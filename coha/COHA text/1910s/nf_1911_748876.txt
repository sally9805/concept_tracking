txt //l he be willing to write to the Gypsy Committee concerning me ? I wish to translate the Gospel of St. John into their language , which I could easily do with the assistance of one or two of the old people , but then they must be paid , for the Gypsies are more mercenary than Jews . I have already written to my dear friend Mr. Cunningham on this subject , and have no doubt that he will promote the plan to the utmost of his ability . I must procure a letter of introduction from him to Joseph Gurney , and should be very happy to obtain one also from Mr. Brandram , for in all which regards the Gospel and the glory of Christ , Joseph Gurney is the principal person to look to in these parts . I will now conclude by beseeching you to send me as soon as possible whatever can serve to enlighten me in respect to Mandchou Grammar , for had I a Grammar , I should in a month 's time be able to send a Mandchou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revd. and dear Sir , your most humble and obedient servant , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# 18th March , 1833 , WILLOW LANE , ST . GILES , NORWICH . DEAR SIR ,  --  As yourself and Mr. Brandram expressed a desire to hear from me occasionally concerning my progress in Mandchou , I now write to inform you that I am advancing at full gallop , and am able to translate with pleasure and facility the specimens of the best authors who have written in the language contained in the compilation of Klaproth . But I must confess that the want of a Grammar has been , particularly in the beginning of my course , a great clog to my speed , and I have little doubt that had I been furnished with one I should have attained my present knowledge of Mandchou in half the time . I was determined however not to be discouraged , and , not having a hatchet at hand to cut down the tree with , to attack it with my knife ; and I would advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to be in his possession , until he can procure better ones , and it is not improbable that by the time the good tools arrive he will find he has not much need of them , having almost accomplished his work . This is not exactly my case , for I shall be very glad to receive this same tripartite Grammar which Mr. Brandram is hunting for , my ideas respecting Mandchou construction being still very vague and wandering , and I should also be happy if you could and would procure for me the original grammatical work of Amyot , printed in the Memoires , etc . Present my kind regards to Mr. Hattersley , and thank him in my name for his kind letter , but at the same time tell him that I was sorry to learn that he was putting himself to the trouble of transferring into Mandchou characters the specimens which Amyot has given in Roman , as there was no necessity for it in respect to myself , a mere transcript being quite sufficient to convey the information I was in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with him in his opinion of Amyot 's Dictionary , which he terms in his letter ' something not very first-rate , ' for the Frenchman 's translations of the Mandchou words are anything but clear and satisfactory , and being far from literal , frequently leave the student in great doubt and perplexity . I have sent to my brother one copy of St. Luke 's Gospel with a letter ; the postage was 15s. 5d . My reason for sending only one was , that the rate of postage increases with the weight , and that the two Gospels can go out much cheaper singly than together . The other I shall dispatch next month . I subjoin a translation from the Mandchou , as I am one of those who do not wish people to believe words but works ; and as I have had no Grammar , and been only seven weeks at a language which Amyot says one may acquire in five or six years , I thought you might believe my account of my progress to be a piece of exaggeration and vain boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not being translated by Klaproth , I have selected as most adapted to the present occasion ; I must premise that I translate as I write , and if there be any inaccuracies , as I daresay there will , some allowance must be made for haste , which prevents my devoting the attention necessary to a perfectly correct rendering of the text . I will conclude by observing that I believe myself at present competent to edit any book in Mandchou , if that be what is wanted , and beg leave to remain , dear Sir , your obedient humble servant , GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To the Rev.

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I have mastered Mandchou , and I should feel obliged by your informing the Committee of the fact , and also my excellent friend Mr. Brandram . I assure you that I have had no easy and pleasant task in acquiring this language . In the first place , it is in every respect different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of the Turkish , to which it seems to bear some remote resemblance in syntax , though none in words . In the second place , it abounds with idiomatic phrases , which can only be learnt by habit , and to the understanding of which a Dictionary is of little or no use , the words separately having either no meaning or a meaning quite distinct from that which they possess when thus conjoined . And thirdly the helps afforded me in this undertaking have been sadly inadequate . However , with the assistance of God , I have performed my engagement . I have translated several pieces from the Mandchou , amongst which is the . . . or Spirit of the Hearth ( Greek text ) , which is a peculiarly difficult composition , and which had never previously been translated into a European language .

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  Owing to the culpable tardiness of the post-office people , I have received your letter so late that I have little more than a quarter of an hour to answer it in , and be in time to despatch it by this day 's mail . What you have written has given me great pleasure , as it holds out hope that I may be employed usefully to the Deity , to man , and myself . I shall be very happy to visit St. Petersburg and to become the coadjutor of Mr. Lipoftsoff , and to avail myself of his acquirements in what you very happily designate a most singular language , towards obtaining a still greater proficiency in it . I flatter myself that I am for one or two reasons tolerably well adapted for the contemplated expedition , for besides a competent knowledge of French and German , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without much difficulty any printed Russian book , and I have little doubt that after a few months ' intercourse with the natives I should be able to speak it fluently . It would ill become me to bargain like a Jew or a Gypsy as to terms ; all I wish to say on that point is , that I have nothing of my own , having been too long dependent on an excellent mother , who is not herself in very easy circumstances .

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I arrived at Hamburg yesterday after a disagreeable passage of three days , in which I suffered much from sea-sickness , as did all the other passengers , who were a medley of Germans , Swedes , and Danes , I being the only Englishman on board , with the exception of the captain and crew . I landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the earliness of the hour , shone so fiercely that it brought upon me a transient fit of delirium , which is scarcely to be wondered at , if my previous state of exhaustion be considered . You will readily conceive that my situation , under all its circumstances , was not a very enviable one ; some people would perhaps call it a frightful one . I did not come however to the slightest harm , for the Lord took care of me through two of His instruments , Messrs . Weil and Valentin , highly respectable Jews of Copenhagen , who had been my fellow-passengers , and with whom I had in some degree ingratiated myself on board , in our intervals of ease , by conversing with them about the Talmud and the book Sohar . They conveyed me to the Konig von Engeland , an excellent hotel in the street called the Neuenwall , and sent for a physician , who caused me to take forty drops of laudanum and my head to be swathed in wet towels , and afterwards caused me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awoke in the evening perfectly recovered and in the best spirits possible . This morning , Sunday , I called on the British Consul , Mr. H. Canning , to whom I had a letter of recommendation . He received me with great civility , and honoured me with an invitation to dine with him to-morrow , which I of course accepted . He is a highly intelligent man , and resembles strikingly in person his illustrious relative , the late George Canning . Since visiting him I have been to one of the five tall churches which tower up above the tall houses ; I thought its interior very venerable and solemn , but the service seemed to be nothing more than a low-muttered chanting , from which it was impossible to derive much spiritual edification . There was no sermon , and not more than twenty persons were present , though the edifice would contain thousands conveniently . Hamburg is a huge place , and the eastern part of it is intersected by wide canals communicating with the Elbe , so that vessels find their way into most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous , and are mostly of wood . Some of the streets are planted with trees , which have a pretty appearance , though upon the whole it has certainly no claim to the appellation of a handsome town . But no observer can fail to be struck with the liveliness and bustle which reign in this emporium of continental Europe , worthy to be compared with Tyre of old or our own Liverpool . Another city adjoins it called Altona , the park of which and the environs are the favourite Sunday lounge of the Hamburgers . Altona is in Holstein , which belongs to the Danish Government . It is separated from the Hanseatic town merely by a small gateway , so that it may truly be said here that there is but one step from a republic to a monarchy . Little can be said in commendation of the moral state of this part of the world , for rope-dancers were displaying their agility in the park to-day , and the dancing-saloons , which I am informed are most infamous places , are open to the public this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to decency , and will not tolerate such a shameless display of vice on so sacred a season , when a decent cheerfulness is the freest form in which the mind or countenance ought to invest themselves . I shall depart for Lubeck on the sixth ( Tuesday ) , and shall probably be on the Baltic on my way to St. Petersburg on the eighth , which is the day notified for the departure the steamboat . My next letter , provided it pleases the Almighty to vouch-safe me a happy arrival , will be from the Russian capital ; and with a fervent request that you will not forget me in your prayers , and that you will present my kind remembrances and best respects to Mr. Brandram , and also remember me to Mr. Hattersley and Mr. Tarn , I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , your most obedient and most humble servant , GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . Sept. 26th , 1833 ) ST . PETERSBURG , No. 221 GALERNOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  My last letter was from Hamburg , which I hope and trust you received . I started from thence on the 24th , and embarking at Travemunde I arrived at the Russian capital on the 31st July ( old style ) after an exceedingly pleasant passage , accomplished in the short space of 72 hours ; for the wind was during the greatest part of our way favourable and gentle , the sea being quite as smooth as a mill pond , so that the paddles of our noble steamer , the Nikolai , were not at all impeded in their working by any rolling or pitching of the vessel . Immediately on my arrival I sought out Mr. Swan , one of the most amiable and interesting characters I have ever met with , and delivered to him your letter , the contents of which were very agreeable to him ; for from applying himself too un-interruptedly to transcribing the manuscript of the Mandchou Old Testament he had in some degree injured his health ; and the arrival of a coadjutor in the task was exceedingly opportune . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to Mr. Schmidt , who resides a few miles out of town . He assured us that he had no doubt of permission being granted for the printing of the Mandchou New Testament , and promised to make all the necessary inquiries , and to inform Mr. Swan and myself of the result . He was at the time we saw him much occupied with his Mongolian Grammar and Dictionary , which are in the press . We have not heard from him since this visit , and I shall probably call upon him again in a week or two to hear what steps he has taken . I resided for nearly a fortnight in a hotel , as the difficulty of procuring lodgings in this place is very great , and when you have procured them , you have to furnish them yourself at a considerable expense . During this time I collated with Mr. Swan the greatest part of what he had transcribed , and eventually I took up my abode with Mr. Egerton Hubbard , a friend of Mr. Venning 's , where I am for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you exerting myself to the utmost to fulfil the views of the Society . I have transcribed from the Mandchou Old Testament the second book of Chronicles , which when I had done , I put aside the Old Testament for a season , and by the advice of Mr. Swan began to copy St. Matthew 's Gospel from the version of the New , executed by the same hand as the Old , with the purpose of comparing it with that of Mr. Lipoftsoff . This task I have just completed , and am now about to commence a transcript of the Acts . Respecting this manuscript translation of the Old and New Testaments I must here observe , that with scarcely one exception it is the most laborious and best executed work of the kind which I have ever seen , and I can not but admire the diligence and learning of him who , probably unasked and unrewarded , engaged in and accomplished it . The style , as far as I can judge , is to an eminent degree elegant and polished , and likely to captivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it exhibits none of that obscurity which too frequently attends refinement of language ; and as for fidelity  --  it is upon the whole executed as literally , and with as much adherence to the original , as the genius of the Tartar language and the understandings of the people , for whose edification it is intended , will permit . But the notes and elucidations ( which I copy not ) which follow every chapter , both of the Old and New Testament , constitute the most surprising feature of this work . They are so full and copious , that they occupy far more space than the text ; indeed , I think I speak quite within bounds when I say that for every page of text there are two of explanatory matter . The author was a French Jesuit , and when did a Jesuit any thing which he undertook , whether laudable or the reverse , not far better than any other person ? Staunch Protestant though I be , I am not ashamed to say that all the skill and talent of our own missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are , when compared with the capabilities displayed by the seminary priests , faint and seemingly insignificant ; and yet it is singular enough that the labours of the latter in this line have had almost invariably no other fate than to be buried in continental public libraries or in the literary collections of the learned and curious ; from which it is manifest that the Lord smiled not upon their undertakings . They thought not of His glory but of the glory of their order , and the consequence has been that ' He has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted the humble and meek . ' A few days since I called upon Mr. Lipoftsoff , and to my surprise discovered that he was totally unaware of any plan being in agitation for the printing of his translation of the Scriptures . He said that he had had no communication with Mr. Schmidt for several months ; and far from being able to furnish me with any information respecting the probable destiny of his work , he asked questions of me concerning it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sixty and seventy , but is nevertheless surprisingly hale and robust . He was very kind , and promised to give me any assistance in his power towards acquiring a thorough knowledge of the Mandchou ; and , permit me to say , that Petersburg is the only place in Europe where such a knowledge can be obtained , for the manuscripts and printed books in that tongue are very plentiful here , and there are moreover several individuals who speak and write it . I of course most gladly accepted such an offer , and shall endeavour to turn it to the best account . Mr. L. speaks no European language but Russ , which I am not sorry for , because frequent conversation and intercourse with him will improve my knowledge of that language . It is a great error to suppose that a person resident in this country can dispense with Russ , provided he is acquainted with French and German . The two latter languages , it is true , are spoken by the French and German shop-keepers settled here . French is moreover spoken ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers in the army ; but neither are so generally understood as in England  --  German far less so ; and as for the Russians being the best general linguists in Europe , I am totally unable to guess how the idea could have originated , but am certain from personal experience that they are quite the contrary . Petersburg is the finest city in the world ; neither London nor Paris nor any other European capital which I have visited has sufficient pretensions to enter into comparison with it in respect to beauty and grandeur . Many of the streets are miles in length , as straight as an arrow and adorned with the most superb edifices . The so-called Nevsky Prospect , a street which runs from the Admiralty to the Monastery of St. Alexander Nevsky , is nearly three miles in length and for the greatest part of the way floored with small blocks of wood shaped octagonally . The broad and rapid Neva runs through the centre of this Queen of cities , and on either side is a noble quay , from which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing on its bosom . But I will not be diffuse in the description of objects which have been so often described , but devote the following lines which my paper will contain to more important matters . The lower orders of the Russians are very willing to receive Scriptural information , and very willing to purchase it if offered to them at a price which comes within their means . I will give an interesting example of this . A young man of the name of Nobbs , in the employ of Mr. Leake , an English farmer residing a few versts from Petersburg , is in the habit on his return from the latter place , whither he is frequently sent by his master , to carry with him a satchel filled with Russian New Testaments and religious tracts , with which he is supplied by an excellent English lady who dwells there . He says that before he has reached home , he has invariably disposed of his whole cargo to the surrounding peasantry ; and such is the hunger and thirst which they display for the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer all the demands made , after it was known what merchandise he brought with him . There remain at present three hundred copies unsold of the modern Russian New Testament at the shop which has the disposal of the works of the late Russian Bible Society ; these copies , all of which are damaged from having been immersed during the inundation of 1824 , might all be disposed of in one day , provided proper individuals were employed to hawk them about in the environs of this capital . There are twenty thousand copies on hand of the Sclavonian Bible , which being in a language and character differing materially from the modern Russ character and language , and only understood by the learned , is unfit for general circulation , and the copies will probably remain unsold , though the Synod is more favourable to the distribution of the Scriptures in the ancient than in the modern form . I was informed by the attendant in the shop that the Synod had resolved upon not permitting the printing of any fresh edition of the Scriptures in the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been disposed of . But it is possible that this assertion is incorrect . I must now conclude ; and with an earnest request that you will write to me speedily , and deliver my kindest remembrances to Mr. Brandram and to my other good friends at the Society House , I remain , Revd. and dear Sir , your most obedient servant , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ST . PETERSBURG , August 27 , 1833 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  The bearer of this letter is Mr. Glen , the son of the celebrated missionary of Astracan . He is desirous of forming your acquaintance , and I take the liberty of making him known to you . He is a young man of considerable learning , and a devout Christian . His object in visiting England is to qualify himself for the missionary calling , in the hope that at some future period he may tread in the steps of his father and proclaim a crucified Saviour to the Oriental heathens . I am at present , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am every day busily engaged in transcribing the Mandchou Old Testament and collating with Mr. Swan . In the hope that these lines will find you in good health , I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , your most obedient servant , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . Feb. 17th , 1834 ) ST . PETERSBURG , 20th January ( old style ) , 1834 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I received in due time your epistle of the 2nd January , which gave me considerable pleasure , as it is exceedingly cheering in a foreign land to hear from one 's friends and to know that one is not forgotten by them . I now proceed to give an account of my stewardship up to the present time , which account I humbly trust will afford perfect satisfaction to the Society which has honoured a frail creature like myself with a charge , the importance and difficulty of which I at present see much more clearly than I originally did . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was far from being forgetful of the ulterior object of my mission , and therefore , as in duty bound , applied to Dr. Schmidt for advice and information , who was the person upon whom I mainly depended . But I found that gentleman so involved in a multiplicity of business that it was utterly impossible for him to afford me either ; and though he was kind enough to promise to make inquiry , etc. etc. , it is very probable that he forgot to fulfil his promise , for the result never came to my ears . Thus circumstanced , and being very uneasy in my mind , I determined to take a bold step , and directly and without further feeling my way to petition the Government in my own name for permission to print the Mandchou Scriptures . Having communicated this determination to our beloved , sincere , and most truly Christian friend Mr. Swan ( who has lately departed to his station in Siberia , shielded I trust by the arm of his Master ) , it met with his perfect approbation and cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented it with my own hand to his Excellence Mr. Bludoff , Minister of the Interior . He having perused it , briefly answered , that he believed the matter did not lie with him , but that he would consider . I now began greatly to fear that the affair would not come to a favourable issue , but nevertheless prayed fervently to God , and confiding principally in Him , resolved to leave no human means untried which were within my reach . Since residing here I have assiduously cultivated the friendship of the Honourable Mr. Bligh , His Britannic Majesty 's plenipotentiary at the Court of Russia , who has shown me many condescending marks of kindness , and who is a person of superb talents , kind disposition , and of much piety . I therefore , on the evening of the day of my presenting the petition , called upon him , and being informed that he was out of town , and was not expected till late at night , I left a letter for him , in which I entreated him to make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him with the Minister , towards procuring a favourable reply ; assuring him that the Mandchou version was not intended for circulation nor calculated for circulation in any part of the Russian Empire , but in China and Chinese Tartary solely . I stated that I would call for an answer the next morning . I did so , and upon seeing Mr. Bligh , he was kind enough to say that if I desired it he would apply officially to the Minister , and exert all his influence in his official character in order to obtain the accomplishment of my views ; but at the same time suggested that it would , perhaps , be as well at a private interview to beg it as a personal favour ; and to this I instantly assented . He spoke twice to Mr. Bludoff upon the subject ; and I shortly afterwards received a summons to appear at the Asiatic Department , whither I went , and found that Mr. Bludoff had been enquiring whether any person was to be found capable of being employed as Censor over the work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is one of the clerks of the Asiatic Department , should be appointed Censor , and that I should be the Editor of the work , provided permission were granted to print it . I went away , and having received no intelligence during the space of a fortnight , I waited upon Mr. Bligh and begged that , provided it were not disagreeable to him , he would make a fresh application to the Minister . And , singularly enough , Mr. Bludoff was to dine at Mr. Bligh 's that evening , and the latter amiable gentleman assured me that he would not let so excellent an opportunity slip of saying what was calculated to bring the matter to a conclusion . That same night I received a message , whereby I was requested to wait on Mr. Bludoff the next day , at one . I did so , and he received me in the most polite manner and said that the matter did not entirely depend upon him , but that it would be necessary to obtain the permission also of the Director of Worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dignitary , which he doubted not would have some effect . I received the letter , and without losing any time repaired to the Director 's Office and having delivered my letter , after waiting some time , was told to call at the Asiatic Department on the first day of the next week ( the very day your letter arrived ) . On calling there I found that permission had been granted to print the Mandchou Scripture . I hope that the honourable Committee and yourself will feel no displeasure at my presuming here to make a slight suggestion . We are under great obligations to Mr. Bligh ; and I have certainly taken great liberties with the friendship with which he has thought proper to favour me , liberties which I should certainly not have felt myself authorised to have taken in any affair , the end of which was not the glorifying of God , as the aim of this certainly is . I therefore should wish to hint the expediency of a letter in which the thanks of the Committee be presented to Mr. Bligh for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , and for the trouble he has given himself . You are well aware that a handsome acknowledgement of a kindness received is never taken amiss ; and as it is not impossible that Mr. Bligh , at another time and even at another place , may have an opportunity of promoting the excellent views of the Society , I can not help thinking that such an acknowledgement would be unwise neither in respect to what has occurred or may occur hereafter . In reply to your inquiries respecting my progress in the Mandchou language , I have to observe that for some time past I have taken lessons from a person who was twelve years in Pekin , and who speaks Mandchou and Chinese with fluency . I pay him about six shillings English for each lesson , which I grudge not , for the perfect acquirement of Mandchou is one of my most ardent wishes ; as I am convinced that it is destined by providence to be the medium for the spiritual illumination of countless millions of Chinese and Tartars . At present I can transcribe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the English . I can translate from it with tolerable facility , and have translated into it , for an exercise , the second homily of the Church of England " On the Misery of Man . " I have likewise occasionally composed a few hymns in this language , the difficulty of which I am at present more fully aware of than when I left England . It is one of those deceitful tongues , the seeming simplicity of whose structure induces you to suppose , after applying to them for a month or two , that little more remains to be learned , but which , should you continue to study a year , as I have studied this , show themselves to you in their veritable colours , amazing you with their copiousness , puzzling with their idioms . In a word Mandchou is equally as difficult as Sanscrit or Persian , neither of which languages has ever been thoroughly acquired by any European , though at first acquaintance they flatter the student with their deceitful simplicity . I take the liberty of sending you a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other purpose will afford you some idea of my running Mandchou hand , which , as I now write perpendicularly , is very different from that hand which I wrote previously to my coming hither . The epigram is upon the exploits of the Tartars . Here follow four upright lines in Manchu characters . Milites qui e Manjurico deserto exierunt , bellando silvas , campos et oppida Sinensis imperii captarunt . Want of room obliges me to defer making a report upon Mr. Lipoftsoff 's translation until my next letter , which will follow in a week or two ; for I am unwilling in a matter of such immense importance to deliver a brief and hurried opinion . I have much to communicate also respecting the proper means to be pursued for the introduction and circulation of the volume , when printed , in China and Tartary . This information I have derived from the most authentic sources , namely from individuals who have spent many years in these countries , and whose acquaintance I have eagerly sought . From England I have lately received a letter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico , amounting to this  --  that there is no native language in that country entitled to the appellation of the Mexican language ; that it is as incorrect to make use of such an expression , as it would be to say definitely the European language ; that setting aside the Spanish there are upwards of twenty languages and dialects spoken in Mexico , none of which are read ( except perhaps here and there by a few individuals ) but communicated by the mouth and only acquired by the ear ; that my brother has shown the sheet of St. Luke 's Gospel , which I transmitted to him , to various Spaniards and Indians , but it was unintelligible to them , the latter not recognising the words when read to them . I should therefore advise that the copies of this version be sent , if possible , to the place where the version was purchased , as it was probably made in the language or dialect of that place or neighbourhood , and where there is a chance of its being of some utility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , I have no doubt that he will be exceedingly happy to assist in flinging the rays of Scriptural light over that most benighted and miserable region ; but having lately read in the Russian newspapers that the town of Guanajuato , where he resided , has been taken and sacked by the murderous bands of the insurgents , I have great reason to fear that his earthly course is terminated , for the former , incited by their demoniacal priests , in comparison with whom the Shamans of Manjuria and the lamas of Mongolia and China are innocent and holy , lay hold of every opportunity of shedding the blood of Protestants and foreigners . I remain , Revd. and dear Sir , most truly yours , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . March 10th , 1834 , with Report on the Mandchou New Testament . ) ST . PETERSBURG , GALERNOY ULITZA , 4 February ( old style ) 1834 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  In compliance with the request of the Committee , expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a report upon Mr. Lipoftsoff 's translation ; and as there were many things which I wished to mention in my last letter , but was unable from want of room , I take this opportunity of stating them , with the hope that they will meet with your approbation . In the first place , whatever communication you wish to make to Mr. Lipoftsoff I think you had best charge me with to him , for in that case you will be certain that he will receive it , without loss of time . But I must inform you that he is rather a singular man , and to all appearances perfectly indifferent to the fate of his excellent translation , caring nothing whether it be published as a powerful instrument to open the closed eyes and soften the hard hearts of the idolators of China and Tartary , or whether it be committed to the flames , and for ever lost to the world . You can not conceive the cold , heartless apathy in respect to the affair , on which I have been despatched hither as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom I looked , not unreasonably , for encouragement and advice . But thanks be to the Lord , the great object has been accomplished , permission has been obtained to print the New Testament , and have no doubt that permission for the whole Bible is within our reach . And in regard to what we have yet to do , let it be borne in mind , that we are by no means dependent upon Mr. Lipoftsoff ; though certainly to secure the services which he is capable of performing would be highly desirable , and though he can not act outwardly in the character of Editor , he having been appointed Censor , he may privately be of great utility to us . Therefore let the attempt to engage his services be made without delay . At the Sarepta House is a chest containing Mandchou characters , belonging to the Bible Society , which I shall cause to be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have sustained any injury from rust during the long time they have been lying neglected ; if any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in possession of a small fount of Mandchou types for the convenience of printing trifles in that tongue , has kindly promised to assist us with the use of as many of his own as may be necessary . There is one printing office here , where they are in the habit of printing with the Mongolian character , which differs but little from the Mandchou ; consequently the Mongolian compositors will be competent to the task of composing in Mandchou . There are no Mandchou types in St. Petersburg , with the exception of our own and Baron Schilling 's . I suppose that it will be thought requisite to print the town for a year or so , it is my humble opinion , and the opinion of much wiser people , that if he were active , zealous and likewise courageous , the blessings resulting from his labours would be incalculable . It would be by no means a difficult thing to make excursions into Tartary and to form friendships amongst the Tartar hordes , and I am far from certain that with a little management and dexterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to return in safety , after having examined the state of the land . I can only say that if it were my fortune to have the opportunity , I would make the attempt , and should consider myself only to blame if I did not succeed . In my last letter I informed you that I had procured myself an instructor in Mandchou , and that I was making tolerable progress in the language . I should now wish to ask whether this person could not be turned to some further account ; for example , to assist me in making a translation into Mandchou of the Psalms and Isaiah , which have not yet been rendered . A few shillings a week , besides what I give him for my own benefit , would secure his co-operation , for he is a person in very low circumstances . He is not competent to undertake any thing of the kind by himself , being in many respects very simple and ignorant ; but as an assistant I think he might be of considerable utility , and that between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be particularly elegant , would be clear , grammatical and faithful to the original . In the mean time I shall pursue my studies , and be getting every thing in readiness for setting the printers at work ; and with a humble request for speedy instructions , in order that as little time as possible may be lost in the work of the Lord , I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , Your most obedient and humble servant , GEORGE BORROW . P.S.  --  My kindest regards to Mr. Brandram and my other dear friends at the Bible House . I thank you heartily for your kind advice in the latter part of your last epistle . Do me the favour to inform Dr. Richardson that I have followed his instructions in regard to clothing , etc. , and have derived great benefit therefrom . @# @# To the Rev.

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I intended , I take the liberty of troubling you with these lines . But first of all I must apologise for certain slips of the pen in the Report which I transmitted ; for it left me without having been corrected , Baron Schilling having called upon me just as I sat down to the task , and when he had departed , I had barely time to seal it and despatch it by that week 's post . There was in it , I believe , nothing of much importance which required alteration , but , if I mistake not , I had written , in the third side , vibebam , instead of viverem , and unaparelled , or some such word , instead of unparalleled , in the fourth . Now to the point . What is to be done with the transcript of Puerot 's translation of the Acts of the Apostles , which I made , and which is now in my possession ? The translation is in every respect an admirable one ; clear , faithful , and elegant . It would not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that part of the New Testament ; because the styles of the two individuals are so different , that to mix up the writings of the one with those of the other would only serve to disfigure the work , and Mr. Lipoftsoff 's translation is well worthy of being printed separately and entire ; but I conceive that we possess a treasure in Puerot 's writings , and that it would be a great pity to hide any portion of them from the world . Pray communicate this hint to the Committee , and pardon me for troubling you . I remain , Rev. and dear Sir , most sincerely yours , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd , May 16th , 1834 ) GALERNOY ULITZA , ST . PETERSBURG , 15th April ( old style ) 1834 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  Upon the receipt of your letter of the 21st ult. date omitted , I lost no time in endeavouring to obtain the necessary information upon the points to which you directed my attention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate will not be altogether unsatisfactory ; but I must first of all state that it was not acquired in a day , and that I have been obliged to go to many people and many places , which will account for my not having sooner returned an answer . First , respecting the most important point , the expense of printing the New Testament in Mandchou . I was quite terrified at the enormous sums which some of the printers to whom I made application required for the work . At length our friend Dr. Schmidt recommended me to the University Press , and I having spoken to the directors of the establishment , they sent me in the course of a week an estimate which neither Dr. Schmidt nor myself considered to be unreasonable , and of this estimate I here subjoin a translation : To Mr. Borrow . ' After much consultation with the compositor , I have come to the following result concerning the Mandchou business about which you consulted me . If the work be printed on as thin paper as that of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now supposing that the size is to be folio like that of the original , two sides will make a sheet , and the price of composition will be 26 roubles , 20 copecks  --  that is to say ; 12R. to the compositor , wages 2R. 50c. , percentage to the printing office 11R. 60c. , making 26R. 20c . The printing of 1000 on one side 2R. 50c. , percentage 2R. , making 4R. 50c . Thus for composition and printing 30R. 60c. for 1000 ; for 2000 , 35R. 10c. ; for 3000 , 39R. 60c.  --  Your very obedient servant , KORLER . ' In the meantime I had become acquainted with two German printers , Schultz and Beneze , who being young men and just entered into business are very eager to obtain the printing of a work of such importance , which they hope will serve to bring them into notice , as well as being advantageous to them in a pecuniary view . The difference , as to the expense of printing , in the estimate made by these gentlemen and that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did me . Here it follows : ' In respect to the printing of the New Testament in the Manchou language , the undersigned oblige themselves to undertake the printing of the said work . In the first place , as the Bible Society , and in particular their agent Mr. Borrow , think fit to furnish the printers with the necessary types and paper , the undersigned offer to supply the sheet consisting of four pages with composition , clean and black printing , at the rate of 25 roubles , paper currency , for a thousand copies ; for two thousand copies , five additional roubles assignats , so that the same sheet , only by a greater edition , amounts to 30 roubles assignats ; thirdly , for 3000 copies in the above proportion , 35 roubles . Fourthly , we promise during the interval of a certain period to supply at the rate of three sheets per week . SCHULTZ &; BENEZE . ' You will perceive that the amount of this estimate is less , by more than one-half , than the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four sides , and they charge less for it than the printers of the University charge for theirs which consists only of two . I should therefore think that upon this ground they are entitled to the preference , were there nothing else to recommend them , which , in my humble opinion , there is ; for being young beginners , and not having very much to do , they are more likely to push the work forward , than a firm overwhelmed with business , from whom , whatever might be promised , a sheet per week is the utmost to be expected , by which much valuable time must be lost . Dr. Schmidt is acquainted with Messrs . S. &; B. , and highly approves of their being employed . Secondly , concerning paper , with which the printer has no concern . I can as yet say little for certain upon this matter , which has been the occasion of no little trouble and expense ; for I have been obliged to take no less than three journeys to Peterhof , a town about 30 versts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such paper as we want in the Russian capital . In this manufactory they have about 50 stopes or reams ( we should require ten times that quantity for only 1000 copies ) of the very paper , I believe , on which the Mandchou Gospel of St. Matthew was printed , and some of the workmen said that they could make as much more as should be required . Concerning the price of this paper , I could obtain no positive information , for the director and first and second clerks were invariably absent , and the place abandoned to ignorant understrappers ( according to the custom of Russia ) . And notwithstanding I found out the director in Petersburg , he himself could not tell me the price , but informed me that he would inquire , and speedily send me word ; but as I have as yet heard nothing from him , I write lest it should be supposed in England that I am sleeping on my station . I shall write again in a few days on this point ; in the mean time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinkerton 's expenses to be referred to , for the purpose of ascertaining how much he paid per ream for this kind of paper . I believe it to be extravagantly dear , at least five times dearer than good common paper , which can be procured for fifteen roubles per ream ; and if that be the case , common paper must be used and the book printed in the common fashion , unless the Society be prepared to disburse thousands instead of hundreds ; for if the work were printed on this Chinese paper , four times more paper would be required than if it were printed on the other , as five multiplied by four make twenty , the expense of paper would be twenty times greater . Thirdly , respecting Mr. Lipoftsoff , with whom I have of late had much conversation . He has behaved very handsomely . He has made an immense number of alterations in his translation , all of which are excellent improvements , and all these are to be at our disposal gratis . He says that he can not receive any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so as Censor . I shall therefore edit it , and have the supervision of the proof sheets , which he will peruse last of all . He having examined me in Mandchou did me the honour to say I required no assistance at all ; but should the Committee and yourself be of opinion that it would be advisable to procure a little , the ' pundit ' would be very happy for an extra six or seven shillings per week to collate with me when wanted . I have derived great benefit from this man , who though in many respects a most singular and uncouth being speaks Mandchou gallantly , with the real pronunciation of Pekin , which differs considerably from that of Pekhan ( the desert ) , being far more soft and melodious . During the interval which will elapse between my writing to you and hearing from you , I shall borrow from Baron Schilling the Mandchou Old Testament and reperuse the notes in order to be able to give a suitable opinion as to their value . My present opinion of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transcript of the Old Testament , I beg leave to inform you that it is in the hands of a Mr. Merrilies , an English merchant , to whom Mr. Swan entrusted it . I believe he starts for England by the first steam-boat . I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , sincerely yours , GEORGE BORROW . P.S.  --  Since my last letter I have been laid up for some time with a nervous fever , but thank God I am quite recovered . My best respects to Mr. Brandram . Pray excuse the haste in which this letter is written , it will be barely in time for the post . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . May 26th , 1834 ) ST . PETERSBURG , April 28 ( old style ) 1834 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  Being at length able to communicate some positive information respecting the price of the paper , which we are in need of , I lose no time in doing so . The day after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , I was favoured with a communication from the director of the Peterhof Fabrik or Manufactory , a gentleman who amongst other titles bears that of Councillor of State . He was kind enough to say that I should have the 50 reams of paper which remained , and which I before alluded to , at 75 roubles per ream ; but that if any more were necessary , one hundred roubles per ream would be required , and not any reduction would be made . You may easily guess that I was somewhat startled at this piece of information , for upon making a calculation I found that one ream of paper would be little more than sufficient for two copies of the entire Mandchou New Testament . There are 480 sheets in a Russian ream , and I suppose that our book will consist of seven parts , each containing about the same number of sheets as the printed Mandchou Gospel of St. Matthew . Now that Gospel contains 31 sheets , and 31 multiplied by 7 amounts to 211 sic , which multiplied by 2 makes 422 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper necessary for 1000 copies only would amount to about 450 reams , the price of which , after allowance had been made for the 50 reams at 75 roubles , would exceed 40,000 roubles . The next day I hired a calash , and spent the best part of a week in causing myself to be driven to all the places in the vicinity of Petersburg where paper is made . Knowing but too well that it is the general opinion of the people of this country that Englishmen are made of gold , and that it is only necessary to ask the most extravagant price for any article in order to obtain it , I told no person , to whom I applied , who I was , or of what country ; and I believe I was supposed to be a German . In some places I had now the pleasure of hearing that I could have the paper at 60 roubles per ream . At last I came to a person whom , after having informed him that I was in need of a very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat down from 50 to 40 roubles , from 40 to 35 , and it is probable that I may be able to obtain a large quantity at 30 . I must inform you that I also employed two agents , and we three going various ways have ascertained that the necessary paper may be procured for between 30 and 40 roubles per ream , paper of as good a quality  --  nay , better than that on which the Gospel of St. Matthew was printed , and that for which 100 roubles were demanded at Peterhof . It is therefore now time for the Committee to come to a decision respecting the number of copies to be printed , and I wish it to be borne in mind that the price of the paper per ream in some degree depends upon the quantity required . I do not think it possible to obtain any where paper of a similar quality at a less price than 30 or 35 roubles ; for the specimens which I have obtained are very beautiful , and a work printed on such paper need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartars and Chinese . To print the Testament on common paper would certainly not be advisable , as in that case the probability is that notwithstanding the reverence of those singular people for written or printed characters , the sacred volume , if put into their hands , would be destroyed . I am in conformity with your expressed desire getting every thing into readiness for commencing printing , and therefore earnestly beg for a speedy communication , informing me how much paper I am to bespeak , and in what manner I am to pay for it . I must here observe that in all dealings within Russia the purchaser must have his money ready in his hand ; consequently , if I am authorised to purchase any quantity of paper , I must have a letter of credit upon some firm here resident , that I may be able to pay for the article immediately upon its delivery . I remain , Revd. and dear Sir , most truly yours , GEORGE BORROW . P.S.  --  With respect to the paper , if purchased ; would you have me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , or should a small apartment be hired in which to keep part of it until wanted ?

I have , according to your suggestion when we parted , deducted the salary of the days passed in journeying from the money which I received from you , Messrs . Simondsen having received advice to pay me from the day of my arrival at St. Petersburg , whereas by the words of my agreement ( see books ) the salary commences from the time of embarcation . I believe , previous to my departure , that I accounted to you for the sums advanced for passports . I have had the good fortune , as I suppose you are aware , to procure for 25 roubles per ream the paper for which I was originally asked 60 , and of which previously the very lowest price has ever been 35 . This paper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 ( and which was not dear at 40 ) , being far stronger and more glossy . You will particularly oblige me by taking care that Messrs .

If I were unable to pay for the paper at the stated time I should probably be arrested , and , what would be far more lamentable , the contract with the merchants would be broken ; and upon a fresh contract I could not obtain the paper in question for less than 60 roubles per ream , for the winter has already come upon us , during which most of the paper manufactories are at a stand-still , and an order for paper would be consequently given under every possible disadvantage .

I intended to have reserved my account for Christmas , by which season I hope , with the blessing of God , to have brought out the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear Sir , ever yours , GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . Nov. 10th , 1834 ) ST . PETERSBURG , Oct. 8 old style , 1834 . I have just received your most kind epistle , the perusal of which has given me both pain and pleasure  --  pain that from unavoidable circumstances I have been unable to gratify eager expectation , and pleasure that any individual should have been considerate enough to foresee my situation and to make allowance for it . The nature of my occupations during the last two months and a half has been such as would have entirely unfitted me for correspondence , had I been aware that it was necessary , which , on my sacred word , I was not . Now , and only now , when by the blessing of God I have surmounted all my troubles and difficulties , I will tell , and were I not a Christian I should be proud to tell , what I have been engaged upon and accomplished during the last ten weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common compositor , between ten and thirteen hours every day during that period ; the result of this is that St. Matthew 's Gospel , printed from such a copy as I believe nothing was ever printed from before , has been brought out in the Mandchou language ; two rude Esthonian peasants , who previously could barely compose with decency in a plain language which they spoke and were accustomed to , have received such instruction that with ease they can each compose at the rate of a sheet a day in the Mandchou , perhaps the most difficult language for composition in the whole world ; considerable progress has also been made in St. Mark 's Gospel , and I will venture to promise , provided always the Almighty smiles upon the undertaking , that the entire work of which I have the superintendence will be published within eight months from the present time . Now , therefore , with the premise that I most unwillingly speak of myself and what I have done and suffered for some time past , all of which I wished to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular and circumstantial account of my proceedings from the day when I received your letter , by which I was authorised by the Committee to bespeak paper , engage with a printer , and cause our type to be set in order . My first care was to endeavour to make suitable arrangements for the obtaining of Chinese paper . Now those who reside in England , the most civilised and blessed of countries , where everything is to be obtained at a fair price , have not the slightest idea of the anxiety and difficulty which , in a country like this , harass the foreigner who has to disburse money not his own , if he wish that his employers be not shamefully and outrageously imposed upon . In my last epistle to you I stated that I had been asked 100 roubles per ream for such paper as we wanted . I likewise informed you that I believed that it was possible to procure it for 35 roubles , notwithstanding our Society had formerly paid 40 roubles for worse paper than the samples I was in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the expending of money collected for sacred purposes , it behoves the agent to be extraordinarily circumspect and sparing . I therefore was determined , whatever trouble it might cost me , to procure for the Society unexceptionable paper at a yet more reasonable rate than 35 roubles . I was aware , that an acquaintance of mine , a young Dane , was particularly intimate with one of the first printers of this city , who is accustomed to purchase vast quantities of paper every month for his various publications . I gave this young gentleman a specimen of the paper I required , and desired him ( he was under obligations to me ) to enquire of his friend , as if from curiosity , the least possible sum per ream at which the printer himself ( who from his immense demand for paper should necessarily obtain it cheaper than any one else ) could expect to purchase the article in question . The answer I received within a day or two was 25 roubles . Upon hearing this I prevailed upon my acquaintance to endeavour to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to allow me , notwithstanding I was a perfect stranger , to have it at that price . All this was brought about . I was introduced to the printer , Mr. Pluchard , by the Dane , Mr. Hasfeldt , and between the former gentleman and myself a contract was made to the effect that by the end of October he should supply me with 450 reams of Chinese paper at 25 roubles per ream , the first delivery to be made on the 1st of August ; for as my order was given at an advanced period of the year , when all the paper manufactories were at full work towards the executing of orders already received , it was but natural that I should verify the old apophthegm , ' Last come , last served . ' As no orders are attended to in Russia unless money be advanced upon them , I deposited in the hands of Mr. Pluchard the sum of 2000 roubles , receiving his receipt for that amount . Having arranged this most important matter to my satisfaction , I turned my attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messrs . Schultz and Beneze to compose and print the Mandchou Testament at the rate of 25 roubles per sheet , and caused our fount of type to be conveyed to their office . I wish to say here a few words respecting the state in which these types came into my possession . I found them in a kind of warehouse , or rather cellar . They had been originally confined in two cases ; but these having burst , the type lay on the floor trampled amidst mud and filth . They were , moreover , not improved by having been immersed within the waters of the inundation of ' 27 1824 . I caused them all to be collected and sent to their destination , where they were purified and arranged  --  a work of no small time and difficulty , at which I was obliged to assist . Not finding with the type what is called ' Durchschuss ' by the printers here , consisting of leaden wedges of about six ounces weight each , which form the spaces between the lines , I ordered 120 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely enough for three sheets . I had now to teach the compositors the Mandchou alphabet , and to distinguish one character from another . This occupied a few days , at the end of which I gave them the commencement of St. Matthew 's Gospel to copy . They no sooner saw the work they were called upon to perform than there were loud murmurs of dissatisfaction , and . . . four Russian words which means ' It is quite impossible to do the like , ' was the cry  --  and no wonder . The original printed Gospel had been so interlined and scribbled upon by the author in a hand so obscure and irregular , that , accustomed as I was to the perusal of the written Mandchou , it was not without the greatest difficulty that I could decipher the new matter myself . Moreover , the corrections had been so carelessly made that they themselves required far more correction than the original matter . I was therefore obliged to be continually in the printing-office , and to do three parts of the work myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character with my own fingers , and to deliver it to the compositor , and by so doing I learnt myself to compose . We continued in this way till all our characters were exhausted , for no paper had arrived . For two weeks and more we were obliged to pause , the want of paper being insurmountable . At the end of this period came six reams ; but partly from the manufacturers not being accustomed to make this species of paper , and partly from the excessive heat of the weather which caused it to dry too fast , only one ream and a half could be used , and this was not enough for one sheet ; the rest I refused to take , and sent back . The next week came fifteen reams . This paper , from the same causes , was as bad as the last . I selected four reams , and sent the rest back . But this paper enabled us to make a beginning , which we did not fail to do , though we received no more for upwards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of that time , owing to my pressing remonstrances and entreaties , a regular supply of about twelve reams per week of most excellent paper commenced . This continued until we had composed the last five sheets of St. Matthew , when some paper arrived which in my absence was received by Mr. Beneze , who , without examining it , as was his duty , delivered it to the printers to use in the printing of the said sheets , who accordingly printed upon part of it . But the next day , when my occupation permitted me to see what they were about , I observed that the last paper was of a quality very different from that which had been previously sent . I accordingly instantly stopped the press , and , notwithstanding eight reams had been printed upon , I sent all the strange paper back , and caused Mr. Beneze to recompose three sheets , which had been broken up , at his own expense . But this caused the delay of another week . This last circumstance made me determine not to depend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated to Mr. Pluchard that , as his people were unable to furnish me with the article fast enough , I should apply to others for 250 reams , and begged him to supply me with the rest as fast as possible . He made no objection . Thereupon I prevailed upon my most excellent friend , Baron Schilling , to speak to his acquaintance , State-Councillor Alquin , who is possessed of a paper manufactory , on the subject . M. Alquin , as a personal favour to Baron Schilling ( whom , I confess , I was ashamed to trouble upon such an affair , and should never have done so had not zeal for the cause induced me ) , consented to furnish me with the required paper on the same terms as Mr. P. At present there is not the slightest risk of the progress of our work being retarded  --  at present , indeed , the path is quite easy ; but the trouble , anxiety , and misery which have till lately harassed me , alone in a situation of great responsibility , have almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me the favour to ask our excellent Committee , Would it have answered any useful purpose if , instead of continuing to struggle with difficulties and using my utmost to overcome them , I had written in the following strain  --  and what else could I have written if I had written at all ?  --  ' I was sent out to St. Petersburg to assist Mr. Lipoftsoff in the editing of the Mandchou Testament . That gentleman , who holds three important situations under the Russian Government , and who is far advanced in years , has neither time , inclination , or eyesight for the task , and I am apprehensive that my strength and powers unassisted are incompetent to it ' ( praised be the Lord , they were not ! ) , ' therefore I should be glad to return home . Moreover the compositors say that they are unaccustomed to compose in an unknown tongue from such scribbled and illegible copy , and they will scarcely assist me to compose . Moreover the working printers say ( several went away in disgust ) that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wetted , and that to print on dry requires a two-fold exertion of strength , and that they will not do such work for double wages , for it ruptures them . ' Would that have been a welcome communication to the Committee ? Would that have been a communication suited to the public ? I was resolved ' to do or die , ' and , instead of distressing and perplexing the Committee with complaints , to write nothing until I could write something perfectly satisfactory , as I now can ; and to bring about that result I have spared neither myself nor my own money . I have toiled in a close printing-office the whole day , during 90 degrees of heat , for the purpose of setting an example , and have bribed people to work whom nothing but bribes would induce so to do . I am obliged to say all this in self-justification . No member of the Bible Society would ever have heard a syllable respecting what I have undergone but for the question , ' What has Mr. Borrow been about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered to the satisfaction of those who do Mr. Borrow the honour to employ him . In respect to the expense attending the editing of such a work as the New Testament in Mandchou , I beg leave to observe that I have obtained the paper , the principal source of expense , at fifteen roubles per ream less than the Society paid formerly for it  --  that is to say , at nearly half the price . As St. Matthew 's Gospel has been ready for some weeks , it is high time that it should be bound ; for if that process be delayed , the paper with be dirtied and the work injured . I am sorry to inform you that book-binding in Russia is incredibly dear , and that the expenses attending the binding of the Testament would amount , were the usual course pursued , to two-thirds of the entire expenses of the work . Various book-binders to whom I have applied have demanded one rouble and a half for the binding of every section of the work , so that the sum required for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Schmidt assured me that one rouble and forty copecks , or , according to the English currency , fourteenpence halfpenny , were formerly paid for the binding of every individual copy of St. Matthew 's Gospel . I pray you , my dear Sir , to cause the books to be referred to , for I wish to know if that statement be correct . In the meantime arrangements have been made , and the Society will have to pay for each volume of the Testament the comparatively small sum of forty-five copecks , or fourpence halfpenny , whereas the usual price here for the most paltry covering of the most paltry pamphlet is fivepence . Should it be demanded how I have been able to effect this , my reply is that I have had little hand in the matter . A nobleman , who honours me with particular friendship , and who is one of the most illustrious ornaments of Russia and of Europe , has , at my request , prevailed on his own book-binder , over whom he has much influence , to do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commend me to our most respected Committee . Assure them that in whatever I have done or left undone , I have been influenced by a desire to promote the glory of the Trinity and to give my employers ultimate and permanent satisfaction . If I have erred , it has been from a defect of judgment , and I ask pardon of God and them . In the course of a week I shall write again , and give a further account of my proceedings , for I have not communicated one-tenth of what I have to impart ; but I can write no more now . It is two hours past midnight . The post goes away to-morrow , and against that morrow I have to examine and correct three sheets of St. Mark 's Gospel , which lie beneath the paper on which I am writing . With my best regards to Mr. Brandram , I remain , dear Sir , most truly yours , G. BORROW . P.S.  --  I wrote to Mr. Jackson and Mr. Tarn last week . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ST . PETERSBURG , Oct. 13th ( old style ) 1834 . REVEREND AND DEAR SIR ,  --  In pursuance of the promise given in my epistle of last week , which I trust in the Lord you have received , I again address you . In the first place I must intreat you to peruse and to read to the Committee the enclosed Latin certificate penned by Mr. Lipoftsoff , a gentleman as little inclined to be prodigal of praise , as was of old the learned Scaliger himself , to whom in many points indeed , he bears no faint resemblance . In the second place , I must inform you that a few hurried lines are all that I can afford to write at present ; my proof sheets are rushing in so fast that time is exceedingly precious to me , and I grudge every moment that is not devoted to my Maker or to my great undertaking . Before this letter reaches you St. Mark 's Gospel will have passed through the press . The two remaining Gospels will be printed before the arrival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament , in the Mandchou language , will have been published . I wish this intelligence to be communicated to the public , who are at liberty , provided the Lord does not visit me with some heavy affliction , to hold me culpable , if my assertion is belied by the event . It is true that were I to pursue the common practice of editors , it would be impossible to complete the work in less than two years ; the quantity of proofs , successively required for every sheet , fail not , in general , to retard the progress of all such undertakings . My beloved friend Mr. Swan published in this city a small tract in Mongolian ; he found that it was absolutely necessary to demand six proofs of every sheet , for in the second , nay the third proof , there were frequently as many errors as in the first , from the compositors not being able properly to read the corrections . But I never entrust the task of making alterations in the press to other hands than my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the printing office and rectify all errors myself . I consequently never require more than two proofs ; the second , which I generally show to Mr. Lipoftsoff , is frequently faultless . I am so perfectly convinced of the excellence of this plan , that it is my firm intention to pursue it in whatever foreign , or even English works , it may be my destiny to edit . I wish now to say a few words upon a subject , on which I have previously said something . At the present moment my principal inducement to such a step is the observation every now and then made to me , both by Christians and no Christians , namely : ' You are printing Testaments for which you will never find readers . Do not tell us that you can distribute them at Canton and its environs , or on the coasts of China ; there are not ten individuals amongst a million of the aboriginal Chinese , and such constitute the inhabitants of Canton , of the coasts and of the isles , who understand the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for readers you must seek them amongst the masters of Pekin and the fierce hordes of desert Tartary ; but what means do you possess for introducing them to Tartary or Pekin ? ' I stated in a former letter that the town of Kiachta , upon the northern frontier of China , appeared to me to be in many respects a suitable head-quarters for any person on whom might devolve the task of endeavouring to supply the Mandchou Tartars with the word of life in their own language . I am still of opinion , and so are many individuals much more experienced than myself , that if a passport could be obtained from the Russian Government , the Bible Society would do well in despatching an agent to Kiachta , to see what might be done at , or rather from , that place in the great cause . Kiachta is little more than 800 miles from Pekin , and not more than half that distance from Manjuria ; he might therefore , trusting in the Lord , not unreasonably hope to be able to penetrate to the Tartar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his undertaking would not ' come within the limits of safe and prudent speculation . ' But is it possible for a plan to come within the limits of safe speculation , which has in view the conversion of the Tartar ? Far be it from me to advise that the entire stock of Testaments be hazarded in such an enterprise ; 200 is the extreme number which should be ventured , the others shipped for England , for a seizure upon the agent and his books would be no improbable event . I am a person of few words , and will therefore state without circumlocution that I am willing to become that agent . I speak Russ , Mandchou , and the Tartar or broken Turkish of the Russian steppes , and have also some knowledge of Chinese , which I might easily improve at Kiachta , half of the inhabitants of which town are Chinamen . I am therefore not altogether unqualified for such an adventure . Were the attempt to be made , the winter of the ensuing year would be the proper time for starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , and the expenses of a summer journey would be enormous . A few days since , upon taking leave of Prince Abbas Khoulgi , who has departed from this place to his patrimonial territories , near the Caucasus , I presented him with a Testament in the Russian-Tartar language , which is his native tongue . He is without one exception the most interesting man I have ever met . Though by religion a Mahometan he is totally divested of the blind bigotry which so peculiarly characterises the followers of the **35;0;TOOLONG , but on the contrary is possessed of a mind ever restless in the pursuit of truth , and which will doubtless eventually lead him to the narrow path which leadeth unto salvation . The Testament which he received from me was the very last , in the Tartar language , which remained in the shop at which are sold the publications of what was once the Russian Bible Society . It is a sad fact that though there are upwards of three thousand Tartars in St. Petersburg , most of whom can read and write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand suited to their understandings . I have formed many acquaintances among these most singular people , whose language I have acquired , during my residence in the Russian capital , chiefly from conversing with my servant Mahomet Djaffier , a native of Bucharia , son of the Iman or Mahometan priest of this place . Notwithstanding the superstition and fanaticism of these men I am much attached to them ; for their conscientiousness , honesty , and fidelity are beyond all praise . They stand in strong contrast with the lower orders of the Russians , a good-natured , lowly-vicious , wavering race , easily excited , easily soothed ; whilst the former are sedate , sober , temperate beings , with minds like Egyptian granite , from which it is no easy matter to efface an impression , once made . How lamentable that such people should in the all-important matter of religion have embraced error instead of truth ; what ornaments they would prove at the present day to Christianity , if , instead of Mahometanism , Christianity had originally come in their way ! Of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ than millions whose deeds and behaviour are more worthy of the followers of the impostor than of Him ' in whose mouth was found no craft or subtlety . ' I have much more to write and wish so to do , but I have really no time . It is probable that you will not hear from me again before Christmas ( old style ) , but I entreat you to inform me as soon as possible whether my proceedings give satisfaction or not ; but I must here take the liberty of stating that if I were moved one inch from my own course , the consequences might prove disastrous to the work , as I should instantly lose all power of exertion . I want no assistance but that of God , and will accept of none . Pray , I beseech you , that That be granted . You would , my dear Sir , be conferring a great favour upon me , if you would so far trouble yourself as to write a few lines to my venerated friend Mr. Cunningham of Lowestoft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work is going on most prosperously . I remain , Reverend and dear Sir , Your most humble and obliged servant , GEORGE BORROW . P.S.  --  Baron Schilling wishes to have a Chinese Testament of the large edition : pray , send one if possible , and direct it to me at the Sarepta House . Be particular to remember that it must be of the large edition , for he has one of the small already in his possession . He wishes likewise to have Gutzlaff and Lindsay 's Voyages . Enclosed in the letter is the following certificate . Testifico  --  Dominum Burro ab initio usque ad hoc tempus summa cum deligentia et studio in re Mantshurica laborasse . LIPOVZOFF. @# @# To J. Tarn , Esq . @# ST . PETERSBURG , Decr. 15/27 , 1834 . On the other side I send an account of the money disbursed since the period of my last writing to you until the present moment . In respect to the 75 roubles charged for the reprinting of three sheets of St. Matthew , I beg leave to observe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the same manner as that adopted in the first edition , Mr. Lipoftsoff , the Censor , gave me notice that he had determined that the position of the vowel-points should be altered ; and I did not think proper to make any opposition . But as common-sense informed me that it was by no means expedient to exhibit two systems of pointing in the same work , I subsequently caused the first sheets to be reprinted . I think it necessary to offer this short explanation to prevent any misunderstanding ; for this superfluous expense must be attributed to the Censor 's not knowing originally his own mind , and not to any negligence on my part . I am so pressed for time that I have not been able to refer to my last account , which lies buried amongst the ocean of my papers , and in stating that I retained in hand 123 roubles , I have merely trusted to memory and calculation ; but I am sure the Committee and yourself will excuse my little inaccuracy , when I state my situation . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries of Mandchou composition , are in the hospital down with the brain fever , for every kind of sickness is at present raging in this place ; and during the last three days I have been running about in all directions in quest of people to fill their situation , until they recover . Thanks be to the Lord , I have discovered and engaged the person who composed the first Mandchou Gospel of St. Matthew , ten years since ; and as next week I shall again station myself in the printing office for the purpose of assisting and instructing , the great work will not be delayed , and in a fortnight or ten days I trust to be able , provided an opportunity occurs , to transmit to England copies of the four Gospels . With my best rewards to Mr. Brandram and Mr. Jowett ( whose last letter I have received ) , I remain , etc. , GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To J. Tarn , Esq . @# ST . PETERSBURG , Feb. 1 , 1835 . The last account which I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mandchou Testament as far as the first two sheets of St. John . That Gospel having by the blessing of the Almighty passed through the press , and a copy of it bound , and also copies of the three other Gospels , having been forwarded to London , I snatch a moment from my occupation to give an account of my late outgoings , the sums drawn for having been considerable on account of my having many and large bills to discharge . When I last wrote , I retained in hand 75 roubles 50 copecks , of the sum of 3500 drawn for ; since which sum I have drawn for the separate sums of 5000 and 500 according to the books of the Sarepta House . I had advanced to the printer in consequence of the illness of his compositors the sum of 250 , which being deducted from the 5000 I shall , in order to prevent confusion , take no notice of , and proceed to give an account of the disbursement of R.

The sacrifice of time to the correction of the manuscript and proof-sheets scarcely allows me a moment 's leisure , and I am moreover compelled to superintend the printers and book-binders , for everything goes wrong without a strict surveillance . By the time these lines reach you the Acts of the Apostles ( the Lord willing ) will have passed through the press . Next week I hope to write to the Revd. J. Jowett . I remain , etc. , G. BORROW . P.S.  --  I believe that the seven shillings may be accounted for in this manner . I charged seven pounds for my passage to Hamburg , whereas I paid seven guineas . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . March 23 , 1835 ) ST . PETERSBURG , Febry. 20 old style , 1835 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I take advantage of the period of the Russian Carnival , during which all business is at a stand-still , to transmit to you some account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when I last addressed myself to you . True it is , that I have not much to communicate ; for the history of one day is that of a week , and a month ; and when I state that the printing of the Mandchou New Testament is advancing rapidly to a conclusion , I shall have stated all I can of much importance ; but as you and our excellent friends at home have a right to demand particulars , I will endeavour to be as particular as lies within my power . About a month since I placed in the hands of Baron Schilling bound copies of the first four parts of the Testament , the Gospels ; he having kindly promised to cause them to be conveyed to London by one of the couriers belonging to the Foreign Department , to which the Baron is attached . I have reason to believe , however , that you have not received them yet , as I have been informed that they remained in Petersburg some weeks after they had been deposited in the Foreign Office ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no direct means of sending packets to London , I am glad to embrace any which may come in my way , especially those not attended with expense to the Society . In the mean time , I wish to inform you that I am at present occupied on the last sheets of the fifth volume of the Testament , namely , the Acts of the Apostles , in getting which through the press I have experienced much difficulty , partly from the illness of my compositors , and partly from the manner in which the translation was originally executed , which has rendered much modification highly necessary . How I have been enabled to maintain terms of friendship and familiarity with Mr. Lipoftsoff , and yet fulfil the part which those who employ me expect me to fulfil , I am much at a loss to conjecture ; and yet such is really the case . It is at all times dangerous to find fault with the style and composition of authors and translators , even when they come to your door to ask for your advice and assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been one of treble peril . Mr. L. is the Censor of his own work , and against the Censor 's fiat in Russia there is no appeal ; he is moreover a gentleman whom the slightest contradiction never fails to incense to a most incredible degree ; and being a strict member of the Greek Sclavonian Church , imagines that the revealed word and will of the Supreme are only to be found in the Sclavonian Scriptures , from which he made his Mandchou version . Yet whenever anything has displeased me in his translation , I have frankly told him my opinion ; and in almost every instance ( and the instances have been innumerable : for in translations of the sacred writings omissions and additions must ever be avoided ) he has suffered himself to be persuaded to remodel what he originally concluded to be perfect , and which perhaps he still does . So that in what has been hitherto printed of the Testament , there is little , if any thing , with which any one but a professed caviller can find fault . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry my point ; though I assure you that I did not yield until I found that it was absolutely of no avail to offer any further opposition . For although I was convinced that Mr. L. was wrong , and I think when I state the particulars that you will be of my opinion , he had on his side the Chinese scholars of St. Petersburg , Baron Schilling amongst the rest , and moreover being Censor he could have prohibited the work from proceeding if I had been too obstinate . I will tell you the ground of dispute ; for why should I conceal it ? Mr. L. , amongst what he called his improvements of the translation , thought proper , when the Father Almighty is addressed , to erase the personal and possessive pronouns thou or thine , as often as they occur , and in their stead to make use of the noun as the case may require . For example , ' O Father , thou art merciful , ' he would render , ' O Father ! the Father is merciful ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thy name , ' by ' Our . . . may the name of the Father be made holy , may the kingdom of the Father come , may the will of the Father be done on earth , ' etc . I of course objected to this , and enquired what reason he had for having recourse to so much tautology . He replied that he had the best of reasons ; for that amongst the Chinese and Tartars none but the dregs of society were ever addressed in the second person ; and that it would be most uncouth and indecent to speak to the Almighty as if He were a servant or a slave . I told him that Christians , when they address their Creator , do not address Him as if He were a great gentleman or illustrious personage , but rather as children their father , with a mixture of reverence and love ; and that this mixture of reverence and love was one of the most characteristic traits of Christianity . But he said that in China children never address their parent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received usage ; and that in speaking to a parent the children observe the same respectful formula of phraseology as in addressing an Emperor or Viceroy . I then observed that our object in sending the Bible into China was not to encourage the Chinese in any of their customs or observances , but rather to wean them from them ; and that however startling any expression in the Bible might prove to them at first , it was our hope and trust that it would eventually cease to be disagreeable and extraordinary , and that the Chinese were at present in a state which required stirring and powerful medicine , medicine which must necessarily be disagreeable to the palate to prove beneficial in another quarter . However , he said that I talked ' pustota ' ( emptiness or nonsense ) , and as he was not to be moved , I was compelled to acquiesce with his dictum . This occurred some months since , and I rejoice to see in the last letter with which you favoured me a fortuitous corroboration of my views on this subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that you do not desire the Chinese to consider the Bible the work of a Chinese , etc . Nor do I ; and throughout the progress of the work I have collated every sheet with the Greek Testament , and whenever I have found anything still adhering to the translation which struck me as not being faithful to the original , I have invariably modified it , so that , with the exception of the one instance above mentioned , I can safely assert that the Word of God has been rendered into Mandchou as nearly and closely as the idiom of a very singular language would permit . I have now received and paid for , as you will perceive by my accompts , 495 reams of paper , which will be barely sufficient for the work , which will consist of eight parts , instead of seven , as we at first supposed . I take the liberty of requesting that when the books arrive you will examine the texture of the paper on which they are printed . Mr. L. is exceedingly pleased with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first edition of St. Matthew by at least ten roubles per ream ; and that it is calculated to endure for 200 years . It certainly does possess uncommon strength and consistency , notwithstanding its tenuity , and the difficulty of tearing it is remarkable . By my direction it received a slight tinge of yellow , as no books are printed in China upon paper entirely colourless . I must be permitted to say that the manner in which the book-binder , Mr. Lauffert , is performing his task is above all praise ; but he has been accustomed for many years to this kind of work , the greatest part of Baron Schilling 's immense collection of Chinese works having been bound by him . We may esteem ourselves very fortunate in having met with a person so competent to the task , and whose terms are so remarkably reasonable . Any other book-binder in St. Petersburg would have refused double the price at which he has executed this important part of the work , and had they undertaken the affair , would probably have executed it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn and laughter of the people for whom it is intended . A few months since I saw Mr. Glen , the missionary from Astracan , as he passed through St. Petersburg on his return to England . He is a very learned man , but of very simple and unassuming manners . The doom which had been pronounced upon his translation seems to have deeply affected him ; but he appears to me to labour under a very great error respecting the motives which induced the Editorial Committee to reject his work , or at least to hesitate upon publishing it . He assured me that all that was urged against it was the use , here and there , of Arabic words , which in a language like the Persian , which on an original foundation exhibits a superstructure nearly one moiety of which is Arabic , is unavoidable . As I was totally unacquainted with the facts of the case , I said nothing upon the subject ; but I now suspect , from a few words dropped in your letter , that the objection is founded not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at improving or adorning the simplicity of the Bible . However this may be , there can be no doubt that Mr. Glen is a Persian scholar of the first water . Mirza Achmed , a Persian gentleman now living at St. Petersburg , who resided some time at Astracan , informed me that he had seen the translation , and that the language was highly elegant ; but whether or not the translation was faithful , and such as a translation of the sacred volume ought to be , he of course was entirely ignorant ; he could merely speak as to the excellence of the Persian . Mirza Djaffar also , the Persian professor here , spoke much to the same effect . Mr. Stallybrass , the Siberian missionary , is at present here on his way to England , whither he is conducting his two sons , for the purpose of placing them in some establishment , where they may receive a better education than it is possible for him to give them in Siberia . I have seen him several times , and have heard him preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-informed man , and in countenance and manner much like Mr. Swan  --  which similarity may perhaps be accounted for by their long residence under the same roof ; for people who are in the habit of conversing together every day insensibly assume each other 's habits , manner of speaking , and expression of countenance . Mr. Stallybrass 's youngest son , a lad of fifteen , shows marks of talent which may make him useful in the missionary field for which he is intended . The most surprising instance of precocious talent that I have ever seen , or ever heard of , is exhibited in a young nobleman , who visits me every day . He is the eldest son of Count Fredro , Marshal of the Imperial Court , and though only fourteen years of age , speaks eight languages perfectly well , is a good Grecian and Latinist , is one of the best draftsmen in Russia , is well acquainted with physics , botany , geography , and history , and to crown all , has probably the most beautiful voice that ever mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the religion of the family , with whom I am very intimate , is the Romish . I now and then attend the service of the Armenian Church , for the purpose of perfecting myself in the language , and have formed many acquaintances amongst the congregation : there are several very clever and very learned Armenians in this place ; one of them I will particularly mention , a little elderly gentleman of the name of Kudobashoff , who is the best Armenian scholar at present in existence . He is on the eve of publishing a work , calculated to be very interesting to us : an Armenian and Russian Dictionary , on which he has been occupied for the space of thirty-seven years , and which will be of the highest assistance to any future editor of the Armenian Scriptures ; and be it known , that no place in Europe , with perhaps the exception of Venice , offers more advantages to the editing of the A.S . than St. Petersburg . I will now conclude , and repeat the assurance that I am ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , at a moment 's warning , will direct my course towards Canton , Pekin , or the court of the Grand Lama . With my best respects to Mr. Brandram , I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , most truly yours , G. BORROW . @# @# To J. Tarn , Esq . @# ( Endorsed : recd . May , 1835 ) ST . PETERSBURG , April 28th old style , 1835 . I send you an account of monies spent in the editing of the Acts of the Apostles and the first volume of the Epistles . I beg leave at the same time to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Jackson 's letter . I am sorry that any mistake should have occurred , but the cause of the one in question was , that at the time I last wrote to you , I was unable to refer to my previous account ; however , the mistake now stands rectified . I take this opportunity of informing you that I shall be obliged to order sixty or seventy more reams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess will not be sufficient to complete the work . You will see the reason of this in the account which I now send you . In the first volume of the Epistles there are forty-three sheets , and in the second there will be nearly the same number ; these two volumes in thickness will be equal to three of the previous parts . During the last month I have experienced great difficulty in keeping the printers at work on account of the festivals of the season , but I am glad to say that I have never failed to obtain six sheets every week . I have received the Revd. Mr. Jowett 's letter , and shall write to him in a few days . GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . June 1 , 1835 ) May 3 , 1835 old style , ST . PETERSBURG . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I write a few hasty lines for the purpose of informing you that I shall not be able to obtain a passport for Siberia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandchou Bible thither . The Russian Government is too solicitous to maintain a good understanding with that of China to encourage any project at which the latter could take umbrage . Therefore pray inform me to what place I am to despatch the Bibles . I have had some thoughts of embarking the first five parts without delay to England , but I have forborne from an unwillingness to do anything which I was not commanded to do . By the time I receive your answer everything will be in readiness , or nearly so , to be forwarded wherever the Committee shall judge expedient . I wish also to receive orders respecting what is to be done with the types . I should be sorry if they were to be abandoned in the same manner as before , for it is possible that at some future time they may prove eminently useful . As for myself , I suppose I must return to England , as my task will be speedily completed . I hope the Society are convinced that I have served them faithfully , and that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did me the honour of confiding to me , correctly and within as short a time as possible . At my return , if the Society think that I can still prove of utility to them , I shall be most happy to devote myself still to their service . I am a person full of faults and weaknesses , as I am every day reminded by bitter experience , but I am certain that my zeal and fidelity towards those who put confidence in me are not to be shaken . Should it now become a question what is to be done with these Mandchou Bibles which have been printed at a considerable expense , I should wish to suggest that Baron Schilling be consulted . In a few weeks he will be in London , which he intends visiting during a summer tour which he is on the point of commencing . He will call at the Society 's House , and as he is a nobleman of great experience and knowledge in all that relates to China , it would not be amiss to interrogate him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at command . In your last letter but one you stated that our noble President had been kind enough to declare that I had but to send in an account of any extraordinary expenses which I had been put to in the course of the work to have them defrayed . I return my most grateful thanks for this most considerate intimation , which nevertheless I can not avail myself of , as according to one of the articles of my agreement my salary of 200 pounds was to cover all extra expenses . Petersburg is doubtless the dearest capital in Europe , and expenses meet an individual , especially one situated as I have been , at every turn and corner ; but an agreement is not to be broken on that account .

The seventh part is bound and packed up ; the eighth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have been ready a month since , having been nearly six weeks in the book-binder 's hands , but he was disappointed in obtaining the necessary paper ; I hope to have shipped all off , and to have bidden adieu to Russia , at the expiration of a fortnight . I take this opportunity of informing you that I was obliged to purchase additional 85 reams of paper , of every sheet of which I shall give an account . 1020 copies of every sheet I ordered to be printed , that we might have a full 1000 at the conclusion . 20 reams have at various times been sent to the binder for frontings and endings to the work , and there were 36 sheets in the seventh and 33 in the eighth part , consequently the demand for paper is not surprising . Since my last drafts upon the Treasurer I have received two thousand roubles from Asmus , Simondsen and Co. , for which I shall give them a draft on my departure when I receive my salary . My account since the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand 518 roubles of the Society 's money , I shall deliver to you on my arrival . I have the honour to remain , Dear Sir , Truly yours , G. BORROW . Pray excuse this hasty letter , which I write from the Custom House . @# @# To Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . Sept. 14th , 1835 ) ST . PETERSBURG , Aug. 12 , 1835 . As it is probable that yourself and my other excellent and Christian friends at the Bible House are hourly expecting me and wondering at my non-appearance , I can not refrain from sending you a few lines in order to account for my prolonged stay abroad . For the last fortnight I have been detained at St. Petersburg in the most vexatious and unheard-of manner . The two last parts of our Testaments have been bound and ready for shipping a considerable time , and are at present in the warehouse of a most pious and excellent person in this place , whom the Bible Society are well acquainted with ; but I have hitherto not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will ask how I contrived to despatch the first six volumes , which you have doubtless by this time received . But I must inform you that at that time I had only a verbal permission , and that the Custom House permitted them to pass because they knew not what they were . But now , notwithstanding I obtained a regular permission to print , and transacted everything in a legal and formal manner , I am told that I had no right at all to print the Scriptures at St. Petersburg , and that my coming thither on that account ( I use their own words ) was a step in the highest degree suspicious and mysterious , and that there are even grounds for supposing that I am not connected with the Bible Society or employed by them . To-day , however , I lost patience , and said that I would not be trifled with any longer ; that next week I should send away the books by a vessel which would then sail , and that whosoever should attempt to stop them would do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I said . I shall then demand my passport and advertise my departure , as every one before quitting Russia must be advertised in the newspapers two weeks successively . Pray do me the justice to believe that for this unpleasant delay I am by no means accountable . It is in the highest degree tormenting to myself . I am very unwell from vexation and disquietude of mind , and am exposed to every kind of inconvenience . The term for which I took my chambers is expired , and I am living in a dirty and expensive hotel . But there is One above who supports me in these troubles , and I have no doubt that everything will turn out for the best . I take this opportunity of sending my accounts to Mr. Tarn ; if there be any inaccuracy let him excuse it , for the post hurries me . G. BORROW . @# @# Report of Mr. George Borrow @# To the Members of the Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society . GENTLEMEN ,  --  It is now about two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty which you have been pleased to confide to my hands , namely , that of editing at the Russian capital the New Testament in the Mandchou language which has been translated by Mr. Lipoftsoff , at present Councillor of State and Chinese Translator at that place , but formerly one of the members of the Russian mission at Pekin . On my arrival , before entering upon this highly important and difficult task , I , in obedience to your command , assisted Mr. Swan , the missionary from Selinginsk , to complete a transcript which he had commenced some time previous of a manuscript translation of the principal part of the Old Testament into Mandchou executed by Puerot , who , originally a Jesuit emissary at Pekin , passed the latter years of his life in the service of the Russian mission in the capacity of physician . The united labours of Mr. Swan and myself speedily brought the task in question to a conclusion , so that the transcript has for a considerable time been in the possession of the Bible Society . I will here take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as the work is not at the present moment before me , it is impossible to enter upon a critical and minute examination of its merits . Nevertheless , having either transcribed or at various times perused it , I have formed a general opinion concerning it which , though very probably a faulty one , I shall lay before you in a few words , which at any future time I hope you will permit me to recall , if fresh lights upon the subject compel me to believe that my original conclusion was an erroneous one ; having no doubt that those who are embarked in so noble a cause as the propagation of The Great Truth , will be at all times willing to excuse error when confessed , as by the confession of error the truth becomes more glaringly manifest . The merits of this translation are , upon the whole , of a very high order ; but it would be an untruth and an absurdity to say that it does not exhibit defects and blemishes of a striking and peculiar kind  --  peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original which , being narrative are exceedingly simple as to idea and style , have been invariably rendered in a manner the most liable to censure , exhibiting not only a slovenly carelessness in regard to diction , but not unfrequently a disregard of accuracy when the slightest particle of attention was only necessary to render the meaning which the sacred writer endeavours to convey . These are its greatest , and , it may perhaps be said , its only defects ; for if a regard for truth compel me to state that the style of the translation frequently sinks far below the original when at its lowest grade , that same regard compels me to say that in yet more instances it rises with the same to a degree which I believe it is scarcely possible for any individual with the limited powers of uninspired man to surpass . This soaring tendency is particularly observable in the version of the Book of Job , which is certainly the most beautiful , is believed by many to be the most ancient , and is confessedly one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree entitled to speak particularly of this part of the Mandchou version in question , having frequently at the time I was engaged upon it translated into English several of the chapters which particularly struck me , for the purpose of exhibiting them to Mr. Swan , who invariably sympathised with my admiration . The translation of most of the writings of the prophets , as far as Puerot went , has been executed in the same masterly manner , and it is only to be lamented that , instead of wasting much of his time and talents upon the Apocryphal writings , as is unfortunately the case , the ex-Jesuit left behind him no Mandchou version of Isaiah and the Psalms , the lack of which will be sensibly felt whenever his work shall be put in a printed state into the hands of those for whose benefit it is intended , an event most devoutly to be wished for by all those who would fain see Christ reign triumphant in that most extraordinary country of which the Mandchou constitutes one of the principal languages , being used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing within it translations of all the masterpieces of Chinese , Tibetian , and Brahmanic literature with which it has been enriched since the period of the accession of the present Tartar dynasty to the Chinese throne , the proper language of which dynasty it is well known to be . To translate literally , or even closely , according to the common acceptation of the term , into the Mandchou language is of all impossibilities the greatest ; partly from the grammatical structure of the language , and partly from the abundance of its idioms . The Mandchou is the only one of any of the civilised languages of the world with which the writer of these lines has any acquaintance , whose grammar stands far aloof from the rest in wonderful singularity ; the most remarkable feature of which is the want of some of those conjunctions generally considered as indispensable , and which are certainly of the first utility . The result of this peculiarity is that such a combination of other parts of speech must be employed as will express the idea without the aid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy , much more space is required in the translation of a sentence into this language than the original occupies . I am induced to make this remark , which I am afraid will be considered an excursory one , from the apprehensiveness that some , observing the translations of the Scriptures into this language to be bulkier than the originals , might conclude that extraneous and unnecessary matter had crept in , which a knowledge of the above fact will prevent . The transcript of the Mandchou Old Testament having been brought to a conclusion and permission having been obtained to print the New at St. Petersburg  --  the accomplishment of which last point was , as you are well aware , attended with much difficulty  --  I set myself seriously to work upon the principal object of my mission . With the recapitulation of my labours I wish not to trouble you , the various particulars having been communicated to you in letters written at various times upon the subject . I will content myself with observing that within ten months from the commencement of printing , the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of the Almighty passed through the press , and , I believe , with as few typographical errors as would have been the case had a much more considerable portion of time been devoted to the enterprise , which , it is true , I was in haste to accomplish , but in a manner not calculated to render the undertaking futile nor cast discredit upon the Society and myself being well aware that an edition of the Scriptures exhibiting marks of carelessness must at best be a futile work , and that the speed with which it was executed could be no apology ; as few will be tempted to deny that no edition at all of the sacred volume in the languages of the heathen is far preferable to one whose incorrectness would infallibly and with some reason awaken ridicule , which , though one of the most contemptible , is certainly one of the most efficacious weapons in the armoury of the Prince of Darkness and the Enemy of Light , as it is well known that his soldiers here on earth accomplish by its means what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of eloquence and carnal reasoning , in the use and management of which they are , however , by no means unskilled , as many a follower of Jesus from his own individual experience can testify . After the termination of my editorial task , having little to employ myself upon whilst the two last volumes were undergoing the process of binding , I determined upon a journey to Moscow , the ancient capital of the Russian Empire , which differs widely from St. Petersburg in appearance , structure , and in the manners , habits , and opinions of its inhabitants . I arrived there after a journey of four days . Moscow is by far the most remarkable city it has ever been my fortune to see ; but as it has been frequently described , and with tolerable correctness , there is no necessity for me to enter into a particular account of all that presented itself to my observation . I ascended the celebrated tower of Ivan Velike , situated within the walls of the Kremlin , from the top of which there is a glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of which , in a deep hole in the earth , is the gigantic bell which weighs 27,000 poods , or eight hundred and seventy thousand pounds . I likewise visited the splendid church of the Kremlin , and had much conversation with the priest who is in the habit of showing its curiosities to strangers . He is a most intelligent and seemingly truly pious person , and well acquainted with English spiritual literature , especially with the writings of Bishops Taylor and Tillotson , whom he professed to hold in great admiration ; though he asserted that both these divines , great men as they undoubtedly were , were far inferior writers to his own celebrated countryman Archbishop Teekon , and their productions less replete with spiritual manna  --  against which assertion I felt little inclined to urge any objection , having myself perused the works of the great Russian divine with much comfort and satisfaction , and with which I can only regret that the devout part of the British public are up to the present moment utterly unacquainted . As one of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a particular part of its population , which from the accounts I had received of it had inspired me with the most vivid interest , I did not fail shortly after my arrival to seek an opportunity of accomplishing my work , and believe that what I have now to communicate will be of some interest to the Christian and the philosopher . I allude to the people called Zigani or Gypsies , or , as they style themselves , Rommany , of which there are several thousands in and about Moscow , and who obtain a livelihood by various means . Those who have been accustomed to consider these people as wandering barbarians , incapable of civilisation and unable to appreciate the blessings of a quiet and settled life , will be surprised at learning that many of those in Moscow inhabit large and handsome houses , appear abroad in elegant equipages , and if distinguishable from the genteel class of the Russians are only so by superior personal advantages and mental accomplishments . Of this singular phenomenon at Moscow the female Gypsies are the principal cause , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that , although in the heart of a country in which the vocal art has arrived at greater perfection than in any other part of the world , the principal Gypsy choirs in Moscow are allowed by the general voice of the public to be unrivalled and to bear away the palm from all competitors . It is a fact notorious in Russia that the celebrated Catalani was so filled with admiration for the powers of voice displayed by one of the Gypsy songsters , who , after the former had sung before a splendid audience at Moscow , stepped forward and with an astonishing burst of melody ravished every ear , that she tore from her own shoulders a shawl of immense value which had been presented to her by the Pope , and embracing the Gypsy compelled her to accept it , saying that it had been originally intended for the matchless singer which she now discovered was not herself . The sums obtained by these performers are very large , enabling them to live in luxury of every description and to maintain their husbands in a princely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and every one who has resided for any length of time in Russia can not but be aware that the lovely , talented , and domesticated wife of Count Alexander Tolstoi is by birth a Gypsy , and was formerly one of the ornaments of a Rommany choir at Moscow as she is now one of the principal ornaments of the marriage state and of illustrious life . It is not , however , to be supposed that all the female Gypsies in Moscow are of this high , talented , and respectable order ; amongst them there are a great number of low , vulgar , and profligate females who sing in taverns , or at the various gardens in the neighbourhood , and whose husbands and male connections subsist by horse-jobbing and such kinds of low traffic . The principal place of resort of this class is Marina Rotche , lying about two verses from Moscow , and thither I drove , attended by a valet-de-place . Upon my arriving there the Gypsies swarmed out from their tents and from the little tracteer or tavern , and surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I addressed them in a loud voice in the dialect of the English Gypsies , with which I have some slight acquaintance . A scream of wonder instantly arose , and welcomes and greetings were poured forth in torrents of musical Rommany , amongst which , however , the most pronounced cry was : ah kak mi toute karmuma  --  ' Oh , how we love you , ' for at first they supposed me to be one of their brothers , who , they said , were wandering about in Turkey , China , and other parts , and that I had come over the great pawnee , or water , to visit them . Their countenances exactly resembled those of their race in England and Spain , brown , and for the most part beautiful , their eyes fiery and wildly intelligent , their hair coal-black and somewhat coarse . I asked them numerous questions , especially as to their religion and original country . They said that they believed in ' Devil , ' which , singularly enough , in their language signifies God , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; that their fathers came from Rommany land , but where that land lay they knew not . They sang many songs both in the Russian and Rommany languages ; the former were modern popular pieces which are in vogue on the stage , but the latter were evidently very ancient , being composed in a metre or cadence to which there is nothing analogous in Russian prosody , and exhibiting an internal character which was anything but European or modern . I visited this place several times during my sojourn at Moscow , and spoke to them upon their sinful manner of living , upon the advent and suffering of Christ Jesus , and expressed , upon my taking a final leave of them , a hope that they would be in a short period furnished with the word of eternal life in their own language , which they seemed to value and esteem much higher than the Russian . They invariably listened with much attention ; and during the whole time I was amongst them exhibited little in speech or conduct which was objectionable . I returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me to Russia being successfully terminated , I quitted that country , and am compelled to acknowledge , with regret . I went thither prejudiced against the country , the government , and the people ; the first is much more agreeable than is generally supposed ; the second is seemingly the best adapted for so vast an empire ; and the third , even the lowest classes , are in general kind , hospitable , and benevolent . True it is that they have many vices , and their minds are overshadowed by the gloomy clouds of Grecian superstition , but the efforts of many excellent and pious persons amongst the English at St. Petersburg are directed to unveiling to them the cheering splendour of the lamp of the Gospel ; and it is the sincere prayer of the humble individual who now addresses you that the difficulties which at present much obstruct their efforts may be speedily removed , and that from the boundless champains of Russia may soon resound the Jubilee hymn of millions , who having long groped their way in the darkness of the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with joyful hearts acknowledge the immensity of the blessing .

As you ask me to favour you with my thoughts , I certainly will ; for I have thought much upon the matters in question , and the result I will communicate to you in a very few words . I decidedly approve ( and so do all the religious friends whom I have communicated it to ) of the plan of a journey to Portugal , and am sorry that it has been suspended , though I am convinced that your own benevolent and excellent heart was the cause , unwilling to fling me into an undertaking which you supposed might be attended with peril and difficulty . Therefore I wish it to be clearly understood that I am perfectly willing to undertake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit the town and country , to discourse with the people , especially those connected with institutions for infantine education , and to learn what ways and opportunities present themselves for conveying the Gospel into those benighted countries . I will moreover undertake , with the blessing of God , to draw up a small volume of what I shall have seen and heard there which can not fail to be interesting , and if patronised by the Society will probably help to cover the expenses of the expedition . On my return I can commence the Armenian Testament , and whilst I am editing that , I may be acquiring much vulgar Chinese from some unemployed Lascar or stray Cantonman whom I may pick up upon the wharves ; and then  --  to China .

The speaking produced such an effect that some of the most vicious characters in the neighbourhood have become weekly subscribers to the Branch Society . So says the Chronicle of Norfolk in its report . @# @# To the Rev. J. Jowett @# ( Endorsed : recd . Dec. 8 , 1835 ) LISBON , 30 Nov. 1835 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I arrived safe at Lisbon on the twelfth of the present month after a passage which , considering the season in which it was made , may be termed a fair one . On the morning of the tenth we found ourselves about two leagues from the coast of Galicia , whose lofty mountains gilded by the rising sun presented a magnificent appearance . We soon passed Cape Finisterre , and standing farther out to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eleventh the sea was very rough , and a most remarkable circumstance occurred . I was on the forecastle , discoursing with two of the sailors , and one of them who had just left his hammock told me that he had had a most disagreeable dream , for , said he , pointing up to the mast , ' I dreamt that I fell into the sea from off the cross-trees . ' He was heard to say this by several of the crew besides myself . A moment after , the captain of the vessel , perceiving that the squall was increasing , ordered the topsails to be taken in , whereupon this man with several others instantly ran up aloft . The yard was presently loosened , and in the act of being hauled down , when a violent gust of wind whirled it round with violence , and a man was struck down from the cross-trees into the sea , which was raging and tumbling below . In a few moments he emerged , and I saw his head distinctly on the crest of a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shortly before had been relating his dream . I shall never forget the look of agony he cast us whilst the ship hurried past him . The alarm was given , and in a moment everything was in confusion . It was at least two minutes before the vessel was stopped , and the man was left a considerable way behind , but I still kept my eye upon him , and could perceive that he was struggling gallantly with the waves . A boat was at length lowered , but the rudder unfortunately was not at hand , and only two oars could be procured , with which the men who manned her could make but little progress in the tremendous sea ; however , they did their best , and had arrived within ten yards of the man who had continued struggling for his life , when I lost sight of him , and the men on their return said that they saw him below the waters at glimpses , sinking deeper and deeper , his arms stretched out and his body to all appearance stiff , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , as if satisfied with the prey it had received , became comparatively calm , and the squall subsided . The poor fellow who was drowned in this singular manner was a fine young man , twenty-seven years of age , the only son of a widowed mother . He was the best sailor on board , and beloved by every one who was acquainted with him . The event occurred on the 11th of November 1835 , the vessel was the ' London Merchant ' Steamship , commanded by Captain Whittingham . Wonderful indeed are the ways of Providence . I experienced some difficulty in landing at Lisbon , the custom-house officers being exceedingly dilatory in examining the baggage . I had yet more difficulty in obtaining a lodging , but at last found one , dark , dirty , and exceedingly expensive , without attendance . I shall not trouble you with a description of Lisbon , for as I have much that is important to communicate I must not waste paper with uninteresting details . I will merely observe that it is a noble town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tagus , the houses are very lofty , like castles , the streets are in general precipitously steep , and no animals of burden but mules , asses , and oxen can traverse them with safety . I found the streets by no means so dirty as they have been represented , and at night they are tolerably well lighted , but between the hours of nine and twelve they swarm with robbers and assassins . I should have written to you before , but I wished to transmit in my first letter a stock of information which would enable you at once to form some idea as to the state of this country ; and in order to acquire such I have visited every part of Lisbon , entered into discourse with the people on all occasions , and have made a journey of nearly one hundred miles about the country , during which I visited Cintra and Mafra , at the former of which places I remained four days , making excursions in the meanwhile on foot or on a mule amongst the mountains , and visiting whatever villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisbon carelessness for religion of any kind seems to prevail . The people appear in general to have shaken off the old superstition and to feel no inclination to bend their necks to another yoke . Many of them have told me that the priests are the veriest knaves in the world , and that they have for many years subsisted by imposing upon them , and that they wished the whole body was destroyed from the face of the earth . I have enquired of many of the lower orders whether they ever confessed themselves , whereupon they laughed in my face and said that they had not done so for years , demanding what good would result to them for so doing , and whether I was fool enough to suppose that a priest could forgive sins for a sum of money . One day whilst speaking to a muleteer I pointed to a cross over the gate of a chapel opposite to us , and asked him if he reverenced it ; he instantly flew into a rage , stamped violently , and spitting on the ground said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have no more objection to spit upon it than the stones on which he trod : ' I believe that there is a God , ' he added , ' but as for the nonsense which the priests tell us I believe no part of it . ' It has not yet been my fortune during my researches in Lisbon to meet one individual of the populace amongst the many I have addressed who had read the Scripture or knew anything of its contents ; though many of them have assured me that they could read , which in many instances I have found to be the fact , having repeatedly taken from my pocket the New Testament in Portuguese which I constantly carry with me , and requested them to read a few verses , which they were able to do . Some of these individuals had read much in their own language , which indeed contains a store of amusing and instructive literature  --  for example , the chronicles of the various kings of Portugal and of the heroes who distinguished themselves in the various wars of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast regions of the East by doubling the Cape . Amongst the many public places which I have visited at Lisbon is the Convent of San Geronymo , the church of which is the most beautiful specimen of Gothic architecture in the Peninsula , and is furnished with the richest shrines . Since the expulsion of the monks from the various religious houses in Portugal , this edifice has served as an asylum for orphans , and at present enjoys the particular patronage of the young Queen . In this establishment upwards of five hundred children , some of them female , are educated upon the Lancastrian system , and when they have obtained a sufficient age are put out to the various trades and professions for which they are deemed most suited , the tallest and finest of the lads being drafted into the army . One of the boys of his own accord became my guide and introduced me to the various classes , where I found the children clean and neat and actively employed upon their tasks . I asked him if the Holy Scripture ( Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He answered in the affirmative ; but I much doubt the correctness of his answer , for upon my requesting him to show me a copy of the Holy Scripture , he did not appear to know what I meant by it . When he said that the scholars read the Holy Scripture he probably meant the vile papistical book called ' Christian Doctrine , ' in which the office of the mass is expounded , which indeed I saw in the hands of the junior boys , and which , from what I have since seen , I believe to be a standard school-book in Portugal . I spent nearly two hours in examining the various parts of this institution , and it is my intention to revisit it in a short time , when I hope to obtain far better information as to the moral and religious education of its inmates . On my arrival at Lisbon I was disappointed in my expectation of finding Mr. Wilby , who was in the country and was not expected for a week . I therefore had at first no person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best means of proceeding ; but unwilling to remain idle till the period of his arrival , I at once commenced operations at Lisbon as I have narrated . At the end of four or five days I started for Cintra , distant about four leagues from Lisbon , situate on a ledge of the northern declivity of a wild and picturesque mountain . Cintra contains about eight hundred inhabitants , and in its environs are many magnificent quintas or country seats of some of the first families in Portugal ; it is likewise a royal residence , for at its north-eastern side stands an ancient palace , which though unfurnished is preserved in good repair , and which was the favourite residence of the ancient kings . On one of the ridges of this mountain are seen the ruins of an immense castle , which for centuries was the stronghold of the Moors in this part of the Peninsula . The morning after my arrival I was about to ascend the mountain to examine it , when I observed a person , advanced in years , whom , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enquiry I found in effect that he was one of the three priests of the place . I instantly accosted him , and had no reason to repent for so doing , for I found him affable and communicative . After praising the beauty of the scenery , I made some enquiry as to the state of education amongst the people beneath his care . He told me that he was sorry to say that they were in a state of great ignorance , that very few of them could either write or read , that there was no school in the place but one at which a few children were taught the alphabet , but which was not then open , that there was a school at Colhares , about a league distant . He said that nothing so surprised him as to see English , the most learned and intelligent people in the world , visiting a place like Cintra , where there was no literature and nothing of utility ( aonde no ha nem leitura , nem sciencia , nem alguma cousa que presta ) . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear a priest of Portugal lament the ignorance of the populace , and began to entertain hopes that I should not find the priests in general so indisposed to the mental improvement of the people as I at first imagined . That same day I visited Colhares , a romantic village lower down the mountain to the west , near the sea . Seeing some peasants collected round the smithy I enquired about the school , and one instantly offered to be my guide thither . I went upstairs into a small apartment where I found the master with about a dozen pupils standing in a row , for there was but one chair , or rather stool , to which , after having embraced me , he conducted me with great civility . After some discourse he shewed me the books which he used for the instruction of his pupils ; they were spelling-books like those used in our village schools and the before-mentioned ' Christian Doctrine . ' Upon my enquiring whether it was his custom to use the Scripture in his school , he told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scriptures their parents took them from school in order that they might assist them in the labours of the field , and that in general they were by no means solicitous that their children should learn anything , as they considered the time occupied in acquiring learning as squandered away . He added that all the village schools in Portugal were supported by the Government , but that many of them had lately been discontinued , as the schoolmasters experienced the greatest difficulty in obtaining their salaries ; but that he had heard that it was the intention of the Government to establish schools in all parts of the country on the Lancastrian system  --  which since my return to Lisbon I have discovered to be a fact . He told me that he had a copy of the New Testament in his possession , which I desired to see ; but on examining it I discovered that it was only the Epistles ( from Pereira 's version ) with long Popish notes . I asked him whether he considered that there was any harm in reading the Scripture without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , but that simple people without the assistance of notes could derive but little benefit therefrom , as the greatest part that they read would be unintelligible to them . Whereupon I shook hands with him , and on departing said that there was no part of Scripture so difficult to understand as those very notes which were intended to elucidate it , and that the Almighty would never have inspired His saints with a desire to write what was unintelligible to the great mass of mankind . For some days after this I traversed the country in all directions , riding into the fields where I saw the peasants at work , and entering into discourse with them ; and notwithstanding many of my questions must have appeared to them very singular , I never experienced any incivility , though they frequently answered me with smiles and laughter . ( I have now communicated about half of what I have to say ; the remainder next week . G. BORROW. ) @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Jan. 10 , 1836 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At length I departed for Mafra ; the principal part of the way lay over steep and savage hills , very dangerous for horses , and I had reason to repent , before I got back to Cintra , that I had not mounted one of the sure-footed mules of the country . I reached Mafra in safety ; it is a large village , which has by degrees sprung up in the vicinity of an immense building , originally intended to serve as a convent and palace , and which next to the Escurial is the most magnificent edifice in the Peninsula . In this building is to be seen the finest library in Portugal , comprising books in all sciences and languages , and which , if not suited to the place in which the building stands , which is almost a desert , is yet well suited to the size and grandeur of the building which contains it . But here are now no monks to take care of it ; they have been driven forth , some of them to beg their bread , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , and many , as I have been informed , to prowl about as banditti . The place is now abandoned to two or three menials , and exhibits an aspect of solitude and desolation which is truly appalling . Whilst I was viewing the cloisters an exceedingly fine and intelligent-looking lad came up to me , and asked ( I suppose in the hope of obtaining a trifle ) if I would permit him to show me the village church , which he told me was well worth seeing . I said ' No , ' but that if he would show me the village school , I should be much obliged to him . He looked at me with astonishment , and assured me that there was nothing to be seen in the school , at which not more than half a dozen boys were instructed , and that he himself was one of the number ; but I told him that he should show me no other place , and he at last unwillingly attended me . On the way he said that the schoolmaster was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expelled , and that he was a very learned man and spoke French and Greek . We went past a stone cross , and the boy bent and crossed himself with much devotion : I mention this circumstance , as it was the first instance of devotion which I had observed amongst the Portuguese since my arrival . When near the house where the schoolmaster resided , he pointed it out to me and then hid himself behind a wall , where he waited till I returned . On stepping over the threshold I was confronted by a short stout man , between sixty and seventy years of age , dressed in a blue jerkin and grey trousers , without shirt or waistcoat . He looked at me sternly , and enquired in the French language what was my pleasure . I apologised for intruding upon him , and stated that , being informed that he occupied the situation of schoolmaster to the place , I had come to pay my respects to him , and to beg to be informed respecting the manner of instruction which he adopted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied , for that he was a brother of the convent . I replied that I had heard that all the friaries had been broken up and the brothers dismissed ; whereupon he sighed , and said it was too true . He was then silent for a minute , and his better nature overcoming his angry feelings he produced a snuff-box and offered it to me . The snuff-box is the olive-branch of the Portuguese , and he who wishes to be on good terms with them , or to conciliate them , must never refuse to put his finger and thumb into it when preferred ; I took therefore a large pinch , though I detest the dust , and we were soon friendly enough . He was eager to obtain news , especially from Lisbon and Spain . I told him that the officers of the regiments at Lisbon had the day before I left that place gone in a body to the Queen , and insisted upon her either receiving their swords or dismissing her Ministers ; whereupon he rubbed his hands and said , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Upon my saying that the affairs of Don Carlos were on the decline , he frowned , and said that it could not possibly be , for that God was too just to suffer it . I felt for the poor man , who had been driven from his home in the noble convent close by , and from a state of comfort and affluence reduced in his old age to indigence and misery , for his dwelling seemed to contain scarcely an article of furniture . I tried twice or thrice to induce him to converse on the school , but he always avoided the subject or said shortly that he knew nothing about it ; the idea of being a schoolmaster was evidently humiliating to him . On my leaving him , the boy came from his hiding-place and rejoined me ; he said his reason for hiding himself was fear that his master might know that it was he who brought me to him , for that the old man was ashamed of appearing in the character of a schoolmaster . I asked the boy whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever read it ; but he did not understand me . I must here observe that the boy was fifteen years of age , and that he was in many respects very intelligent and had some knowledge of the Latin language ; nevertheless he knew not the Scripture even by name , and I have no doubt that at least one half of his countrymen are , in that respect , no wiser than himself . I have questioned the children of Portugal at the doors of village inns , at the hearths of their cottages , in the fields where they labour , at the stone Mountains by the way-sides where they water their cattle , about the Scripture , the Bible , the Old and New Testament , and in scarcely one instance have they known what I was alluding to or could return me a rational answer , though in all other instances I had no reason to complain of their want of apprehension . Indeed nothing has surprised me more than the free and unembarrassed manner with which the Portuguese peasantry sustain a conversation , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet very few of them can write or read , whereas the peasantry of our own country , whose education is in general much superior , are in their conversation coarse and dull almost to brutality , and absurdly ungrammatical in the language which they use , though the English tongue , upon the whole , is more simple in its grammar than the Portuguese . On my way back from Mafra to Cintra I very nearly lost my life . As the night was closing in fast , we left the regular road by the advice of the guide , and descending the hill on which Mafra stands reached the bottom of the valley , from which there is a narrow pathway winding round the next hill , exceedingly steep , with a precipice on the left side ; the horse on which I was mounted , and which was by no means suited for such climbing , in his violent struggles to accomplish the ascent burst the girth of the saddle , so that I was cast violently off , with the saddle beneath me . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have rolled down the hill and probably have been killed ; as it was , I remained stunned and senseless for two or three minutes , when I revived , and with the assistance of the guide and the man who waits on me , walked up the remaining part of the hill , when , the saddle being readjusted , I mounted again . I was very drowsy and stupid for two or three days , from the influence of the fall , but I am happy to say at present , thanks to the Almighty , I have long ceased to feel any inconvenience from it . On my return to Lisbon I saw Mr. Wilby , who received me with great kindness ; the next ten days were exceedingly rainy and prevented me from making any excursions into the country , and during this time I saw him frequently and had a good deal of conversation with him , concerning the best means of causing God 's glorious Gospel to be read in Portugal . He informed me that four hundred copies of the Bible and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no better than put them into the hands of the booksellers ; but I strongly advised that at least half of them should be entrusted to colporteurs , to hawk about , upon receiving a certain profit on every copy they sold . He thought the idea a good one , as far as regards Lisbon , but said that no colporteur would venture to carry them about the country , as the fanatical priests would probably cause him to be assassinated . He was kind enough to promise to look out for people suited to make the essay in the streets of Lisbon ; and as the lower orders are very poor I wrote to Mr. Whiteley at Oporto , requesting to be informed whether he had any objection to our selling the books to the populace at Lisbon at a lower price than a cruzado novo , which he had determined to sell them at . I thought it but right to consult him on the subject , as the Society are under great obligations to him ; and I was unwilling to do anything at which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Wilby I enquired which was the province of Portugal , the population of which he considered to be the most ignorant and benighted : he replied , ' The Alemtejo . ' The Alemtejo means ' the other side of the Tagus . ' This province is not beautiful and picturesque like the other portions of Portugal , it has few hills or mountains ; the greatest part of it consists of heaths , broken by knolls and gloomy dingles , swamps , and forests of stunted pine . These places are infested with banditti , and not a week passes by without horrible murders and desperate robberies occurring . The principal town is Evora , one of the most ancient cities in Portugal , and formerly the seat of an Inquisition far more cruel and baneful than the terrible one of Lisbon . Evora lies about sixty miles from the farther bank of the Tagus , which is at Lisbon three leagues broad ; and to Evora I determined on going with a small cargo of Testaments and Bibles . My reasons I need not state , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not help thinking that it was the Lord who inspired me with the idea of going thither , as by so doing I have introduced the Scriptures into the worst part of the Peninsula , and have acquired lights and formed connections ( some of the latter most singular ones , I admit ) which if turned to proper account will wonderfully assist us in our object of making the heathen of Portugal and Spain acquainted with God 's holy word . My journey to Evora and my success there shall be detailed in my next letter . G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Feb. 15 , 1836 ) Badajoz , Janry. 8 , 1836. @# JOURNEY TO EVORA An Extract from My Journal @# On the afternoon of the sixth of December I set out for this place , accompanied by my servant Anthonio . I had been informed that the tide would serve for the felouks , or passage-boats , employed in crossing the Tagus , at about four o'clock , but on reaching the river 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ply , I found that the tide would not permit them to start before eight o'clock . Had I waited for them I should probably have landed at Aldea Gallega at midnight , and I felt little inclination to make my entree in the Alemtejo at that hour ; therefore as I saw small boats which can push off at any time lying near in abundance , I determined upon hiring one of them for the passage , though the expense would be thus considerably increased . I soon agreed with a wild-looking lad to take us over , who told me that he was in part owner of one of the boats . I was not aware of the danger in crossing the Tagus at any time in these small boats at its broadest part , which is between Lisbon and Aldea Gallega , but especially at close of day in the winter season , or I should certainly not have ventured . The lad and his comrade , a miserable object , whose only clothing , notwithstanding the severity of the weather , was a battered jerkin and trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the land ; they then hoisted a large sail , and the lad , who seemed to be the principal and to direct everything , took the helm and steered . The evening was now setting in ; the sun was not far from its bourne in the horizon , the air was very cold , the wind was rising , and the waves of the noble Tagus began to be crested with foam . I told the boy that it was scarcely possible for the boat to carry so much sail without upsetting ; upon which he laughed , and began to gabble in a most incoherent manner . He had the most harsh and rapid articulation that has ever come under my observation ; it was the scream of the hyena blended with the bark of the terrier ; but it was by no means an index of his disposition , which I soon found to be light , merry , and anything but malevolent ; for when I , in order to show him that I cared little about him , began to hum : ' Eu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smuggler ' ) , he laughed heartily , and clapping me on the shoulder said that he would not drown us if he could help it . The other poor fellow seemed by no means averse to go to the bottom ; he sat at the forepart of the boat looking the image of famine , and only smiled when the waters broke over the side and drenched his scanty clothing . In a little time I had made up my mind that our last hour was come ; the wind was becoming higher , the short dangerous waves were more foamy , the boat was frequently on its beam-ends , and the water came over the lee side in torrents ; but still the wild lad at the helm held on , laughing and chattering , and occasionally yelling out parts of the Miguelite air ' Quando el Rey chegou ' ' When the King arrived ' , the singing of which in Lisbon is punished with imprisonment . The stream was against us , but the wind was in our favour , and we sprang along at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape was in speedily getting under the shelter of that part of the farther bank of the Tagus , where the bight or bay commences at the extremity of which stands Aldea Gallega , as we should not then have to battle with the waves of the adverse stream , which the wind lashed into fury . It was the will of the Almighty to permit us speedily to gain this shelter , but not before the boat was nearly filled with water , and we were all wet to the skin . At about seven o'clock in the evening we reached Aldea Gallega , shivering with cold and in a most deplorable plight . Aldea Gallega , or the Galician Village , for the two words have that signification , is a place containing , I should think , about four thousand inhabitants . It was pitchy dark when we landed , but rockets soon began to fly about in all directions , illumining the air far and wide . As we passed along the dirty unpaved street which leads to the Largo or square in which the town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ears . On enquiring the cause of all this bustle , I was informed that it was the Eve of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin . As it was not the custom of the people of the inn to provide provisions for the guests , I wandered about in search of food , and at last seeing some soldiers eating and drinking in a sort of wine-house , I went in and asked the people to let me have some supper . In a short time they furnished me with a tolerable meal , for which , however , they charged two crowns . Having engaged with a person for mules to carry us to Evora , which were to be ready at five next morning , I soon retired to bed , my servant sleeping in the same apartment , which was the only one in the house vacant . I closed not an eye during the whole night ; beneath us was a stable in which some almocreves , or carriers , slept with their mules , and at our back in the yard was a hog-stye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mules screamed ; and the almocreves snored most horribly . I heard the village clock strike the hours until midnight , and from midnight till four in the morning , when I sprang up and began to dress , and despatched my servant to hasten the man with his mules , for I was heartily tired of the place , and wished to leave it . An old man , but remarkably bony and hale , accompanied by a bare-footed lad , brought the beasts . He was the proprietor of them , and intended to accompany us to Evora with the lad , who was his nephew . When we started the moon was shining brightly , and the morning was piercingly cold . We soon entered a sandy , hollow way , emerging from which we passed by a large edifice , standing on a high , bleak sand-hill , on our left . We were speedily overtaken by five or six men on horseback , riding at a rapid pace , each with a long gun slung at his saddle , the muzzle depending about two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the cause of their going thus armed ; he answered that the roads were very bad ( meaning that they abounded with robbers ) , and that these people carried arms for their defence . They soon turned off to the right towards Palmella . We reached a sandy plain studded with stunted pine ; the road was little more than a footpath , and as we proceeded the trees thickened and became a wood , which extended for two leagues with clear spaces at intervals , in which herds of cattle and sheep were feeding . The sun was just beginning to show itself , but the morning was misty and dreary , which together with the aspect of desolation which the country exhibited had an unfavourable effect on my spirits . I got down and walked , entering into conversation with the man . He seemed to have but one theme of conversation , ' the robbers ' and the atrocities they were in the habit of practising in the very spots we were passing . The tales he related were truly horrible , and to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In about an hour and a half we emerged from the forest and entered upon wild broken ground covered with mato or brushwood . The mules stopped to drink at a shallow pool , and on looking to the right I saw a ruined wall . This , the guide informed me , was the remains of the Vendal Velhas , or the old inn , formerly the haunt of the celebrated robber Sabocha . This Sabocha , it seems , had , about sixteen years since , a band of forty ruffians at his command , who infested these wilds , and supported themselves by plunder . For a considerable time Sabocha pursued his atrocious trade unsuspected , and many an unfortunate traveller was murdered , in the dead of night , at the solitary inn by the wood 's side , which he kept ; indeed a more fit situation for plunder and murder I never saw . The gang were in the habit of watering their horses at the pool , and perhaps of washing therein their hands stained with the blood of their victims . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow of great strength and ferocity , particularly famous for the skill he possessed in darting a long knife and transfixing his opponents . Sabocha 's connection with the gang at last became known , and he fled with the greatest part of his associates across the Tagus , to the northern provinces . He and his brother eventually lost their lives on the road to Coimbra , in an engagement with the military . His house was razed by order of the Government . The ruins of this house are still frequently visited by banditti , who eat and drink amongst the stones and look out for prey , as the place commands a view of the road . The old man assured me that about two months previous , on returning from Aldea Gallega with his mules from accompanying some travellers , he had been knocked down , stript naked , and had all his money taken from him , by a fellow who , he believed , came from this murderers ' nest . He said that he was an exceedingly powerful young man with immense moustaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musket . About ten days subsequently he saw the robber at Vendas Novas , where we were to pass the night . The fellow on recognising him took him aside and threatened , with horrid imprecations , that he should never be permitted to return home if he attempted to discover him ; he therefore held his peace , as he said there was little to be gained and everything to be lost by apprehending him , as he would have been speedily set at liberty for want of evidence to criminate him , and then he would not have failed to have his revenge , or would have been anticipated therein by his comrades . I dismounted and went up to the place , and saw the vestiges of a fire and a broken bottle . The sons of plunder had been there very lately . I left a New Testament and some tracts amongst the ruins , and hastened away . The sun had dispelled the mists and was beaming very hot ; we rode on for about an hour , when I heard the neighing of a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a party of horsemen behind . Our mules were good , and they did not overtake us for at least twenty minutes . The foremost rider was a gentleman in a fashionable travelling dress ; a little way behind were an officer , two soldiers , and a servant in livery . I heard the principal horseman , on overtaking Anthonio , enquiring who I was , and whether I was French or English . He was told I was an English gentleman , travelling . He then asked whether I understood Portuguese ; the man said I understood it , but that he believed I spoke French and Italian better . The gentleman then spurred on his horse and accosted me , not in Portuguese , or in French , or Italian , but in the purest English that I have ever heard spoken by a foreigner . It had indeed nothing of foreign accent or pronunciation in it , and had I not known by the countenance of the speaker that he was no Englishman ( for there is a peculiarity in the English countenance which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Englishman ) , I should have concluded that I was conversing with a countryman . He continued in company and discourse until we arrived at Pegoens . Pegoens consists of about two or three houses and an inn ; there is likewise a species of barrack , where half a dozen soldiers are stationed . In the whole of Portugal there is no place of worse reputation , and the inn is nicknamed Estalagem de Ladroens , or the hostelry of thieves ; for it is there that the banditti of the wilderness , which extends around it on every side for leagues , are in the habit of coming and spending the fruits of their criminal daring ; there they dance and sing , feast on fricasseed rabbits and olives , and drink the muddy but strong wine of the Alemtejo . An enormous fire , fed by the trunk of a cork-tree , was blazing in a niche on the left hand on entering the spacious kitchen ; by it , seething , were several large jars , which emitted no disagreeable odour , and reminded me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now nearly one o'clock and I had ridden five leagues . Some wild-looking men , who , if they were not banditti , might easily be mistaken for such , were seated on logs about the fire ; I asked them some unimportant question , to which they replied with readiness and civility , and one of them , who said he could read , accepted a tract which I offered him . My new friend , who had been bespeaking dinner , or rather breakfast , now with great civility invited me to partake of it , and at the same time introduced me to the officer who accompanied him , and who was his brother , and also spoke English , though not so well as himself . I found I had become acquainted with Don Geronimo Joze d'Azveto , Secretary to the Government at Evora . His brother belonged to a regiment of hussars , whose headquarters were at Evora , but which had outlying parties along the road ; for example , at the place where we were stopping . Rabbits at Pegoens seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the moors around . We had one fricasseed , the gravy of which was delicious ; and afterwards a roasted one , which was brought up on a dish entire . The hostess having first washed her hands proceeded to tear the animal to pieces , which having accomplished she poured over the fragments a sweet sauce . I ate remarkably heartily of both dishes , particularly of the last , owing perhaps to the novel and curious manner in which it was served up . Excellent figs from the Algarves and apples completed our repast , which we ate in a little side room with a mud-floor , which sent such a piercing chill into my system as prevented me from deriving that pleasure from my good fare and agreeable companions which I might otherwise have experienced . Don Joze d'Azveto had been educated in England , in which country he passed his boyhood , which to a certain degree accounted for his proficiency in the English language , the idioms and pronunciation of which can only be acquired by a residence in the country at that period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the usurpation of the throne of Portugal by Don Miguel , and from thence had passed over to the Brazils , where he had devoted himself to the service of Don Pedro , and had followed him in that expedition which terminated in the downfall of the Usurper and the establishment of the constitutional government in Portugal . Our conversation rolled chiefly on literary and political subjects , and my acquaintance with the writings of the most celebrated authors of Portugal was hailed with surprise and delight ; for nothing is more gratifying to a well-educated Portuguese than to observe a foreigner taking an interest in the literature of his nation , of which he is so justly proud . About two o'clock we were once more in the saddle , and pursued our way through a country exactly resembling that which we had previously been traversing , rugged and broken , with here and there a clump of pines . The afternoon was exceedingly fine , and the bright rays of the sun relieved the desolation of the scene . Having advanced about two leagues , I caught sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnt was a royal palace , standing at the farther extremity of Vendas Novas , the village where we were to halt . It was considerably more than a league from us , yet , seen through the clear transparent atmosphere of Portugal , it appeared much nearer . Before reaching it , we passed by a stone cross , on the pedestal of which was an inscription commemorating a horrible murder of a native of Lisbon , which had been perpetrated on that spot . It looked ancient , and was covered with moss , and the greatest part of the inscription was illegible , at least it was to me , who could not bestow much time on the deciphering of it . Having arrived at Vendas Novas and bespoke supper , my new friends and myself strolled forth to view the palace . It was built by the late King of Portugal , and presents little that is remarkable in its exterior . It is a long edifice with wings , and is only two stories high , though it can be seen afar , owing to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper and twelve in the lower story , with a paltry-looking door something like that of a barn , the ascent to which is by a single step . The interior corresponds with the exterior , offering nothing which can gratify curiosity , if we except the kitchens , which are indeed magnificent , and so large that food enough might be prepared in them to serve as a repast to all the inhabitants of the Alemtejo . I passed the night with great comfort in a clean bed , remote from all those noises in general so rife in a Portuguese inn , and the next morning at six we again set out on our journey , which we hoped to terminate before sunset , as Evora is but ten leagues from Vendas Novas . The preceding morning had been cold , but the present one was far more , so much so that just before sunrise I could no longer support it whilst riding , and therefore dismounting ran and walked until we reached a few houses , at the termination of these desolate moors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Pedro and Miguel met , and it was there agreed that the latter should resign the crown in favour of Donna Maria ; for Evora was the last stronghold of the Usurper , and the moors of the Alemtejo the last area of the combats which so long agitated unhappy Portugal . I therefore gazed on the miserable huts with considerable interest , and did not fail to scatter in the neighbourhood several of the precious little tracts with which , together with a small quantity of Bibles , my carpet-bag was provided . The country began to improve , the savage heaths were left behind , and we saw hills and dales , cork-trees and azineirias , on the last of which trees grows that kind of sweet acorn called bolota , which is pleasant as a chestnut , and forms in winter the principal food on which the numerous swine of the Alemtejo subsist . Gallant swine they are , with short legs and portly bodies , of a black or dark-red colour , and for the excellence of their flesh I can avouch , having frequently partaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . The lumbo , or loin , when broiled on the live embers , is delicious , especially when eaten with olives . We were now in sight of Monte Moro , which as the name denotes was once a fortress of the Moors ; it is a high , steep hill , on the summit and sides of which are ruined walls and towers . At its western side is a deep ravine or valley , through which a small stream rushes , traversed by a stone bridge ; farther down there is a ford , through which we passed and ascended to the town , which commencing near the northern base , passes over the lower ridge towards the north-east ; the town is exceedingly picturesque , and many of the houses are very ancient and built in the Moorish fashion . I wished much to examine the relics of Moorish sway on the upper part of the mountain , but time pressed , and the shortness of our stay in this place did not permit me to gratify my inclination . Monte Moro is the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from hence they fork towards the east and south-east , in the former of which directions lies the direct road to Elvas , Badajoz , and Madrid , and in the latter the road to Evora . A beautiful mountain , covered to the top with cork trees , is the third in the chain which skirts the way in the direction of Evora . It is called Monte Almo ; a brook brawls at its base , and as I passed it the sun was shining gloriously on the green herbage , on which flocks of goats were feeding with their bells ringing merrily , so that the tout ensemble resembled a fairy scene ; and that nothing might be wanted to complete the picture , I here met a man , a goat-herd , beneath an azineiria whose appearance recalled to my mind the Brute-man mentioned in an ancient Danish poem : ' A wild swine on his shoulders he kept , And upon his bosom a black bear slept , And about his fingers with hair o'erhung The squirrel sported and weasel clung . ' Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me was a lontra or otter , which he had lately caught in the neighbouring brook , it had a string round its neck which was attached to his arm ; at his left side was a bag from the top of which peeped the heads of two or three singular-looking animals ; and beside him was squatted the sullen cub of a wolf , which he was endeavouring to tame . His whole appearance was to the last degree savage and wild . After a little conversation , such as those who meet on the road frequently hold , I asked him if he could read ; but he made no answer . I then enquired if he knew anything of God or Jesus Christ ; he looked me fixedly in the face for a moment , and then turned his countenance towards the sun which was beginning to sink , nodded to it , and then again looked fixedly upon me . I believed I understood this mute reply , which probably was , that it was God who made that glorious light which illumines and gladdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and hastened after my companions who were , by this time , a considerable way in advance . I have always found amongst the children of the fields a more determined tendency to religion and piety than amongst the inhabitants of towns and cities , and the reason is obvious ; they are less acquainted with the works of man 's hands than with those of God ; their occupations are simple , and requiring less of ingenuity and skill than those which engage the intention of the other portion of their fellow-creatures , are less favourable to the engendering of self-conceit and sufficiency , so utterly at variance with that lowliness of spirit which constitutes the best test of piety . The sneerers and scoffers at religion do not spring from amongst the simple children of nature , but are the excrescences of overwrought refinement , and though their baneful influence has indeed penetrated to the country and corrupted many there , the fountain-head was amongst crowded houses where nature is scarcely known . I am not one of those who look for perfection amongst the rural population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the children of the fall , be their abode where it may ; but until the heart disbelieve the existence of a God , there is still hope for the possessor , however stained with crime he may be , for even Simon the Magician was converted . But when the heart is once steeled with infidelity , infidelity confirmed by carnal reasoning , an exuberance of the grace of God is required to melt it , which is seldom or never manifested ; for we read in the blessed book that the Pharisee and the Wizard became receptacles of grace , but where is mention made of the conversion of the sneering Sadducee ? and is the modern infidel aught but a Sadducee of later date ? To be continued . @# @# To the Rev. Andrew Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Feb. 29th , 1836 ) Journal continued BADAJOZ , 10th January 1836 . The night had closed in before we reached Evora , and having taken leave of my friends , who kindly requested me to consider their house my home , myself and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where was a hostelry , which the muleteer informed me was the best in the town . We rode into the kitchen , at the extreme end of which was the stable , as is customary in Portugal . The house was kept by an aged gypsy-like female and her daughter , a fine blooming girl about eighteen years of age . The house was large ; in the upper story was a very long room , like a granary , extending nearly the whole length of the house ; the further end was partitioned off , and formed a tolerably comfortable chamber , but rather cold , the floor being of tiles , as was that of the large room in which the muleteers were accustomed to sleep on the furniture of their mules . Having supped I went to bed , and after having offered up my devotions to Him who had protected me through a dangerous journey , I slept soundly till the morning . Evora is a walled town , but not regularly fortified , and could not sustain a siege of a day . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal promenade of the inhabitants ; the fair on St. John 's Day is likewise held there . The houses are mostly very ancient ; many of them are unoccupied . It contains about five thousand inhabitants , though twice that number would be by no means disproportionate to its size . The two principal edifices are the See or Bishop 's Palace , and the Convent of San Francisco , opposite to which I had taken up my abode . A large barrack for cavalry stands on the right-hand side on entering the south-west gate . The adjacent country is uninteresting ; but to the south-east , at the distance of six leagues , is to be seen a range of blue hills , the highest of which is called Serra Dorso . It is picturesquely beautiful , and contains within its recesses wolves and wild boars in numbers . About a league and a half on the other side of this hill is Estremoz . I passed the day succeeding my arrival principally in examining the town and its environs , and as I strolled about I entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were of the middle classes , shopkeepers and professional men ; they were all Constitutionalists , or pretended to be so , but had very little to say , except a few commonplace remarks on the way of living of the friars , their hypocrisy and laziness . I endeavoured to obtain some information respecting the state of instruction at Evora , and from their replies was led to believe that it must be very low , for it seemed that there was neither book-shop nor school in the place . When I spoke of religion , they exhibited the utmost apathy , and making their bows left me as soon as possible . Having a letter of introduction to a person who kept a shop in the market-place , I called upon him , found him behind his counter and delivered it to him . I found that he had been persecuted much whilst the old system was in its vigour , and that he entertained a hearty aversion to it . I told him that the nurse of that system had been the ignorance of the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its return was to enlighten them in those points . I added that I had brought with me to Evora a small stock of Testaments and Bibles , which I wished to leave for sale in the hands of some respectable merchant , and that if he were desirous to lay the axe to the root of superstition and tyranny he could not do so more effectually than by undertaking the charge of these books . He declared his willingness to do so , and that same evening I sent him ten Testaments and a Bible , being half my stock . I returned to the hostelry , and sat down on a log of wood on the hearth within the immense chimney in the common apartment . Two men were on their knees on the stones ; before them was a large heap of pieces of iron , brass , and copper ; they were assorting it and stowing it away in various large bags . They were Spanish contrabandistas , or smugglers of the lowest class , and earned a miserable livelihood by smuggling such rubbish from Portugal into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I addressed them in their native language they returned no answer but a kind of growl . They looked as dirty and rusty as the iron in which they trafficked . The woman of the house and her daughter were exceedingly civil , and coming near to me crouched down , asking various questions about England . A man dressed something like an English sailor , who sat on the other side of the hearth , confronting me , said : ' I hate the English , for they are not baptized , and have not the law ' ( meaning the law of God ) . I laughed , and told him , that according to the law of England no one who was not baptized could be buried in consecrated ground ; whereupon he said ; ' Then you are stricter than we . ' He then asked : ' What is meant by the lion and the unicorn which I saw the other day on the coat of arms over the door of the English consul at St. Uves ? ' I said that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied ; ' but what do they represent ? ' I said I did not know . ' Then , ' said he , ' you do not know the story of your own house . ' I answered : ' Suppose I were to tell you that they represented the lion of Belem ( Bethlehem ) and the horned monster of the flaming pit in combat as to which should obtain the mastery in England , what would you say ? ' He replied : ' I should say that you gave a fair answer . ' This man and myself became great friends ; he came from Palmella , not far from St. Uves ; he had several mules and horses with him , and dealt in corn and barley . I again walked out in the environs of the town . About half a mile from the southern wall is a stone fountain , where the muleteers and other people approaching the town are accustomed to water their cattle . I sat down by it , and there I remained about two hours , entering into discourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will here observe that during the time of my sojourn at Evora I repeated my visit every day , and remained there about the same time , and by following this plan I believe that I spoke to near two hundred of the children of Portugal upon matters connected with their eternal welfare . Of those whom I addressed I found very few had received any species of literary education ; none of them had seen the Bible , and not more than half a dozen had the slightest knowledge of what the Holy Book consisted . I found that most of them were bigoted Romanists and Miguelites at heart . When they told me they were Christians , I denied the possibility of their being so , as they were ignorant of Christ and His commandments , and rested their hope of salvation in outward forms and superstitious observances which were the inventions of Satan , who wished to keep them in darkness in order that at last they might stumble into the pit which he had digged for them . I said repeatedly that the Pope whom they revered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth , and that the monks and friars , to whom they had been accustomed to confess themselves , and whose absence they so deplored , were his subordinate agents . When called upon for proofs , I invariably cited the ignorance of my hearers respecting the Scripture , and said that if their spiritual guides had been really ministers of Christ they would not have permitted their flocks to remain unacquainted with His word . Since this occasion I have been frequently surprised that I received no insult or ill-treatment from the people whose superstitions I was thus attacking , but I really experienced none ; and am inclined to believe that the utter fearlessness which I displayed , trusting in the protection of the Almighty , may have been the cause . When threatened by danger the best policy is to fix your eye steadily upon it , and it will in general vanish like the morning mist before the sun ; whereas if you quail before it , it becomes more imminent . I have fervent hope that the words which I uttered sunk deep into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them depart musing and pensive . I occasionally distributed tracts among them , for although they themselves were unable to turn them to much account , I thought that by their means they might become of service at some future time , and might fall into the hands of others to whom they might be instruments of regeneration ; as many a book which is cast on the waters is wafted to some remote shore , and there proves a blessing and a comfort to millions who are ignorant from whence it came . The next day , which was Friday , I called at the house of my friend Azveto ; I did not find him there , but was directed to the Episcopal Palace , in an apartment of which I found him writing with another gentleman , to whom he introduced me . It was the Governor of Evora , who welcomed me with every mark of kindness and affability . After some discourse we went out together to examine an ancient edifice , which was reported to have served in ancient times as a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture , for there was no mistaking the beautiful light pillars which supported a dome , under which the sacrifices to the most captivating and poetical divinity of the heathen Theocracy had probably been made ; but the original space between the pillars had been filled up with rubbish of a modern date , and the rest of the building was apparently of the architecture of the latter end of the middle ages . It is situated at one end of the building which was once the seat of the Inquisition , and I was informed that before the erection of the present See , it served as the residence of the Bishop . Within the See , where the Governor now resides , is a superb library , occupying an immense vaulted room , like the aisle of a cathedral , and in a side apartment is a collection of pictures by Portuguese artists , chiefly portraits , amongst which is that of Don Sebastian . I hope it did not do him justice ; for it represents him in the shape of an awkward lad , of about eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wearing a ruff round a short apoplectic neck . I was shown several beautifully illuminated missals and other manuscripts , but the one which most arrested my attention , I scarcely need say why , bore the following title :  --  Forma sive ordinatio Capelli illustrissimi et xtianissimi principis Henrici sexti Regis Anglie et Francie am diu Hibernie descipta serenissio principi Alfonso Regi Portugalie illustri per humilem servitorem sm Willm Sav Decanum capelli supradicti . It seemed a voice from the olden times of my dear native land . This library and picture-gallery had been formed by one of the latter Bishops , a person of commendable learning and piety . In the evening I dined with Don Joze d'Azveto and his brother ; the latter soon left us , in order to attend to his military duties . My friend and myself had then much conversation of considerable interest . He lamented feelingly the deplorable state of ignorance in which his countrymen were at present buried , and said that his friend the Governor and himself were endeavouring to establish a school in the vicinity , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty convent called the Espinhero , or thorn-tree , at about a league 's distance , and that they had little doubt of their request being complied with . I had before told him who I was ; and now , after expressing my joy at the plan which he had in contemplation , I urged him in the most pressing manner to use all his influence to cause the knowledge of the Scripture to be the basis of the education of the pupils in the intended school , and added that half of the Testaments and Bibles which I had brought with me to Evora were heartily at his service . He instantly gave me his hand , and said he accepted my offer with the greatest pleasure , and would do all in his power to further my views , which were in many respects his own . I now told him that I did not come to Portugal with the view of introducing the dogmas of any particular sect , but with the hope of introducing the Bible , which is the well-head of all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that I cared not what people called themselves , provided they read the Scripture , for that where the Scripture was read neither priestcraft nor tyranny could long exist ; and instanced my own country , the cause of whose freedom and happiness was the Bible , and that only , for that before the days of Tyndal it was the seat of ignorance , oppression , and cruelty , and that after the fall of ignorance , the oppression and cruelty soon ceased , for that the last persecutor of the Bible , the last upholder of ignorance  --  the bloody and infamous Mary  --  was the last tyrant who had sat on the throne of England . We did not part till the night was considerably advanced ; and the next day I sent him the books , in the steadfast hope that a bright and glorious morning was about to rise upon the night which had so long cast its dreary shadow over the regions of the Alemtejo . The day after this interesting event , which was Saturday , I had more conversation with the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never been attacked by robbers ; he answered ' No , ' for that he generally travelled in company with others ; ' however , ' said he , ' were I alone I should have little fear , for I am well protected . ' I said that I supposed he carried arms with him . ' No other arms than this , ' said he , and he pulled out a long , desperate-looking knife of English manufacture , like that with which every Portuguese peasant is provided , and which I should consider a far more efficient weapon than a dagger . ' But , ' said he , ' I do not place much confidence in the knife . ' I then enquired in what were his hopes of protection . ' In this , ' he replied ; and unbuttoning his waistcoat he showed me a small bag , attached to his neck by a silken string . ' In this bag is an oracam ( or prayer ) , written by a person of power ; and as long as I carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the leading features of my character , and I instantly said that to be allowed to read the prayer would give me great pleasure . ' Well , ' he replied , ' you are my friend , and I would do for you what I would do for few others . I will show it you . ' He then asked me for my penknife and proceeded to unrip the bag , and took out of it a large piece of paper closely folded up . I hurried with it to my chamber , and commenced the examination of it . It was scrawled over in a very illegible hand , and was moreover much stained with perspiration , so that I had considerable difficulty in making myself master of its contents ; but at last I accomplished the following literal translation of the charm , which was written in bad Portuguese , but which struck me at the time as being the most remarkable composition I had ever seen . @# The Charm @# ' Just Judge and divine Son of the Virgin Maria , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wast crucified in the midst of all Jewry ! I beseech Thee , O Lord , by virtue of Thy sixth day 137 that the body of me , Francisco , be not caught nor put to death by the hands of Justice ! Pazes teco ( pax tecum ) , pazes Cristo . May you receive peace , said Christ to His disciples . If the accursed Justice should distrust me , or have its eye on me , in order to take me , or to rob me , may it have an eye which shall not see me ; may it have a mouth which shall not speak to me ; may it have an ear which shall not hear me ; may it have a hand which shall not seize me ; may it have a foot which shall not overtake me ; for may I be armed with the arms of Saint George ; may I be covered with the cloak of Abraham ; and embarked in the ark of Noah ; so that it can neither see me , nor hear me , nor draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O Lord , by those three blessed crosses  --  by those three blessed chalices  --  by those three blessed clergymen  --  by those three consecrated hosts , that Thou give me that sweet company which Thou gavest the Virgin Maria , from the gates of Bethlehem even unto the portals of Jerusalem , that I may go and come with peace and joy with Jesus Christ , Son of the Virgin Maria , the prolific , yet nevertheless the eternal Virgin Maria our Lady . ' The woman of the house and her daughter had similar bags tied to their necks , containing charms , which they said prevented the witches having power to harm them . The belief in witchcraft is very prevalent amongst the peasantry of the Alemtejo , and I believe of other provinces of Portugal . This is one of the relics of the monkish system , the aim of which in all countries where it has existed , or does exist , seems to be to besot the minds of the people that they may be the more easily plundered and misled . The monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of ware , which they know to be poison , but which , as it brings them a price and fosters delusion by which they are maintained in luxury and idleness , they would rather vend than the wholesome drug . The Sunday morning was fine , and the plain before the church of the Convent of San Francisco was thronged with people going to mass or returning . After having performed my morning devotions and breakfasted , I went down to the kitchen . The fine girl Geronima was seated by the fire . I asked if she had heard mass ; she replied , ' No , ' and that she did not intend to hear it . Upon my inquiring her motive for absenting herself , she replied that , since the friars had been expelled from their churches and convents , she had ceased to attend mass or to confess herself , for that the Government priests had no spiritual power , and consequently she never troubled them . She said the friars were holy men and charitable ; for that every morning those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of their meals of the preceding day , but that now these people were allowed to starve . I replied that the friars who had lived upon the dainties of the land could well afford to bestow a few bones on the poor , and that their doing so was not the effect of charity , but merely a part of their artful policy , by which they hoped to secure to themselves friends in time of need . The girl then said that as it was Sunday I should perhaps like to see some of her books , and without waiting for a reply she produced them . They consisted principally of popular stories and lives and miracles of saints , but amongst them was a translation of Volney 's Ruins of Empires . I inquired how she became possessed of this book ; she said that a young man , a great Constitutionalist , had given it her some months since and had pressed her much to read it , telling her that it was the best book in the world . Whereupon I told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Satan and an enemy of Jesus Christ and the souls of mankind ; that he had written it with the sole view of bringing all religion into contempt , and that he had inculcated therein the doctrine that there was no future state nor rewards for the righteous nor punishments for the wicked . She made no reply , but going into another room , returned with her apron full of dry brushwood and faggot ; all of this she piled upon the fire , and produced a bright blaze . She then took the book from my hand , and placed it upon the flaming pile ; then sitting down , took her rosary out of her pocket , and told her beads till the volume was consumed . This was an Auto-da-fe , in the true sense of the word . On the Monday and Tuesday I paid my usual visits to the fountain , and likewise rode about the neighbourhood for the purpose of circulating tracts . I dropped a great many in the favourite walks of the people of Evora , as I felt rather dubious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands ; whereas if they found them on the ground , I thought that curiosity might induce them to pick them up and examine them . I likewise on the Tuesday evening paid a farewell visit to my friend Don Azveto , as it was my intention to leave Evora on the Thursday following ; in which view I had engaged a cabriolet of a man who informed me that he had served as a soldier in the Grande Armee of Napoleon , and had been present throughout the Russian campaign . He looked the image of a drunkard ; his face was covered with carbuncles , and his breath impregnated with the fumes of strong waters . He wished much to converse with me in French , in the speaking of which language , it seems , he prided himself much ; but I refused , and told him to speak the language of the country , or I would hold no discourse with him . Wednesday was stormy , with occasional rain . On coming down I found that my friend from Palmella had departed , but several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows , and , unlike the two I had seen the previous week , who were of much lower degree , were chatty and communicative ; they spoke their native language and no other , and seemed to hold Portuguese in great contempt ; their magnificent Spanish tones were heard to great advantage amidst the shrill chirping dialect of Portugal . I was soon in deep conversation with them , and was much pleased to find that all of them could read . I presented the eldest of them , a man of about fifty years of age , with a tract in Spanish . He examined it for some time with great attention ; he then rose from his seat , and going into the middle of the apartment , began reading it aloud , slowly and emphatically ; his companions gathered round him , and every now and then expressed their satisfaction at what they heard . The reader occasionally called upon me to explain particular passages which , as they referred to Scripture , he did not exactly understand , for not one of the party had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading for nearly an hour until he had finished the tract , and at its conclusion the whole party were clamorous for similar ones , with which I was happy to be able to supply them . Most of them spoke of priestcraft and the monks with the utmost abhorrence , and said that they should prefer death to again submitting to the yoke which had formerly galled their necks . I questioned them very particularly respecting the opinion of their neighbours and acquaintances on this point , and they assured me that in their part of the Spanish frontier all were of the same mind , and that they cared as little for the Pope and his monks as they did for Don Carlos , for the latter was a dwarf ( chicotito ) and a tyrant , and the others were plunderers and robbers . I told them that they must beware of confounding religion with priestcraft , and that in their abhorrence of the latter they must not forget that there is a God and a Christ , to whom they must look for salvation , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion ; whereupon they all expressed a devout belief in Christ and the Virgin . These men , though in many respects far more enlightened than the surrounding peasantry , were in others quite as much in the dark ; they believed in witchcraft and in the efficacy of particular charms . The night was very stormy , and about nine we heard a galloping towards the door , and then a loud knocking ; it was opened , and in rushed a wild-looking man mounted upon a donkey . He wore a jerkin of sheepskin , called in Spanish zamarras , with breeches of the same as far down as his knee ; his legs were bare . Around his sombrero , or shadowy hat , was tied a large quantity of the herb called in English rosemary , in Spanish romero , and in the rustic language of Portugal ellecrin , which last is a word of Scandinavian origin , and properly signifies the elfin plant . It was probably carried into the south by the Vandals or the Alani . The man seemed frantic with terror , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering over his head , for the last two leagues . He came from the Spanish frontier with meal and other articles ; he informed us that his wife was following him and would soon arrive , and within a quarter of an hour she made her appearance , dripping with rain , and also mounted upon a donkey . I asked my friends the contrabandistas why he wore the rosemary in his hat , and they told me that it was good against witches and the mischances of the road . I had no time to argue against this superstition , for as the chaise was to be ready at five o'clock next morning I wished to make the most of the few hours which I could devote to rest . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Feb. 15 , 1836 ) The following Translations into the Romanee , or language of the Spanish Tchai , Tchabos , Gitanos , Callos , or Gypsies , were made by me at Badajoz during the first two weeks of January 1836 .

Feb. 29th , 1836 ) MADRID , CALLE DE LA ZARZA , Feby. 13th , 1836 . The game is now in our own hands , and it is our fault if we do not win it , for a little patience and a little prudence is all that is required . I came to Madrid without a single letter of introduction , and without knowing an individual there . I have now some powerful friends , and through the kindness of Sir Geo . Villiers , the British Ambassador at the Spanish Court , I have had an interview with that most singular man , Mendizabal , whom it is as difficult to get nigh as it is to approach the North Pole . I have obtained his promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , he will allow us to commence our operations ; but the preposterous idea , which by some means or other he has embraced , that we have been endeavouring to foment disturbances amongst the slaves of Cuba , prevents his looking upon us with favourable eyes . I now write for orders ; if you have received my letters and journals ( copious extracts from which you had better print ) , you will see how successful I have been in the Alemtejo , as our books are now for sale at Evora and Elvas , the two principal towns , and the Gospel of Christ has been preached to many who were ignorant of it even by name ; you will see what I have been doing at Badajoz , especially amongst the Spanish Gypsies , whose dialect of the Rommany I have so far mastered as to be able to translate into it with tolerable ease . Now , until my friends here and myself can claim the fulfilment of Mr. Mendizabal 's promise , do you wish me to go to Granada , or back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rommany , with the assistance of the Gypsies of those places , who are far more conversant with their native language than their brethren in other parts of Spain ; or shall I return to Lisbon and exert all my interest towards the execution of the plan which I communicated first to Mr. Wilby , and then to yourself , namely , attempting to induce the Government to adopt the Scriptures in the schools which they are about to establish ? Since I have been at Madrid I have obtained letters to individuals of great importance at Lisbon , and I know that Don Jose d'Azveto will do anything to serve me within the limits of reason . Therefore let the Committee be summoned , and a resolution forthwith adopted as to my next course . I think all our negotiations in the Peninsula may be brought to a successful termination in a few months ; then you must send over an agent , a plain man of business , to engage colporteurs and to come to arrangements with booksellers , both in Spain and in the provincial towns of Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of needless doubts and difficulties ; anything may be accomplished with a little shrewdness , a little boldness , and a great trust in God . I hope that my exertions have afforded satisfaction at home , but if not , let me be allowed to state that it was not in my power to accomplish more than I have . I have borne hunger and thirst , cold and fatigue , I have exposed myself to danger from robbers , and was near losing my life from the ruffian soldiery at Arrayolos , whose bullets so narrowly missed me . I have been as economical as possible , though the charges in Portugal for everything are enormous , and a stranger there is like a ship on shore , a mark for plunder . In Spain the people are far more honest , and the charges , though high , reasonable in comparison . Before leaving Lisbon I drew on excellent Mr. Wilby for 75 pounds ; of this sum 12 pounds was remitted to Malaja , through which place I shall probably pass on my return to Lisbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , I therefore need not enter into a detail of my expenses . I now wait for a letter from you ; and when you write , please to remit to me a small letter of credit on some one at Madrid , or request Mr. Wilby to do so , as he has correspondents here , and in that case communicate my address to him . I give you below an abridgment of my interview with Mr. Mendizabal . I think it will make you laugh . I have the honour to remain , Revd. and dear Sir , etc. , G. BORROW . @# Interview with Mr. Mendizabal @# At about 8 o'clock in the morning of the 7th inst . I went to the palace , where Mr. Mendizabal resides . I informed the usher that I came from the British Ambassador , whereupon I was shown into a room , and after waiting about three hours I was admitted to the presence of the Prime Minister of Spain . He was dressed in a morning gown and sat behind a table covered with papers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle height , with very handsome features , aquiline nose and large sparkling eyes ; his hair is partly grey . I presented him the letter with which Sir Geo . Villiers had furnished me , and when he had read it , I said that before entering upon the matter which more immediately brought me to him , I begged leave to set him right upon a point relating to which he was labouring under considerable error : Sir Geo . Villiers had informed me that Mr. M. entertained an opinion that the Bible Society had been endeavouring to exercise an undue influence over the minds of the slave population of Cuba by means of their agents ; but that I could assure him with truth , that neither directly nor indirectly had they exerted or attempted to exert any influence at all over any part of the inhabitants of that island , as they had neither sent agents there , nor held any communication with the residents . While I was saying this , he interrupted me several times , insisting that it was so , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was probable he confounded the Bible Society with some other institution for the propagation of religion , perhaps with one of the missionary societies , more especially one of those belonging to the United States , which might have sent individuals to the island in question for the purpose of communicating religious instruction to the slaves  --  but all I could say was to no avail ; he would have it that it was the British Bible Society who had despatched missionaries to Cuba to incite the blacks to rise up against their masters . The absurdity of this idea struck me so forcibly that it was with difficulty I restrained myself from laughing outright . I at last said that , whatever he might think to the contrary , the Committee of the Bible Society were by no means of that turbulent and outrageous disposition ; that they were for the most part staid , quiet gentlemen , who attended to their own affairs , and a little , and but a little to the promulgation of Christ 's Gospel , which , however , they too much respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they all know full well that it is the Word of God says that servants are to obey their masters at all times and occasions . I then requested permission to print the New Testament in Spanish at Madrid . He said he should not grant it , for that the New Testament was a very dangerous book , especially in disturbed times . I replied that I was not aware that the holy book contained any passages sanctioning blood-shedding and violence , but I rather thought that it abounded with precepts of an entirely opposite tendency ; but he still persisted that it was an improper book . I must here observe that it was with the utmost difficulty I obtained an opportunity of explaining myself , on account of the propensity which he possesses of breaking in upon the discourse of the person who is addressing him ; and at last , in self-defence , I was myself obliged to infringe the rules of conversation , and to hold on without paying any attention to his remarks  --  not that I gained much by so doing , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he never abandoned his opinions . I certainly do not think him the most tractable of men , but I am inclined to think that he is not ill-natured , as he preserved his temper very well during the interview , and laughed heartily at two or three of my remarks . At last he said : ' I will not give you permission now : but let the war be concluded , let the factious be beaten , and the case will be altered ; come to me six months hence . ' I then requested to be allowed to introduce into Spain a few copies of the New Testament in the Catalan dialect , as we had lately printed a most beautiful edition at London , but he still said ' No , no , ' and when I asked if he had any objection to my calling again on the morrow and showing him a copy , he made use of these remarkable words : ' I do not wish you should come , lest you should convince me , and I do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I received your letter of the 8th inst. , which gave me much pleasure , as I understood from it that my humble efforts had afforded satisfaction . I also received the two letters from St. Petersburg which were written by a dear friend of that place , to whom I shall trouble you to forward a letter as soon as I have an opportunity of writing , which at present I have not , as my time is much occupied . I have to communicate to you what will not fail to be interesting . The Spanish press have taken up our affair , and I am at present engaged in attempting to lay the foundation of a Bible Society at Madrid , to accomplish which the editor of the influential newspaper , the Espanol , has promised me his assistance . There has already appeared in that journal a most brilliant article which gives the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Spain from the establishment within its bosom of a society whose aim should be the propagation of the Scripture , in the Spanish language , amongst the population . Of this article I send extracts below , and shall probably , when I have more time , send the whole . The person whom we are looking forward to as a head of the projected institution is a certain Bishop , advanced in years , a person of great piety and learning , who has himself translated the New Testament in a manner , as I am informed , far superior to that of any of his predecessors ; but I have not as yet seen it , and therefore can not speak positively as to its merits . However , he is disposed to print and circulate it , and if the translation be really an excellent one it would not be unwise in us to patronise it , if by so doing we could induce him to co-operate with us in our plans for enlightening unhappy Spain . But more of this anon . I have little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God will triumph in this country , and I am exerting every means which I can devise in humbleness of heart to help to bring about an event so desirable . I intend to remain a few weeks longer at Madrid at all events , for the present moment is too fraught with interest to allow me to quit it immediately . As far as self is concerned I should rejoice to return instantly to Lisbon , for I am not partial to Madrid , its climate , or anything it can offer , if I except its unequalled gallery of pictures ; but I did not come hither to gratify self but as a messenger of the Word . May I take the liberty of begging you to write a line to my dear and revered friend Mr. Cunningham , informing him that I am in tolerable health , and that I hope to write myself speedily . The three letters which you say have not arrived were , I believe , destroyed by a servant for the sake of the postage , but I shall send you parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ' Espanol ' @# ' The first founders of the Bible Societies ( for by this name they were known ) immediately comprehended their philosophic and civilising mission , and fulfilled the thought of its inventor . In a short period the circle of their action expanded itself , and not content with making Great Britain alone a participator of this salutary institution , they wished to extend it to all countries , and therefore called to their assistance the majority of the known languages . To all the quarters of the inhabited world they sent at their own expense agents to traverse the countries and discover the best means of disseminating the truths of the Bible , and to discover manuscripts of the ancient versions . They did more : convinced of the necessity of placing themselves above the miserable considerations of sectarian spirit , they determined that the text should not be accompanied by any species of note or commentary which might provoke the discord which unhappily reigns among the different fractions of Christianity , which separates more and more their views instead of guiding them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of the Nazarene might be studied with equal success by the Greek schismatic and the Catholic Spaniard , by the sectary of Calvin and the disciple of Luther : its seed might bless at one and the same time the fruitful plains of Asia and the sterile sands of desert Arabia , the burning soil of India and the icy land of the ferocious Esquimaux . Antiquity knew no speedier means of conveying its ideas than the harangues which the orators pronounced from the summit of the tribune , amidst assemblies of thousands of citizens ; but modern intelligence wished to discover other means infinitely more efficacious , more active , more rapid , more universal , and has invented the press . Thus it was that in the preceding ages the warm and animated words of the missionary were necessarily the only organ which Christianity had at command to proclaim its principles ; but scarcely did this invention come to second the progress of modern civilisation , than it foresaw the future ally destined to complete the intelligent and social labour which it had taken upon itself . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. B. Society , and how many others have sprung up under her auspices in different lands , the article continues : ) ' Why should Spain which has explored the New World , which has generalised inoculation in order to oppose the devastations of a horrid pest , which has always distinguished herself by zeal in labouring in the cause of humanity  --  why should she alone be destitute of Bible Societies ? Why should a nation eminently Catholic continue isolated from the rest of Europe , without joining in the magnificent enterprise in which the latter is so busily engaged ? ' GEORGE BORROW .

Though I hope that I shall be able to communicate matter which will afford yourself and our friends at home subject for some congratulation , my more immediate object is to inform you of my situation , of which I am sure you have not the slightest conception . For the last three weeks I have been without money , literally without a farthing . About a month ago I received fifteen pounds from Mr. Wilby , and returned him an order for twenty , he having , when I left Lisbon , lent me five pounds , on account , above what I drew for , as he was apprehensive of my being short of money before I reached Madrid . 12 pounds , 5s. of this I instantly expended for a suit of clothes , 153 my own being so worn , that it was impossible to appear longer in public with them . At the time of sending him the receipt I informed him that I was in need of money , and begged that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never heard from him from that moment , though I have written twice . Perhaps he never received my letters , or I may not have received his , the post of Estremadura having been three times robbed ; I can imagine no other reason . The money may still come , but I have given up all hopes of it , and am compelled to write home , though what I am to do till I can receive your answer I am at a loss to conceive . But God is above all , and I am far from complaining ; but you would oblige me , upon receiving this , to procure me instantly a letter of credit on some house in Madrid . I believe Messrs . Hammersley of London have correspondents here . Whatever I undergo , I shall tell nobody my situation : it might hurt the Society and our projects here . I know enough of the world to be aware that it is considered as the worst of crimes to be without money . Above all , let me intreat you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilby ; he is a most invaluable man , and he might take offence . A week ago , after having spent much time in drawing up a petition , I presented it to the Ecclesiastical Committee of Censors . It was strongly backed by the Civil Governor of Madrid , within whose department the Censorship is . In this petition , after a preamble on the religious state of Spain , I requested permission to print the New Testament without note or comment , according to the version of Father Scio , and in the same form and size as the small edition of Paris , in order that the book might be ' al alcance asi de los pobres como de los ricos ' ( within the reach of the poor as well as of the wealthy ) . 154 The Ecclesiastical Board are at present consulting about it , as I was informed to-day , upon my repairing to their house for the purpose of knowing how matters were going on . I have hopes of success , having done all in my power to prevent a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was introduced to the Governor by his most intimate acquaintance Synudi , the Deputy of Huelba , to whom I was introduced by the celebrated Alcala de Galiano , the Deputy of Cadiz , who will sooner or later be Prime Minister , and to him I was introduced by  --  but I will not continue , as I might run on for ever , much after the fashion as ' This is the house which Jack built . ' And now I have something to tell you which I think will surprise you , and which , strange as it may sound , is nevertheless true . The authority of the Pope in this country is in so very feeble and precarious a situation , that little more than a breath is required to destroy it , and I am almost confident that in less than a year it will be disowned . I am doing whatever I can in Madrid to prepare the way for an event so desirable . I mix with the people , and inform them who and what the Pope is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them that the indulgences , which they are in the habit of purchasing , are of no more intrinsic value than so many pieces of paper , and were merely invented with the view of plundering them . I frequently ask : ' Is it possible that God , who is good , would sanction the sale of sin ? ' and , ' Supposing certain things are sinful , do you think that God , for the sake of your money , would permit you to perform them ? ' In many instances my hearers have been satisfied with this simple reasoning , and have said that they would buy no more indulgences . Moreover , the newspapers have , in two or three instances , taken up the subject of Rome upon national and political grounds . The Pope is an avowed friend of Carlos , and an enemy of the present Government , and in every instance has refused to acknowledge the Bishops who have been nominated to vacant sees by the Queen . Therefore the editors say , and very naturally , if the Pope does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regeneration , it is high time to cut the ties which still link Spain to the papal chair . It is my sincere prayer , and the prayer of many of those who have the interest of Spain at heart , that The Man of Rome will continue in the course which he is at present pursuing , for by so doing he loses Spain , and then he is nothing . He is already laughed at throughout Italy  --  Ireland will alone remain to him  --  much good it may do him ! In respect to the Apocrypha , let me be permitted to observe that an anticipation of that difficulty was one of my motives for forbearing to request permission to print the entire Bible ; and here I will hint that in these countries , until the inhabitants become Christian , it would be expedient to drop the Old Testament altogether , for if the Old accompany the New the latter will be little read , as the former is so infinitely more entertaining to the carnal man . Mr. Wilby in his last letter informs me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but that the demand for Testaments has not amounted to half that number . My best respects to Mr. Jowett . G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . June 1 , 1836 ) MADRID , May 22 , 1836 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I write in the greatest hurry . I shall receive the permission , the Lord willing , in a few days ; the Duke de Rivas has this moment told me so , and he is Minister of the Interior . The Ecclesiastical Court declined deciding upon the matter , and left it entirely in the hands of the Ministers . Just as the English Ambassador was about to remind Mr. Mendizabal of his promise to me , the latter gentleman and his colleagues retired from office ; a new Ministry was formed composed entirely of my friends , amongst them Alcala Galiano ( turn to my last letter ) . As soon as the Minister of Finance , with whom I am very intimate , returns from France , I shall request to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable duty . I received Mr. Jackson 's letter containing the money , and yours , also with money , and a rap on the knuckles besides ; it was scarcely merited , as I can prove in five words . Not having the Scripture to offer to the people , I was obliged to content myself with mentioning it to them ; the people here know not the Scripture even by name , but they know a certain personage well enough , and as soon as the subject of religion is brought up they are sure to bring him forward , as they consider him the fountainhead of all religion . Those therefore in the situation of myself have three things at their option ; to speak nothing  --  to speak lies  --  or to speak the truth . In simpleness of heart I thought proper to adopt the last principle as my line of conduct ; I do not think I have erred , but I shall be more reserved in future . In conclusion let me be permitted to observe that the last skirts of the cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whoever says the contrary either knows nothing of the matter or wilfully hides the truth .

MY DEAR SIR ,  --  There has been a partial disturbance at Madrid , and it is not impossible that the new Ministry will go out and Mr. M. be reinstated  --  which event , however , will make little difference to us , as the British Ambassador has promised to back the application which I shall instantly make . There are so many changes and revolutions here that nothing is certain even for a day . I wish to let you know what is going forward , and am aware that you will excuse two letters arriving at one time . G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd .

Every thing , thank God , is again tranquil , and it appears that the present Ministry will stand its ground . I am just returned from the house of one of the Ministers ; I can consequently speak pretty positively . The Queen will not accept their resignations , and the army is on their side . The Cortes have been dissolved . The whole Cabinet are of opinion that my petition is just and reasonable and ought to be granted . I have been requested to appear next Thursday at the Office , when I expect to receive the permission , or to hear that steps have been taken towards making it out . The reason of Mr. Mendizabal 's resignation was his inability to accomplish the removal of General Cordova from the head of the army . It is not for me to offer an opinion on the General 's military talents , but he is much beloved by the soldiers , whose comforts and interests he has much attended to ; to deprive him of command would therefore be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mr. M. ; he is a kind , well-meaning man , and had he remained in office I have no doubt that he would have acceded to my petition .

July 11 , 1836 ) CALLE SANTIAGO , No. 16 PISO 3RO , MADRID , June 30 , 1836 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  As I have little doubt that you are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from me , I write a few lines which I have no doubt will prove satisfactory to you , and in the course of a few days I hope to write again , when I shall probably be able to announce the happy termination of the affair which brought me to Spain . The difficulties which I have had to encounter since I last wrote to you have been so many and formidable that I have been frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print the Gospel in Spain , which has become the most ardent wish of my heart . Only those who have been in the habit of dealing with Spaniards , by whom the most solemn promises are habitually broken , can form a correct idea of my reiterated disappointments and of the toil of body and agony of spirit which I have been subjected to . One day I have been told , at the Ministry , that I had only to wait a few moments and all I wished would be acceded to ; and then my hopes have been blasted with the information that various difficulties , which seemed insurmountable , had presented themselves , whereupon I have departed almost broken-hearted ; but the next day I have been summoned in a great hurry and informed that ' all was right , ' and that on the morrow a regular authority to print the Scriptures would be delivered to me ; but by that time fresh and yet more terrible difficulties had occurred  --  so that I became weary of my life . During the greatest part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours every day , dancing attendance on one or another of the Ministers , and when I have returned home I have been so fatigued that I have found it impossible to write , even to my nearest friends . The heat has been suffocating , for the air seems to be filled with flaming vapours , and the very Spaniards are afraid to stay out , and lie gasping and naked on their brick floors ; therefore if you have felt disappointed in not having heard from me for a considerable time , the above statement must be my excuse . During the last fortnight the aspect of my affair has become more favourable , and , notwithstanding all the disappointments I have met , I now look forward with little apprehension to the result . The English Ambassador , Mr. Villiers , has taken me by the hand in the most generous manner and has afforded me the most effectual assistance . He has spoken to all the Ministers , collectively and individually , and has recommended the granting of my petition in the strongest manner , pointing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without religious instruction of any kind , and the impossibility of exercising any species of government over a nation of atheists , which the Spaniards will very shortly become if left to themselves . Whether moved by his arguments or by a wish to oblige a person of so much importance as the British Ambassador , the Cabinet of Madrid now exhibit a manifest willingness to do all in their power to satisfy me ; and though by the law of Spain the publishing of the Scripture in the vulgar tongue without notes is forbidden , measures have been taken by which the rigor of the law can be eluded and the printer be protected , until such time as it shall be deemed prudent to repeal the law made , as is now generally confessed , in a time of ignorance and superstitious darkness . I herewith send you a letter which I received some days since from Mr. Villiers ; I have several others on the same subject , but I prefer sending this particular one as it is the last . Since I received it , the Ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , as I have been informed , though not officially , in its favour . You would oblige me by mentioning to his Lordship the President of the Bible Society the manner in which Mr. Villiers has befriended me , and to beg that he would express by letter an acknowledgment of the favour which I have received ; and at the same time , I think that a vote of thanks from the Committee would not be amiss , as I may be again in need of Mr. V. 's assistance before I leave Spain . The interest which he has taken in this affair is the more surprising , as Mr. Graydon informed me that upon his applying to him he declined to interfere . I saw Mr. Graydon twice or thrice . He left Madrid for Barcelona about a month since , because the heat of the former place in the summer months is more than he can bear , and as he found I was so far advanced , he thought he might be of more utility in Catalonia . I have at present nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue that I can hardly hold the pen . I have removed from my old lodgings to those which Mr. Graydon occupied ; therefore when you write , direct as above . With my best remembrances to Mr. Jowett , I remain , my dear Sir , very truly yours , G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . July 18 , 1836 ) 7 July , 1836 , MADRID , CALLE SANTIAGO , No. 16 PISO 3RO . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  The affair is settled  --  thank God ! ! ! and we may begin to print whenever we think proper . Perhaps you have thought I have been tardy in accomplishing the business which brought me to Spain ; but to be able to form a correct judgment you ought to be aware of all the difficulties which I have had to encounter , and which I shall not enumerate ; I shall content myself with observing that for a thousand pounds I would not undergo again all the mortifications and disappointments of the last two months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with great reason , as they are not of the movement or radical party , and many of their friends are bigoted papists ; nevertheless , influenced by the pressing applications of the British Ambassador and being moreover well-disposed to myself , they have consented to the printing of the Testament ; but it must be done in a private manner . I have just had a long interview with Mr. Isturitz , who told me that if we were resolved upon the enterprise we had best employ the confidential printer of the Government , who would keep the matter secret ; as in the present state of affairs he would not answer for the consequences if it were noised abroad . I of course expressed my perfect readiness to comply with so reasonable a request . I will now candidly confess to you that I do not think that the present Ministry , or , as it is generally called , the Court Ministry , will be able to stand its ground ; nevertheless a change of Ministry would not alter the aspect of our affair in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the liberty of the press ( a great misfortune for Spain ) would be probably granted ; at all events , the influence of the English Ambassador would be greater than it is even at present , and upon his assistance I may rely at all times and occasions . I am not aware that there is any great necessity for my continuance in Spain ; nevertheless , should you think there is , you have only to command . But I can not help thinking that in a month or two when the heats are over Mr. Graydon might return , as nothing very difficult remains to be accomplished , and I am sure that Mr. Villiers at my entreaty would extend to him the patronage with which he has honoured me . But , as I before observed , I am ready to do whatever the Bible Society may deem expedient . Do not forget the two letters of thanks to the Ambassador , and it would not be unwise to transmit a vote of thanks to ' His Excellence Antonio Alcala Galiano , President of Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . July 30th , 1836 ) MADRID , July 19th , 1836 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  As I believe you have no account of my proceedings at Badajoz , I send you the following which will perhaps serve for your ' Monthly Extracts . ' I have corrected and improved my translation of the Lord 's Prayer into Rommany , and should it be printed , let it be done so with care . Perhaps in a few days I shall send a general account of what I have been about since my arrival at Madrid , but I am at present very feeble and languid , and can scarcely hold a pen . There is nothing new here , all is quiet , and I hope will continue so . My time does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all my acquaintance have left the place to escape from the intolerable heat . I often sigh for Russia , and wish I was there , editing Mandchou or Armenian ; pray remember me kindly to Mr. Jowett and to my other friends . I remain , etc . G. BORROW . About one o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of January , 1836 , I crossed the bridge of the Guadiana , a boundary river between Portugal and Spain , and entered Badajoz , a strong Spanish town containing about 8000 inhabitants , and founded by the Romans . I instantly returned thanks to God who had protected me during a journey of five days through the wilds of Alemtejo , the province of Portugal the most infested by robbers and desperate characters , and which I had traversed with no other human companion than a lad , nearly idiotic , who was to convey back the mules which carried myself and baggage . It was not my intention to make much stay at Badajoz , and as a vehicle would set out for Madrid the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart therein for the capital of Spain . The next morning I was standing at the door of the inn where I had taken up my residence ; the weather was gloomy , and rain seemed to be at hand . I was thinking of the state of the country I had lately entered , which was involved in bloody anarchy and confusion , and where the ministers of a religion , falsely styled Catholic and Christian , were blowing the trump of war , instead of preaching the love-engendering words of the blessed Gospel . Suddenly two men wrapped in long cloaks came down the narrow and almost deserted street . They were about to pass me , and the face of the nearest was turned full towards me . I knew to whom the countenance which he displayed must belong , and I touched him on the shoulder . The man stopped and his companion also ; I said a certain word , to which after an exclamation of surprise he responded in the manner which I expected . The men were of that singular family , or race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized globe , and the members of which are known as Gypsies , Bohemians , Gitanos , Zigani , and by many other names , but whose proper appellation seems to be ' Rommany , ' from the circumstance that in many and distant countries they so style themselves , and also the language which they speak amongst each other . We began conversing in the Spanish dialect of this language , with which I was tolerably well acquainted . Upon inquiring of my two newly-made acquaintances whether there were many of their people at Badajoz and in the vicinity , they informed me that there were nine or ten families residing in the town , and that there were others at Merida , a town about nine leagues distant . I asked by what means they supported themselves , and they replied that they and their brethren gained a livelihood by jobbing in horses , mules , etc. , but that all those in Badajoz were very poor , with the exception of one man , who was exceedingly mubalballo or rich , as he was in possession of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and I saw that their undergarments were rags . They left me in haste , and went about the town informing the rest that a stranger was arrived , who spoke Rommany as well as themselves , who had the eyes and face of a Gitano , and seemed to be of the eratti , or blood . In less than half-an-hour the street before the inn was filled with the men , women , and children of Egypt . I went out amongst them , and my heart sank within me as I surveyed them ; so much squalidness , dirt , and misery I had never before seen amongst a similar number of human beings . But the worst of all was the evil expression of their countenances , plainly denoting that they were familiar with every species of crime ; and it was not long before I found that their countenances did not belie them . After they had asked me an infinity of questions , and felt my hands , face , and clothes , they retired to their homes . My meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badajoz a much longer time than I originally intended . I wished to become better acquainted with their condition and manners , and above all to speak to them about Christ and His Word , for I was convinced that should I travel to the end of the universe I should meet with none who were more in need of Christian exhortation , and I accordingly continued at Badajoz for nearly three weeks . During this time I was almost constantly amongst them , and as I spoke their language and was considered by them as one of themselves , I had better opportunities of coming to a fair conclusion respecting their character than any other person , whether Spaniard or foreigner , could have hoped for , not possessed of a similar advantage . The result of my observations was a firm belief that the Spanish Gitanos are the most vile , degraded , and wretched people upon the earth . In no part of the world does the Gypsy race enjoy a fair fame and reputation , there being no part where they are not considered , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Spain are not only all this , but far more . The Gypsies of England , Russia , etc. , live by fraud of various descriptions , but they seldom commit acts of violence , and their vices are none or very few ; the men are not drunkards , nor are the women harlots ; but the Gypsy of Spain is a cheat in the market-place , a brigand and murderer on the high-road , and a drunkard in the wine-shop , and his wife is a harlot and thief on all times and occasions . The excessive wickedness of these outcasts may perhaps be attributed to their having abandoned their wandering life and become inmates of the towns , where to the original bad traits of their character they have super-added the evil and vicious habits of the rabble . Their mouths teem with abomination , and in no part of the world have I heard such frequent , frightful , and extraordinary cursing as amongst them . Religion they have none ; they never attend mass , nor confess themselves , and never employ the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprecation and blasphemy . From what I learnt from them it appeared that their ancestors had some belief in metempsychosis , but they themselves laughed at the idea , and were decidedly of opinion that the soul perished when the body ceased to breathe ; and the argument which they used was rational enough , so far as it impugned metempsychosis : ' We have been wicked and miserable enough in this life , ' they said ; ' why should we live again ? ' I translated certain portions of Scripture into their dialect , which I frequently read to them , especially the parables of Lazarus and the Prodigal Son , and told them that the latter had been as wicked as themselves , and both had suffered as much or more ; but that the sufferings of the former , who always looked forward to a blessed resurrection , were recompensed in the world to come by admission to the society of Abraham and the prophets , and that the latter , when he repented of his crimes , was forgiven and received into as much favour as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration , but alas ! not of the truths , the eternal truths I was telling them , but at finding that their broken jargon could be written and read . The only words of assent to the heavenly doctrine which I ever obtained , and which were rather of the negative kind , were the following , from a woman : ' Brother , you tell us strange things , though perhaps you do not lie ; a month since I would sooner have believed these tales , than that I should this day have seen one who could write Rommany . ' They possess a vast number of songs or couplets which they recite to the music of the guitar . For the purpose of improving myself in the language I collected and wrote down upwards of one hundred of these couplets , the subjects of which are horse-stealing , murder , and the various incidents of gypsy-life in Spain . Perhaps a collection of songs more characteristic of the people from whom they originated was never made , though amongst them are to be found some tender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower or shrub is here and there seen springing from the interstices of the rugged and frightful rocks of which are composed the mountains and sierras of Spain . The following is their traditionary account of the expulsion of their fathers from Egypt . ' And it came to pass that Pharaoh the King collected numerous armies for the purpose of war ; and after he had conquered the whole world , he challenged God to descend from heaven and fight him ; but the Lord replied , " There is no one who shall fight with Me " ; and thereupon the Lord opened a mountain , and He cast therein Pharaoh the King and all his numerous armies ; so that the Egyptians remained without defence , and their enemies arose and scattered them wide abroad .

MY DEAR SIR ,  --  I have received your two letters containing the 50 pounds and the resolution of the Society ; I have likewise received Mr. Brandram 's . I shall make the provisional engagement to print as desired , and shall leave Madrid as soon as possible ; but I must here inform you that I shall find much difficulty in returning to England , as all the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proclaimed , and the roads are swarming with robbers and banditti . It is my intention to join some muleteers and attempt to reach Granada , from whence , if possible , I shall proceed to Malaga or Gibraltar , and thence to Lisbon , where I left the greatest part of my baggage . Do not be surprised therefore , if I am tardy in making my appearance . It is no easy thing at present to travel in Spain . But all these troubles are for the benefit of the Cause , and must not be repined at . I remain , my dear Sir , most truly yours , G. B. @# @# Report of Mr. Geo . Borrow 's late Proceedings in Spain @# LONDON , October 17 , 1836 . On the 16th of January I quitted Badajoz , a Spanish town on the frontier of Portugal , for Madrid , whither I arrived in safety . As my principal motive for visiting the Spanish capital was the hope of obtaining permission from the Government to print the New Testament in the Castilian language in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking what I considered to be the necessary steps . I must here premise that I was an entire stranger at Madrid , and that I bore no letters , of introduction to any person of influence whose credit might have assisted me in this undertaking ; so that notwithstanding I entertained a hope of success , relying on the assistance of the Almighty , this hope was not at all times very vivid , but was frequently overcast with the clouds of despondency . Mr. Mendizabal was at this time Prime Minister of Spain , and was considered as a man of almost unbounded power , in whose hands were placed the destinies of the country . I therefore considered that if I could by any means induce him to favour my view I should have no reason to fear interruption from other quarters , and I determined upon applying to him ; but though I essayed two or three times to obtain an interview with him , I failed , as he was far too much engrossed in important business to receive a humble and unknown stranger . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British Ambassador at Madrid , and craving with the freedom permitted to a British subject his advice and assistance in this most interesting affair . I was received by him with great kindness , and enjoyed a conversation with him on various subjects , before I introduced the matter which I had most at heart . He said that if I wished for an interview with Mr. M. he would endeavour to procure me one ; but at the same time told me frankly that he could not hope that any good would arise from it , as Mr. M. was violently prejudiced against the British and Foreign Bible Society , and was far more likely to discountenance than encourage any efforts which they might be disposed to make for introducing the Gospel into Spain . I however remained resolute in my desire to make the trial , and before I left him obtained a letter of introduction to Mr. Mendizabal , with whom I had an interview a few days after . The particulars of this interview have been detailed on a former occasion . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not immediate permission to print the Scriptures , a promise that at the expiration of a few months , when he hoped that the country would be in a more tranquil state , I should be at full liberty to do so , with which promise I departed well satisfied , and full of gratitude to the Lord , who seemed to have so wonderfully smoothed my way in an enterprise which at first sight seemed particularly arduous and difficult . Before three months had elapsed Mr. Mendizabal had ceased to be Prime Minister ; with his successor , Mr. Isturitz , I had become acquainted , and also with his colleagues , Galiano and the Duke de Rivas , and it was not long before I obtained  --  not however without much solicitation and difficulty  --  the permission which I so ardently desired . Before , however , I could turn it to my account , the revolution broke out in Spain , and the press became free . The present appears to be a moment peculiarly well adapted for commencing operations in Spain , the aim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy portion of the world the knowledge of the Saviour . The clouds of bigotry and superstition which for so many centuries cast their dreary shadow upon Spain , are to a considerable degree dispelled , and there is little reason for supposing that they will ever again conglomerate . The Papal See is no longer regarded with reverence , and its agents and ministers have incurred universal scorn and odium ; therefore any fierce and determined resistance to the Gospel in Spain is not to be apprehended either from the people themselves , or from the clergy , who are well aware of their own weakness . It is scarcely necessary to remark that every country which has been long subjected to the sway of popery is in a state of great and deplorable ignorance . Spain , as might have been expected , has not escaped this common fate , and the greatest obstacle to the diffusion of the Gospel light amongst the Spaniards would proceed from the great want of education amongst them . Perhaps there are no people in the world to whom nature has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Spaniards . They are generally acute and intelligent to an extraordinary degree , and express themselves with clearness , fluency , and elegance upon all subjects which are within the scope of their knowledge . It may indeed be said of the mind of a Spaniard , as of his country , that it merely requires cultivation to be a garden of the first order ; but , unhappily , both , up to the present time , have been turned to the least possible account . Few amongst the lower class of the population of the towns are acquainted with letters , and fewer still amongst the peasantry ; but though compelled to acknowledge the ignorance of the Spaniards in general , I have great pleasure in being able to state that during the latter years it has been becoming less and less , and that the rising generation is by no means so illiterate as the last , which was itself superior in acquirements to the preceding one . It is to be hoped that the progress in improvement will still continue , and that within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffused amongst the Spaniards as amongst the people of France and England . Government has already commenced the establishment of Normal Schools , and though the state of the country , convulsed with the horrors of civil war , precludes the possibility of devoting to them the care and attention which they deserve , I have no doubt that when it shall please the Lord to vouchsafe peace unto Spain they will receive all the requisite patronage and support , as their utility is already generally recognised . Before quitting Madrid I entered into negotiation with Mr. Charles Wood , a respectable Englishman established there , for the printing of 5000 copies of the New Testament in Spanish , which number , if on good paper and in handsome type , I have little doubt might be easily disposed of within a short time in the capital and in the principal provincial towns of Spain , particularly Cadiz and Seville , where the people are more enlightened than in other parts in most respects , and where many would be happy to obtain the sacred volume in a handsome yet cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the Word of God is at least known by reputation , and no small curiosity has of late years been manifested concerning it , though unfortunately that curiosity has not hitherto been gratified , for reasons too well known to require recapitulation . In the rural districts the chances of the Scriptures are considerably less , for there , as far as I am aware , not only no curiosity has been excited respecting it , but it is not known by name , and when mentioned to the people , is considered to be nothing more or less than the mass-book of the Romish Church . On various occasions I have conversed with the peasantry of Estremadura , La Mancha , and Andalusia respecting the holy Book , and without one exception they were not only ignorant of its contents , but ignorant of its nature ; some who could read , and pretended to be acquainted with it , said that it contained hymns to the Virgin , and was written by the Pope ; yet the peasantry of these three provinces are by no means the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , great as the ignorance of the generality of the Spaniards upon most essential points is , they are principally ignorant of the one most essential of all , the religion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . No time , however , ought to be lost in supplying those with the word who are capable of receiving it ; though millions in Spain are undoubtedly beyond the reach of any efforts which the Bible Society can make to assist them , however much it may have at heart their eternal salvation , it is gratifying to have grounds for belief that thousands are able and willing to profit by the exertions which may be made to serve them . Though the days of the general orange-gathering are not arrived , when the tree requires but a slight shaking to scatter its ripe and glorious treasures on the head of the gardener , still goodly and golden fruit is to be gathered on the most favoured and sunny branches ; the quantity is small in comparison with what remains green and acid , but there is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cull it ; the time of the grand and general harvesting is approaching , perhaps it will please the Almighty to hasten it ; and it may even now be nearer than the most sanguine of us dares to hope .

AND DEAR SIR ,  --  On taking leave of you I promised to write from Cadiz , and I still hope to perform my promise ; but as I am apprehensive that several days will elapse before I shall reach that place I avail myself of the present opportunity of informing you that I am alive and well , lest you should become uneasy at not hearing from me at the time you expected . It is owing to the mercy of God that , instead of being able to pen these lines , I am not at the present moment floundering in the brine , a prey to the fishes and monsters of the ocean . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with passengers , most of whom were poor consumptive individuals and other invalids , fleeing from the cold blasts of England 's winter to the sunny shores of Portugal and Madeira . In a more uncomfortable vessel , especially steam-ship , it has never been my fate to make a voyage ; the berths were small and insupportably close , and of the wretched holes mine was amongst the worst , the rest having been for the most part bespoken before I arrived on board , so that to avoid the suffocation which seemed to threaten me I lay upon the floor of one of the cabins , and continued to do so until my arrival here . We remained at Falmouth twenty-four hours , taking in coals and repairing the engine , which had sustained considerable damage . On Monday the 7th inst. we again started and made for the Bay of Biscay ; the sea was high and the wind strong and contrary , nevertheless on the morning of the fourth day we were in sight of the rocky coast to the north of Cape Finisterre . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain who commanded the vessel had ever made on board of her , and that he knew little or nothing about the coast towards which we were bearing ; he was a person picked up in a hurry , the former captain having resigned his command on the ground that the ship was not sea-worthy , and that the engines were frequently unserviceable . I was not acquainted with these circumstances at the time , or perhaps I should have felt more alarmed than I did when I saw the vessel approaching nearer and nearer to the shore , till at last we were only a few hundred yards distant . As it was , however , I felt very much surprised , for having passed it twice before , both times in steam-vessels , and having seen with what care the captains endeavoured to maintain a wide offing , I could not conceive the reason of our being now so near the dangerous region . The wind was blowing hard towards the shore , if that can be called a shore which consists of steep abrupt precipices , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tossing up clouds of spray and foam to the height of a cathedral . We coasted slowly along , rounding several tall forelands , some of them piled up by the hand of nature in the most fantastic shapes , until about the fall of night . Cape Finisterre was not far ahead , a bluff brown granite mountain , whose frowning head may be seen far away by those who travel the ocean . The stream which poured round its breast was terrific , and though our engines plied with all their force , we made little or no way . By about eight o'clock at night , the wind had increased to a hurricane , the thunder rolled frightfully , and the only light which we had to guide us on our way was the red forked lightning which burst at times from the bosom of the big black clouds which lowered over our heads . We were exerting ourselves to the utmost to weather the cape , which we could descry by the lightning on our lee , its brow being frequently brilliantly lighted up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great crash , the engine broke , and the paddles on which depended our lives ceased to play . I will not attempt to depict the scene of horror and confusion which ensued : it may be imagined , but never described . The captain , to give him his due , displayed the utmost coolness and intrepidity , and he and the whole crew made the greatest exertions to repair the engine , and when they found their labour in vain , endeavoured by hoisting the sails and by practising all possible manoeuvres to preserve the ship from impending destruction . But all was of no use ; we were hard on a lee shore , to which the howling tempest was impelling us . About this time I was standing near the helm , and I asked the steersman if there was any hope of saving the vessel or our lives ; he replied , ' Sir , it is a bad affair ; no boat could for a minute live in this sea , and in less than an hour the ship will have her broadside on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shivers instantly . None of us will see the morning . ' The captain likewise informed the other passengers in the cabin to the same effect , telling them to prepare themselves , and having done so he ordered the door to be fastened , and none to be permitted to come on deck . I , however , kept my station , though almost drowned with water , immense waves continually breaking over our windward side and flooding the ship ; the water-casks broke from their lashings , and one of them struck me down , and crushed the foot of the unfortunate man at the helm , whose place was instantly taken by the captain . We were now close on the rocks , when a horrid convulsion of the elements took place ; the lightning enveloped us as with a mantle , the thunders were louder than the roar of a million cannon , the dregs of the ocean seemed to be cast up , and in the midst of all this turmoil the wind , without the slightest intimation veered right about , and pushed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us towards it . The oldest sailors on board acknowledged that they had never witnessed so providential an escape . I said from the bottom of my heart , ' Our Father : hallowed be Thy name . ' The next day we were near foundering , for the sea was exceedingly high , and our vessel , which was not intended for sailing , laboured terribly , and leaked much . The pumps were continually working . She likewise took fire , but the flames were extinguished . In the evening the steam-engine was partially repaired , and we reached Lisbon on the 13th . Most of my clothes and other things are spoiled , for the hold was overflowed with the water from the boiler and the leak . The vessel will be ready for sea in about a week , when I shall depart for Cadiz ; but most of the passengers who intended going farther than Lisbon have abandoned her , as they say she is doomed . But I have more trust in the Lord that governeth the winds , and in whose hands the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finisterre can preserve elsewhere , and if it be His will that we perish , the firm ground is not more secure than the heaving sea . I have seen our excellent friend Mr. Wilby , and delivered to him the parcel , with which I was entrusted . He has been doing everything in his power to further the sale of the sacred volume in Portuguese ; indeed his zeal and devotedness are quite admirable , and the Society can never appreciate his efforts too highly . But since I was last at Lisbon the distracted state of the country has been a great obstacle to him ; people 's minds are so engrossed with politics that they find no time to think of their souls . Before this reaches you , you will doubtless have heard of the late affair at Belem , where poor Freire ( I knew him well ) one of the ex-Ministers lost his life , and which nearly ended in an affray between the English forces and the native . The opinions of the Portuguese seem to be decidedly democratic , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Queen would lose her crown within a month , and be compelled with her no less unfortunate young husband to seek a refuge in another country . I repeat that I hope to write to you from Cadiz ; I shall probably be soon in the allotted field of my labours , distracted , miserable Spain . The news from thence is at present particularly dismal ; the ferocious Gomez , after having made an excursion into Estremadura , which he ravaged like a pestilence , has returned to Andalusia , the whole of which immense province seems to be prone at his feet . I shall probably find Seville occupied by his hordes , but I fear them not , and trust that the Lord will open the path for me to Madrid . One thing I am resolved upon : either to be the instrument of doing something for Spain , or never to appear again in my native land . G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Dec. 28th , 1836 ) SEVILLE , Dec. 5th , 1836 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cadiz on the 21st ult. ; the steam-engine had been partially repaired at Lisbon , and our passage was speedy and prosperous . I was happy to have reached the shores of Spain , being eager to enter upon my allotted task . Cadiz is a small but beautiful city , built upon a tongue of land and surrounded on all points but one by the sea , which dashes up against its walls : the houses are lofty , and of a dazzling whiteness ; the streets are straight and narrow . On my arrival I found great confusion reigning : numerous bands of the factious were reported to be hovering in the neighbourhood , an attack was not deemed improbable , and the place had just been declared in a state of siege . I took up my abode at the French Hotel , in the Calle de la Niveria , and was allotted a species of cock-loft or garret to sleep in , for the house was filled with guests , being a place of much resort on account of the excellent table d'hote which is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I entered several coffee houses : the din of tongues in all was deafening ; in one no less than six orators were haranguing at the same time on the state of the country , and the probability of an intervention on the part of England and France . As I was listening to one of them he suddenly called upon me for my opinion , as I was a foreigner , and seemingly just arrived . I replied that I could not venture to guess what steps the two Governments would pursue under the present circumstances , but thought that it would be as well if the Spaniards would exert themselves more , and call less on Jupiter . As I did not wish to engage in any political conversation I instantly quitted the house , and sought those parts of the town where the lower classes principally reside . I entered into discourse with several individuals , but found them very ignorant ; none could write or read , and their ideas respecting religion were anything but satisfactory , most professing a perfect indifference . I afterwards went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for literature , which he informed me was small . I produced our 24mo edition of the New Testament in Spanish , and asked the bookseller whether he thought a book of that description would sell in Cadiz . He said it was exceedingly beautiful , both in type and paper , but it was a work not sought after , and very little known . I did not pursue my enquiries in other shops , for I reflected that I was not very likely to receive a very favourable opinion from booksellers respecting a publication in which they had no interest . I had , moreover , but two or three copies of the New Testament with me , and could not have supplied them had they given me an order . That night I became very unwell , and was apprehending that I had been seized with the cholera , as the symptoms of my complaint were very similar to those which accompany that disorder . I was for some time in most acute pain , and terribly sick ; I drank oil mixed with brandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding days was very feeble , and able to undertake nothing . This attack was the cause of my not writing to you from Cadiz as I had fully intended . Early on the 24th I embarked for Seville in the small Spanish steamer the Betis . The morning was wet , and the aspect of nature was enveloped in a dense mist , which prevented my observing surrounding objects . After proceeding about six leagues , we reached the north-eastern extremity of the bay of Cadiz , and passed by Saint Lucar , an ancient town close by where the Guadalquivir disembogues itself . The mist suddenly disappeared , and the sun of Spain burst forth in full brilliancy , enlivening all around , and particularly myself , who had till then been lying on the deck in a dull melancholy stupor . We entered the mouth of the ' Great River , ' for that is the English translation of Qued al Kiber , as the Moors designated the ancient Betis . We came to anchor for a few minutes at a little village called Bonanca , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we received several passengers , and again proceeded . There is not much in the appearance of the Guadalquivir to interest the traveller : the banks are low and destitute of trees , the adjacent country is flat , and only in the distance is seen a range of tall blue sierras . The water is turbid and muddy , and in colour closely resembling the contents of a duck-pool ; the average width of the stream is from 150 to 200 yards . But it is impossible to move along this river without remembering that it has borne the Roman , the Vandal , and the Arab , and has been the witness of deeds which have resounded through the world , and been the themes of immortal song . I repeated Latin verses and fragments of old Spanish ballads , till we reached Seville at about nine o'clock of a lovely moonlight night . Before entering upon more important matter I will say a few words respecting Seville and its curiosities . It contains 90,000 inhabitants , and is situated on the left bank of the Guadalquivir , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high Moorish walls , in a good state of preservation , and built of such durable materials that it is probable they will for many centuries bid defiance to the encroachment of time . The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral and Alcazar or palace of the Moorish kings . The tower of the former , called La Giralda , belongs to the period of the Moors , and formed part of the Grand Mosque of Seville . It is 220 ells in height , and is ascended not by stairs or ladders , but by a vaulted pathway , in the manner of an inclined plane ; this path is by no means steep , so that a cavalier might ride up to the top , a feat which Ferdinand the Seventh is said to have accomplished . The view from the summit is very extensive , and on a fine clear day the ridge called the Sierra de Ronda may be discovered though the distance is upward of twenty-two leagues . The cathedral itself is a noble Gothic structure , reputed the finest of the kind in Spain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most magnificent paintings which Spanish art has produced . Here are to be seen the far-famed ' Angel of the Guard , ' by Murillo , his ' Saint Anthony at Devotion , ' the celestial spirits hovering around him , and Saint Thomas of Villa Nueva bestowing Charity ' ; there are also some pictures by Soberan ? Zurbaran of almost inestimable value . Indeed , the cathedral at Seville is at the present time far more rich in splendid paintings than at any former period , possessing many very recently removed from some of the suppressed convents , particularly from the Capuchin and Franciscan . No one should visit Seville without paying particular attention to the Alcazar . It is perhaps the most perfect specimen of Moorish architecture which is at present to be found in Europe . It contains many splendid halls , particularly that of the Ambassadors , so called , which is in every respect more magnificent than the one of the same name within the Alhambra of Granada . This palace was a favourite residence of Peter the Cruel , who carefully repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It probably remains in much the same state as at the time of his death . On the right side of the river is a large suburb called Triana , communicating with Seville by means of a bridge of boats ; for there is no permanent bridge across the Guadalquivir owing to the violent inundations to which it is subject . This suburb is inhabited by the dregs of the populace , and abounds with Gitanos or Gypsies . About a league and a half to the north-west stands the village of Santo Ponce ; at the foot and on the side of some elevated ground higher up are to be seen vestiges of ruined walls and edifices which once formed part of Italica , the birth-place of Silius Italicus and Trajan , from which latter personage Triana derives its name . One fine morning I walked thither , and having ascended the hill I directed my course northward . I soon reached what had once been bagnios , and a little farther on , in a kind of valley between two gentle acclivities , the amphitheatre . This latter object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is oval in its form , with two gateways , fronting the east and west . On all sides are to be seen the time-worn broken granite benches , from whence myriads of human beings once gazed down on the area below , where the gladiator shouted , and the lion and leopard yelled . All around beneath these flights of benches are vaulted excavations , from whence the combatants , part human , part bestial , darted forth by their several doors . I spent several hours in this singular place , forcing my way through the wild fennel and brushwood into the caverns , now the haunts of adders and other reptiles , whose hissings I heard . Having sated my curiosity , I left the ruins , and returning by another way reached a place where lay the carcass of a horse half-devoured . Upon it with lustrous eyes stood an enormous vulture , who , as I approached , slowly soared aloft till he alighted on the eastern gate of the amphitheatre , from whence he uttered a hoarse cry , as if in anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now for another subject . You are doubtless anxious to know what are my projects , and why I am not by this time further advanced on my way to Madrid ; know then that the way to Madrid is beset with more perils than harassed Christian in his route to the Eternal Kingdom . Almost all communication is at an end between this place and the capital , the diligences and waggons have ceased running , even the bold arrieros or muleteers are at a stand-still ; and the reason is that the rural portion of Spain , especially this part , is in a state of complete disorganisation and of blackest horror . The three fiends , famine , plunder , and murder , are playing their ghastly revels unchecked ; bands of miscreants captained by such  --  what shall I call them ?  --  as Orejita and Palillos , are prowling about in every direction , and woe to those whom they meet . A few days since they intercepted an unfortunate courier , and after scooping out his eyes put him to death with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be mentioned . Moreover , the peasantry , who have been repeatedly plundered by these fellows , and who have had their horses and cattle taken from them by the Carlists , being reduced with their families to nakedness and the extreme of hunger , seize in rage and desperation upon every booty which comes within their reach , a circumstance which can awaken but little surprise . This terrible state of things , staring me in the face on my arrival at Seville , made me pause . I thought that the tempest might in some degree subside , but hitherto I have been disappointed . My mind is at present made up . I shall depart for Madrid in two or three days , at all risks . The distance is 300 miles . I shall hire , in the first place , horses , and a guide , as far as Cordova ( twenty-six leagues ) . I shall have to pay a great price , it is true , but I have money , praised be God , who inspired me with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should otherwise be helpless . From Cordova I must endeavour to obtain horses to Val de Penas ( twenty leagues ) , which is half way to Madrid . Were I at Val de Penas , I should feel comparatively at ease ; for from thence I know the road , having traversed it in my ways from Madrid to Grenada ; it moreover runs through La Mancha , which , though infested with banditti , is plain open ground , and if I could obtain no guide or horses , or had been plundered of my money , I might hope to make my way on foot . But I am ignorant of the country between Seville and Cordova , and from Cordova to Val de Penas . The route is through the dismal and savage mountains of the Sierra Morena , where I should inevitably be bewildered , and perhaps , if not murdered , fall a prey to the wolves . Were the whole way known to me , I would leave my baggage here and dressed as a beggar or Gypsy set out on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be the safest course I could pursue . Should I perish in this journey , keep the affair secret as long as possible from my dear mother , and when it should be necessary to reveal it to her , do me the favour to go to Norwich on purpose ; should I reach Madrid , you will hear from me in about five weeks , from the time you receive this . It would be of no utility to write to you from Cordova ; the letter would never reach you , I hope this will . Gomez had not hitherto paid a visit to Seville ; when I arrived here , he was said to be in the neighbourhood of Ronda . The city was under watch and ward , several gates had been blocked up with masonry , trenches dug , and redoubts erected , but I am convinced that the place would not have held out six hours against a resolute assault . Gomez has proved himself to be a most extraordinary man , and with his small army of Aragonese and Basques has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he has very frequently been hemmed in with forces three times the number of his own , in places whence escape seemed impossible , but he has always baffled his enemies , whom he seems to laugh at . The most absurd accounts of victories gained over him are continually issuing from the press at Seville ; the other day it was stated that his army had been utterly defeated , himself killed , and that 1200 prisoners were on their way to Seville . I saw these prisoners ; instead of 1200 desperadoes , they consisted of about twenty poor lame ragged wretches , many of them boys from fourteen to sixteen years of age ; they were evidently camp-followers , who , unable to keep up with the army , had been picked up straggling in the plains and amongst the hills . It now appears that no battle had occurred , and that the death of Gomez was a fiction . The grand defect of Gomez is not knowing how to take advantage of circumstances ; after his defeat of Lopez he might have marched to Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might have captured Seville . There are several booksellers ' shops in Seville , in two of which I found copies of the New Testament ( our own 12mo edition of 1826 ) ; they had been obtained from Gibraltar about two years since , during which time six copies had been sold in one shop and four in the other . I have become acquainted with an elderly person , a Genoese by birth , who , should we succeed in bringing out an edition of the sacred volume at Madrid , may be of service to us , as a colporteur in this place and the neighbourhood , where he is well known . He has assured me of his willingness to undertake the task , and , if required , to visit Cordova , Grenada , or any part of Andalusia , town or country ; he has been accustomed to bookselling , and at one time he also brought some of our Testaments from Gibraltar , all of which were however taken from him by the Custom House officers with the exception of one copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 reals ( 6s. 6d . ) . Should the Bible Society be desirous to circulate the book in the rural districts of Spain , they must be prepared to make considerable sacrifices . In some of the towns , especially the sea-ports , it is probable that many copies may be disposed of , at a fair price ; but can it be expected that amongst myriads , who are in want of the common necessaries of life , who are without food , fuel or clothing , and on whose wretched heads the horrors which civil war  --  and such a civil war  --  have principally fallen , men can have money for books ? I am willing to visit every part of Spain , and to risk my life a thousand times in laying God 's Word before the people , but I can promise no more . I have no extraordinary powers , indeed scarcely those allotted to the average of humanity ; God , it is true , can operate wonders by any instrument , but we must bide His will . I have had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English gentleman , who has for many years been established in a very important branch of business at Seville . He takes a warm interest in my mission , and has frequently informed me that nothing will afford him greater pleasure than to further the cause at this place and in the neighbourhood ; as he employs a vast number of individuals , I have little doubt that he has the power , as he certainly has the will . He is a virtuoso and possesses a singular collection of the ancient idols of Mexico , which bear a surprising resemblance to those used by the followers of the Buddhist superstition . In return for a translation of an Arabic inscription which I made for him , he presented me with a copy of the Cabalistic book Zohar , in the Rabbinical language and character , which on the destruction of the Inquisition at Seville ( 1820 ) he obtained from the library of that horrible tribunal .

I reached Cordova in three days , attended by the old Italian whom I mentioned in my last letter , for I could procure no other guide . From Cordova I have ridden to Madrid in the company of a contrabandista , or smuggler , whose horses I insured , and to whom I am to give a gratuity of 42 dollars . We passed through the horrible pass of Despena Perros in the Sierra Morena . Providence here manifested itself ; the day before , the banditti of the pass committed a dreadful robbery and murder by which they sacked 40,000 reals ; they were probably content with their booty and did not interrupt me and my guide . We entered La Mancha , where I expected to fall into the hands of Palillos and Orejita . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; suddenly the Lord breathed forth a frozen blast , the severity of which was almost intolerable ; no human being but ourselves ventured forth ; we traversed snow-covered plains and passed through villages and towns without seeing an individual ; the robbers kept close in their caves and hovels , but the cold nearly killed me . We reached Aranjuez late on Christmas day , and I got into the house of an Englishman , where I swallowed nearly two bottles of brandy ; it affected me no more than warm water . I am now at my journey 's end , and shall presently fall to work , for I must lose no time , but profit by the present opportunity . All is quiet in Madrid and in the neighbourhood ; Gomez has returned to Biscay . If my letter be somewhat incoherent , mind it not . I have just alighted , and the cold has still the mastery of me ; I shall send a journal in a few days which will be more circumstantial .

MY DEAR SIR ,  --  I forward the bill of my expenses from the moment of my quitting London up to the time of my arrival at Madrid .

I beg leave to call your attention particularly to the expense of horse-hire .

I asked him if it were his opinion that I might venture to commence printing the Scriptures without an application to the present Government , as the law is doubtful on the point . His reply was satisfactory : ' You obtained the permission of the Government of Isturitz , ' said he , ' which was a much less liberal one than the present ; I am a witness to the promise made to you by the former Ministers , which I consider sufficient ; you had best commence and complete the work as soon as possible , without any fresh application , and should any one attempt to interrupt you , you have only to come to me , whom you may command at any time .

You will remember that I brought over specimens of paper from thirty to eighty reals per ream , and that I was authorised to purchase 600 197 reams of paper at 60 reals per ream . I asked Mr. O'Shea if he did not think that , through his connections , he could procure me such paper as I wanted at a much cheaper rate than it was possible for me to obtain it ; he said he would make enquiries . I returned in a few days : he had performed more than I expected , and he showed me paper at 45 reals , better than what I could have purchased at 70 , likewise some very good at 37 . I hesitated for some time between these two specimens ; I at length , however , determined to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate that in paper alone 9000 reals will have been saved to the funds of the Society , and at the same time a superior article have been procured . I found that during my absence from Madrid Mr. Wood had quitted Mr. Borrego , and had accepted a situation in another printing establishment ; but as Mr. Borrego is in possession of the only English press at Madrid , is moreover an intimate friend of Mr. O'Shea , and above all enjoys the good opinion of Mr. Villiers who interests himself in his welfare , I am determined to entrust the printing to him . Mr. Borrego has agreed to make a reduction of 10 reals per sheet in his estimate , which I consider very liberal conduct , as the former charge , considering the rate of printing at Madrid , was by no means high . We have resolved to print the work precisely the same in shape and size as the copy entrusted to my charge , except that we shall substitute single for double columns . I shall look over each sheet of the work myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition as possible I have engaged the literary assistance of Dr. Usoz , the gentleman who some time since addressed a letter to the Society , in which he expressed a wish to become a member . He is one of the best Castilian scholars in Madrid , and , as he feels zeal in the cause , will , I have no doubt , prove eminently useful . Any remuneration for his labour he will leave to the consideration of the Bible Society and myself . We shall commence printing within a few days , and I expect to have the work ready within ten weeks . Now permit me to propose a very important question to you . What is to be done with the volumes when the work shall have passed through the press ? As I am sure you will feel at a loss to give a satisfactory answer , allow me to propose the only plan which appears feasible . Believe me when I say that it is not the result of a few moments ' cogitation . I have mused on it much and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempest , in the cut-throat passes of the Morena , and on the plains of La Mancha , as I jogged along a little way ahead of the smuggler . It is this . As soon as the work is printed and bound , I will ride forth from Madrid into the wildest parts of Spain , where the Word is most wanted , and where it seems next to an impossibility to introduce it . I will go through the whole of the Asturias and Galicia , and along the entire line of the Pyrenees , not forgetting to visit every part of Biscay . To accomplish this I must have horses and a man to take care of them . To purchase horses will be much more economical than to hire them , as the hire of an animal for a journey of only thirty leagues generally amounts to nearly its full value ; the purchase of three horses will not amount to more than 36 pounds , and a servant may be obtained for 9d. per day and his board . I will take with me 1200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for little or much , to the wild people of the wild regions which I intend to visit . As for the rest of the edition it must be disposed of , if possible , in a different way  --  I may say the usual way ; part must be entrusted to booksellers , part to colporteurs , and a depot must be established at Madrid . Such work is every person 's work , and to any one may be confided the execution of it ; it is a mere affair of trade . What I wish to be employed in is what , I am well aware , no other individual will undertake to do : namely , to scatter the Word upon the mountains , amongst the valleys and the inmost recesses of the worst and most dangerous parts of Spain , where the people are more fierce , fanatic and , in a word , Carlist ,  --  parts where bookshops are unknown , and where none of those means can be resorted to for the spread of the Bible which can be used in the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I most humbly offer to the consideration of the Committee and yourself . I shall not feel at all surprised should it be disapproved of altogether ; but I wish it to be understood that in that event I could do nothing further than see the work through the press , as I am confident that whatever ardour and zeal I at present feel in the cause would desert me immediately , and that I should neither be able nor willing to execute anything which might be suggested . I wish to engage in nothing which would not allow me to depend entirely on myself . It would be heart-breaking to me to remain at Madrid , expending the Society 's money , with almost the certainty of being informed eventually by the booksellers and their correspondents that the work has no sale . In a word , to make sure that some copies find their way among the people I must be permitted to carry them to the people myself ; and what people have more need of Christian instruction than the inhabitants of the districts alluded to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased one of the horses which had brought us to Madrid . It is an exceedingly strong , useful animal , and as I had seen what it is capable of performing , I gave him the price which he demanded ( about 11 pounds , 17s . ) . It will go twelve leagues a day with ease , and carry three hundred-weight on its back . I am looking out for another , but shall of course make no further purchase until I hear from you . I confess I would sooner provide myself with mules , but they are very expensive creatures . In the first place , the original cost of a tolerable one amounts to 30 pounds ; and they , moreover , consume a vast quantity of fodder , at least two pecks of barley in the twenty-four hours with straw in proportion , and if they are stinted in their food they are of no manner of service ; the attendance which they require is likewise very irksome , as they must be fed once every four hours night and day ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vogue amongst the principal nobility . Hoping to hear from you soon , I remain , Revd. and dear Sir , most truly yours , G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Mar. 6 , 1837 ) MADRID , No. 16 CALLE SANT . IAGO , Feby. 27 , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I have received your letter of the 27th ult. containing the resolution of the Committee , and also yours of the 17th ult. with my account . I was exceedingly grieved at learning that poor Mr. Tarn has been removed , for he was a most worthy person , and the Bible Society will experience a severe loss in his death ; but I hope and trust that eventually some one will be found worthy to succeed him . He is doubtless at present in the other world receiving the reward of his faith in this ; let us pray that we may be counted worthy to join him there ! By the time these lines reach you the four Gospels will have passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperously , and I have little doubt that within five weeks it will be completed . I have already entered into arrangements respecting the binding with Mr. Borrego , who is about to unite bookbinding with printing ; the terms are very reasonable , considering the current prices of the country , as I am to pay but three reals per volume for a calf binding similar to that of the copy which was entrusted to me . I have reckoned that the expense of each book , printing , paper , and binding included , will but barely amount to 15 reals ; and cheaper than this it is utterly impossible to bring out a work of the size of the New Testament , handsomely and creditably in Spain . Within a few days I shall despatch letters circular to all the principal booksellers in Spain , specifying the nature , size and quality of the work , and inviting them to subscribe at 15 reals per copy , the prime cost ; for if anything will tempt them to a speculation of the kind , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet they are so short-sighted and , like all their countrymen , so utterly unacquainted with the rudiments of business , that it is by no means improbable that they , one and all , take no notice of this proposal , which is however the only plan which at present appears available for promoting the general circulation of the Scriptures . Dr. Usoz , the gentleman who is at present assisting me in the editing of the work in question , is very anxious to become a member and a correspondent of the Bible Society . His letter on that subject I translated and transmitted previous to my last visit to England , but he has never received an answer . I beg leave to say that I am extremely desirous that his request be granted , and that he be written to without delay ; and I must moreover beg to be furnished with a written or printed authority to establish a branch Bible Society in Madrid , and to nominate Dr. Usoz as secretary . That part of my last letter , where I stated my wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Biscays , as soon as the work should be completed , does not seem to have been clearly understood . I did not intend to devote myself entirely to the wild people , but to visit the villages and towns as well as the remote and secluded glens . I intended to take letters of introduction to some of the most respectable people of Oviedo , of Corunna , of Lugo , of Vigo , Pontevedro , Barbastro , Bilboa , etc. , and to establish depots of Bibles in those towns ; but in my way I intended to visit the secret and secluded spots amongst the rugged hills and mountains , and to talk to the people , after my manner , of Christ and to explain to them the nature of His book , and to place that book in the hands of those whom I should deem capable of deriving benefit from it . True it is that such a journey would be attended with considerable danger , and very possibly the fate of St. Stephen might befall the adventurer ; but does the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink from danger of any kind in the cause of Him whom he calls his Master ? ' He who loses his life for My sake , shall save it , ' are words which the Lord Himself uttered , and words surely fraught with consolation to every one engaged in propagating His Gospel in savage and barbarian lands . About a fortnight since I purchased another horse , for these animals are at present exceedingly cheap . A royal requisition is about to be issued for 5000 , and the consequence is that an immense number are for sale ; for by virtue of this requisition the horses of any person not a foreigner can be seized for the benefit of the service . It is probable that when the number is made up the price of horses will be treble what it is at present , which consideration induced me to purchase this animal before I exactly want him . He is a black Andalusian stallion of great size and strength , and capable of performing a journey of 100 leagues in a week 's time , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo of Bibles which I hope shortly to put on his back will , I have no doubt , thoroughly tame him , especially when labouring up the flinty hills of the north of Spain . I wished to purchase a mule , according to my instructions , but though I offered 30 pounds for a sorry one , I could not obtain her ; whereas the cost of both the horses , tall , powerful , stately animals , scarcely amounted to that sum . I will now say a few words respecting the state of Spain , though what I communicate will probably startle you , as in England you are quite in the dark respecting what is going on here . At the moment I am writing , Cabrera , the tiger-friar , is within nine leagues of Madrid with an army nearly ten thousand strong ; he has beaten the Queen 's troops in several engagements , and has ravaged La Mancha with fire and sword , burning several towns ; bands of affrighted fugitives are arriving every hour bringing tidings of woe and disaster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by taking Madrid , which is at his mercy , put an end to the war at once . But the truth is , the Carlist generals do not wish the war to cease ; for as long as the country is involved in bloodshed and anarchy , they can plunder and exercise that lawless authority so dear to men of fierce and brutal passions . Cabrera is a wretch whose sole enjoyment consists in inflicting pain and torture and causing woe and misery to his fellow creatures ; he is one of the instruments of the anger of the Almighty , a scourge in the hand of Providence to chastise a land whose wickedness had become intolerable . For the elect 's sake , and there are a few even in Spain , may it please the Lord to shorten the affliction of these days , or all flesh must succumb . I remain , dear Sir , most truly yours , G. B. P.S.  --  Pray let me hear from you shortly , and remember me particularly to Mr. Jowett and Mr. Browne . P.S. 2.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing and paper , as you will have concluded by my draft . The Gospel of Saint Luke , in the Rommany language , is nearly ready for the press . It is my intention to subjoin a vocabulary of all the words used , with an explanation in the Spanish language . Before I left England I was authorised to look out for a person competent to translate the Scriptures in Basque ( Spanish ) . I am acquainted with a gentleman who is well versed in that dialect , of which I myself have some knowledge . Perhaps it would not be unwise to engage him to translate St. Luke as a trial of his powers . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Mar. 25 , 1837 ) MADRID , No. 16 CALLE SANT IAGO PISO 3RO . March 16th , 1837 . REVD . SIR ,  --  I write a few lines for the purpose of informing you that the New Testament in Castilian will be ready in a few days , probably before you receive this epistle , should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible and distracted state of Spain at the present time . The work has been printed on the best paper , and no pains have been spared , at least on my part , to render it as correct as possible , having read every proof-sheet three times . I must here take the liberty of observing that the work executed in London , and of which a copy was delivered to me to print from , abounds in errors of every kind and reflects little credit on the person who edited it ; no systematic order is observed either in the orthography or the use of accents or capitals , and whole sentences frequently appear in a mangled and mutilated state which renders them unintelligible . On my final settlement with Mr. Borrego I shall send a regular account of my disbursements ; he has already received two-thirds of his money , as you will have conjectured from the bills I have drawn .

AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enclosed letter , and making what use of it you please , to seal it , pay the postage , and despatch it to Russia . It contains all I have at present to say , and is as much intended for yourself , as for the person to whom it is directed . I leave Madrid in about three days , and it is my intention to write frequently whilst upon my journey ; but should few letters reach you , be not surprised , but attribute it to the state of the country , which is terrible indeed . I am first going to Salamanca , by the pass of the Guadarama ; from thence to Burgos ; then to the Asturias , Galicia , and Biscay , and along the whole chain of the Pyrenees . Some hundreds of our books have been placed in the hands of a bookseller at Madrid , and I have ordered them to be advertised , once a week , in the principal journals . Dr. Usoz and another friend will do what they can in my absence . To-morrow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been despatched sooner , but I could not obtain my account from Mr. O'Shea . I remain , Revd. and dear Sir , most faithfully yours , G. BORROW . P.S.  --  My best remembrances to Mr. Jowett , Mr. Browne , and all my friends . @# @# To Mr. John Hasfeldt @# MADRID , 29 April , 1837 . I received your letter of last January a few weeks since , and I sincerely hope that mine of February may have reached your hands . The principal reason of my taking up the pen at present is the long and adventurous journey which I am about to engage in , and which I am afraid will preclude the possibility of my writing to you for some months . In a few days I quit Madrid , it being my intention to visit the mountainous districts of Spain , particularly Galicia and the Basque Provinces , for the purpose of disposing of part of the edition of the New Testament in Spanish , lately completed at Madrid , under my superintendence . It was my intention to have set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that I thought it more prudent to defer my departure ; during the last two months violent and bitter winds have blown without ceasing , before whose baneful influence animal and vegetable nature seems to have quailed . I was myself , during a fortnight , prostrated , body and limb , by a violent attack of la grippe , or , as it is styled in English , the ' influenza . ' I am , however , by the blessing of the Almighty , perfectly recovered and enjoying excellent spirits , but multitudes less favoured have perished , especially the poor . I expect to be absent on my journey about five months , when , if I am spared , not having fallen a prey to sickness , Carlists , banditti , or wild beasts , I shall return to Madrid for the purpose of carrying through the press my own translation of the Gospel of St. Luke in the language of the Spanish Gypsies , and also the same Gospel in Cantabrian or Basque , executed by the domestic physician of the Marquis of Salvatierra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I should wish to visit China by a land journey , either through Russia , or by Constantinople and Armenia as far as the Indian Gulf ; as it is my opinion that , with God 's permission , I might sow some seed by the way which might in time yield a good harvest . Speaking of these matters reminds me that in your next letter ( written in your usual choice Danish ) you might send me some useful information respecting what might be done in Russia . Do you think permission might be obtained to print the New Testament in Russ , and that the Russian Hierarchy would be inclined to offer any serious opposition ? I wish you would speak to Gretsch on the subject , to whom you will , as usual , present my kindest remembrances . I believe you are acquainted with Mrs. Biller , but if not , you would confer a great favour upon me by calling on her , and requesting her opinion , as she is better acquainted than perhaps any person in Russia with the course to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps at the same time you will enquire of her as to what has become of my translation into Russ of the second and third Homilies which I left with her , and whether license to print has been obtained . If not , I should wish that energetic steps be taken to that effect , and as you are an energetic person , and she may possibly have too many important affairs upon her hands , I pray you to take the matter up , but at all events to follow her advice ; pray remember me to her likewise . The translation was corrected by that unfortunate man Nicanoff , who , though he lived and died a drunkard , was an excellent Russian scholar ; therefore I think that no objection can reasonably be made in respect to style , though indeed the original is very plain and homely , being adapted to the most common understanding . I offer no apology for giving you all this trouble , as I am fully aware that you are at all times eagerly ready to perform anything which I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , I am sorry to say , is in a more distracted and convulsed situation than at any former period , and the prospect is gloomy in the extreme . The Queen 's troops have sustained of late grievous defeats in the Basque provinces and Valencia , and a Carlist expedition of 18,000 men , whose object is to ravage Castile and to carry the war to the gates of Madrid , is shortly expected to pass the Ebro . From what I have seen and heard of the demoralised state of the Cristinos forces , I believe they will meet with no effectual resistance , and that Cristina and her daughter will be compelled to flee from the capital to Cadiz , or to some strong frontier town . Nevertheless , such is the nature of the Spanish people , that it is impossible to say whether the liberal cause ( as it is called ) be desperate or not , as neither one party nor the other knows how to improve an advantage . Twice might Don Carlos have marched to Madrid and seized the crown ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cristinos ; yet still is the affair undecided , and will perhaps continue so for years . The country is , as you may well conceive , in a most distracted state ; robbery and murder are practised with impunity , and the roads are in such an insecure state that almost all communication has ceased between one town and another ; yet I am going forth without the slightest fear , trusting in God ; for if He is with me , who shall stand against me ? I have a servant , a person who has been a soldier for fifteen years , who will go with me for the purpose of attending to the horses and otherwise assisting me in my labours . His conduct on the journey is the only thing to which I look forward with uneasiness ; for though he has some good points , yet in many respects a more atrocious fellow never existed . He is inordinately given to drink , and of so quarrelsome a disposition that he is almost constantly involved in some broil . Like most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frequently unsheaths and brandishes in the faces of those who are unfortunate enough to awaken his choler . It is only a few days since that I rescued the maid-servant of the house from his grasp , whom otherwise he would undoubtedly have killed , and all because she too much burnt a red herring which he had given her to cook . You perhaps wonder that I retain a person of this description , but , bad as he is , he is the best servant I can obtain ; he is very honest , a virtue which is rarely to be found in a Spanish servant , and I have no fear of his running away with the horses during the journey , after having perhaps knocked me on the head in some lone posada . He is moreover acquainted with every road , cross-road , river , and mountain in Spain , and is therefore a very suitable squire for an errant knight , like myself . On my arrival in Biscay I shall perhaps engage one of the uncorrupted Basque peasants , who has never left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , for I am told that they are exceedingly faithful and laborious . The best servant I ever had was the Tartar Mahmoud at St. Petersburg , and I have frequently repented that I did not bring him with me on my leaving Russia ; but I was not then aware that I was about to visit this unfortunate country , where goodness of every description is so difficult to find . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . May 23 , 1837 ) MADRID , May 10th , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I herewith send the long promised account of my private expenses , which I hope will be found correct . I start to-morrow for Salamanca , at which place I should now be , but for the misconduct of my servant , whom I have been compelled to turn away .

Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . June 21 , 1837 ) SALAMANCA , June 7 , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I arrived at Salamanca about a fortnight since , in safety and in tolerable good health . I shall defer for a few days communicating the particulars of my journey , though they are not destitute of interest , having at present information to afford which I consider of more importance , and which I hope will afford the same satisfaction to yourself and our friends at home which I myself experience in communicating them . Some days previous to my departure from Madrid I was very much indisposed . Owing to the state of the weather  --  for violent and biting winds had long prevailed  --  I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable cough , which the many remedies which I successively tried were unable to subdue . I had made preparation for departing on a particular day , but owing to the state of my health I was apprehensive that I should be compelled to postpone my journey for a time . The last day of my stay in Madrid , finding myself scarcely able to stand , I was fain to submit to a somewhat desperate experiment , and by the advice of the barber-surgeon who visited me , I determined to be bled . Late on the night of that same day he eased me of sixteen ounces of blood , and having received his fee , left me , wishing me a pleasant journey , and assuring me upon his reputation that by noon the next day I should be perfectly recovered . A few minutes after his departure , whilst I was sitting alone , meditating on the journey which I was about to undertake , and on the rickety state of my health , I heard a loud knock at the street-door of the house , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very comfortably . In a minute or two Mr. Southern of the British Embassy entered my apartment . After a little conversation he informed me that Mr. Villiers had desired him to wait upon me , to communicate a resolution which he , Mr. Villiers , had come to . Being apprehensive that alone and unassisted I should experience considerable difficulty in propagating the Gospel of God to any considerable extent in Spain , he was bent upon exerting to the utmost his own credit and influence to further my views , which he himself considered , if carried into proper effect , extremely well calculated to operate beneficially on the political and moral state of the country . To this end it was his intention to purchase a very considerable number of copies of the New Testament , and to despatch them forthwith to the various British consuls established in different parts of Spain , with strict and positive orders to employ all the means , which their official situation should afford them , to circulate the books in question and to assure their being noticed . They were moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in their respective districts , all the protection , encouragement , and assistance I should stand in need of , as a friend of Mr. Villiers , and a person in the success of whose enterprise he himself took the warmest interest . I could scarcely believe my ears on receiving this information ; for though I had long been aware that Mr. Villiers was at all times willing to assist me , he having frequently given me sufficient proof , I could never expect that he would come forward in so noble , and to say the least of it , considering his high diplomatic situation , so bold and decided a manner . I believe that this is the first instance of a British Ambassador having made the cause of the Bible Society a national one , or indeed to favour it directly or indirectly . What renders the case of Mr. Villiers more remarkable is that on my first arrival at Madrid I found him by no means well disposed towards the Society . The Holy Spirit has probably illumined his mind on this point . Honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our institution will shortly possess many agents in Spain with far more power and opportunity than I myself can ever expect to possess , who will scatter abroad the seed of the Gospel , and make of a barren and thirsty wilderness a green and smiling corn-field . The next day verified the prediction of the barber . I had to a considerable degree lost my cough and fever , though , owing to the great loss of blood , I was very feeble and weak . Precisely at twelve o'clock myself and man rode forth from the gate of Saint Vincent , directing our course to the lofty mountains which separate Old from New Castile . That night we rested at Guadarama , a large village at their foot , distant from Madrid about twenty-five miles . The journey to Salamanca occupied four days , and I disposed of five Testaments by the way . Since my arrival at Salamanca I have been taking measures that the Word of God may become generally known in this place , so celebrated in many respects . The principal bookseller of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has consented to become our agent here , and I have deposited in his shop a certain number of New Testaments . He is the proprietor of a small printing press , where the official bulletin of the place is published . For this bulletin I have prepared an advertisement of the work , in which amongst other things I have said that the New Testament is the only guide to salvation . I have also spoken of the Bible Society , and the great pecuniary sacrifices which it is making with the view of proclaiming Christ crucified , and of making His doctrine known . This step will perhaps be considered by some as too bold , but I am not aware that I can take any more calculated to arouse the attention of the people  --  a considerable point . I have also ordered numbers of the same advertisement to be struck off in the shape of bills which I am causing to be stuck up in various parts of the town . I have great hope that by means of these a considerable number of New Testaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valladolid , Leon , St. Jago , and all the principal towns which it is my intention to visit in my wanderings , and I shall likewise distribute them as I ride along . The children of Spain will thus be brought to know that such a work as the New Testament is in existence , a fact of which not five in one hundred are at present aware , notwithstanding their so frequently repeated boasts of their Catholicity and Christianity . I carry with me the Gospel of St. Luke in the Cantabrian or Basque language . It is my intention to print this little book , either at San Sebastian or Pamplona ; as it would be unwise not to avail myself of so favourable an opportunity of circulating it as my visit to the provinces where the language is spoken will afford me . I have examined it with much attention , and find it a very faithful version . The only objection which can be brought against it is that Spanish words are frequently used to express ideas for which there are equivalents in Basque ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very corrupt , and a work written entirely in the Basque of Larramendi 's Dictionary would be intelligible to very few . I have read passages from it to the men of Guipuscoa , who assured me that they had no difficulty in understanding it , and that it was written in the colloquial style of their province . G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . July 25 , 1837 ) ASTORGA , 5th July , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I avail myself of the present opportunity of giving an account of what has befallen me since I last wrote to you from Salamanca , which I shortly after quitted . By that time my advertisements had been affixed in all parts of the city , and several New Testaments had been sold ; I myself had the pleasure of seeing three despatched in less than a quarter of an hour that I remained in the shop . From Salamanca I proceeded to Valladolid , distant about twenty-five leagues , where I employed the same means which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Word . I must here observe that Valladolid is a place where literature of every description is at the lowest ebb , and bookselling there is merely carried on in connexion with other business , it being in itself quite insufficient to afford a livelihood to those who pursue it . Nevertheless during the five days that I continued there my labours were so far favoured that twenty copies were disposed of , and a fair prospect opened that many more would be demanded . Before leaving I gave orders that the advertisements should be renewed every week , as evil-disposed , persons probably of the Carlist or Papist party , had defaced or torn down a great number of those which had been put up . From pursuing this course I expect that much and manifold good will accrue , as the people of these parts will have continual opportunities of acquainting themselves that a book which contains the living word is in existence and within their reach , which may induce them to secure it and consult it even unto salvation . Quitting Valladolid , I directed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the way was barren and uninteresting to a high degree , consisting of wide dusty plains scantily sown with barley , but unrelieved with trees or waters . The people are ignorant and brutal , though they boast themselves to be Old Castilians , which is however not the fact , as these desolate and benighted regions belong to what was once the kingdom of Leon . Their inhospitality is so great that I have been refused a glass of water in their villages , though I asked it in the name of God ; though I have subsequently obtained it by paying for it , for their hearts can always be opened by the key of interest , though inaccessible to every noble and generous sentiment . I suffered dreadfully during this journey , as did likewise my man and horses , for the heat was the fiercest which I have ever known , and resembled the breath of the simoom or the air from an oven 's mouth . Leon is beautifully situated in a smiling blooming country abounding in grass and trees , and watered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountains in the neighbourhood , which traverse a great part of Spain and are connected with the Pyrenees ; but unfortunately it is exceedingly unhealthy , for the heats of the summer-time raise noxious exhalations from the waters , which generate all kinds of disorders , especially fevers and tertian agues . It is the Feversham of Spain . Nomen cui infausta Fata dedere febris sic . I had scarcely been at Leon three days when I was seized with a fever , against which I thought the strength even of my constitution would have yielded ; for it wore me almost to a skeleton , and when it departed , at the end of about a week , left me in such a deplorable state of weakness that I was scarcely able to make the slightest exertion . I had however previously persuaded a bookseller to undertake the charge of vending the Testaments , and had published my advertisements as usual , though without very fervent hope of success , as Leon is a place where the inhabitants , with very few exceptions , are furious Carlists and ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , moreover , a Bishop 's see , which was once enjoyed by the prime councillor of Don Carlos , whose fierce and bigoted spirit still seems to pervade the place . Scarcely had the advertisements appeared when the clergy were in motion ; they went from house to house , banning and cursing and denouncing misery on whomsoever should either purchase or read ' the accursed books ' which had been sent into the country by heretics for the purpose of perverting the innocent minds of the population . They did more : they commenced a process against the bookseller in the ecclesiastical court . Fortunately this court is not at present in the possession of much authority , and the bookseller , who is a bold and determined man , set them at defiance , and went so far as to affix an advertisement to the gate of the very cathedral . Notwithstanding the cry raised against the work several copies were sold at Leon , two were purchased by ex-friars , and the same number by parochial priests from neighbouring villages . I believe the whole number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my visit to this dark corner has not been altogether in vain , as the seed of the Gospel has been sown , though sparingly . But the palpableness of the darkness which envelops Leon is truly lamentable , and the ignorance of the people is so great that printed charms and incantations against Satan and his host and against every kind of misfortune are publicly sold in the shops and are in great demand ; such are the results of Popery , a delusion which more than any other has tended to debase and brutalise the human mind . I had scarcely risen from the bed where the fever had cast me , when I found that my servant had become alarmed ; he informed me that he had seen several soldiers in the uniform of Don Carlos knocking at the door of the posada , and that they had been making enquiries concerning me . It was indeed a singular fact connected with Leon that upwards of fifty of these fellows , who had on various accounts left the ranks of the pretender , were walking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence which the certainty of the protection of the local authorities could afford them , should any one be disposed to interrupt them . He moreover informed me that the person in whose house we were living was a notorious alcahuete , or spy to the robbers in the neighbourhood , and that unless we took our departure speedily and unexpectedly , we should to a certainty be plundered on the road . I did not pay much attention to these hints , but my desire to quit Leon was great , as I was convinced that as long as I continued there I should be unable to regain my health and vigour . Accordingly , at three o'clock in the morning of the fourth ( yesterday ) we departed , taking the route for Lugo , a principal town in the province of Galicia . We had scarcely proceeded half a league when we were overtaken by a thunderstorm of tremendous violence . We were at that time in the midst of a kind of wood which extends to some distance in that direction . The trees were bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , whilst the ground was plowed up by the lightning which burst all around and nearly blinded us . The horse which I rode upon , which was a spirited Andalusian stallion , became furious and bounded into the air as if possessed ; owing to my state of weakness I had the greatest difficulty in maintaining my seat and in avoiding a fall which might have been fatal . A tremendous discharge of rain followed the storm , which swelled the brooks into streams and flooded the surrounding country , causing great damage amongst the corn . After riding about five leagues we began to enter the mountainous district which surrounds Astorga ; the road was flinty and very trying to the poor horses , who suffered much , whilst the heat was suffocating . It was with the utmost difficulty that we reached Astorga , covered with mud and dust and our tongues cleaving to the roofs of our mouths from thirst . We were compelled to take up our abode in a wretched hovel , full of pigs , vermin , and misery , and from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to proceed on my journey , being exhausted with illness , fatigue and want of food , for scarcely anything is to be obtained . But I return God thanks and glory for being permitted to undergo these crosses and troubles for His Word 's sake . I would not exchange my present situation , unenviable as some may think it , for a throne . Pray excuse the style and writing of this letter , both are inevitably bad . I hope in a few days to have reached Lugo , where I shall be more at my ease . GEORGE BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd. 12th August 1837 ) CORUNNA , 20th July 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  My last letter was dated from Astorga , and I stated that I was suffering from the relics of the fever which had assailed me at Leon ; in a day or two , however , I was sufficiently recovered to mount my horse and proceed on my journey to Lugo . I shall send a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , interested in Bible proceedings in Spain , may gather some idea of this very strange country and people . I arrived safely at Lugo , but much fatigued , for the way thither lay through the wildest mountains and wildernesses . The Lord deigned to favour my humble efforts at Lugo ; I brought thither thirty Testaments , all of which were disposed of in one day , the Bishop of the place himself purchasing two copies , whilst several priests and friars , instead of following the example of their brethren at Leon by persecuting the work , spoke well of it , and recommended its perusal . I was much grieved that my stock of these holy books was exhausted , for there was a great demand for them ; and had I been able to supply them , quadruple the quantity might have been sold during the four days that I remained at Lugo . Midway between Lugo and Corunna I was near falling into the hands of robbers . Two fellows suddenly confronted me with presented carbines , which they probably intended to discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise of my servant 's horse , who was following a little way behind . This affair occurred at the bridge Castellanos , a spot notorious for robbery and murder , and well adapted for both , for it stands at the bottom of a deep dell surrounded by wild desolate hills . Only a quarter of an hour previous , I had passed three ghastly heads , stuck on poles standing by the wayside ; they were those of a captain of banditti and two of his men , who had been seized and executed about two months before . Their principal haunt was the vicinity of the bridge I have already spoken of , and it was their practice to cast the bodies of the murdered into the deep black water which runs rapidly beneath . These three beads will always live in my remembrance , particularly that of the captain , which stood on a higher pole than the other two ; the long hair was waving in the wind , and the blackened distorted features were grinning in the sun . The fellows whom I met were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred Testaments at Corunna , from which it is my intention to supply the principal towns of Galicia . I have as usual published my advertisements , and the work enjoys a tolerable sale  --  seven or eight copies per day on the average . Perhaps some will say that these are small matters and not worthy of being mentioned ; but let these bethink them that till within a few months the very existence of the Gospel was almost unknown in Spain , and that it must necessarily be a difficult task to induce a people like the Spaniards , who read very little and who in general consider money expended in books of any kind as cast away , to purchase a work like the New Testament , offering them little prospect of amusement , and which , though the basis of all true religion , they have never been told is useful as a guide to salvation . Let us hope that the present is the dawning of better and more enlightened times , and though little has been accomplished , still it is more than nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Madrid to the northernmost part of Galicia , a distance of nearly four hundred miles . In about a fortnight I shall depart for Santiago , where I intend to pass several days ; then retracing my steps to Corunna I shall visit Ferrol , whence I shall perhaps shape my course for Oviedo in the Asturias , either along the seashore or by the mountain route , in which latter case I should have to revisit Lugo . Every part of Galicia abounds with robbers and factious , so that almost all travelling is at an end , and the road to Santiago is so bad that no one is permitted to travel it unless in company with the weekly post , which goes attended by a strong military escort . This gives me some uneasiness , as the stallion I ride is so vicious and furious that it is dangerous to bring him in contact with other horses whom , with the exception of his companion , he invariably attacks , getting me into all manner of scrapes . An old Castilian peasant , whose pony he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you have any love for yourself , get rid of that beast , who is capable of proving the ruin of a kingdom . ' But he is a gallant creature who seldom tires , and he has borne me too far to permit me to think of parting with him . Since my arrival at Corunna I have received advice from my agent at Valladolid that the forty copies which I deposited in his hands have been sold , and that he was anxious for a fresh supply . I have accordingly ordered fifty more to be sent him from Madrid . Since my departure from the capital I have myself disposed of sixty-five , without including those sold at Lugo and other places by means of the advertisements , on which I principally rely , as they speak at all times whether I am present or absent . I wish it to be distinctly understood that throughout my journey I have given away none of the books , having invariably received money for them , viz. , from 10 to 12 reals . The enemies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no vent for the Bibles and Testaments which it publishes in many foreign languages but by sending them to the various countries , and there distributing them gratis or selling them by auction , when they are bought for waste paper ( see in particular Wiseman 's Letters ) . My conduct in this point has been principally influenced by a desire to give , in the case of Spain at least , the direct lie to this assertion , and this conduct I shall pursue until I receive direct orders to abandon it . I will now conclude by repeating that in a few days you will receive my journal , which will prove more interesting than the above hasty scrawl . I remain , etc. , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. Andrew Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Aug. 23 , 1837 ) Journey from Astorga to Lugo Before proceeding to narrate what befell me in this journey , it will perhaps not be amiss to say a few words concerning Astorga and its vicinity . It is a walled town containing about five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which last is , however , at present deserted . It is situated on the confines , and may be called the capital , of a tract of land called the country of the Maragatos , which occupies about three square leagues , and has for its north-western boundary a mountain called Telleno , the loftiest of a chain of hills which have their origin near the mouth of the river Minho , and are connected with the immense range which constitutes the frontier of the Asturias and Guipuscoa . The land is ungrateful and barren , and niggardly repays the toil of the cultivator , being for the most part rocky , with a slight sprinkling of a red bricky earth . The Maragatos are perhaps the most singular caste to be found amongst the chequered population of Spain . They have their own peculiar customs and dress , and never intermarry with the Spaniards . Their name is a clue to their origin , as it signifies ' Moorish Goths , ' and at this present day their garb differs but little from that of the Moors of Barbary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured at the waist by a broad girdle ; loose short trowsers which terminate at the knee , and boots and gaiters . Their heads are shaven , a slight fringe of hair being only left at the lower part . If they wore the turban , or barret , they could scarcely be distinguished from the Moors in dress , but in lieu thereof they wear the sombrero or broad slouching hat of Spain . There can be little doubt that they are a remnant of those Goths who sided with the Moors on their invasion of Spain , and who adopted their religion , customs , and manner of dress , which , with the exception of the first , are still to a considerable degree retained . It is , however , evident that their blood has at no time mingled with that of the wild children of the desert , for scarcely amongst the hills of Norway would you find figures and faces more essentially Gothic than those of the Maragatos . They are strong , athletic men , but loutish and heavy , and their features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoid of expression . They are slow and plain in speech , and those eloquent and imaginative sallies so common in the conversation of other Spaniards seldom or never escape them ; they have , moreover , a coarse , thick pronunciation , and when you hear them speak , you almost imagine that it is some German or English peasant attempting to express himself in the language of the Peninsula . They are constitutionally phlegmatic , and it is very difficult to arouse their anger ; but they are dangerous and desperate when once incensed , and a person who knew them well told me that he would rather face ten Valencians , people infamous for their ferocity and blood-thirstiness , than confront one angry Maragato , sluggish and stupid though he be on other occasions . The men scarcely ever occupy themselves in husbandry , which they abandon to the females , who plough the flinty fields and gather in the scanty harvests . Their husbands and sons are far differently employed , for they are a nation of arrieros or carriers , and almost esteem it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain , particularly those north of the mountains which divide the two Castiles , may be seen gangs of fives and sixes of these people lolling or sleeping beneath the broiling sun on their gigantic and heavily laden mutes and mules , the boast of Spain , but dearly purchased by the debasement and degeneration of a once noble breed of horses . In a word , almost the entire commerce of nearly one half of Spain passes through the hands of the Maragatos , whose fidelity to their trust is such that no one accustomed to employ them would hesitate to entrust them with the transport of a ton of treasure from the sea of Biscay to Madrid , knowing well that it would not be their fault were it not delivered safe and undiminished even of a grain , and that bold must be the thieves who would seek to wrest it from the far-feared Maragatos , who would cling to it whilst they could stand , and would cover it with their bodies when they fell in the act of loading or discharging their long carbines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the most trustworthy of all the arrieros of Spain , they in general demand for the transport of articles a sum at least double of what others of the trade would esteem a reasonable recompense . By this means they accumulate large sums of money , notwithstanding that they indulge themselves in a far superior fare to that which contents in general the parsimonious Spaniard  --  another argument in favour of their pure Gothic descent ; for the Maragatos , like true men of the north , delight in swilling liquors and battening upon gross and luscious meats , which help to swell out their tall and goodly figures . Many of them have died possessed of considerable riches , part of which they have not unfrequently bequeathed to the erection or embellishment of religious houses . On the east end of the cathedral of Astorga , which towers over the lofty and precipitous wall , a colossal figure of lead may be seen on the roof . It is the statue of a Maragato carrier , who endowed the cathedral with a large sum . He is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of his fathers , and whilst he waves in his hand a species of flag , he seems to be summoning his race from their unfruitful region to other climes where a richer field is open to their industry and enterprise . I spoke to several of these men respecting the all-important subject of religion ; but ' I found their hearts blunted , and with their ears they heard heavily , and their eyes were closed . ' There was one in particular to whom I showed the New Testament and addressed for a considerable time . He listened , or seemed to listen , patiently , taking occasional copious draughts from an immense jug of whitish wine which stood between his knees . After I had concluded , he said : ' To-morrow I set out for Lugo , whither I am told yourself are going . If you wish to send your chest , I have no objection to take it at so much ( naming an extravagant price ) . As for what you have told me , I understand little of it and believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books which you have shown me , I will take three or four . I shall not read them , it is true , but I have no doubt that I can sell them at a higher price than you demand . ' So much for the Maragatos . It was four o'clock of a beautiful morning that we sallied from Astorga , or rather from the suburbs in which we had been lodged ; we directed our course to the north in the direction of Galicia . Leaving the mountain Telleno on our left , we passed along the eastern skirts of the land of the Maragatos over broken uneven ground , enlivened here and there by small green valleys and runs of water . Several of the Maragato women mounted on donkeys passed us on their way to Astorga whither they were carrying vegetables ; we saw others in the fields handling their rude ploughs drawn by lean oxen ; we likewise passed through a small village in which we however saw no living soul . Near this village we entered the high road which leads direct from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four leagues we came to a species of pass formed on our left by a huge lumpish hill ( one of those which descend from the great mountain Telleno ) , and on our right by one of considerably less altitude . In the middle of this pass which was of considerable breadth , a noble view opened itself to us . Before us , at the distance of about a league and a half , rose the mighty frontier chain of which I have spoken before ; its blue sides and broken and picturesque peaks still wearing a thin veil of the morning mist , which the fierce rays of the sun were fast dispelling . It seemed an enormous barrier threatening to oppose our further progress , and it reminded me of the fables respecting the children of Magog , who are said to reside in remotest Tartary behind a gigantic wall of rocks which can only be passed by a gate of steel a thousand cubits in height . We shortly after arrived at Manzanal , a village consisting of wretched huts , and exhibiting every sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves and horses , and we accordingly put up at a kind of venta , the last habitation in the village , where , though we found barley for the animals , we had much difficulty in procuring anything for ourselves . I was at last fortunate enough to obtain a large jug of milk , for there were plenty of cows in the neighbourhood feeding in a picturesque valley which we had passed by , in which there was abundance of grass and trees and a run of water broken by tiny cascades . The jug might contain about half a gallon , but I emptied it in a few minutes , for the thirst of fever was still burning within me though I was destitute of appetite . The venta had something the appearance of a German baiting house . It consisted of an immense stable , from which was partitioned a kind of kitchen and a place where the family slept . The master , a robust young man , lolled on a large solid stone bench which stood within the door . He was very inquisitive respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became communicative , and gave me the history of his life , the sum of which was that he had been a courier in the Basque provinces , but about a year since had been despatched to this village where he kept the post-house . He was an enthusiastic liberal , and spoke in bitter terms of the surrounding population , who , he said , were all Carlists and friends of the friars . I paid little attention to his discourse , for I was looking at a Maragato lad of about fourteen who served in the house as a kind of ostler . I asked the master if we were still in the land of the Maragatos , but he told me that we had left it behind nearly a league , and that the lad was an orphan , and was serving until he could rake up a sufficient capital to become an arriero . I addressed several questions to the boy , but the urchin looked sullenly in my face , and either answered by monosyllables or was doggedly silent . I asked him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as much as that black brute of yours who is tearing down the manger . ' Quitting Manzanal , we continued our course , the ground gradually descending ; we soon arrived at a place where the road took a turn to the west , though previously it had tended due north . We now found that we had to descend the steep sides of a deep and narrow valley which wound amongst mountains , not those of the chain which we had seen before us and which we had left at our right , but those of the Telleno range , just before they unite with that chain . Arrived at the brink of the valley we turned into a foot-path , to avoid making a considerable circuit , for we saw the road on the other side of the valley opposite to us about a furlong distant , and the path appeared to lead direct towards it . We had not gone far before we met two Galicians on their way to cut the harvests of Castile . One of them shouted , ' Cavalier , turn back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your horses will break their necks , for we ourselves could scarcely climb them on foot . ' The other cried , ' Cavalier , proceed , but be careful , and your horses , if sure-footed , will run no great danger ; my comrade is a fool . ' A violent dispute instantly ensued between the two mountaineers , each supporting his opinion with loud oaths and curses ; but without stopping to see the result I passed on . But the path was now filled with stones and huge slaty rocks , on which my horse slid , frequently on his haunches . I likewise heard the sound of water in a deep gorge , which I had hitherto not perceived , and I soon saw that it would be worse than madness to proceed . I turned my horse and was hastening to regain the path which I had left , when Antonio , my faithful Greek , pointed out to me a meadow , by which he said we might regain the high road much lower down than if we returned on our steps . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle there was a small rivulet of water . I spurred my horse on , expecting to be in the high road in a moment ; the horse , however , snorted and stared wildly , and was evidently unwilling to cross the seemingly inviting spot . I thought that the scent of a wolf or some other wild animal might have disturbed him , but was soon undeceived by his sinking up to the knees in a bog . The animal uttered a shrill sharp neigh , and exhibited every sign of the greatest terror , making at the same time great efforts to extricate himself , and plunging forward , but every moment sinking deeper . At last he arrived where a small vein of rock showed itself , on this he placed his fore feet , and with one tremendous exertion freed himself from the deceitful soil , springing over the rivulet and alighting on comparatively firm ground , where he stood panting , his heaving sides covered with a foamy sweat . Antonio , who had been a terrified observer of the whole scene , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came and shortly afterwards rejoined me . This adventure brought to my recollection the meadow with its foot-path , which tempted Christian from the straight road to heaven , and finally conducted him to the dominions of the Giant Despair . No hay atajo Sin trabajo . ' There is no short cut Without some deep rut. ' says the Spanish proverb . We now began to descend the valley by a broad and excellent carretera , or carriage road , which was cut out of the steep side of the mountain on our right . On our left was the gorge , down which tumbled the run of water which I have before mentioned . The road was tortuous , and at every turn the scene became more picturesque . The gorge gradually widened , and the brook at its bottom , fed by a multitude of springs , grew more considerable ; but it was soon far beneath us , pursuing its headlong course till it reached level ground , where it flowed in the midst of a beautiful but confined prairie . There was something silvan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foot to pinnacle with trees , so closely growing that the eye was unable to obtain a glimpse of the hill-sides which were uneven with ravines and gulleys , the haunts of the wolf , the wild boar and the corso or mountain-stag ; the last of which , as I was informed by a peasant who was driving a car of oxen , frequently descended to feed in the prairie and were shot for the sake of their skins , for the flesh being strong and disagreeable is held at no account . But notwithstanding the wildness of these regions , the handiworks of man were visible . The sides of the gorge though precipitous were yellow with little fields of barley , and we saw a hamlet and church down in the prairie below , whilst merry songs ascended to our ears from where the mowers were toiling with their scythes , cutting the luxuriant and abundant grass . I could scarcely believe that I was in Spain , in general so brown , so arid and cheerless , and I almost fancied myself in Greece , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery Theocritus has so well described . At the bottom of the valley we entered a small village washed by the brook , which had now swelled almost to a stream . A more romantic situation I had never witnessed . It was surrounded and almost overhung by huge mountains , and embowered in trees of various kinds ; waters sounded , nightingales sang , and the cuckoo 's full note boomed from the distant branches , but the village was miserable . The huts were built of slate-stones , of which the neighbouring hills seemed to be principally composed , and roofed with the same , but not in the neat tidy manner of English houses , for the slates were of all sizes , and seemed to be flung on in confusion . We were spent with heat and thirst , and sitting down on a stone bench I entreated a woman to give us a little water . The woman said she would , but added that she expected to be paid for it . My Greek on hearing this burst into horrid execrations , and speaking Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heartless woman , saying ' If I were to offer a Mahometan gold for a draught of water , he would dash it in my face ; and you are a Catholic with the stream running at your door . ' I told him to be silent , and giving the woman two cuartos repeated my request ; whereupon she took a pitcher , and , going to the stream , filled it with water . It tasted muddy and disagreeable , but it drowned the fever which was devouring me . We again mounted and proceeded on our way , which for a considerable distance lay along the margin of the stream , which now fell in small cataracts , now brawled over stones , and at other times ran dark and silent through deep pools overhung with tall willows  --  pools which seemed to abound with the finny tribe , for huge trout frequently sprang from the water catching the brilliant fly which skimmed along its deceitful surface . How delightful ! The sun was rolling high in the firmament , casting from its girdle of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering with their splendour ; but their fierceness was either warded off by the shadow of the trees or rendered innocuous either by the refreshing coolness which rose from the waters or by the gentle breezes which murmured at intervals over the meadows ' fanning the cheek or raising the hair ' of the wanderer . The hills gradually receded , till at last we entered a plain where tall grass was undulating , and mighty chestnut-trees in full blossom spread their giant and umbrageous boughs . Beneath many stood cars , the tired oxen prostrate on the ground , the cross-bar of the pole which they support pressing heavily on their heads , whilst their drivers were either employed in cooking or were enjoying a delicious siesta in the grass and shade . I went up to one of the largest of these groups and demanded of the individuals whether they were in need of the Testament of Jesus Christ . They stared at one another and then at me , till at last a young man who was dandling a long gun in his hands as he reclined demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enquiring whether I was a Catalan , ' for you speak hoarse , ' said he , ' and are tall and fair like that family . ' I sat down amongst them and said I was no Catalan , but I came from a spot in the western sea many leagues distant to sell that book at half the price it cost , and that their souls ' welfare depended upon their being acquainted with it . I then explained to them the nature of the New Testament and read to them the Parable of the Sower . They stared at each other again , but said that they were poor and could not buy books . I rose , mounted , and was going away , saying to them : ' Peace bide with you . ' Whereupon the young man with the gun rose , and saying ; ' Caspita ! this is odd , ' snatched the book from my hand , and gave me the price I had demanded . Perhaps the whole world might be searched in vain for a spot whose natural charms could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its wall of mighty mountains , its spreading chestnut-trees , and its groves of oaks and willows which clothe the banks of its stream , a tributary to the Minho . True it is that when I passed through it the candle of heaven was blazing in full splendour , and everything lighted by its rays looked gay , glad and blessed . Whether it would have filled me with the same feelings of admiration if viewed beneath another sky I will not pretend to determine , but it certainly possessed advantages which at no time could fail to delight ; for it exhibited all the peaceful beauties of an English landscape blended with something wild and grand , and I thought within myself that he must be a restless dissatisfied man who born amongst those scenes would wish to quit them . At the time I would have desired no better fate than that of a shepherd on the prairies or a hunter on the hills of Bembibre . Three hours passed away , and we were in another situation . We had halted and refreshed ourselves and horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which possessed little to attract attention . We were now ascending , for the road was over one of the extreme ledges of those frontier hills which I have before so often mentioned ; but the aspect of heaven had blackened , clouds were rolling rapidly from the west over the mountains , and a cold wind was moaning dismally . ' There is a storm travelling through the air , ' said a peasant , whom we overtook mounted on a wretched mule , ' and the Asturians had better be on the look-out , for it is speeding in their direction . ' He had scarce spoken when a light so vivid and dazzling that it seemed the whole lustre of the fiery element was concentrated therein broke around us , filling the whole atmosphere , and covering rock , tree and mountain with a glare indescribable . The mule of the peasant tumbled prostrate , while the horse I rode reared himself perpendicularly , and turning round dashed down the hill at headlong speed which for some time it was impossible to check . The lightning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it sounded hollow and deep ; the hills , however , caught up its voice , seemingly pitching it along their summits , till it was lost in interminable space . Other flashes and peals succeeded , but slight in comparison , and a few drops of rain ; the body of the tempest seemed to be over another region . ' A hundred families are weeping where that bolt fell , ' said the peasant , when I rejoined him , ' for its blaze has blinded my mule at six leagues ' distance . ' He was leading the animal by the bridle , as its sight was evidently affected . ' Were the friars still in their nest above there , ' he continued , ' I should say that this was their doing , for they are the cause of all the miseries of the land . ' I raised my eyes in the direction in which he pointed . Half-way up the mountain over whose foot we were wending jutted forth a black , frightful crag , which at an immense altitude overhung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ledges of the rocky mountains in the picture of the deluge , up to which the terrified fugitives have scrambled from the eager pursuit of the savage and tremendous billow , down on which they are gazing in horror , whilst above them rise still higher and giddier heights to which they seem unable to climb . Built on the very rim of this crag stood an edifice , seemingly devoted to the purposes of religion , as I could discern the spire of a church rearing itself high over wall and roof . ' That is the house of " The Virgin of the Rocks , " ' said the peasant , ' and it was lately full of friars , but they have been driven out , and the only inmates now are owls and ravens . ' I replied that their life in such a bleak exposed abode could not have been very enviable , as in winter they must have incurred great risk of perishing with cold . ' By no means , ' said he ; ' they had the best of wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm them at their meals , which were not the most sparing ; moreover they had another convent down in the vale yonder , to which they could retire at their pleasure . ' I asked him the reason of his antipathy to the friars , to which he replied that he had been their vassal , and that they had deprived him every year of the flower of what he possessed . Discoursing in this manner we reached a village just below the convent , where he left me , having first pointed out to me a house of stone with an image over the door , which he said once also belonged to the canalla ( rabble ) above . The sun was setting fast , and , eager to reach Villafranca , where I had determined on resting and which was still distant three leagues and a half , I made no halt at this place . The road was now down a rapid and crooked descent which terminated in a valley , at the bottom of which was a long and narrow bridge . Beneath it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , for the chain was here cleft probably by some convulsion of nature . I looked up the pass and on the hills on both sides . Far above on my right , but standing out bold and clear , and catching the last rays of the sun , was ' the Convent of the Precipices ' ; whilst directly over against it , on the further side of the valley , rose the perpendicular side of the rival hill which , to a considerable extent intercepting the light , flung its black shadow over the upper end of the pass , involving it in mysterious darkness . Emerging from the centre of this gloom with thundering sound dashed a river , white with foam and bearing along with it huge stones and branches of trees , for it was the wild Sil , probably at that time swollen by the recent rains , which I now saw hurrying to the ocean from its cradle in the heart of the Asturian hills . Its fury , its roar , and the savage grandeur of the surrounding scenery which was worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful lines of Stolberg addressed to a mountain torrent  --  ' The pine-trees are shaken , they yield to thy shocks , And , crashing , they tumble in wild disarray ; The rocks fly before thee  --  thou seizest the rocks And whirlst them , like pebbles , contemptuous away . ' Hours again passed away . It was now night , and we were in the midst of woodlands , feeling our way , for the darkness was so great that I could scarcely see the length of a yard before my horse 's head . The animal seemed uneasy , and would frequently stop short , prick up his ears , and utter a low mournful whine . Flashes of sheet-lightning frequently illumed the black sky and flung a momentary glare over our path . No sound interrupted the stillness of the night save the slow tramp of the horses ' hoofs , and occasionally the croaking of frogs from some pool or morass . I now bethought me that I was in Spain , the chosen land of the two fiends , assassination and plunder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We at last cleared the woodlands , and after proceeding a short distance the horse gave a joyous neigh and broke into a smart trot . A barking of dogs speedily reached my ears , and we seemed to be approaching some town or village . In effect we were close to Cacabelos , a town about five miles distant from Villafranca . It was now near eleven at night , and I reflected that it would be far more expedient to tarry in this place till the morning than to attempt at present to reach Villafranca , exposing ourselves to all the horrors of darkness in a lonely and unknown road . My mind was soon made up on this point  --  but I determined without my hosts , for at the first posada which I attempted to enter I was told that we could not be accommodated , and particularly our horses , as the stable was full of water . At the second ( there were but two ) , I was answered from the window by a gruff voice nearly in the words of Scripture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my servants are also with me in bed ; I can not arise to let you in . ' Indeed we had no particular desire to enter , as it appeared a wretched hovel ; though the poor horses pawed piteously against the door , and seemed to crave admittance . We had now no choice but to resume our doleful way to Villafranca , which we were told was a short league distant , though it proved a league and a half . We however found it no easy matter to quit the town , for we were bewildered amongst its labyrinths and could not find the outlet . A lad about eighteen was , however , persuaded by the promise of a peseta to guide us , whereupon he led us by many turnings to a bridge which he told us to cross and to follow the road , which was that of Villafranca ; he then , having received his fee , hastened from us . We followed his directions , not , however , without a suspicion that he might be deceiving us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible to distinguish any object , however nigh . The lightning had become more faint and rare . We heard the rustling of trees and occasionally the barking of dogs , which last sound , however , soon ceased , and we were in the midst of night and silence . My horse , either from weariness or the badness of the road , frequently stumbled ; whereupon I dismounted , and leading him by the bridle , soon left my companion far in the rear . I had proceeded in this manner a considerable way when a circumstance occurred of a character well suited to the time and place . I was again amidst trees and bushes , when the horse , stopping short , nearly pulled me back . I know not how it was , but fear suddenly came over me , which , though in darkness and in solitude , I had not felt before . I was about to urge the animal forward , when I heard a noise at my right hand , and listened attentively . It seemed to be that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushwood . It soon ceased , and I heard feet on the road . It was the short , staggering kind of tread of people carrying a very heavy substance , nearly too much for their strength , and I thought I heard the hurried breathing of men over-fatigued . There was a short pause in the middle of the road ; then the stamping recommenced until it reached the other side , when I again heard a similar rustling amidst branches ; it continued for some time , and died gradually away . I continued my road , musing on what had just occurred and forming conjectures as to the cause . The lightning resumed its flashing , and I saw that I was approaching tall black mountains  --  But I will omit further particulars of this midnight journey . ' Quien vive , ' roared a voice about an hour from this time , for I had at last groped my way to Villafranca . It proceeded from the sentry at the suburb , one of those singular half soldiers , half guerillas , called Miguelets , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads of robbers . I gave the usual answer ' Espana , ' and went up to the place where he stood . After a little conversation , I sat down on a stone , awaiting the arrival of Antonio , who was long in making his appearance . On his arrival I asked him if any one had passed him on the road , but he replied that he had seen nothing . The night , or rather morning , was still very dark , though a small corner of the moon was occasionally visible . On our enquiring the way to the gate , the Miguelet directed us down a street to the left , which we followed . The street was steep , we could see no gate , and our progress was soon stopped by houses and wall . We knocked at the gates of two or three of these houses ( in the upper stories of which lights were burning ) for the purpose of being set right , but we were either disregarded or not heard . A horrid squalling of cats from the tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought of the night-arrival of Don Quixote and his squire at Tobosa , and their vain search amongst the deserted streets for the palace of Dulcinea . At length we saw light and heard voices in a cottage at the further side of a kind of ditch . Leading the horses over , we called at the door , which was opened by an aged man , who appeared by his dress to be a baker , as indeed he proved , which accounted for his being up at so late an hour . On begging him to show us the way into the town , he led us up a very narrow alley at the end of his cottage , saying that he would likewise conduct us to the posada . The alley led directly to what appeared to be the market-place , at a corner house of which our guide stopped and knocked . After a long pause an upper window was opened , and a female voice demanded who we were . The old man replied that two travellers had arrived who were in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of night , ' said the woman , ' they will be wanting supper , and there is nothing in the house ; they must go elsewhere . ' She was going to shut the window , but I cried that we wanted no supper , but merely a resting-place for ourselves and horses , that we had come that day from Astorga , and were dying with fatigue . ' Who is that speaking ? ' cried the woman . you are come at the right time , for my own is out of order . I am sorry I kept you waiting , but I will admit you in a moment . ' The window was slammed to ; presently light shone through the crevices if the door , a key turned in the lock , and we were admitted . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Sept. 11 , 1837 ) SAINT JAMES ( SANTIAGO ) OF COMPOSTELLA , 19th Aug. 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  I left Corunna about ten days since for this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was escorted by a strong party of soldiers in consequence of the distracted state of the country . Nothing particular worth relating occurred during the journey , which occupied a day and a half , though the distance is barely ten leagues . Santiago , or Saint James , is , as you are aware , the capital of Galicia , and the residence of the Metropolitan . It is , or was , the most celebrated resort for pilgrims in the whole world , with the exception of Jerusalem , as it is said to contain the bones of Saint James the Elder , the Child of the Thunder , who according to the legend of the Roman Church first preached the Gospel in Spain . The cathedral , though built at various periods and by no means uniform , is a majestic , venerable edifice , in every respect calculated to excite awe and admiration ; indeed it is almost impossible to walk its long dusky aisles and hear the solemn music and the noble chanting and inhale the incense of the mighty censers , which are at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , whilst gigantic tapers glitter here and there amongst the gloom from the shrine of many a saint , before which the worshippers are kneeling , breathing forth their prayers and petitions for help , love , and mercy , and entertain a doubt that we are treading the floor of a house where God delighteth to dwell . Yet the Lord is distant from that house . He heareth not , He seeth not : or , if He hear and see , it is with anger . What availeth that solemn music , that noble chanting , that incense of sweet savour ? What availeth kneeling before that grand altar of silver , surmounted by that figure with its silver hat and breastplate , the emblem of one who , although an Apostle and Confessor , was at best an unprofitable servant ? What availeth hoping for remission of sin by trusting in the merits of him who possessed none , or by paying homage to others who were born and nurtured in sin , and who alone by the exercise of a lively faith granted from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty ? Yet such acts and formalities constitute what is termed religion at Compostella , where , perhaps , God and His will are less known and respected than at Pekin or amid the wildernesses where graze the coursers of the Mongol and the Mandchou . Perhaps there is no part of Spain where the Romish religion is so cherished as throughout Galicia . In no part of Spain are the precepts and ordinances of that Church , especially fasting and confession , so strictly observed , and its ministers regarded with so much respect and deference . The natural conclusion therefore would be that , if the religion of Rome be the same as that founded by Christ , the example of the Saviour is more closely followed , and the savage and furious passions more bridled , bloodshed and rapine less frequent , unchastity and intemperance less apparent , and the minds of the people more enlightened and free from the mists of superstition in Galicia than in other provinces . What is the fact ? Almost every road is teeming with banditti , who under the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty so atrociously horrible that indignation at the crime is frequently lost in wonder ; for the Galician robbers are seldom satisfied with booty , and unlike their brethren in other parts generally mutilate or assassinate those who are so unfortunate as to fall in their hands ; prostitution is carried on to an enormous extent , and although loathsome concustant sic diseases stare the stranger in the face in the street , in the market-place , in the church , and at the fountain ; ' Drunken as a Galician ' is a proverb ; and superstitions forgotten , abandoned in the rest of Spain , are clung to here with surprising pertinacity , the clergy exerting themselves to uphold them by carrying on a very extensive sale in charms , verifying the old saying , ' Witches are found where friars abound . ' An unhappy man , whilst collecting vipers amongst the hills , which he was in the practice of selling to the apothecaries , was lately met near Orense by some of these monsters . Having plundered and stripped him , they tied his hands behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained several of these horrible reptiles alive ! They then fastened the sack at the mouth round his neck , and having feasted their ears for a time with his cries , they abandoned him to his fate . The poor wretch , stung by the vipers in the face and eyes , presently became mad and ran through several villages , till he fell dead . I am now in the heart of this strange country and people . It has pleased the Lord to bless my humble endeavours more than I had reason to expect ; since my arrival Santiago between thirty and forty copies of the New Testament have been despatched . The bookseller of the place , Rey Romero , a venerable man of seventy , very wealthy and respected , has taken up the cause with an enthusiasm which doubtless emanates from on high , losing no opportunity of recommending the work to those who enter his shop , which is very splendid and commodious . In many instances , when the peasants of the neighbourhood have come with the intention of purchasing some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu thereof to carry home Testaments , assuring them that it was not only a better and more instructive , but even a far more entertaining book than those they came in quest of . He has taken a great fancy to me , and comes to visit me every evening , when he accompanies me in my walks about the town and environs . Every one who is aware how rare it is to meet with friendship and cordiality in Spain will easily conceive my joy at finding such a coadjutor , and I have no doubt that when I am absent he will exert himself as much , and I hope as effectually , as now that I am present . I leave Saint James to-morrow for Pontevedra and Vigo , carrying with me some Testaments which I hope to dispose of , notwithstanding there are no booksellers in those places . I shall then return to Corunna , either by Compostella or by some other route . I trust the Lord will preserve me in this journey as He has done in others . From Corunna I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asturias , provided that town be not speedily in the hands of the factious . By the time these lines reach you , you will doubtless have heard of the irruption of a part of the Pretender 's hordes into Old Castile ; they have carried everything before them , and have sacked and taken possession of the city of Segovia , distant only one day 's march from Madrid . From the aspect of things I should say that the miseries of this land , far from having reached their climax , are but commencing . Yet let no one mourn for Egypt : she is but paying the price of her sorceries and superstitions . ( UNSIGNED . ) P.S.  --  At San Sebastian I shall need Davison 's Turkish Grammar , which you have in the Library . It will be of assistance to me in editing the Basque St. Luke ; the two languages are surprisingly connected . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Oct. 9 , 1837 ) CORUNNA , Sep. 15 , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Corunna . I stated in my last letter , from Compostella , that it was my intention to visit Pontevedra and Vigo , which I carried into effect . In the first of these places I left , as I passed through , eight copies of the New Testament in the hands of Senor Garcia , the public notary ; three days subsequent , on my return , I found that he had disposed of them , and I have since sent him a fresh supply . He is a very zealous and exceeding intelligent person , and I have no doubt will prove a highly useful agent in Pontevedra and its beautiful neighbourhood , which is the garden of Galicia . In Vigo I disposed of four Testaments , but was not so fortunate as to find any person willing or calculated to undertake the charge accepted by my friend in the former town . Having reached Padron , in my journey back , I sent my servant and horses forward to Saint James , and guided by a peasant , proceeded across the country to Cape Finisterre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipwrecked last year . The distance was fifteen leagues , and the route lay over wild mountains and valleys , where we suffered much from fatigue and the heat of the sun . Arrived at Finisterre we were seized as Carlist spies by the fishermen of the place , who determined at first on shooting us , but at last contented themselves with conducting us prisoners to Corcubion , where the Alcalde of the district , after having examined me and perused my passport , ordered me to be set at liberty , and treated me with all manner of civility . By this journey I accomplished what has long been one of the ardent wishes of my heart . I have carried the Gospel to the extreme point of the old world , having left a Testament in the hands of Antonio de Trava , an ancient mariner of Finisterre , who took my part in a very friendly manner , and probably saved me from experiencing much violence at the hands of his companions . Finisterre is a place of wonders , which I hope at some future time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must speak of other matters . About one hundred Testaments have been disposed of at Saint James of Compostella , and there is at present a steady regular demand for them there which inspires my heart with gratitude to the Almighty . Shortly previous to my journey to Saint James , I despatched fifty copies to Lugo , where the Lord vouchsafed me good success on a former occasion ; this second supply being almost exhausted , I have sent more . Only fifty-eight copies have hitherto been sold at Corunna , for its inhabitants are far too much engrossed by party politics to entertain much relish for heavenly manna . I pray every night and morning that their eyes may be opened to their eternal welfare . Having now arranged matters in Galicia , as well as circumstances will permit , I am about to quit this province , directing my course to Oviedo in the Asturias . The way is long , and is infested by robbers and factious ; yet I go forth without much fear , hoping that the Lord will prove my shield and guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santander , and from thence to the Basque provinces . Santander , being a large and flourishing town , affords me a tolerable prospect of success , and I have accordingly directed my agent at Madrid to despatch thither forthwith 150 Testaments . The intermediate country is , however , in a most distracted state , a great part of it being in the hands of the Carlists ; it is therefore probable that the books may never reach me , in which event I shall have to apply to England . To the Basque provinces I hope to carry Saint Luke in a Biscayan version , which I shall print at Santander should an opportunity present itself . No time must be lost in accomplishing all that is possible in Spain , which in the course of a few months may be entirely in the hands of the Pretender . I received the lines which you directed to the care of the British consul at Corunna , and was thankful for them . Pray present my kind remembrances to Mrs. Brandram and family , to Mr. Jowett , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , most truly yours , G. BORROW . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Oct. 17 , 1837 ) OVIEDO , ASTURIAS , 29 Septr. 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  A day or two after the date of my last letter I quitted Corunna and passed over the bay to Ferrol , where I left twenty Testaments in the hands of a person who has just established a small book-shop in that place . My servant Antonio went round by land with my horse , the only one which I now possess , I having disposed 251 of the largest of the two at Corunna , as I thought he was unable to support the fatigue of a journey to Oviedo . At Ferrol I hired a horse and guide as far as Ribadeo , a distance of twenty leagues , and somewhat less than half the way to Oviedo . This journey was a terrible one ; during the greatest part of it we had to toil up and down mountain gorges and ravines , to force our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torrents swollen by the rain , which descended continually ; our guide proved perfectly ignorant of the country , and we had to bribe various peasants to accompany us , though we incurred great risk by so doing of being conducted to some den of thieves , and stripped and murdered . At Ribadeo we procured a fresh horse and guide , and continued our way to Oviedo , encountering still greater difficulties , the ground being still more rugged and broken than that which we had previously passed over . My own horse rolled down a precipice , and was much maimed , whilst that of the guide was so worn out by the time he reached Gijon , four leagues from Oviedo , that he foundered . As for Antonio and myself , we arrived barefooted and bleeding , for I need scarcely say that during all this journey , which amounted at least to 130 miles , we went on foot , the poor horses being scarcely able to carry our books and baggage . I am now by the blessing of the Almighty in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an unpropitious season , for the bray of war is at the gate , and there is the cry of the captains and the shouting . Castile is at the present time in the hands of the Carlists , who have captured and plundered Valladolid , in much the same manner as they did Segovia . They are every day expected to march on this place , in which case they will probably experience an obstinate resistance , very excellent redoubts having been erected , and several of the convents strongly fortified , especially that of Santa Clara de la Vega . All minds here are at present in a state of feverish anxiety and suspense , more especially as no intelligence at present arrives from Madrid , which by the last accounts was beleaguered by the bands of Cabrera , Palillos , and Orejita.  --  But I am interrupted , and I lay down my pen . A strange adventure has just occurred to me . I am in the ancient town of Oviedo , in a very large , scantily furnished and remote room of an ancient posada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is past ten at night and the rain is descending in torrents . I ceased writing on hearing numerous footsteps ascending the creaking stairs which lead to my apartment  --  the door was flung open , and in walked nine men of tall stature , marshalled by a little hunch-backed personage . They were all muffled in the long cloaks of Spain , but I instantly knew by their demeanour that they were caballeros , or gentlemen . They placed themselves in a rank before the table where I was sitting ; suddenly and simultaneously they all flung back their cloaks , and I perceived that every one bore a book in his hand , a book which I knew full well . After a pause , which I was unable to break , for I sat lost in astonishment and almost conceived myself to be visited by apparitions , the hunch-back advancing somewhat before the rest said in soft silvery tones : ' Senor Cavalier , was it you who brought this book to the Asturias ? ' I now supposed that they were the civil authorities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising from my seat I exclaimed , ' It certainly was I , and it is my glory to have done so . The book is the New Testament of God ; I wish it was in my power to bring a million . ' ' I heartily wish so too , ' said the little personage with a sigh . ' Be under no apprehension , Sir Cavalier ; these gentlemen are my friends . We have just purchased these books in the shop where you have placed them for sale , and have taken the liberty of calling upon you in order to return you our thanks for the treasure you have brought us . I hope you can furnish us with the Old Testament also . ' I replied that I was sorry to inform him that at present it was entirely out of my power to comply with his wish , as I had no Old Testaments in my possession , but did not despair of procuring some speedily , from England . He then asked me a great many questions concerning my Biblical travels in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society in respect to Spain , adding that he hoped I should pay particular attention to the Asturias , which he assured me was the best ground in the Peninsula for our labour . After about half-an-hour 's conversation , he suddenly said in the English language , ' Good night , sir , ' wrapped his cloak around him , and walked out as he had come . His companions , who had hitherto not uttered a word , all repeated , ' Good night , sir , ' and adjusting their cloaks followed him . In order to explain this strange scene I must inform you that this morning I visited the petty bookseller of the place , Longoria , and having arranged preliminaries with him I sent him in the evening a package of forty Testaments , all I possess , with some advertisements . At the time he assured me that , though he was willing to undertake the sale , there was nevertheless not a prospect of success , as a whole month had elapsed since he had sold a book of any description , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty which pervaded the land . I therefore sat down to write this letter much dispirited ; this incident has , however , admonished me not to be cast down when things look gloomiest , as the hand of the Lord is generally then most busy : that men may learn to perceive that whatever good is accomplished is not theirs but His . I shall quit Oviedo in a few days , but whither I shall now direct my course I have not determined . It would be easy for me to reach Santander , which is but thirty leagues distant and the road tolerably free from accidents ; but the state of affairs at Madrid gives me considerable uneasiness , for I remember that Madrid is the depot of our books , and I am apprehensive that in the revolutions and disturbances which at present seem to threaten it , our whole stock may perish . True it is that in order to reach Madrid I should have to pass through the midst of the Carlist hordes , who would perhaps slay or make me prisoner ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have hitherto experienced so many fortunate escapes , that the dangers which infest the route would not deter me a moment from venturing . But there is no certain intelligence , and Madrid may be in safety or on the brink of falling ; perhaps a few hours will inform us , when I shall at once decide . My next letter will therefore be either from Santander or the capital of Spain . Oviedo is picturesquely situated between two mountains , Morcin and Naranco ; the former is very high and ragged , and during the greatest part of the year is covered with snow ; the sides of the latter are cultivated and planted with vines . The town itself possesses nothing very remarkable with the exception of the cathedral , the tower of which is very high , and is perhaps the purest specimen of Gothic architecture at present in existence . The interior of the edifice is neat and appropriate but simple and unadorned , for I observed but one picture , the Conversion of St. Paul . One of the chapels is a cemetery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose souls I trust in Christ have been accepted . I will now conclude in the words of Heber : ' From Greenland 's icy mountains , From India 's coral strand  - -  Where Afric 's sunny fountains Roll down the yellow sand  - -  From many an ancient river , From many a palmy plain , They call us to deliver Their land from error 's chain . ' Most truly yours , G. B. P.S.  --  Morning Sept. 30th , twenty Testaments have been sold . @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Nov. 13 , 1837 ) MADRID , Novr. 1 , 1837 . CALLE SANTIAGO , No. 16 PISO 3RO . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  In my last letter , from Oviedo in the Asturias , I stated that my next would be dated either from Santander or the capital of Spain . I arrived yesterday at Madrid , but I previously visited Santander , which I reached with my usual good fortune , without accident , after a fatiguing journey of six days . When there , I found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered to be sent from Madrid were not come ; and I supposed that they had either been seized on the way by the Carlists or that my letter had miscarried. 256 I then thought of applying to England for a supply , but I abandoned the idea for two reasons ; first , that I should have to remain idly loitering at Santander for at least a month before I could receive them  --  a place where every article is so dear that my expenses with the strictest economy would have amounted to nearly two pounds per diem ; secondly , that I was very unwell , and unable to procure medical advice at Santander : for , to tell the truth , ever since I left Corunna I have been afflicted with a terrible dysentery , and latterly with an ophthalmia , the result of the other malady . I therefore determined on returning to Madrid . To effect this , however , seemed almost impossible . Parties of the army of Don Carlos , which in a partial degree had been routed in Castile , were hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more especially that part called ' The Mountains , ' so that all communication had ceased between Santander and the southern districts . Nevertheless I determined to trust , as usual , in the Almighty and to venture . I purchased , therefore , a small horse and sallied forth with Antonio , notwithstanding I was so unwell as to be scarcely able to support myself . I wished to have written to you from Santander , but I was exceedingly dispirited and could not collect my thoughts . Before departing , I of course entered into conference with the booksellers as to what they should do in the event of my finding an opportunity of sending them a stock of Testaments from Madrid , and having arranged things to my satisfaction I committed myself to Providence . I will not dwell long on this journey of three hundred miles . We were in the midst of the fire , yet , strange to say , escaped without a hair being singed ; robberies , murders , and all kinds of atrocity were perpetrated before , behind , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog barked at us , though in one instance a plan had been laid to intercept us . About four leagues from Santander , whilst we were baiting our horses at a village hostelry , I saw a fellow run off after having held a whispering conversation with a boy who was dealing out barley to us . I instantly enquired of the latter what the man had said to him , but only obtained an evasive answer . It appeared afterwards that the conversation was about ourselves . Two or three leagues further on there was an inn and village , where we had proposed staying , and indeed had expressed our intention of doing so ; but on arriving there , finding that the sun was still far from its bourn , I determined to proceed further , expecting to find a resting-place at the distance of a league ; though I was mistaken , finding none until we reached Montaneda , nine leagues and a half from Santander , where was stationed a small detachment of soldiers . At the dead of night we were aroused from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not far off . A messenger had arrived from the Alcalde of the village where we had previously intended staying , who stated that a party of Carlists had just surprised that place , and were searching for an English spy whom they supposed to be at the inn . The officer commanding the soldiers , upon hearing this , not deeming his own situation a safe one , instantly drew off his men , falling back on a stronger party stationed in a fortified village near at hand ; as for ourselves we saddled our horses and continued our way in the dark . Had the Carlists succeeded in apprehending me , I should instantly have been shot , and my body cast on the rocks to feed the vultures and wolves . But ' it was not so written '  --  said my man , who is a Greek and a fatalist . The next night we had another singular escape ; we had arrived near the entrance of a horrible pass , called El puerto de la puente de las tablas , or the pass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful mountain , on the further side of which was the town of Onas , where we meant to tarry for the night . The sun had set about a quarter of an hour . Suddenly a man with his face covered with blood rushed out of the pass . Turn back , sir , ' he said , ' in the name of God ; there are murderers in that pass ; they have just robbed me of my mule and all I possess , and I have hardly escaped with life from their hands . ' I scarcely can say why , but I made him no answer , and proceeded ; indeed I was so weary and unwell that I cared not what became of me . We entered  --  the rocks rose perpendicularly right and left , entirely intercepting the scanty twilight , so that the darkness of the grave , or rather the blackness of the valley of the shadow of death , reigned around us , and we knew not where we went , but trusted solely to the instinct of the horses , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only sound which we heard was the splash of a stream which tumbled down the pass . I expected every moment to feel a knife at my throat , but  --  it was not so written . We threaded the pass without meeting a human being , and within three quarters of an hour after the time we entered it , we found ourselves within the posada of the town of Onas , which was filled with troops and armed peasants expecting an attack from the grand Carlist army , which was near at hand . Well ! we reached Burgos in safety , we reached Valladolid in safety , we passed the Guadarama in safety , and now we are safely housed in Madrid . People say we have been very lucky ; Antonio says , ' It was so written ' ; but I say , ' Glory be to the Lord for His mercies vouchsafed . ' I did not find matters in a very prosperous state in Madrid . Few copies of the New Testament have been sold ; yet what else could be rationally expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army has been at the gates ; plunder and massacre were expected , and people have been too much occupied in planning to secure their lives and property to have much time to devote to reading of any description . I have had an interview with Dr. Usoz , and have just received a most interesting letter from him , replete with patriotism and piety ; amongst other things he says , ' only circumstances and the public poverty are the cause of the works not having met with sale at Madrid . ' Of this letter I shall send a translation . It contains some remarks respecting Father Scio 's version , which I consider to be of high importance , and humbly recommend to the attention of the Committee . But I am at present in Madrid , and am thus enabled to superintend in person the measures calculated to secure the sale of the work . I shall forthwith cause a thousand advertisements to be printed and affixed from time to time in every part of the city . I shall likewise employ colporteurs to vend them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small shop , where Testaments and Testaments alone will be sold .  --  No exertion of which I am capable will be spared , and if ' the Word of the Lord ' become not speedily better known at Madrid , it will be because the Lord in His inscrutable wisdom does not so will it . Whilst in the northern provinces I ordered a hundred copies to be despatched from Madrid to each of the three great towns , Valencia , Seville , and Cadiz , with advertisements ; I am glad to be able to state that advice has been received that the books have reached their destination . At the commencement of the coming year it is my intention to visit those parts ; for no work seems to prosper in Spain which is not closely attended to by the master . Whilst at Valladolid I ordered all the copies which remained unsold of the second supply to be sent to Burgos , and I am now going to despatch a third fifty to the former town , and a still larger quantity to Oviedo , those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . In a few days it is my intention to commit to the press Luke in Basque and in Rommany , the latter of which versions I propose to carry with me to Andalusia and Valencia , the two provinces which most abound with the Rommany-Chai , of whom , by the way , I found no trace in Old Castile , Galicia , or the Asturias . As for the Basque version , it is probable that even in Madrid it will not be without demand , as many Biscayans residing there will doubtless be eager to read the Gospel when placed within their reach in their native tongue . I will now conclude by begging pardon for all errors of commission and omission . I am a frail foolish vessel , and have accomplished but a slight portion of what I proposed in my vanity . Yet something , though but little , has been effected by this journey , which I have just brought to a conclusion . The New Testament of Christ is enjoying a quiet sale in the principal towns of the north of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the booksellers of those parts , particularly him , the most considerable of them all , Rey Romero of Compostella . I have , moreover , by private sale disposed of one hundred and sixteen Testaments to individuals entirely of the lower classes , namely , muleteers , carmen , contrabandistas , etc . My accounts will follow in a few days . Now may the Lord bless you , and dispose you to pray for myself and all in this land of misery and sorrow . G. B. @# @# To the Rev. A. Brandram @# ( Endorsed : recd . Dec. 2 , 1837 ) MADRID , No. 16 CALLE ST . IAGO PISO 3RO . Novr. 20 , 1837 . REVD . AND DEAR SIR ,  --  On the other side you have an account of the money which I expended during my journey , and also of what I have laid out in the Society 's service since my return . In respect to my expenses , I wish to state that most articles are very dear in Spain , especially in the parts where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many expenses which I have not specified in the account , for example the gate-dues for the books , in every town where I have introduced them  --  the printing of advertisements  --  and particularly farriers ' bills , as the poor horses were continually ailing from over-work , bad provender and falls received amongst the mountains . In the account of Testaments sold you will observe that I make no mention of by far the greater number , namely those disposed of at Lugo , Saint James , etc. , etc. , as I have not yet received the money from the booksellers . About a week since I received advice from Leon that the forty copies which I had left there had been all sold , and that the money was in readiness ; I have despatched a fresh supply of fifty to that important town , where last summer I nearly lost my life in a burning fever . I am expecting every day a fresh order from Salamanca , and hope that , as the circle widens in the lake into which a stripling has cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening until it has embraced the whole vast region of Spain . I have delayed writing for nearly a fortnight , as during that period I have been looking out for a suitable shop in which to commence operations in Madrid . I have just found one quite to my mind , situated in the Calle del Principe , one of the principal streets . The rent , it is true , is rather high ( eight reals per diem ) ; but a good situation , as you are well aware , must be paid for . I came to the resolution of establishing a shop from finding that the Madrid booksellers entrusted with the Testaments gave themselves no manner of trouble to secure the sale , and even withheld advertisements from the public with which they were supplied . But now everything will be on another footing , and I have sanguine hopes of selling all that remain of the edition within a short time . A violent and furious letter against the Bible Society and its proceedings has lately appeared in a public print ; it is prefixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valencia , in which he forbids the sale of the London Bible in that see . About a week since I inserted in the Espanol an answer to that letter , which answer has been read and praised . I send you herewith an English translation of it . You will doubtless deem it too warm and fiery , but tameness and gentleness are of little avail when surrounded by the vassal slaves of bloody Rome . It has answered one purpose  --  it has silenced our antagonist , who , it seems , is an unprincipled benefice-hunting curate . As you read Spanish , I have copied his own words respecting the omission of the Apocrypha ; nevertheless , lest you should find some difficulty in understanding it , I subjoin here the English . ' If the works of Luther were to be given to the world curtailed of their principal chapters , and his maxims and precepts to a certain degree transformed , what would his followers and disciples do ? Would they not rise with one accord in numerous bands , and , in order to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the original writings and produce in his support his manuscripts ? Would they not resort to all kinds of argument to prove the spuriousness of that edition , and employ declamation and reasoning in order to blacken the illicit and fraudulent means which the Catholics were employing ? ' etc. , etc. , etc . I deemed it my duty , as Agent of the Bible Society in Spain , not to permit so brutal an attack upon it to pass unanswered . Indeed I was called upon by my friends to reply , and though I am adverse to all theological and political disputes , I feared to refuse , lest the motives of my silence should be misconstrued . But now I must be permitted to say ( between ourselves ) that it was a very unadvised act to send such a Bible as the London one over to Spain , a Bible which does the editor no credit and the Society less ; and it was a still more unadvised act to advertise in the prints of Valencia that it would be given gratis to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these words : ' How is it possible for you ( meaning myself ) to sell books at Madrid and other places , when it becomes known that those very same books are being given away at Valencia ? Moreover , giving away Bibles to the multitude will seem to imply that there is some plot or conspiracy in the wind , and the Government , with some shadow of reason , may be called upon to interfere , and the proceedings of the Society may be brought to a sudden stop in Spain . ' I hope you will excuse these hints ; they are well meant , and in uttering them I have , as you know , the prosperity of our hallowed cause solely at heart . G. B. ( I am still very unwell. ) @# To the Editors of El Espanol @# GENTLEMEN ,  --  My attention has this moment been directed by a friend to a letter which appeared in your journal of the 5th instant , signed Jose Francisco Garcia and prefixed to a circular of the Governor of the See of Valencia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reading of the Castilian version of the Bible by Father Felipe Scio , as edited in London by the British and Foreign Bible Society , and which the Agent of the Society at Valencia has announced for sale . Did the principles of the Bible Society permit them to rejoice at the misfortunes of their fellow-creatures , even of their enemies , the style and tone which the writer of this epistle has , unfortunately for himself and his cause , adopted , would afford them plenteous matter for congratulation . He calls himself an ecclesiastic and talks about ' the sacred duty of his august ministry , ' and for the purpose , I suppose , of showing how strictly he fulfils the precepts of his mild Master and Redeemer , he styles the Society in question ' an infernal Society , ' and speaks of ' its accursed fecundity . ' Goodly words ! Charitable words ! May I be permitted to enquire in what part of the sacred writings he found them recommended ? Perhaps in the following text of the Vulgate :  --  ' Vae vobis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anethum , et cyminum , et reliquistis quae graviora sunt legis , judicium , et misericordiam , et fidem . Haec oportuit facere , et illa non omittere . ' Matt. cap . xxiii. vers. 23 . Ay de vosotros , Escribas y Phariseos hipocritas , que diezmais la yerba buena , y el eneldo , y el comino , y habeis dexado las cosas , que son mas importantes de la Ley , la justicia , y la misericordia , y la fe ! Esto era menester hacer , y no dexar lo otro . The British and Foreign Bible Society is an infernal society and consequently its members , one and all , are children of the devil . Now , what is required to constitute a child of the devil , according to the opinion of the Founder of Christianity  --  of Jesus  --  the Living Word  --  the Eternal God ? Let me quote His own words , according to the Vulgate , the book of the Church of Rome : ' Vos ex patre diabolo estis : et desideria patris vestri vultis facere . Ille homicida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quia non est veritas in eo : cum loquitur mendacium , ex propriis loquitur , quia mendax est et pater ejus . ' Joan . cap . viii . vers. 44 . ' Vosotros sois hijos del diablo , y quereis cumplir los deseos de vuestro padre : el fue homicida desde el principio , y no permanecio en la verdad ; porque no hay verdad en el : quando habla mentira , de suyo habla ; porque es mentiroso , y padre de la mentira . ' By this it should appear that the infernal Bible Society by the propagation of the Scriptures merely fulfils the desire of its father the devil , and disseminates that which is his . Being a child of the devil it can not propagate truth ; it propagates the Gospel , and nothing else  --  ergo , the Gospel is a lie and the father of it the devil . But the Bible Society is accused , not only in the circular , but in the epistle which introduces it to the Espanol , of vending a mutilated and curtailed version of the holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books which are generally bound up with what is denominated the Bible ; viz. , Tobias , Judith , Baruch , Sabiduria , Eclesiastico , y 1o y 2o de los Machabeos . The Christian ecclesiastic , the author of the epistle , in indignation at this omission becomes suddenly argumentative , and puts a case to the heretics , which he deems in point ; ' Si vieran la luz publica las obras de Lutero mutiladas en sus principales capitulos , y transformadas en cierto modo sus maximas y preceptos ; que diligencias no practicarian sus secuaces y discipulos ? Se levantarian a una en tropas numerosas para sostener el honor de su preceptor , y con el fin de dejar en su justo lugar a su amado maestre , recurririan a sus escritos originales , manifestarian en su apoyo los manuscritos , apelarian a todo linage de argumentos para acreditar la ilegitimidad de aquella edicion , y emplearian sus declamaciones y raciocinios para ascar los medios rateres e ilicitos de que se valia el catolicismo . ' Hear it in Gath ! hear it in Gilead ! hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of the earth hear it ! The principal chapters of the Bible are not those of the New Testament , which contains the will and words of the Saviour , by whom we are to be judged  --  not those of Isaiah , who foretold so beautifully and distinctly the coming of that Saviour to the world  --  not those of Moses , who wrote of things in their earliest date , and so nobly depicted the progress of the creation ,  --  but those of the books of Tobit , Baruch , etc. , books which the Roman Church itself has called apocryphal , and the greater part of which exhibit an internal character of spuriousness which precludes the possibility of their being the offspring of inspired minds , though they c//
