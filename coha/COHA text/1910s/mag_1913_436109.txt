THE history of China , ancient and modern , is an eternal series of paroxysms ; its keynote is bloodshed and famine , with periods of peace and prosperity purchased by the slaughter of countless innocents . Its splendid civilization , based on an unassailable moral philosophy and the canons of the Sages , has ever proved powerless against the inexorable laws of nature , the pitiless cruelty of the struggle for life , intensified by a social system which inculcates procreative recklessness and passive fatalism . Under Mongols , Mings , and Manchus the stern retributive law and its fulfillment have ever been the same , ? history persistently repeating itself , at the passing of dynasties , with fearful monotony of wholesale massacres . The following narrative of the sack of Yang Chou-fu by the Manchus , in l645 , was written by one ( his name is unknown ) who was himself a victim and an eye-witness of those fearful days of slaughter , ? of events which may be taken as normal at times of conquest and civil strife in Oriental lands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Mongols before them , or for that matter , of the Chinese of to-day . Throughout all the recorded history of the Empire , these wholesale massacres of non-combatants have been an accepted feature of the sorry scheme of things ; a deliberate , cold-blooded , al most instinctive fulfillment of the law which prescribes the survival of the fittest among a people with whom the problem of daily bread is ever insistently insoluble . Compared with the most merciless butcheries of ancient and modern times in Europe , with the worst excesses of Kirke 's lambs ' or Alva 's butchers , the slaughter of Orientals by Orientals lacks those factors of religious and political hatred which often explain the extermination of whole communities . Yet another feature common to these records of Chinese cities left desolate , is the complete lack of resistance on the part of their inhabitants ? a few thousands of savage soldiery , let loose without discipline or military cohesion on a walled city of a million inhabitants , will convert it , almost methodically , into a shambles , their terror-stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the Grand Canal in Kiangsu , has always been an important city . Strategically , before the days of railways , it was the gate of the southern capital , Nanking , for invaders from the north . Its ancient walls are some four miles in circumference , and in olden days , when the Grand Canal was the great artery of trade between the Yangtsze and North China , it boasted great wealth and a large population . Before the Manchu invasion it In RN Kublai Khan conferred upon Marco Polo the governorship of the city . 767 768 SECRET ANNALS OF THE MANCHU COURT had suffered , as all Central China had suffered , from the disorders of rebellion and from the general unrest brought about by the chaotic condition of affairs in Peking ; but until 1644 the tide of civil war had flowed northward , and though the cities of the plain had paid for it in silver , there had been but little bloodshed in their streets . After the fall of Peking and the collapse of the Mings before the rebel forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Li 's great army , routed by Wu San-kuei and the Manchus , fled southward and west , while the fugitive Mings established their court at Nanking , and gathered together their shattered forces to prevent the Manchus from crossing the Yangtsze . In 1644 , when the Manchu armies began their invasion and subjugation of the south , the population of Yang Chou-fu was estimated at over a million . Lying on the direct route of the invaders to Nanking , it was held for the Mings by their ablest general , Shih K'o-fa , and garrisoned with an army of about 40,000 men . If Prince Fu , heir to the throne of the Mings , had not been hopelessly dissolute and incapable , if he and his advisers at the court of Nanking had given General Shih the loyal support he deserved , the Manchus would probably never have reached the Yangtsze . But the court was wholly engrossed in licentious pleasures , its scanty revenues were wasted in wine-bibbing and play-acting , its forces in the field unprovided with the necessaries of life and materials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the garrison of Yang Chou-fu , at a most critical moment , to protect a store of munitions and equipment which he had been compelled to leave behind him on his forced march from Soochow . Even so , he might have destroyed the army of the invaders before the investment of the city , had he been willing to cut the banks of the Huai River and flood the country . But Shih was a scholar and a humane man , and preferred the risks of war to the infliction of enduring misery on vast numbers of his fellow countrymen . Re might have saved himself , his army , and the city , had he been willing to entertain the advances made to him by the Manchu Regent and forsake the cause of the Mings . But hoping against hope for reinforcements , he met with a dignified refusal the Regent 's offers to confer wealth and honor upon him as the price of disloyalty . He took a terrible responsibility , and he paid the price of high failure ; and with him , more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their graves like beds . ' The diary from which the following narrative is taken is dated the fourth Moon of the Yi Yu ' year ( 1645 ) . On the fourteenth day of the Yi Yu year , it was reported to General Shih K'o-fa , the commander-in-chief , by his staff , that Yang Ho ( on the Huai River ) had fallen , and our garrison prepared for a siege . Soldiers were quartered in every house ; a certain Colonel Yang and his men were billeted on me . Their discipline was very bad : we had to supply them with everything and their keep cost us several strings of cash per day . As their demands became ever more importunate , I invited Colonel Yang to a banquet and seized the opportunity to beg him to keep his men in better order . After this we were somewhat less disturbed . The colonel enjoyed listening to the flute , and we called in some singing girls to entertain his men . There was fierce fighting on the walls and around the city for ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // rison would repel the enemy . But one evening , while we were having quite a lively party at our house , orders from the commander-in-chief were suddenly brought to Colonel Yang . He read the note , turned deathly pale , and hurried out on the city wall . Our party broke up , every one wondering what evil tidings were in store for us . Next morning all the walls of the city were placarded with a proclamation from General Shih K'o-fa , saying , ' I alone will bear the brunt ; none of you blameless people shall pay the penalty . ' I felt quite reassured and touched by these good words . Later in the day every one 's spirits rose , for news came in that our men had been victorious in a heavy skirmish outside the city . That afternoon , my married cousin came in from Kua-chou in order to escape from the lawlessness of General Li 's dispersed troops . My wife was delighted to see her , and the two women were chatting away , when suddenly rumors began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made immediate inquiries and at first came to the conclusion that the troops who had come in were those of the Marquis Huang Te-kung , one of our own generals , the more so as our guards on the city wall showed no signs of panic . On reaching the main street , however , I met crowds of men , women , and children , many of them barefooted and half naked , all rushing wildly along . To my inquiries they could make no clear replies , all muttering and gibbering incoherently . Next , I observed a small party of horsemen desperately galloping toward the south gate of the city . They passed like a torrent in flood , but I had time to notice that the person they were escorting was none other than General Shih K'o-fa himself . They had tried to leave by the east gate , but finding that the Manchus held it already outside , were hop- ing to escape by the south . The general was wounded ' and had been forced by his bodyguard to leave . Next I saw another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender to the enemy . His face wore a look of misery such as I never wish to behold again . By this time , the troops on the wall had begun to throw away their weapons and were tearing off the badges from their uniforms . Many of them were severely hurt in the crush and confusion as they rushed from the wall ; soon the section adjoining my house was quite deserted . General Shih had erected gun-platforms on a level with the wall , because it was too narrow for artillery purposes ; these platforms were reached from the roofs below by a sloping gangway of planks lashed together . The Manchus gained the wall near the north gate , and came rushing along it , sword in hand , driving our men before them . On reaching the gun-platform adjoining my house , crowds of them , pursuers and pursued , came down it helter-skelter ; the gangway collapsed beneath them and a score or more were killed . Those who succeeded in reaching the roofs engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fighting , making a din most terrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath . My courtyard was filled with routed soldiery and panic-stricken refugees , who listened in terror to the fierce yells of the Manchus . I had no means of preventing these fugitives from entering my house ; even the womens ' quarters were full . From a window at the back I observed a body of troops marching toward the southwest of the city . They seemed well disciplined , and at first I hoped they were some of our own men . At this moment there came a sound of knocking at my gate . A few 770 SECRET ANNALS OF THE MANCHU COURT neighbors had come to suggest that we should join them in preparing a welcome to the Manchu invaders and that we should burn incense in token of allegiance to our new Emperor . As matters stood , I dared not refuse to join in these preparations , so we hurriedly put on our ceremonial robes and shaved our heads in the Manchu fashion . This done , we waited a long while , but no Manchu prince put in an appearance . The fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers lay dead . The Manchus had passed on to other parts of the city . As I looked out from my window , I saw a few soldiers coming and going ; in a little while there came a troop of them escorting a bevy of gaudily clad women , ? women belonging to this city , of evil repute . At the spectacle , a sudden thought struck me , and I went to my women-folk and said , ' The city has fallen ; you must be ready to commit suicide and thus escape outrage . ' They all agreed and handed me their ornaments and their money , saying , ' Keep them ; we do n't expect to live more than a few hours at most . ' Next I saw a small party of horsemen riding slowly from the north ; every person whom they met they stopped , demanding money . These men were not extravagant in their demands , and if they were refused , they would prod their captive with swords , but not so as to hurt him seriously . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted this party to the house of a rich merchant , who had paid ten thousand taels as ransom ; nevertheless he had been murdered . ) When they came near to my house one of the horsemen pointed to me ( I had come out and was standing in the court ) . ' Search that fellow in the blue gown , ' he shouted to one of his comrades , who at once dismounted ; but I was too quick for him and rushed in side . The men rode away laughing . I wondered why they should wish to search me , as i as clad in the garments of a rustic . this moment my two brothers came up and , discussing the point , we concluded that as this part of the city was chiefly inhabited by wealthy merchants , they had suspected my disguise . I therefore decided to remove all the family from my house and take refuge in that of my second eldest brother . My two brothers and the women all made the best of their way thither by unfrequented alleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the slums of the city , a quarter known as the ' Graveyard of the Ho family . ' Meanwhile I remained behind in my own house to see what would happen . All of a sudden my eldest brother came running back to tell me that the main street was running with blood , and that if I stayed where I was , I should surely be murdered . ' Come with us ; we can at least all die together in our brother 's house . ' At that , I took the ancestral tablets from their shrine and went with my brother . We were altogether in his house a party of ten : four of us brothers ( two older and one younger than myself ) , my wife and little son , my sister-in-law , my nephew , and my wife 's brother and sister . As evening drew on , we could hear more and more clearly the shouts of the Manchus at their hellish work of butch . ery . It was pouring with rain but that did not stop them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat roof of an outhouse under the heal. ) rain , covered with a large felt plaid , which soon became soaked . The death-cries of wounded and dying men , of women and children , rang in our ears and made our blood run cold . Not till midnight did we dare to come from our hiding-place and make for the kitchen , where we managed to kindle a fire and boil a little rice . By this time flames // were bursting out all over the city ; several of our neighbors ' houses had been burned to the ground ; the total number thus destroyed must have run into thousands . The night was as light as day ; the tumult and the shouting were incessant . Every now and then we could hear curses in Manchu , blended with some woman 's frantic appeal for mercy . We tried to eat , but our chopsticks refused to carry the food to our mouths . We could think of no way of escape ; my wife took some ingots of silver and divided them amongst us four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boots and loin-cloths . My wife also found for me an old robe and a pair of frayed shoes , which she bade me wear . All night we sat desperate , awaiting the end , and dared not close our eyes . A bird in the room sang without ceasing ; its notes sounded like a clarion . Close at hand I heard a child sobbing , but could not place it . As dawn broke , the conflagrations seemed to die down . I mounted a ladder and concealed myself in the loft . We all crouched on some boards by the ceiling , when suddenly , from the eastern side , a man 's head appeared . He climbed in by one ladder and rushed down another , but the Manchu trooper who followed him paused when he saw us and gave over his pursuit , coming toward me instead . In my terror I too rushed down the ladder and out into the street , followed by my two brothers . We ran at least a hundred yards , but stopped on finding that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my wife and knew not whether she lived or died . The cruel Manchus , to save themselves the trouble of hunting for their victims , posted notices , telling the people that if they surrendered they would he given badges guaranteeing them their lives , but if they hid them-sell es and were caught they would be killed . Many people gave themselves up in consequence . As my brother and I were standing in the street , we saw a group of fifty or sixty persons , half of them women , a little farther on , and my brother said , ' If we hide and are discovered we shall certainly be killed . We are only four helpless men , so we had better surrender and join that group over there . By so doing we may possibly find a means of escape , and if not , at least we shall have the satisfaction of perishing in a general massacre . ' I was far too terrified to suggest any better course , so we went and joined the group , expecting to receive our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away all their money , but oddly enough they left me alone . At this moment some women came up , and one of them spoke to me . I recognized her at once , ? the second concubine of my old friend Chu Shu , ? but I begged her not to draw attention to me . She was in a pitiable condition , her hair all disheveled , her bosom exposed , and her legs besmeared to the knees with mud . Another concubine had a girl baby in her arms , but the troops first flogged her , then threw her down in the mud . Then some more soldiers came up , collected the women , and began tying them together at the knees , like a string of pearls . We were then marched off in a body , one man with a sword leading the way , and another on either side to prevent anyone escaping , just as if they were driving sheep to market . At every step we took we saw dead bodies lying in agonized attitudes , ? babies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women with their new-born babes by the roadside all beaten to a pulp . The streets reeked like a shambles ; here and there one heard the groans of a few dying wretches . Arms and legs protruded from every ditch , inextricably mingled . 772 SECRET ANNALS OF THE MANCHU COURT We were taken to the house of Colonel Yao Yung-yen , entering it by the back door . Every room that I saw was full of corpses , and I said to myself that mine would surely be added to their number . However , there were no Manchu butchers at work there for the time being , and after passing through several courtyards we were brought out through the front of the building . Thence we were led to the house of a Shansi merchant , one Ch'iao Cheng-wang , the headquarters of the men who were our captors . As we entered , I noticed a soldier mounting guard over three comely females . The floor was strewn deep with valuable silks and furs . Our three guards laughed loudly at the sight , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back room , while they placed the women in an inner apartment . In the room into which we were driven , three seamstresses were sitting at work . One of them was about thirty-five and very smartly dressed . She was a native of Yang Chou , and seemed perfectly happy , chaffing the soldiers merrily . Her behavior was wanton in the extreme ; as I watched her making eyes at the men , I heard one of the Manchus say , During the Corean campaign , hardly a woman bought her life at the price of her virtue . Who would have believed that the inhabitants of this great Empire of China could be as shameless as this wench ? ' Next , one of the Manchus began brandishing his sword and shouted , Come here , you Chinese savages . ' They then bound with cords all of us who were in the front row , including p. my eldest brother . My second brother called out to me , It 's all up with us : what 's the use of talking ? ' He seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . We were all bound , some fifty of us in all , and the Manchus led us out into the courtyard , yelling like savages . Then the butchery began : every one was struck dumb with terror , and I stood there and watched it for a few moments , awaiting my turn . At first I looked forward to death calmly enough , but suddenly I felt as if aid had been vouchsafed to me from some supernatural power . Bound as I was , I managed to creep away en . noticed , and reached one of the back rooms of the house , and found myself in the women 's quarters , where there were still some of the older women who had been unable to escape . At the back of this part of the house the Manchu horses and pack-camels were stabled , completely blocking all chance of egress . Creeping on hands and knees , I managed to crawl under the beasts , any one of which might have trampled me to a jelly . After getting past them , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to my left there was a passage leading to a postern door . This door ? half way down the passage ? was nailed securely , so I went some distance up the passage , where I could distinctly hear the groans of my dying comrades and the shouts of their executioners . Passing the kitchen , I saw four men at work there . They had been pressed into the job by the Manchus , and I implored them to let me join them as hewer of wood or drawer of water . They angrily refused , saying , ' We four have been specially assigned to this duty ; if the Manchus find an extra hand here , they will suspect us of conspiracy , and we shall all be killed . ' As I continued to beseech them , they pushed me out , driving me forth with a carving-knife . I then rushed back to the door leading out of the passage , and pulled at it with all my might . I seized the support , in the socket of which the door was inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . With // bleeding fingers I tried to push the door open , but it was still effectually closed from the outside by a heavy beam . The long spell of wet weather had caused it to stick fast in its socket and I could not move it . But as I pushed and pulled , by great good luck the top hinge of the door gave way , and it fell outwards with a heavy crash . Again some unseen power seemed to aid me , and I was through the postern door in a flash . The spot at which I emerged was at the foot of the city wall , and there some sentries made signs to me to advance no farther , so I made my way into a house just beyond the one I had left . Every room M it was full of refugees in hiding , except the gate-house , which looked out on the main street , and was so often visited by soldiers that no one had vent ured to go there . There was a corner in this gatehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb . As I waited , scarcely daring to breathe , I heard an agonized voice which I recognized all too well , the voice of my younger brother , begging for mercy . A sound of blows followed and then I heard my second eldest brother cry , ' I have money buried in my cellar at home . Let me go , and I will bring it to you . ' After that all was silence , and my heart seemed to cease beating . I felt as if my brain were on fire ; the tears refused to well from my eyes , and my bowels were rent asunder . My tongue clove to my mouth and I think I lost consciousness . Shortly afterwards a soldier came in , dragging a woman with him , and abusing her fearfully . My own position was now one of extreme peril . Seizing the first opportunity , I managed to climb from the cupboard , which was open at the top , onto the cross-beam of the loft above . It was as black as pitch up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would look in , and prod the loft matting above their heads with their long spears . Hearing no sound , they concluded it was empty . I lay up there all that day ; during that time , about a score of persons were murdered in the room beneath me . Out in the street I could hear sounds of horsemen riding by , with shrieking women in their train . There was no rain that day , but the sky was overcast . As the day drew to its close , there were fewer soldiers about , but the wailing of homeless refugees served to remind me of my two brothers ' pitiful deaths . I wondered if my wife and son still lived and if so , where they might be hiding . As the night fell , I crept down from my loft and went out into the street . The road was full of people crouching in attitudes of despair , some stooping over corpses and calling them by name . Seeing torches moving toward me , I hurriedly made down a side lane toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress difficult , and I stumbled over them again and again . It took me three hours , from eight o'clock to eleven , to reach my eldest brother 's house . He , with my wife and child , was there before me ; I could not bear to tell them of the death of our two brothers .. . I then told them my experiences . While I was speaking , Mrs. Hung came in and brought some rice , but none of us could eat . Fires were again breaking out all over the city ; by their light one could see a long distance . At the back of the Ho family 's graveyard there were groups of people lying about under the trees , and the sound of wailing mothers and children was most pitiful to hear . My wife said she wished to kill herself ; we talked together all through the night , and I dissuaded her for the present . In the morning she led me to the end of a winding passage , where there was a room full of coffins 774 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crouched down in some straw and hid , after placing the child on one of the coffins and covering him with matting . My wife concealed herself in front . I dared not move hand or foot , and soon my limbs were completely numbed . All day we could hear the voices of soldiers cursing , and the pitiful entreaties of their victims . A southerner before a Manchu was like a sheep in the hands of the butcher ; hardly any attempted even to escape . Toward evening I peeped out and counted over a hundred dead bodies in that one courtyard . Little Peng'rh slept on the top of the coffin right through that terrible day , and never stirred but once , when I wetted his lips with water which I brought in a hollow tile from the ditch outside . As evening came on , Mrs. Hung came again , and with her we returned to the room in which we had passed the night . She told me that my sister-in-law had been carried off , together with my little nephew , an infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made four deaths in my family in two days . I tried to procure a little rice , but without success . My brother and I talked together all that night . Thrice my wife attempted suicide , but each time Mrs. Hung prevented her . Then my brother said , ' We are not all likely to survive another day . I am still unhurt . Give me the child now and let me try to escape with him . ' I agreed , and my brother left us . Mrs. Hung advised my wife to hide in her cupboard , proposing to change places with her . However , we went back to our coffin room . A party of Manchu soldiers entered the house shortly afterwards , and discovering Mrs. Hung 's hiding-place , beat her cruelly ; but she told them nothing of our whereabouts , thereby earning my undying gratitude . Then more troops appeared on the scene , but when they saw the coffins , came no farther in our direction . At last a party of ten ruffianly-looking Manchus entered the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my feet . I rose and showed myself . Their guide was a Yang Chou man whom I knew by sight , and I begged him to ask them to spare me . They asked for money , and I gave them some . One of the soldiers shouted , ' Let ' s spare this fel ) low 's life for the present ' ; and they all went away . Then a young fellow in red clothes with a long sword entered , and hegan brandishing it in my direction . He too wanted money , and I gave him some . He was not satisfied and pointed at my wife . She was expecting her confinement very shortly , and now lay motionless on the ground . I deceived him by telling him that she had been injured . ' My wife is near her time , ' I said , ' and yesterday she fell from a roof and injured herself . She can not sit up and has to remain lying down . ' The red-clothed man did not believe me at first ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( she had previously daubed it on ) and so believed my story . He had with him a young woman and two lit ) tle children ; one of them , a boy , cried to his mother for food . This enraged the soldier who brained the poor child on the stone floor . He then departed with the mother and her little girl . After this , I made for a neighbor 's house , and implored him to let us take shelter there . He said he had no room . My wife again begged to commit suicide , and as I felt there was no longer any hope , I agreed : so we both proceeded to hang ourselves with one rope to the rafter . But the noose had been clumsily adjusted , and we fell with a crash to the ground . More soldiers entered the premises , but they marched // straight through and went their ways . Hy wife rushed out from the chamber into an outhouse , which was full of straw ; here there were a number of count rywomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no room for me . I ran as quickly as I could toward some straw which was piled in a heap in the southern corner , climbed up to the top of the stack , and covered myself completely with the straw . I thought I should be safe there , but in a little while there came a soldier who jumped up and began poking about with a long spear . I came forth from the straw and offered him money to spare my life . He searched about and discovered several other refugees , who all escaped by likewise tendering him silver . After he had withdrawn , we all crept back into our hiding-place . Down in the middle of the straw I noticed a couple of long tables , which seemed to offer an excellent refuge for several persons . Unfortunately for my idea , part of the adjoining wall had collapsed , and there was a wide chink through which our movements could be seen from without . I had not noticed this and had just lain down , when a soldier began prodding at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my companions in misery . The lower part of my back received a nasty gash . We all scrambled out as best we could , and again I went to my wife 's new quarters . All the women there were crouching on piles of firewood ; they had smeared their faces and hair with blood and mud and cinders , so that they looked more like demons than women , and I only recognized my wife by her voice . I implored them to allow me to get in among them , and they managed to find me a place right at the bottom of the straw , with the women all lying on top of me . I was nearly stifled , but my wife procured a long hollow ham- boo , which I placed in my mouth , and through it inhaled a little fresh air from above . A soldier came to the door , murdered two women whom he had dragged thither , and then went off . The day wore on ; it grew dark and the women got up . I then came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I went back to the Hungs ' house , where we found not only Mrs. Hung and her husband , but also my brother and little Peng'rh . He said he had been forced by some Manchus to load carts all day , but they had been kind to little Peng'rh . They had given him a string of cash at the end of his day 's work besides a safe-conduct flag . The streets were piled high with corpses , and all the ditches choked with blood . A report was current that a certain Colonel Wang Shaoyang , on good terms with the Manchus , was providing relief for the homeless and destitute , and that his intercession had saved many from being murdered . In spite of all our misery I slept soundly that night ; when morning broke we had entered upon our ninth day of tribulation . So far we had marvelously escaped , but rumors were being noised abroad that all the survivors were to be massacred that day , so that many , at the risk of their lives , fled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Meanwhile outlaws and cutthroats from the country had begun to make their way into the city , plundering whatever was left , or else , lying in wait outside , they would intercept the escaping town-people and despoil them . Under these circumstances I dared not make the attempt to quit Yang Chou , and my brother was unwilling to start forth alone ; so that evening I concealed myself again under some straw ; my wife and the child lay on top . Many times did my wife owe her safety to her advanced pregnancy . Sol- 776 SECRET ANNALS OF THE MANCHU COURT diers often came in , but we were able to buy them off with bribes . Finally a wolf-eyed , lantern-faced Manchu entered and glared at my wife ferociously . He pulled her about violently , but she lay still , and told him the same story about having fallen from a height . He did not believe her and compelled her to rise . She sank again immediately , whereupon the soldier took his sword and cut at her back , blood gushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to betray my presence , even to save her life , as there was a chance of their sparing the child , even if they killed her , and if I discovered myself the child would surely starve , for both its parents would be dead . So I remained hidden in the straw , and said nothing , expecting that each moment would be her last . The soldier finally caught her by the hair , twisted her long tresses round his arm and brutally pulled her along , belaboring her all the while . He dragged her from the pile of straw down the street for about fifty yards , pausing after every few paces to slash at her with his sword . At this moment a party of cavalry came up , and one of the horsemen spoke to the soldier in Manchu . He at once desisted and left my wife , who managed to crawl back , bleeding in seven or eight places , and covered with the marks of her terrible ill-treatment . She continued moaning all the rest of that day . Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a grave-mound . We were caked all over with mud and filth and looked like anything but human beings . A fire close by spread to the trees by the graveside , and what with the roaring of the flames and the howling of the wind , we felt as if we were already in the infernal regions . Ghastly was the spectacle as the dawn broke , and a pallid sun appeared . On all sides we beheld gaunt fleeting spectres of men and women , our fellow countrymen , while the Manchus , like so many Rakchas , 1 chased them up and down , as if they were already denizens of the nethermost hell . If we closed our eyes , our fevered brains conjured up visions of tortures worse than those we had already undergone . Suddenly I heard the sound of rushing feet . Looking up , I was horrified to see that my brother had been seized by a Manchu soldier and was making desperate efforts to escape from his hold . At last he broke away , but the soldier was after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror ; in the end my brother came tottering back , stark naked and with disheveled hair , in the firm grasp of the Manchu . He implored me to offer the man money to save his life . I had only one silver ingot left and this I offered to the man , but he furiously seized his sword and stabbed my brother in the neck . He fell to earth , blood gushing from his wounds . Poor little Peng'rh ( aged five years ) seized the soldier 's knees and begged him with tears to spare his uncle 's life . The soldier calmly wiped his blade on Peng'rh 's coat and then stabbed my brother again , this time in the head , and as it seemed to me , mortally . Then he caught me by the hair and demanded money , belaboring me with the blunt side of his sword . I told him that my money was all gone , but offered to get him other articles . So he dragged me to the Hungs ' house , where I showed him my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two water-jars . Everything was turned out on the doorstep , and he helped himself to whatever took his fancy . He removed all the pearls and gold ornaments , made a selection of the best clothes , and observing that little Peng'rh had a silver locket round // his neck , wrenched it off with his knife . Then he turned to me and said , ' I wo n't kill you , but do n't rejoice too soon . Others will kill you before very long . ' This showed me that a general massacre was afoot , and I felt that our last hour had come . But my wife and I hurried back to see how it fared with our brother . The wound in his neck was fearful , ? a gaping hole , several inches deep , ? and from the gash in his head a portion of the brain was protruding . He had also a terrible wound in the breast . We took him to the Hangs ' house and asked how he felt . ' No pain , ' he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was only half-conscious when we left him there , to go and hide ourselves close to a neighbor 's house amidst a pile of corpses . As we lay there , suddenly we heard a voice cry , ' The general massacre is fixed for to-morrow . All who can escape had better do so . ' My wife urged me to fly the city , but I reflected that my brother was desperately wounded and could not find it in my heart to leave him . Besides , we had now no money left and if we left the city we should only be facing the certainty of death from starvation . We discussed our position miserably for a long time ; by this time the fires had burned themselves out , and we could hear the booming of distant guns . There were not so many soldiers about , so I moved with my wife and child to an outhouse in which dry dung was kept . Mrs. Hung soon joined us . A little later a young man of about thirty , wearing a Manchu hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came riding by . He had a breastplate of the finest mail ; his steed was beautifully caparisoned , and he was attended by a large suite . His features , though Tartar , were exceedingly handsome : he had a long protruding chin and a lofty forehead . Amongst his retinue there were many Yang Chou people . This was Prince Y6 , the Manchu commander-in-chief and uncle of their Emperor . He looked closely at me , saying , ' You do n't look like a common person : who and what are you ? ' I reflected that some of our people had escaped by saying that they were scholars by profession , while others of the literati had been murdered on suspicion of anti-Manchu proclivities . I did not therefore reveal my identity , but concocted a plausible story . Then he asked about my wife and I told him the truth . He then said , ' I have given orders that all killing shall cease from to-morrow , so you will be quite safe . ' He bade some of his retinue give me clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he asked , ' is it since you have had a good meal ? ' I answered , ' Five days . ' He commanded us to follow him . My wife and I dared not disobey , though suspicious of his intentions . We reached a mansion where preparations for a banquet were laid out on a most lavish scale . Victuals of all kinds were there in abundance . He called a woman , saying , ' Treat these people well , ' and then departed . It was now twilight . My wife 's younger brother had been carried off and we knew nothing of his fate ; my wife was very sad at his loss . The woman soon came out with bowls of fish and rice , and as this mansion was quite near to the Hungs ' house , I carried some food to my brother , but he could not eat it . I combed his hair and washed away the blood from his face , feeling all the time as though a sword were at my own heart . People 's minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next day was the first of the fifth moon ; although the situation was much improved , looting and murder did not 778 SECRET ANNALS OF THE MANCHU COURT cease entirely . All the well-to-do families had been stripped bare of everything ; hardly any females over ten years of age had escaped outrage . To-day one of - the Manchu generals , the Earl of Established Peace , reentered Yang Chou and distributed some food to the people , over which they fought like ravenous tigers . On the second day proclamations were issued that the Manchus had established local officials in Yang Chou and the surrounding districts . The magistrates were sending out runners to tranquillize the people . The Buddhist temples received orders to burn all corpses : there were still many women hiding in their shrines , and many had died there of starvation . According to the official records of bodies found , the total number of persons who perished during these days was eight hundred thousand , but this does not include those who perished in the flames or who drowned themselves in the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief offices were distributing grain and rice . I went with Mrs. Hung to the place , which was the former commissariat department of General Shih K'o-fa . There were tons of rice and grain stored in bins , but in a very short space of time the whole of it had been distributed to the famishing crowd . They presented a pitiful spectacle , most of them with maimed limbs and broken heads , and all in filthy apparel . But when the grain was distributed , each and all fought like wolves : children even forgot to consider their parents , and struggled only for themselves . Many aged and infirm persons waited all day without securing a mouthful . On the fourth day , the sky cleared and the heat of the sun was great . The stench of the corpses was overpowering , and thousands were burned during the day . A mighty smoke was raised and the smell of the burning bodies filled the air , tainting it for miles around . I burned some cotton-wool and human bone , and with the calcined ashes prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grate . fully but could not utter a word . On the fifth day , many people who had remained in hiding began to come forth ; people 's hearts were too full for speech . We five , including the Hungs , were still alive , but as yet we did not dare to spend the day in our own house . After breakfast we went out and sat by the roadside . No one dared to wash or dress his hair , for there were still robbers about , but these were only common footpads . They had no swords , only cudgels , with which they frightened people into giving them money . But even so they beat several people to death . We could not tell if these wretches were Manchus or Chinese soldiers , or merely local ruffians . Today my brother died of his grievous wounds , which had mortified . My loss is not to be described . At the beginning of the trouble we were a party of eight brothers and sisters and their issue ; now only three remained , I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the events of ten days , from the twenty-fifth of the fourth to the fifth of the fifth moon . I have only told of my own experiences and the things of which I have been an eye-witness . In all my story there is not one word of hearsay or rumor , and I have avoided all mention of events which did not come under my own observation . Hence I know that this record is true . Perchance , posterity , born in a happier age , may be interested in perusing this diary , and it may serve to point a moral for the unreflecting . It may even cause vindictive and cruel-minded men to reflect on the error of their ways , and thus be of some value , as a solemn warning . // Thus it was in China in the year 1645 . Thereafter , for 265 years , the Manchus ruled over the Empire which they had won by the sword . Under the wise government of their earlier emperors the country rapidly recovered , as it always does , from the abomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , and then by the Manchus ' ruthless war of conquest . New cities sprang up where not one stone had been left upon another to tell the story of the dead ; once more the wilderness was made to blossom as the rose , until , in the fullness of time , the Manchus ' course of empire was run and , as they lost their prestige as rulers , rebellion and anarchy once more laid waste the land . In the events which have marked the passing of this once Imperial race , none display more vividly the pitiless irony of Fate and the innate savagery of Orientals , than the slaughter of the Manchu garrisons at cities like Sianfu in the recent revolution . Describing the sack of the Tartar quarter in that city in October , 1911 , one who passed through it shortly afterwards wrote : ' Once the Chinese set about this business of destruction , the lust of blood , the madness of killing , possessed them . Old and young , men and women , little children , were alike butchered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his people at the critical moment , ttas unable to face the situation . The safety he had won for the moment , he felt not worth the keeping ; he ended his life by throwing himself down a well . Houses were plundered and then burnt ; those who would fain have lain hidden till the storm was past , were forced to come out into the open . The revolutionaries , protected by a parapet of the wall , poured a heavy , un- ceasing , relentless fire into the doomed Tartar city . Those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates . At the western gates the Mohammedans cynically received them for their own purpose . In the darkness some managed to scale the city wall , descend the other side , wade through the moat , and escape to the open country . But not all who attempted this succeeded . The wall is thirty-six feet in height and at the top is some sixteen yards wide , and on it at various points clustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to slip between these , avoid the flashing lanterns and find a means of affixing their ropes safely before descending . Some possibly escaped by venturing to leap from the height . In despair , many Manchus themselves set fire to their houses ; at least they might cheat their murderers of the loot they sought . Into the English Hospital , days afterwards , when the first fury was passed , men were brought in a shocking condition ? men who had attempted to cut their throats . Asked why they had done so , they answered simply , " The wells were full . " And the Shensi wells are not the shallow ones of some parts of China ; they are thirty-six feet deep . There is such a man in that hospital to-day . All his family , wife , daughters , sons , were slain or destroyed themselves , and he failed in his attempt to end his life by other means . ' There were many Manchus in the Chinese city at the time of the outbreak . Some escaped for the moment through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak a Manchu detected on the street would be dragged off to instant execution . Hundreds were thus hunted through the streets and lanes of the city . They were known by their clothing , by their cast of countenance , by their speech . . . . When the Manchus found that further resistance was useless , they in many cases knelt on the ground , laying down their weapons , and begged the soldiers for life . They were shot as they knelt . Sometimes there was a whole line of them . In one doorway a group of between ten and twenty was thus killed in cold blood . ' A girl came down the street ; a girl of twenty , with hands bound . She had been hastily dragged before the " judges " in the Magazine , temporary headquarters of the Revolution , and was now being taken out a hundred yards or so to be beheaded . And in her face was that which once seen ? by one passer-by at least ? was never to be forgotten . It was not despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in which to reach her . It was the full young life cheated of its days , going out into the dark , the path before her littered by fearful reminders of the fate in front . From the pallid lips no sound issued ; they were held , as the girl 's whole being was held , by utter terror . The shaking limbs , the stumbling gait , proclaimed it ; but more than all , the awful haunting eyes . Along the route where the reek of blood made the very air bitter , acrid in the brilliant sunshine , where curses and sobs mingled with groans , and derisive raucous cries rent the air , they went . A woman , a very girl , caught within the enemy 's gates , not dying with her own people , not able to save herself with them if only in a death she saw and chose : but hurried along thus , as to a shambles . And her crime ? Her birth : a Manchu . The soldier muttered impatiently . He had other affairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? meant sport , ? in those days . He stalked along behind her with naked sword held up . " Hurry , " he snarled , " hurry . " Days after the outbreak , an English . man , passing down a side street , heard groans , heard the cry of pain , corning up with hollow sound from the depths . At the mouth of a well stood some Chinese . It was their day . The pitiful cries went on , the feeble moaning , varied with the sharp cries . A Manchu who had thrown himself , or been thrown down this well , lay there with broken limbs ; lay there in agony , appealing almost unconsciously for pity . The men at the well-mouth picked up lumps of earth , stones , picked up what came to hand . There came up from the well 's depths the thud of missiles on human flesh . ' And so the whirligig of Time brings on its merciless revenges ; the butchers of to-day become the victims of tomorrow . Europe , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus millions , its organized philanthropy and scientific economics , has no conception of the realities of life in farthest Asia , the same now as they were in the days when The Lord commanded Moses to war against the Midianites , and they slew all the males , and burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt . ' It is not possible for us , in our well-ordered materialism , to sympathize with the forces of atavism , the instinctive terrors and cruelties , that dwell forever deep-rooted in the soul of this people . The sack of Yang Chou-fu , and that of the Tartar city in Sian-fu , are in reality only typical and insignificant incidents , normal features in the life-history of a race which , since the beginning of recorded time , has learned to eat its bread with quaking and to drink its water with trembling .
