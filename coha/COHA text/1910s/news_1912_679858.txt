Where the action will be , brought she would not say . Her marriage . said the singer , to a man Younger than she has n't been a happy one . She said she had endured it as long as she could , and though she dreaded having the name of Schumann-Heink in the divorce courts , there was no other alternative . " I have no word to say against Mr. Rapp , " said Mme. Schumann-Heink . " He is a gentleman , cultured and refined . *But it is best that he should go his way and I go mine . He is in New York , where he has an office , and I am on the road singing . " There were no ugly quarrels ' nor any scandal . Please say that for both of us . It was just for the best that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children that caused the separation . He could not understand . And I should not blame him too harshly for it . He has no children of his own , while I have eight  --  and some of them are grown . " When it came to a question whether it should he my children or my husband , to whom I have been married six years , I clung to my children . And what good woman would not ? They are my life , and I love them with every breath that I draw . " It is my children that have been my inspiration in life . It was they who gave me the ambition to achieve what I have achieved . I have given my life for them , and I never have regretted it , and I do pot regret it now . " When I was in my native land , and oh , so poor , and the first of my eight children came . I wanted to do all 1 could for it . And when the others came I felt that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that they might profit by it , that I desired above all things to become a great singer , a great artist , that I might give to them the things which had been denied to my own childhood . " And I worked so hard , and I denied myself so many things to achieve my ambition . It was to work for them and to build them a home that I came to your America , that in the thirteen years I have been here , I have come to love.so well . But what made me come was . to win money and a home for them . " I had succeeded before I became the wife of Mr. Rapp . My estate in New Jersey is a beautiful place , and I am happy when I am there , surrounded by my children . Then I have another home In California , and I am happy there . But no matter where I am , I want my children LO know that their mother will always take them to her arms . Mr. Rapp thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought I gave them more . And I presume he was right in so thinking . What good mother would not give:all she had for her children ? " When Mme. Schumann-Heink was seeking In 1Q08 to obtain her final papers as an American citizen , Judge Ten Eyck , in the Court of Common Pleas in Trenton , before whom she appeared , was at a loss to know why she should desire them . Judge Ten Eyck assured the opera singer that she was already an American citizen , since her marriage to William Rapp in Chicago several years earlier gave her full citizenship rights . This argument did not appeal to Sehumann-Heink in the least . She protested that she wanted some papers to take back to show the German Emperor , so he would have proof of her standing as an American , and more than that , her marriage to Mr. Rapp , who is twelve years ner junior , only made her halfway American , anyhow . She loved the country so , she said , that she wanted to read her title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her home , Villa Fides , at North Caldwell , eight miles out from Newark , N. J. , she mentioned as evidence of her serious intention to rear her eight children as Americans .

Schumann-Heink sang American songs before the Kaiser , she explained , after describing how enthusiastically the Kaiser listened to " The Rosary , " that the young man who was arranging the finances ana attending to the baggage was her third husband . Mme. Schumann-Heink has always made a great ado about her babies ? " jewels and treasures , " as she called them . Born in Bohemia with an Austrian army officer as her father and an Italian mother , Fraulein Heink began soon after she was 12 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " . A calf among your pupils , " said a visitor at the school where she sang In a chorus of the stu- ? dent , and that was the first criticism of her voice that reached her ears . Afterward a choir leader rapped her so severely over the right arm for " spoiling the , whole mass that she carried a black and blue mark for days . Finally at a benefit ' performance in Kroll 's Theatre in . Berlin she had an opportunity to sing " Fides . " That was her first triumph , and the memory of it has worked itself out in the name of her New Jersey home , " Fides Villa . " Mr. Rapp succeeded in getting into the papers once when he figured in a runaway while driving Mme. Schumann . Heink in the Ramapo hills . After that she bought an automobile and was seen frequently with the two youngest of her eight children and a chauffeur . Mr. Rapp seemingly dropped out of sight , while Mme. Schumann-Heink made the matter of her loyalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them each a kiss before hurrying on to Ottowa , where she had an engagement . At her last appearance in New York she was accompanied by George Washington Schumann-Heink , her youngest son : 13 years old , and Maria Teresa , her youngest daughter , 15 years old . Two other sons , Henry and Hans , . she said . were studying opera , and she hoped to see them singing regular roles before she herself was ready to retire .

SchumannHeink declared she had come to - town only , take her " treasures " to the theare , and to buy gowns for the con cert tour of the Middle West , where she now has engagements . She said that , far from hoping to found an opera company , she was only hoping to be loved by the common people and to ? have her children , when she died , scatter her ashes so that a sprinkle of them , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She detested Gel'many , she said , because her first earnings had to be put in her first husband 's name and pass into the hands a a guardian after he died , so that she could receive no benefit from them , - . or , even receive an accounting as to their IIvestment or expenditure .
