T HE novelas we know it today is the product of a highly developed social life , of conditions which make the meeting of men and women on common ground normal and easy . It is preeminently the book society : it deals almost entirely with men and women in social relans . There have been stories since the beginning of history ; but the el came late and belongs to an advanced civilization . Its appeal to women is obvious , and their early and continued success in fiction has revealed not only their knowledge of the material with which fiction deals , ? character and manners , ? but their insight and skill in the art of narration . Miss Austen had a very narrow experience , and was a woman of village associations . She not only led a quiet life , but had a quiet mind . The people she drew were in many cases uninteresting , and many of them were distinctly dull , and yet " Pride and Prejudice " and " Sense and Sensibility , " are not only what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . In this age of a few real and many sham novels , " full of sound and fury , signifying nothing , " Jane Austen 's stories have the stillness of remote country ; but when the whole brood of stories of the " gilt and red plush " order are forgotten people will be reading these quiet novels with delight . MARIA EDGEWORTH There had been other women writers of fiction in the field before Miss Austen , and there were good novelists among her contemporaries . Maria Edgeworth was her elder by eight years , an Irish girl with an erratic and interesting father , who sometimes wrote complacent introductions to his daughter 's novels as if he were conferring a great honor on the books and a great favor on their readers . Byron wittily characterized father and daughter when he said that she looked as if she could hardly write her own name , while he looked as if nothing else was worth writing . The commonplace looking girl had a very keen eye , a first-hand knowledge of men and things in Ireland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " The Absentee " are still read ; but largely for historical reasons . JANE AUSTEN Miss Austen 's novels , on the other hand , are read for their intrinsic interest . In character , conditions , and work she was the embodiment of simplicity and sincerity . The daughter of an English clergyman , of Oxford training , good breeding , and good looks , and of a bright , witty , and somewhat satirical mother , the future novelist was born in a village rectory , and had the great fortune to hear good talk from her earliest childhood . She had a quiet manner ; but nothing escaped her keen eyes , and while she was still a girl she had an expert 's knowledge of the dress , manners , talk , and ideas of the people in her world . It was a little world geographically ; but all the qualities , interests , and characteristics which make the great world interesting were present in it . " Pride and Prejudice " was written before she was twenty-one . " Sense and Sensibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . These stories were the fruits of a girl 's leisure , and were written in delightful unconsciousness of their literary importance . The publishers of the time were not interested in " these quiet tales , and Miss Austen was not eager for publicity for them or for herself . In her twenty-sixth year she exchanged the life of a Hampshire village for the stir and gaiety of Bath , a brilliant little city  | frequented by people of fashion . During the years spent in the gay watering place Xiiss Austen 's imagination was at work ; but her pen was idle : her mind was lying fallow . In 1809 , in a rustic cottage in the village of Chawton , the most productive years of her life were begun . She revised or rewrote the early stories , and added to them " Mansfield Park , " " Emma , " and " Persuasion " ; writing at a little desk near a window in the sitting room . No writer of her distinction was ever freer from self-consciousness , and this is one secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was suggested to her to write a historical romance she said , " What shall I do with your strong , manly , vigorous sketches , full of variety and glow ? How could I possibly join them on to the little bit two inches wide of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after much labor ? " The ivory and the fine brush have given Miss Austen 's stories a place by themselves in English fiction . " The big bow-wow strain I can do myself , like any now going , " wrote Walter Scott ; " but the exquisite touch which renders commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and sentiment is denied me . " Miss Austen began to publish in 1811 , and her last novel , " Persuasion , " appeared in 1818 , the year after her death . At the end of a century , and after many changes of taste , her novels are safely lodged with the " classics , " and are read by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and keen observation , their quiet humor , and the indefinable charm of gentle , refined vivacity of feeling and style which pervades them . CHARLOTTE BRONTE Among novelists of the quiet life Charlotte Bronte appeared like a flaming spirit from another planet . The author of " Jane Eyre " would have been as tranquil as the author of " Persuasion " if physical conditions made us what we are : she too was a child in a rectory in the quiet British village of Haworth . But while the physical conditions of Charlotte  | Bronte 's youth were of the tranquilizing kind , her father had a stern temperament , she was motherless , and the house was so badly managed that the children were not properly fed . After three years ' study in a local school the future novelist went to Brussels to study French , and the two years she spent there furnished the material for " Villette . " On her return home she became a governess , and learned some of the things about that occupation which appear in " Jane Eyre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in their stories . They lived in a gloomy house , among a people of strong . but unsympathetic , nature , and , unknown to one another , they all took refuge in writing prose or verse . Charlotte wrote " The Professor , " but could not find a publisher ; " Jane Eyre , " written in a time of family disaster , appeared anonymously in 1847 . It had an instantaneous and sensational success . It was denounced as immoral , ? a stupid criticism , ? but everybody read it , and everybody had a theory about its authorship . A majority of readers were sure it was the work of a man , although it is feminine to the very heart ; the minority guessed that it might be the work of " an improper woman , " although the splendid courage and unselfish nature of the noble woman who wrote it shines through it . It was immature , extravagant , and melodramatic ( Rochester is a woman 's idea of a superman ) , but it was intensely dramatic , alive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronte had great energy of imagination , her emotions were intense , she had little knowledge of the world , and she was one of the children of tragedy ; and " Jane Eyre " is the product of all these elements plus genius . It was a meteor , and a meteor it remains ; but it is still seen among the planets . It is overwrought , extravagant , and to that extent it lacks the simplicity of truth and of art ; but it is alive , and life covers a multitude of sins of construction and style . The other stories ? " The Professor , " " Villette , " " Shirley " ? are all original ; but none of them has the vitality of " Jane Eyre . " Its author showed her sanity and poise by the calmness with which  | she bore her sudden popularity . She vallued the friendships it brought her with Thackeray , Mrs. Gaskell , and others ; but it did not intoxicate her . She went quietly on with her work ; and at the end she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose love was full of intelligent tenderness . MRS . GASKELL Mrs. Gaskell , who outlived Charlotte Bronte by ten years , and wrote her biography , was the daughter of a literary an , and became the wife of a clergyan , and had reached middle life before e began to write . Her first story , Mary Barton , " was a forerunner of the any later novels which deal with the lations of employees and employers , nd had a great popularity , was much iscussed , and was translated into half dozen languages . Was it not Dickens ho said of the poet Gray that he was walking down to posterity with one book under his arm ? Mrs. Gaskell wrote a number of novels full of charming qualities ; but she is known today chiefly by that delightful story of village life , " Cranford , " a novel f such idyllic quality and gentle humor that it waited years for poplar recognition , and then , fifteen or twenty years ago , suddenly caught e attention and won the hearts of American readers and appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classics of the quiet life . GEORGE ELIOT Marian ( or Mary Ann ) Evans , whom all the world came to know as George Eliot , was , like her predecessors , country born and bred ; but her father had the management of large estates , and she enjoyed the opportunity of knowing people of all classes , from farm laborers to the great landowners . In later years she added to splendid vigor of mind the resources of wide reading and broad acquaintance with the  | world of thought as well as of men ; but her best work deals with rustic and village people , and is in many respects the most vital portraiture we have of provincial character . She was a serious girl , with a vein of humor which runs like light through all her early stories . She went to various schools , and early began the study of French and German . The removal of the family to the neighborhood of Coventry brought her acquaintance with people of wide intellectual interests and in contact with the more radical thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Strauss ' " Life of Jesus , " and other German works of a religious or ethical character . These studies left a permanent impress on her mind : and , for purposes of fiction , that impress was not wholly fortunate . She came to the writing of novels through a severe study of the scientific philosophy of her time ; she wrote criticism of a semiscientific character , she traveled in Italy and Switzerland , she became the friend of Spencer , theMartineaus , Lewes , and other prominent people , and the vigor and force of her intellect were shown in a series of remarkable articles in the Westminster Review . Her real work was , however , yet before her , and she was thirty-seven before her earliest venture in fiction , " The Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton , " appeared , followed by " Mr. Gilfil 's Love Story , " " Janet 's Repentance , " and " Scenes of Clerical Life . " These stories showed firsthand observation , opulent imagination , broad and rich humor , and an intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her knowledge of character was minute and psychological as well . She could paint a personality with wonderful accuracy , and at the same time could make clear the inward sources of action . In due time " Adam Bede , " " The Mill on the Floss , " and " Silas Marner " appeared . In all these stories George Eliot is the creative artist , to whom life is more precious than thought and vital portraiture  | more compelling than analysis . She was rich in what may called the primary endowments of the artist , ? passion for life , sympathy , humor , pathos , courage of insight . These were the first and finest products of her genius ; she poured herself into them with lavish joy in self-expression . Then her genius began to flag . " Middlemarch " has great breadth of character , and in the play of character upon character gives the reader a cross-section of society ; but the joints begin to show , there is less spontaneity and more calculation in the work . " Romola " has great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing of it made her an old woman , and it gives one a sense of the heroic toil of art rather than of its freedom . And " Daniel Deronda , " speaking frankly , is an academic exercise : only at long intervals does it come to life . ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING In point of intellectual quality the transition from George Eliot to Mrs. Browning is not abrupt , and in that power of emotion which stirs and lights the imagination Mrs. Browning must be ranked among the original forces in English literature . She too could write fiction : " Aurora Leigh " is a novel in verse . The world loves a lover , and has always been grateful to the Brownings for making an adventure of love and a romance of marriage . It loves the story of the semi-invalid lying on a couch in a darkened room in London , the coming of the young poet , the ardent wooing , the father 's semi-insane opposition to marriage , the daughter 's drive to the park to test her ability to walk , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Casa Guidi , not far from the Pitti Palace , in Florence . It is a charming modern version of the story of the Prince who broke through the hedge of thorns and carried off the Princess ; it is a fairy tale come true . Elizabeth Barrett might have been both  | an invalid and a bluestocking if Browning had not rescued her . She read Homer in the Greek at , eight , and dreamed of Agamemnon ! At seventeen she published an " Essay on Mind " and translated " Prometheus . " She was always a frail little woman , with a pale face and eyes bright with spiritual vitality ; but for fifteen years she held on to life , and was intensely happy in her marriage and her work . After Mrs. Browning 's death and the passing of immediate interest in her personality , her fame began to wane as Browning 's fame began to glow , until he has become one of the most influential and dominating English poets of the modern period . The reaction has gone too far and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although intermittent , had much of the prophetic quality . Her genius was greater than her art , and she was a great poet only in moments of intense emotional or spiritual experience . Many of her lines are so awkward and prosaic that they seem to show complete lack of the power of self-criticism . On the other hand , many of " The Sonnets from the Portuguese " reach the highest levels of poetic beauty . One is tempted to say that the sonnet beginning If thou love me , let it be for naught Except for love 's sake only belongs with the very best of its kind . In this noble poem she rises far above the obscurities , mannerisms , impossible rimes , that mark her less impassioned work . There are noble passages in " Aurora Leigh , " and in " The Casa Guidi Windows " the soul of freedom finds a voice as powerful and as appealing as its own ; while " The Cry of the Children " and " Cowper 's Grave " are full of deep and moving pathos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as of mind ; she had a flowing  | imagination and the great gift of spontaneity ; she had intellectual passion , and her whole being responded to the appeal of deep sorrows , great wrongs , and shining ideals . " You are wrong , quite wrong , " once wrote Browning , ? " she has genius : I am only a painstaking fellow . " He was right , she did have genius ; and he had genius , but he was not painstaking . her was an artist save in the happiest hours : that was their common limitation . JEAN INGELOW When Mrs. Browning died Jean Ingelow was well known in this country ; she was forty-one , and had thirty-six years of life before her . Like her sisters among the novelists , she was born in quiet surroundings , and her childhood was passed in an affectionate home with gardens and fields , and the ocean not far away . Many Americans have seen the tower of Boston Cathedral , locally called the " Stump . " There is a famous choir school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , which Tennyson said came in on the Lincolnshire coast more majestically than anywhere else in England . But the little girl , who moved the stones in the path because she thought they must tire of lying in the same place , was to sing of things more familiar and intimate than the ocean . The title of her first book of verse , " A Rhyming Chronicle of Incidents and Feelings , " suggested the field of her interests ; although " High Tide on the Lincolnshire Coast " showed that she was not indifferent to the spell and tragedy of the sea as it rushed into the humble life of the coast . She loved children , the home , the common relations and experiences of  | men , so full of sentiment and pathos to the tender-hearted and poetic . Fev poems of the last generation found thei way to more hearts than " Divided , ' and " The Songs of Seven " : they touched deep springs of feeling , am they had a captivating , musical cadence Jean Ingelow did not rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a sibyl ; she was a singer o near and dear things , but her voice wa clear and sweet and full of deep feeling DINAH MULOCK CRAIK English rectories have been school of sound English , taste for good litera ture , and knowledge of ordered am dignified life which form a distinctively English training . Dinah Maria Mulocl Craik , whom readers of the last genera tion know as Miss Mulock , was one or the products of this home culture . She too was born in a rectory ; bu : her early life was neither tranquil nor happy . The unkindness of he : - father to her mother finally led her to open revolt , and she undertook the support of her mother and brothers by her writing . She had , fortunately , a gift of expression which was immediately serviceable , and her first attempt in the field of fiction was successful . This story , " The Ogilvies , " appeared in 1849 , and secured an early popularity . She had little invention in the making of plots ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . She published several novels which find few readers today : but in 1857 she touched the heart of her generation in a novel full of vigor and  | tenderness . " John Halifax , Gentleman , " appealed strongly to the growing democratic sentiment of England . The word " gentleman " has had a definite social meaning for generations in that country . John Halifax was a self-made man without social background or educational advantages ; but he was a gentleman by instinct , a fine type of the self-respecting man who makes lace in the world by force of character , ability , and native refinement . Mrs. Craik wrote stories which she regarded more highly ; but her readers were right in placing " John Halifax , Gentleman , " on a her plane than her other novels . She will be remembered chiefly as its author , and as the author of a tender poem of motherhood , " Philip , My King . "  |                    @
