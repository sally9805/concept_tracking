 | AMERICAN markets have stood up during the past few weeks under a tempest of a character never before encountered since the creation of the modern mechanism of finance . For a few days it looked as though the entire machinery of banking and credit built . up in Europe during forty years of peace had been brought to a standstill , and as if the American market would be compelled also to suspend its activities . The New York Stock Exchange , under a torrent of orders from Europe to sell American securities held abroad , remained open until the close of business on Thursday , July 30 , but was closed the next morning after a consultation between the governing board and big banking interests . In the meantime , the usual mechanism of foreign exchange had broken down , partly because shipping was threatened by the war and insurance rates for the shipment of gold had become prohibitive . Even such credits as were possessed by American banks abroad were in a state of suspense and drafts on England which should have been sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5.25 and even in some cases to $6 . The seriousness of the situation abroad was manifested by almost every cable message which came from the great centers of finance , ? London , Paris , Berlin , Amsterdam , Brussels , and St. Petersburg . The French and English governments promptly declared a moratorium , which means that the holder of documentary obligations , like bills of exchange and promissory notes , can not enforce payment according to the terms of the obligation until the delay granted has expired . In France , the payment of specie at the Bank of France was promptly suspended ; in Germany , gold was gotten only with difficulty and in trifling amounts from any of the banks ; in Belgium , specie suspension occurred ; and in Holland , similar action was accompanied by authority to the National Bank of the Netherlands to issue additional notes to the amount of $200,000,000 . In France , also , the limit of circulation of the Bank of France was increased at a jump from $1,300,000,000 to $2,300,000,000. 326 THE AMERICAN REVIEW OF REVIEWS  | Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold in exchange for its notes which cut down its reserve by more than $50,000,000 in less than a week and led ultimately to the suspension of the bank act of 1844 , which limits the amount of notes that can be issued without gold . London has long prided herself on being the clearing house of the world , and on being the only market where obligations were always payable promptly for their full value in gold . The very fact , however , that the London market was a clearing house for obligations from all over the European Continent and from Africa , Asia , and Latin America , which could not be collected promptly , naturally deprived her of the means of making her usual settlements and made it necessary to allow a breathing spell in order to reconstruct the machinery of exchange . EUROPE 'S PREPARATION FOR A CRISIS This breakdown in European finance took place in spite of a long period of preparation for the stress of war on the part of farsighted statesmen and bankers in Europe . The fact was clearly recognized after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany nearly to the verge of war , that the European banks were inadequately equipped for a great struggle in arms . It is reported that the German Kaiser , near the close of the year 1912 , called the governor of the Imperial Bank before him and asked if the bank was properly equipped for war . Being answered in the negative , he is reported to have replied : " When I ask that question again , I want a different answer . " At once , the Imperial Bank set to work to strengthen its gold reserve , with entire indifference to the usual principles of political economy determining the free movement of gold . It appeared as a high bidder at the London auctions for the gold which arrived from South Africa every week ; it husbanded all the gold which entered the bank in the course of ordinary operations ; and it greatly expanded the issue of notes for 50 marks ( $11.90 ) , and 20 marks ( $4.76 ) , which had never been issued prior to 1906 . The bankers of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gold resources , met her on the same ground . Within a year and a half , the three state banks of France , Germany , and Russia drew into their vaults an amount of gold equal to the entire production within that time which was available for monetary uses , exclusive of the amounts required in the arts and for exportation to India . Their total increase in gold holdings in eighteen months was about $360,000,000 , and shortly before Austria delivered her brutal ultimatum to Servia at the close of July , the gold holdings of the Bank of France had reached $792,160,000 ; of the State Bank of Russia , $819,700,000 ; of the Imperial Bank of Germany , $336,000,000 ; and of the Bank of Austria-Hungary , $254,400,000 . THE AMERICAN MONEY MARKET To these gold war funds , the United States contributed during the spring of the present year up to the end of June , about $84,000,000 in the form of gold exports . When the war-clouds broke into storm , a new effort in Europe to turn other forms of wealth into gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $46,000,000 , and sales of securities on the New York Stock Exchange which would probably have called for $30,000,000 more . The American market had remained , up to the very eve of war , comparatively indifferent to the gathering storm clouds in Europe . With a gold monetary stock in the country estimated at about $1,700,000,000 , the loss of $100,000,000 , more or less , caused little alarm . If the same situation had arisen in 1895 , when the Treasury of the United States was on the brink of specie suspension , and it was necessary to make a contract with the Morgan and Rothschild houses to obtain $65,000,000 in gold and to protect it by a monopoly of the market for exchange , the results to American finance would have been appalling . Attempt to control the exchange market by fixing high rates would have been futile against the feverish thirst for the yellow metal in Europe , which would not have been slaked nor greatly restrained by a trifling difference in the cost of getting it . A STRONG POSITION Fortunately , the finances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a strain than in the closing days of July , 1914 . Even on the stock market , liquidation had been so long going on and speculation had been so discouraging in its results , that there were only a few margined accounts to be thrown over and only moderate loans outstanding on the part of the banks to commission-house brokers . In respect to its gold equipment , the United States was stronger in some senses than even Russia and France , with the mountains of the yellow metal at the command of their cenAMERICAN FINANCE IN THE WAR TEMPEST 327  | tral banks . The amount in gold certificates outstanding at near their maximum point on April 30 , 1914 , was $1,158,997,000 . These certificates represent simply deposits of gold on behalf of the owners in the custody of the government and are only a part , although a large part , of gold resources of the country . The Treasury could afford to look on with comparative indifference while certificates were turned into coin and the coin went abroad ; for neither of these operations affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold standard law of 1900 at the sum of $150,000,000 , nor did they affect directly the " free gold " in the Treasury cash , which stood on July 31st at a point above $130,000,000 . Under the gold standard law , United States notes are redeemable on demand from the legal tender reserve of $150,000,000 , but when so redeemed may be exchanged for gold in the general cash of the Treasury , if gold is found there . Never since the enactment of the law in 1900 , has the legal tender reserve fallen below the legal limit of $150,000,000 ; and this reserve was buttressed by a fund of $130,000,000 of free gold in the Treasury . ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BANKS When it became apparent , however , that the demands of Europe for gold might be almost limitless , if she could throw upon the New York market the great mass of American securities in which she had invested , prompt and energetic action was taken by the banking interests of New York and of the Government to protect the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing of the Stock Exchange ; at a meeting of the Clearing House Committee on Sunday , Aug. 2 , it was decided to issue Clearing House certificates for use between the banks of New York in settling clearing-house balances ; and on Saturday , Aug. 1 , the Hon. William G. McAdoo , Secretary of the Treasury , arrived in New York and entered into earnest conferences with the banking interests , with the result that the Treasury arranged for the prompt issue of emergency bank notes to enable the banks to substitute notes for gold certificates in the circulation and thereby husband their gold and build up their reserves . These reserves had fallen from $466 , - 577,000 for the week of July 25th to $444 , - 436,000 on August 1 , and fell still further , under the pressure of gold exports , to $386 , - 589,000 on August 8 . If jealousies or distrust had existed between the big financial interests in New York and the administration at Washington , they were quickly forgotten under the pressure of the general peril . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldrich-Vreeland law of 1908 , which would have expired by limitation on June 30 , 1914 , but for the forethought of Senator Owen , chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking , and Chairman Carter Glass , of the House Committee , and an amendment received the approval of President Wilson on Tuesday , August 4 , doing away with this limitation and extending the authorized aggregate of new note issues from $500,000,000 to 125 per cent . of the capital and surplus of the banks , or more than $2,000,000,000 . It was probably fortunate for the country that the organization of the new system of Federal reserve banks had been delayed up to the breaking out of the crisis . The new system might have been very effective in protecting the situation if it had been in complete operation ; but in a period of transition , which would have called for the shifting of considerable amounts of legal tender money from the old national banks to the new Federal reserve banks , it would have proved a source of embarrassment without having any completed powers of relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties of the situation , the Secretary of the Treasury had the assistance of those three members of the Federal Reserve Board , who had already been confirmed by the Senate , ? Hon. Charles S , Hamlin , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury ; Mr. W. P. G. Harding , an Alabama banker , familiar with the conditions for moving the cotton crop ; and Dr. Adolph C. Miller , a trained political economist . EASING THE STRAIN These gentlemen remained in New York during the period of acute pressure for currency and superintended the issue within a week of $46,514,980 , in new notes , to New York banks alone . The peculiar value of these notes in relieving monetary strain is that they can be paid out by the banks in response to calls for currency , whether from interior banks or from individuals , and thereby permit the banks to husband their gold certificates and build up their reserves . Incidentally also they equip the banks with increased lending power without dipping into their reserves . Sanity gradually returned to the financial markets in London as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps taken in both countries began to be recognized by the finan328 THE AMERICAN REVIEW OF REVIEWS  | cial community . The Bank of England , which lost in a week more than $50,000,000 in gold , gained gold rapidly during the secend week in August . The rush for the redemption of bank notes in gold was brought to an end when the government authorized the bank to issue notes in excess of the legal limit and put out notes for ten shillings ( $2.44 ) and 11 ( $4.88 ) , which had not before been done since the recovery from the Napoleonic wars . The discount rate of the Bank of England , which was raised on Friday , July 31 , to 8 per cent. , and on the next clay to 10 per cent. , was reduced in the following week to 6 and then to 5 per cent. , and accommodation was extended as usual to solvent clients . The deadlock in exchange with the United States was partially broken by the same firm which had saved the United States Treasury from specie suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , that the government of France had deposited with the Paris office of J. P. Morgan &; Company , a sum of about $6,000,000 , which was subject to drafts by the French Ambassador in Washington . By means of checks drawn upon this fund , but delivered to J. P. Morgan &; Company in New York , the French Government would be able to purchase supplies in the United States and the drafts would release an equal amount of money in New York , which could be applied to obligations of French bankers and importers to bankers and exporters in New York . A clever move in the same direction was announced by the Bank of England on August 11 , by which the Canadian Treasury Department was made a branch of the bank and custodian of the gold due the bank in New York . By this means the gold held on this side of the water could be counted as a part of the reserve - of the bank against its note issues and deposit liabilities in England . AMERICAN SECURITIES HELD IN EUROPE Perhaps the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American finance , is the sending back of American securities held in Europe , to be unloaded on the New York Stock Exchange at any price for cash . For many years , a portion of European savings has been applied to investment in the United States , until the amount thus invested has reached , according to the computations of Sir George Paish , editor of the London Statist , no less a sum than $6,000 , - 000,000 . In Canada , also , it is estimated that foreign capital is invested to the amount of more than $3,000,000,000 . The amount invested in the United States , which is principally in the form of securities , represents nearly the entire value of the annual production of the country , and more than half the aggregate assets of the national banks . Securities issued for railway-building and industrial enterprises represent fixed capital which is the result of the savings of years and in modern times has come to exceed many times the amount of annual production . Obviously , it would be impossible for the United States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of American securities which have been placed abroad . The problem , fortul ately , can not present itself in quite so crude and appalling a form , but the necessity of taking back even one-fifth or one-tenth of this huge mass of obligations would be sufficient to cause derangement in the money market and serious declines in stock exchange prices . It was for this reason that it was necessary to close the Stock Exchange on July 31 , under the torrent of frightened European selling , and it will be necessary to study the situation in this respect carefully before the American Stock Exchanges can be again opened for business . DISTRIBUTION OF THE COSTS OF WAR Even if the war should come to an end in a few months , the echo of its disturbing effects would be felt in the market for capital , because of the considerable loans which it would be necessary for the governments involved to offer to the public . Experience in former wars has shown that the countries which prepare to absorb new issues of their national loans do so by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , this would not be done with the precipitation and sacrifice of values which occur under the threat of war , but the effect would probably be to depress the price of other securities and make it difficult to obtain capital for new enterprises while the costs of war were being distributed over the world 's money markets . America , therefore , whatever her temporary profits from an enhanced demand for certain products and the opening of new opportunities for her commerce and shipping , will be compelled to bear some share of the loss caused by the consumption of hundreds of millions of the world 's savings in supporting contending armies and keeping them supplied with the weapons of destruction .
