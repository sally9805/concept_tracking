 | IT is now more than a century and a half since Louis XV of France signed over to Great Britain the Dominion of Canada with the light remark : " Oh , well ; it 's only a few acres of snow . " One can not help wondering what his thoughts would have been could he have had a vision of the Canada of to-day and the part she is playing as an ally of his countrymen of the twentieth century . Out of a population of some seven and a half millions Canada has given 440,000 fighting men to the war . At the end of last year war orders totalling $1,095,000,000 had been placed with her , while this year 's munitions orders are expected to exceed $700,000,000 ? or about $100 for every man , woman and child . At the beginning of this year 630 factories were working on munition contracts , the country 's output being now more than that of any European nation except Germany before the war . Wooden ships , steel ships and submarines are being turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board is spending annually more than two and a half times as much as the Federal Government spends in a normal year . Anxious European allies await the grain and flour of the Canadian prairies as eagerly as ever the populace of Ancient Rome looked for the corn ships from Sicily and Egypt . And if the province of Alberta alone were cultivated on the same intensive scale prevailing in pre-war Belgium it would support an agricultural population of fifty million ? or half the entire population of the United States . All this and more has been done ; yet it is felt that not nearly the best national effort has hitherto been put forth . The present Conservative government at Ottawa is tottering to its fall beneath the belaboring of opponents ? and a good many political friends ? who feel that it essentially has not been a " Win-the-War Government . " The voluntary enlistment system , despite the halfmillion men that it would shortly have seen with the colors , seems doomed to ultimate , if not immediate , abandonment in favor of conscription . A nation-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on . And , gravest of all , the fiery testing of war has revealed that Canada , like the Motherland , has a " Home Rule " problem . I propose to deal with conscription and its concomitant crop of knotty questions first , because it has come first in the attention of the entire Dominion since the last week of April , and since it has precipitated an internal crisis of the most far-reaching potentialities , potentialities that , in the words of the Mayor of Montreal , point directly to civil war . I was in Australia when the conscription issue there was to the fore ; the results in both cases have been the same ? dissension , unrest , quarrels , bitterness , even between members of the same family and between neighbors whose friendship previously had extended over years . The situation in Canada has been further complicated and envenomed by the presence of racial feeling , due to the fact that the French-Canadians , numbering approximately one-third of the entire population , for the most part are inexorably opposed to any form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly upbraiding them for their small part in the war . In many phases there is a remarkable parallel between the Dominion 's problem regarding Quebec and Great Britain 's problem regarding Ireland . In both cases the difficulties are complicated by religious differences ; in both cases the smaller nationality is clamoring for secession and complete liberty to develop its own national genius independently ; in both cases the greater nationality is loath to grant absolute independence for reasons of strategic safety and commercial self-interest ; in both cases the situation has been embittered by being made political and press capital of ; in both cases the burdens of war have brought long-smoldering fires of discontent to open blaze . Thus , La Croix , a Quebec publication  | with a circulation almost confined to the Roman Catholic clergy , frankly demands separation from the rest of the Dominion , though it would have the autonomous colony thus created remain loyal to the British Crown ? another Newfoundland , in a way . Said an article in a June issue of La Croix : From being the pioneers of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pretends to be " superior . " What advantage , minimum though it be , have we got from Confederation i. e. , the federalizing of Canada ? We have worked hard and it has all gone to enrich the Anglo-Saxons . Our faith , our language , our schools , the future of our children . . . the mission which Providence seems to have confided to our hands to sow on the shores of the St. Lawrence a truly Christian civilization appears to be passing away . . We are already crushed by an enormous debt , and to-day they wish to impose by force a law as unconstitutional as it is anti-Canadian , which will send our sons and brothers to the European butchery like so many cattle . . . And no one speaks of breaking the odious regime which binds us to the chariot wheels of the conqueror . . . . No one suggests the breaking of this tie . . . . How ' sweet . . . to live in a Lower Canada separated from Upper Canada , yet subject as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race would then develop normally . in a country extending from the Ottawa to the Atlantic , administered by a French-Canadian majority possessing the power to make all our laws , to treat freely with foreign countries , to fix our customs tariff , to control our immigration , our navigation and our . . . transportation . I have just crossed Canada from coast to coast as I crossed it a year ago . I have lived in the country at intervals for the last ten years : and never yet have I heard the nativeborn Canadian speak one good word for the French-Canadian . I am talking now of the frank opinion you get from your fellow man in the smoking cars on trains , in the rotundas of hotels , and places where men congregate ; I am not referring to the expressions for special consumption flung out from time to time by politicians with axes to grind , of the sympathy of a few international thinkers or poets ( as Dr. Drummond was ) , of the careful , vague generalities of business men with one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? as strong on one side as the other : the war has merely accentuated it , brought it in fact to a crisis . I do not propose to go into the underlying causes of the trouble or expatiate on the respective merits of the rival nationalities : I merely present the factsas they stand , without comment and without prejudice . For Americans to arrive at a truer appreciation of this problem of Canada 's , I would suggest this : Imagine a reorganized , prosperous , orderly Mexico under United- States rule ; allow the Mexicans to perpetuate their own laws , religion , language and-customs ; permit them their own schools where the children grow up to the use of the Spanish tongue ; have all government papers and documents drawn up in Spanish as well as English ; apportion to Mexico a proportionately equal representation in Congress , with members from south of the Rio Grande allowed to deliver theircongressional speeches in Spanish , though they understand English perfectly ; imagine a President ? a Mexican ? elected-to office for term after term ; realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed or intermarried with Americans ; and on top of all this , try to think what would happen if the recent conscription law passed by Congress had been made to apply to Mexico against the almost united will of the people of that country . . . then you have some glimmering of the problem now confronting the Dominion . Substitute in the foregoing hypothetical case " Quebec " for " Mexico , " " French-Canadian " for " Mexican , " " Canadian " for " American , " " French " for " Spanish , " and you have an almost exact parallel . " Why are we hostile to the FrenchCanadians ? " was one of the typical statements made to me . " Why should n't we be ? Well , we 're up against it now , good and hard . We 've raised over 400,000 men , and the French-Canadians , although they number a third of our people , haveonly contributed something like 12,000 ? and that 's giving them all the best of it in face of official figures . Is conscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is : we do n't like it any more than they do , but if that 's the only way to get ' em out with the colors . . . all right . " In his speech in the Ottawa House , asking that the conscription issue be put to the plebiscite , Sir Wilfrid Laurier , himself a French-Canadian and for many years Premier , admitted that recruiting in Quebec had not been what it should have been , , adding that better results might have been attained had the government sent men of their own race , tongue and sympathies among the people of French Canada . He pointed out that enlistment proceeded reversely in proportion to the length of time men had been in the country : British-born had contributed the largest number , Canadian-born of Brit- ish stock a smaller proportion , FrenchCanadians ? who had been in the Dominion longest of all ? the least . Always has the racial feeling operated against any real unity between the two nationalities , nullifying the dreams of the fathers of Confederation . Yesterday it was bi-lingualism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who knows ? Le Devoir , the organ of Henri Bourassa , the Quebec Nationalist leader , said recently that while reserving a sincere affection for France , their country of origin , FrenchCanadians did not feel obliged to fight for her any more than the European French would feel called upon to fight for them were they attacked by " the United States or Japan , or if civil war broke out . " As for England , they felt held to all duties resulting to them from the British Constitution and from the relations between the Imperial Government and that at Ottawa ? but nothing more . At a meeting held in Montreal at the end of June , Mr. Bourassa stated that Canada entered the war as a slave , " the servile satellite of England , " adding that if Canada were in any danger then it must be danger of annexation by the United States " brought about by the economic conditions due to borrowing . " He concluded : " The Dominions have lost more of liberty since this war began than they gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the Dominion of Canada celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Confederation . Three days before that , Mederic Martin , Mayor of Montreal , said in the Ottawa House , referring to the government 's conscription measure : " If you pass this bill , you are entering the realm of civil war . You are deliberately provoking the people . " Conscription in Canada is also opposed by the class that defeated it at the Australian referendum last October ? organized labor . The unions demand that Premier Borden do as his colleague , Hughes of Australia , did ? submit the matter to the people . Alphonse Verville , Liberal-Labor member for a Montreal constituency , said in the Ottawa Parliament on June 28 that organized labor in the Dominion had been ignored since war began , although in the United States President Wilson had consulted it to gain its cooperation . He threatened a general strike all over the country if conscription were enforced without a referendum . Trade unions from the Atlantic to the Pacific have made the same threat , a recent resolution of Calgary unionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable terms of menace . J. C. Watters , president of the Dominion Trades and Labor Congress , whose position is somewhat similar to that of Samuel Gompers in the United States , has issued a statement which says in part : Until the government gives proof that conscription . . . is the only measure to preserve the existence of the state and of the institutions and liberties we enjoy , organized labor has every warrant in seeking its defeat by both their economic and political power . If the government is sincere in its determination to " consecrate the power of the nation " to the cause of the Allies and democracy , the conscription of man power will follow , and not precede , that of wealth and the nationalization of every industry necessary for the prosecution of the war . . . . The statements made by the Premier , taken in conjunction with information I gleaned in Washington all went to demonstrate that the need of the hour was not men at the front so much as food for the people of our Motherland , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by overcoming the submarine menace , and the manufacturing of all war supplies and the building of ships . I consider it my duty to sound a note of warning to the organized workers not to permit themselves to be shackled with the chains of conscription . It is interesting to note in this connection that the Canadian Manufacturers ' Association , at convention in Winnipeg during June , showed a marked desire for the government to nationalize the railroads . On the Pacific Coast opposition to conscription is all but as bitter as it is in Quebec . In British Columbia , moreover , the measure is opposed not only by union labor , but by earnest-minded men and women of the classes that elsewhere in the Dominion are generally in favor of compulsion . They fear it for reasons which , if local and incidental , are also cogent and fraught with limitless potentialities . They point to the fact that there are probably 50,000 Asiatics ? Chinese , Japanese , and East Indians ? between the Pacific and the Divide ; that in addition to these aliens there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Austrians and Germans ? working in the lumber camps and mines of British Columbia , not all of whom are loyal to Canada in particular or the British Empire in general . " Our best men have left us under the voluntary system of their own free will , " these Coast people said to me in effect . " If you  | forcibly take most of the rest of our ablebodied males between the ages of eighteen and forty-five from us by compulsion , you will be handing over this province to aliens ? and aliens with Asiatics in the ascendancy at that . Our women are getting uneasy about that . Our men are wondering what is to become of white and highly-paid labor ? both now and after the war ? if you allow Asiatic and cheap European labor to get more of a grip here than it has already got . . . and we feel none too comfortable about it as it is . Even the most ardent supporters of conscription say that it is aimed principally at Quebec : let them see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " So strong has public feeling become that women have been recruited this year for fruit-picking in British Columbia instead of the work being practically left to Chinese as in times past . That is how the conscription issue stands in Canada . Voluntary enlistment is dead , or nearly so . There is a widespread feeling that in raising 440,000 men out of a total population of seven and a half millions , Canada has contributed her share , of man power at least . If the government adopts the Laurier amendment and submits the matter to a referendum it will probably be defeated ? overwhelmingly . If it passes the bill without a referendum there will be trouble ? civil war , say the most violent FrenchCanadian leaders , passive resistance to the last ditch , say the more cautious ones ? in French Canada ; there will be trouble throughout the country with organized labor ; there will be trouble in British Columbia with organized labor and many people unaffiliated with any trade unions . The mere passing of the bill probably will not evoke more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it begins that the real crisis will be at hand . And it is proposed , if the bill pass , to put it into force some time later ? perhaps after a last desperate effort to get the men required by voluntary enlistment ? by proclamation . SHIPBUILDING IN CANADA One of the most interesting reactions of the war upon Canadian industrial life is that which has caused a recrudescence of shipbuilding . The Imperial Munitions Board , on behalf of the British Minister of Shipping , has undertaken a program of steel vessel construction in the Dominion . A sub-commission to direct the turning out of wooden vessels in British Columbia also has been appointed and is now actively at work on the Coast . The provincial government is guaranteeing 55 per cent . of the cost of this auxiliary fleet . By the end of June , from one firm 's yards in North Vancouver , seven wooden schooners , equipped with twin auxiliary Diesel engines of 320 horsepower , burning crude oil , and measuring 260 feet over all with a 44-foot beam , already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction . One and a quarter million feet of lumber ? British Columbia fir ? are used for each ship , and each ship takes out on its voyage 1,500,000 feet of lumber as cargo ; so that it needs no special knowledge to grasp the immense fillip given the Coast lumbering industry by this new war undertaking . In fact , before the program was begun the sawmills of the province were everywhere closing down . As I write this ? in the early days of July ? the first of the auxiliary schooners has just reached Sydney , Australia , after a voyage of seventy-six days . This time will be greatly cut down later , as the initial trip was really by way of an experiment ; in fact , the vessel had to put in at Honolulu for engine adjustments , after which her behavior gave all-round satisfaction to master and owners . Vancouver is situated on a strip of land between the Fraser River and Burrard Inlet ; between these two bodies of water , running up into the city like a clawing finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small machine shop on the shore of False Creek . The concern that owned that machine shop is now building six standard steel steamers to the order of the government , the vessels to be delivered in fourteen months at a contract price of $8,000,000 . Such is the story of shipbuilding ? wartime shipbuilding ? in the Dominion ; and the country is only at the beginning . I can not help thinking that perhaps Masefield spoke a little too soon when he said : The schooners and the merry crews are laid away to rest , A little south the sunset in the Islands of the Blest .
