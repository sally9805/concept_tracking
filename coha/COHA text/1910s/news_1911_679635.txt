A thorough investigation of the whole affair has been made by staff officers of the Eastern Division headquarters , and as a result all the facts were laid before Mayor Gaynor by Major Gen. Grant , the division commander . Mayor Gaynor was indignant when he read Gen. Grant 's communication , and yesterday he sent to Police Commissioner Waldo a letter in which he charat terized as " intolerable " conditions that made such a thing as the insult to the artillerymen possible . The place out of which the artillerymen were ordered was Sultzer 's dancing pavilion on Coney Island , and the special policeman who made them leave was G. Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them he was carrying out the orders of " the boss , " and , according to the army officers , he told them the truth . As a result of the incident G. Clark will now cease to be a special policeman , and so will scores of others who have been wearing the badge of the special service , " so-called . Commissioner Waldo is Imown to be in sympathy with Mayor Gaynor 's views in the matter . and an order abolishing all special policemen is expected to be issued to-day from Police Headquarters . The letter from Gen. Grant , on which Mayor Gaynor acted . was received at the City Hall yesterday morning . The Mayor read it , and it is said that he was mad clear through . Certain it is he lost 510 time in writing this letter to Commissioner Waldo : Office of the Mayor , July 26. 1911 . Sir : I beg to inclose to you a letter front Major Gen. Grant , calling my attention to the fact that two privates of the United States Army were excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you be so good as to make a careful examination of this matter and report to me all of the particulars ? I note that Gen. Grant says in his letter that Special Policeman G. Clark , in accordance with the instructions of the proprietor , excluded the soldiers . I bad supposed that all these special policemen . hired out by the Police Department to ' private individuals to do their bidding , and who of ten eommit the - grossest outrages at the command of their employers , had been called in and their badges taken from them . If any have been allowed to remain through oversight , please have them removed at once . It is contrary to the first principles of . government to put public officers in the employ of private individuals . to be paid by them . and directed in the performance of their duty by them . If they do not do what these private individuals tell them to do . then they are discharged . The result is that many wrongs are perpetrated by these special officers at the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition is intolerable . let private individuals and corporations hire their own watchmen and servants as best they can . We can not create policemen to be hired out to them and put under their orders . Very truly yours , W. J. GA'S-NOR . Mayor . Rhinelander Waldo , Esq. , Commissioner Police . " There are some people who would like to have a Mayor as well as a special policeman in their employ to do their bidding . " said Mayor Gaynor in making his letter to Commissioner Waldo public . The Mayor added that he did pot care to specify the individuals to whom he had reference as being willing to have a Mayor on their payroll . Those to whom he had reference would know when they read his comments Mayor Gaynor ordered Police Commissiener Cropsey last April to take away the badges of the special policemen . Objection was made to the order by many ' banking and trust companies , and in certain cases the specials were permitted to remain . It now seems probable that all special will go . In that event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other special Policemen will be out of a job or retained as watchmen merely . The story of the ejection of the Forst Hamilton artillerymen was told to a TrmEs reporter on Governors Island last night by one of the staff officers . who had a prominent part in the investigation of the affair . - " The artillerymen who were insulted . " this officer said. : : are both soldiers of excellent character , who have been in the army a long- time and against whose records not a single mark has ever been made . Last Fourth of July they went to Coney Island to enjoy the holiday . They wore the regulation dress uniform of the Coast Artillery Corps . In the evening they sauntered into Sultzer 's dance hall . They were sober and their deportment above reproach . This we are in a position to prove by the testimony of several reputable - civilian witnesses who were present and witnessed the humiliation they were subjected to at the hands of . a special policeman named Clark . The men were dancing when Clark went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to leave the hall . " ' What for ? I have not created any disorder . ' the soldier answered . " ' Well , I know you have not . but my orders are that fellows in that uniform ca n't dance here . ' was the gist of the explanation offered by Clark . " The soldiers protested , and Clark told them to see the boss . ' They did so and the ' boss ' told them that Clark was carrying out his instructions . and that they would have to get out . The soldiers realized that there was nothing for them to do but leave and they did , special policemen following them to the door . while hundreds of civilians looked on and Wendered what it was all about , it being evident to them all that the artillerymen were sober and well-behaved young men . " " Do you mean to say that the only - reason of the objection was the uniform , and that it was the reason advanced by the proprietor when the soldiers demanded an-explanation ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . " The artillerymen returned to their quarters at Fort Hamilton , and told their comrades of the insult . The story came to the ears of the post commander , who made an investigation and reported the result of it to division headquarters on Governors Island . The division officers made another and more sweeping investigation , and brought the matter to the attention , of Mayor Gaynor . The facts in the case may be carried ' VS Albany , and it is believed that a bill will be introduced at the next session of the Legislature making it a criminal of-. fence for the proprietor of any public place to discriminate - against a soldier or sailor of the United States because he is. in the uniform of one of those services . Such a law for the District of Columbia and the Federal Territories has already been passed by . Congress . On the evening of July 4 , " said E. T. Sultzer , owner of the dance pavilion , last night ; " we had a reception in the pavilion in honor of the Coney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I invitations were kept out .
