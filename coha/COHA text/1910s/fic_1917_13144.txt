A room in a house which was once a life-saving station . Since ceasing to be that it has taken on no other character , except that of a place which no one cares either to preserve or change . It is painted the life-saving gray , but has not the life-saving freshness . This is one end of what was the big boat room , and at the ceiling is seen a part of the frame work from which the boat once swung . About two thirds of the back wall is open , because of the big sliding door , of the type of barn door , and through this open door are seen the sand dunes , and beyond them the woods . At one point the line where woods and dunes meet stands out clearly and there are indicated the rude things , vines , bushes , which form the outer uneven rim of the woods  --  the only things that grow in the sand . At another point a sand-hill is menacing the woods . This old life-saving station is at a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea also is seen . ( The station is located on the outside shore of Cape Cod , at the point , near the tip of the Cape , where it makes that final curve which forms the Provincetown Harbor . ) The dunes are hills and strange forms of sand on which , in places , grows the stiff beach grass  --  struggle ; dogged growing against odds . At right of the big sliding door is a drift of sand and the top of buried beach grass is seen on this . There is a door left , and at right of big sliding door is a slanting wall . Door in this is ajar at rise of curtain , and through this door BRADFORD and TONY , life-savers , are seen bending over a man 's body , attempting to restore respiration . The captain of the life-savers comes into view outside the big open door , at left ; he appears to have been hurrying , peers in , sees the men , goes quickly to them . CAPTAIN I 'll take this now , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Capt'n . He was dead when we picked him up . CAPTAIN Dannie Sears was dead when we picked him up . But we brought him back . I 'll go on awhile . ( The two men who have been bending over the body rise , stretch to relax , and come into the room . ) BRADFORD ( pushing back his arms and putting his hands on his chest ) . Work ,  --  tryin ' to put life in the dead . CAPTAIN Where 'd you find him , Joe ? BRADFORD In front of this house . Not forty feet out . CAPTAIN What 'd you bring him up here for ? ( He speaks in an abstracted way , as if the working part of his mind is on something else , and in the muffled voice of one bending over . ) BRADFORD ( with a sheepish little laugh ) . Force of habit , I guess . We brought so many of ' em back up here . Looks around the room . And then it was kind of unfriendly down where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you till he 'd have no way of knowin ' he was ashore . TONY Lucky I was not sooner or later as I walk by from my watch . BRADFORD You have accommodating ways , Tony . Not sooner or later . I would n't say it of many Portagees . But the sea ( calling it in to the CAPTAIN ) is friendly as a kitten alongside the women that live here . Allie Mayo  --  they 're both crazy  --  had that door open ( moving his head toward the big sliding door ) sweepin ' out , and when we come along she backs off and stands lookin ' at us , lookin '  --  Lord , I just wanted to get him somewhere else . So I kicked this door open with my foot ( jerking his hand toward the room where the CAPTAIN is seen bending over the man ) and got him away . ( Under his voice . ) If he did have any notion of comin ' back to life , he would n't a come if he 'd seen her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know who he is , Joe ? BRADFORD I never saw him before . CAPTAIN Mitchell telephoned from High Head that a dory came ashore there . BRADFORD Last night was n't the best night for a dory . ( To TONY , boastfully . ) Not that I could n't a stayed in one . Some men can stay in a dory and some ca n't . ( Going to the inner door . ) That boy 's dead , Capt'n . CAPTAIN Then I 'm not doing him any harm . BRADFORD ( going over and shaking the frame where the boat once swung ) . This the first time you ever been in this place , ai n't it , Tony ? TONY I never was here before . BRADFORD Well , I was here before . ( A laugh . ) And the old man  --  ( nodding toward the CAPTAIN ) he lived here for twenty-seven years . Lord , the things that happened here . There 've been dead ones carried through that door . ( Pointing to the outside door . ) Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Collins , and Lou Harvey and  --  huh ! ' sall over now . You ai n't seen no wrecks . Do n't ever think you have . I was here the night the Jennie Snow was out there . ( Pointing to the sea . ) There was a wreck . We got the boat that stood here ( again shaking the frame ) down that bank . ( Goes to the door and looks out . ) Lord , how 'd we ever do it ? The sand has put this place on the blink all right . And then when in gets too God-for-saken for a life-savin ' station , a lady takes it for a summer residence  --  and then spends the winter . She 's cheerful one . p. 5 TONY A woman  --  she makes things pretty . This not like a place where a woman live . On the floor there is nothing  --  on the wall there is nothing . Things  --  ( trying to express it with his hands ) do not hang on other things . BRADFORD ( imitating TONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other things . In my opinion the woman 's crazy  --  sittin ' over there on the sand  --  ( a gesture toward the dunes ) what 's she lookin ' at ? There ai n't nothin ' to see . And I know the woman that works for her 's crazy  --  Allie Mayo . She 's a Provincetown girl . She was all right once , but  --  ( MRS . PATRICK comes in from the hall at the right . She is a " city woman , " a sophisticated person who has been caught into something as unlike the old life as the dunes are unlike a meadow . At the moment she is excited and angry . ) MRS . PATRICK You have no right here . This is n't the life-saving station any more . Just because it used to be  --  I do n't see why you should think  --  This is my house ! And  --  I want my house to myself ! CAPTAIN ( putting his head through the door . One arm of the man he is working with is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well I must say , lady , I would think that any house could be a life-saving station when the sea had sent a man to it . p. 6 MRS . PATRICK ( who has turned away so she can not see the hand ) . I do n't want him here ! I  --  ( defiant , yet choking ) I must have my house to myself ! CAPTAIN You 'll get your house to yourself when I 've made up my mind there 's no more life in this man . A good many lives have been saved in this house , MRS . Patrick  --  I believe that 's your name  --  and if there 's any chance of bringing one more back from the dead , the fact that you own the house ai n't goin ' to make a damn bit of difference to me ! MRS . PATRICK ( in a thin wild way ) . I must have my house to myself . CAPTAIN Hell with such a woman ! ( Moves the man he is working with and slams the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if there 's any chance of bringing one more back from the dead , " ALLIE MAYO has appeared outside the wide door which gives on the dunes , a bleak woman , who at first seems little more than a part of the sand before which she stands . But as she listens to this conflict one suspects in her that peculiar intensity of twisted things which grow in unfavoring places . ) MRS . PATRICK I  --  I do n't want them here ! I must  --  ( But suddenly she retreats , and is gone. ) p. 7 BRADFORD Well , I could n't say , Allie Mayo , that you work for any too kind-hearted a lady . What 's the matter with the woman ? Does she want folks to die ? Appears to break her all up to see somebody trying to save a life . What d' you you work for such a fish for ? A crazy fish  --  that 's what I call the woman . I 've seen her  --  day after day  --  settin ' over there where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookin ' . ( Suddenly thinking of it . ) I believe she likes to see the sand slippin ' down on the woods . Pleases her to see somethin ' gettin ' buried , I guess . ( ALLIE MAYO , who has stepped inside the door and moved half across the room , toward the corridor at the right , is arrested by this last  --  stands a moment as if seeing through something , then slowly on , and out . ) BRADFORD Some coffee 'd taste good . But coffee , in this house ? Oh , no . It might make somebody feel better . ( Opening the door that was slammed shut . ) Want me now , Capt'n ? CAPTAIN No . BRADFORD Oh , that boy 's dead , Capt'n . CAPTAIN ( snarling ) . Dannie Sears was dead , too . Shut that door . I do n't want to hear that woman 's voice again , ever . ( Closing the door and sitting on a bench built into that corner between the big sliding door and the room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful pair of women  --  livin ' in this cheerful place  --  a place that life-savers had to turn over to the sand  --  huh ! This Patrick woman used to be all right . She and her husband was summer folks over in town . They used to picnic over here on the outside . It was Joe Dyer  --  he 's always talkin ' to summer folks  --  told ' em the government was goin ' to build the new station and sell this one by sealed bids . I heard them talkin ' about it . They was sittin ' right down there on the beach , eatin ' their supper . They was goin ' to put in a fire-place and they was goin ' to paint it bright colors , and have parties over here  --  summer folk notions . Their bid won it  --  who 'd want it ?  --  a buried house you could n't move . TONY I see no bright colors . BRADFORD Do n't you ? How astonishin ! You must be color blind . And I guess we 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Joseph 's grocery store , one day last November , when in she comes  --  MRS . Patrick , from New York . " I 've come to take the old life-saving station , " says she . " I 'm going to sleep over there tonight ! " Huh ! Bill is used to queer ways  --  he deals with summer folks , but that got him . November  --  an empty house , a buried house , you might say , off here on the outside shore  --  way across the sand from man or beast . He got it out of her , not by what she said , but by the way she looked at what he said , that her husband had died , and she was runnin ' off to hide herself , I guess . I person 'd feel sorry for her if she were n't so stand-offish , and so doggon mean . But mean folks have got minds of their own . She slept here that night . Bill had men hauling things till after dark  --  bed , stove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Somebody , " says she , " that does n't say an unnecessary word ! " Well , when Bill come to the back of the store , I said , " Looks to me as if Allie Mayo was the party she 's lookin ' for . " Allie Mayo has got a prejudice against words . Or maybe she likes ' em so well she 's savin ' of ' em . She 's not spoke an unnecessary word for twenty years . She 's got her reasons . Women whose men go to sea ai n't always talkative . ( The CAPTAIN comes out . He closes door behind him and stands there beside it . He looks tired and disappointed . Both look at him . Pause. ) p. 9 CAPTAIN Wonder who he was . BRADFORD Young . Guess he 's not been much at sea . CAPTAIN I hate to leave even the dead in this house . But we can get right back for him . ( A look around . ) The old place used to be more friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave like this . ) Well , Joe , we brought a good many of them back here . BRADFORD Dannie Sears is tendin ' bar in Boston now . ( The three men go ; as they are going around the drift of sand ALLIE MAYO comes in carrying a pot of coffee ; sees them leaving , puts down the coffee pot , looks to the door the CAPTAIN has closed , moves toward it , as if drawn . MRS . PATRICK follows her in . ) MRS . PATRICK They 've gone ? ( MRS . MAYO nods , facing the closed door . MRS . PATRICK And they 're leaving  --  him ? ( Again the other woman nods . ) Then he 's  --  ? ( MRS . MAYO just stands there . ) They have no right  --  just because it used to be their place  --  ! I want my house to myself ! ( Snatches her coat and scarf from a hook and starts through the big door toward the dunes. ) p. 10 MAYO Wait . ( When she has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by what she has done . The other woman is held . ) MAYO ( to herself ) . If I could say that , I can say more . ( Looking at the woman she has arrested , but speaking more to herself . ) That boy in there  --  his face  --  uncovered something  --  ( Her open hand on her chest . But she waits , as if she can not go on ; when she speaks it is in labored way  --  slow , monotonous , as if snowed in by silent years . ) For twenty years , I did what you are doing . And I can tell you  --  it 's not the way . ( Her voice has fallen to a whisper ; she stops , looking ahead at something remote and veiled . ) We had been married  --  two years . ( A start , as of sudden pain . Says it again , as if to make herself say it . ) Married  --  two years . He had a chance to go north on a whaler . Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half  --  it was to be . A year and a half . Two years we 'd been married . ( She sits silent , moving a little back and forth . ) . The day he went away . ( Not spoken , but breathed from pain . ) The days after he was gone . I heard at first . Last letter said farther north  --  not another chance to write till on the way home . ( A wait . ) . Six months . Another . I did not hear . ( Long wait . ) Nobody ever heard . ( After it seems she is held there , and will not go on . ) I used to talk as much as any girl in Provincetown . Jim used to tease me about my talking . But they 'd come in to talk to me . They 'd say  --  " You may hear yet . " They 'd talk about what must have happened . And one day a woman who 'd been my friend all my life said  --  " Suppose he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from my kitchen  --  and from that time till this I 've not said a word I did n't have to say . ( She has become almost wild in telling this . That passes . In a whisper . ) The ice that caught Jim  --  caught me . ( A moment as if held in ice . Comes from it . To MRS . PATRCK simply . ) It 's not the way . ( A sudden change . ) You 're not the only woman in the world whose husband is dead ! p. 11 MRS . PATRICK ( with the cry of the hurt ) . Dead ? My husband 's not dead . MAYO He 's not ? ( Slowly understands . ) Oh . ( The woman in the door is crying . Suddenly picks up her coat which has fallen to the floor and steps outside . ) MAYO ( almost failing to do it ) . Wait . MRS . PATRICK Wait ? Do n't you think you 've said enough ? They told me you did n't say an unnecessary word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see , I should think , that you 've bungled into things you know nothing about ! ( As she speaks , and crying under her breath , she pushes the sand by the door down on the half-buried grass  --  though not as if knowing what she is doing . ) MAYO ( slowly ) . When you keep still for twenty years you know  --  things you didn ' know you knew . I know why you 're doing that . ( She looks up at her , startled . ) Do n't bury the only thing that will grow . Let it grow . ( The woman outside still crying under her breath turns abruptly and starts toward the line where dunes and woods meet. ) p. 12 MAYO I know where you 're going ! ( MRS . PATRICK turns , but not as if she wants to . ) What you 'll try to do . Over there . ( Pointing to the line of woods . ) Bury it . The life in you . Bury it  --  watching the sand bury the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight too . The woods ! They fight for life the way that Captain fought for life in there ! ( Pointing to the closed door . ) MRS . PATRICK ( with a strange exultation ) . And lose the way he lost in there ! MAYO ( sure , sombre ) . They do n't lose . MRS . PATRICK Do n't lose ? ( Triumphant . ) I have walked on the tops of buried trees ! MAYO ( slow , sombre , yet large ) . And vines will grow over the sand that covers the trees , and hold it . And other trees will grow above the buried trees . MRS . PATRICK I 've watched the sand slip down on the vines that reach out farthest . MAYO Another vine will reach that spot . ( Under her breath , tenderly ) . Strange little things that reach out farthest ! p. 13 MRS . PATRICK And will be buried soonest ! MAYO And hold the sand for things behind them . They save a wood that guards a town . MRS . PATRICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the outside  --  these dunes where only beach grass grows , this outer shore where men ca n't live . The Outside . You who were born here and who die here have named it that . MAYO Yes , we named it that , and we had reason . He died here ( reaches her hand toward the closed door ) and many a one before him . But many another reached the harbor ! ( Slowly raises her arm , bends it to make the form of the Cape . Touches the outside of her bent arm . ) The Outside . But an arm that bends to make a harbor  --  where men are safe . MRS . PATRICK I 'm outside the harbor  --  on the dunes , land not life . MAYO Dunes meet woods and woods hold dunes from a town that 's shore to a harbor . MRS . PATRICK This is the Outside . Sand . ( Picking some of it up in her hand and letting it fall on the beach grass . ) Sand that covers  --  hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods to hold the moving hills from Provincetown . Provincetown  --  where they turn when boats ca n't live at sea . Did you ever see the sails come round here when the sky is dark ? A line of them  --  swift to the harbor  --  where their children live . Go back ! ( Pointing . ) Back to your edge of the woods that 's the edge of the dunes . p. 14 MRS . PATRICK The edge of life . Where life trails off to dwarfed things not worth a name . ( Suddenly sits down in the doorway . ) MAYO Not worth a name . And  --  meeting the Outside ! ( Big with the sense of the wonder of life . ) MRS . PATRICK ( lifting sand and letting it drift through her hand ) . They 're what the sand will let them be . They take strange shapes like shapes of blown sand . MAYO Meeting the Outside . ( Moving nearer ; speaking more personally . ) I know why you came here . To this house that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life try to live . I know what holds you on these dunes , and draws you over there . But other things are true beside the things you want to see . MRS . PATRICK How do you know they are ? Where have you been for twenty years ? MAYO Outside . Twenty years . That 's why I know how brave they are . ( Indicating the edge of the woods . Suddenly different . ) You 'll not find peace there again ! Go back and watch them fight ! MRS . PATRICK ( swiftly rising ) . You 're a cruel woman  --  a hard , insolent woman ! I knew what I was doing ! What do you know about it ? About me ? I did n't go to the Outside . I was left there . I 'm only  --  trying to get along . Everything that can hurt me I want buried  --  buried deep . Spring is here . This morning I knew it .

You have n't felt for so long you do n't know what it means ! But I tell you , Spring is here ! And now you 'd take that from me  --  ( looking now toward the edge of the woods ) the thing that made me know they would be buried in my heart  --  those things I ca n't live and know I feel . You 're more cruel than the sea ! " But other things are true beside the things you want to see ! " Outside . Springs will come when I will not know that it is Spring . ( As if resentful of not more deeply believing what she says . ) What would there be for me but the Outside ? What was there for you ? What did you ever find after you lost the thing you wanted ? p. 15 MAYO I found  --  what I find now I know . The edge of life  --  to hold life behind me  --  ( A slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( stepping back ) . You call what you are life ? ( Laughs . ) Bleak as those ugly things that grow in the sand ! MAYO ( under her breath , as one who speaks tenderly of beauty ) . Ugly ! MRS . PATRICK ( passionately ) . I have known life . I have known life . You 're like this Cape . A line of land way out to sea  --  land not life . MAYO A harbor far at sea . ( Raises her arm , curves it in as if around something she loves . ) Land that encloses and gives shelter from storm . MRS . PATRICK ( facing the sea , as if affirming what will hold all else out ) . Outside sea . Outer shore . Dunes  --  land not life . MAYO Outside sea  --  outer shore , dark with the wood that once was ships  --  dunes , strange land not life  --  woods , town and harbor . The line ! Stunted straggly line that meets the Outside face to face  --  and fights for what itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 16 MRS . PATRICK It loses . MAYO It wins . MRS . PATRICK The farthest life is buried . MAYO And life grows over buried life ! ( Lifted into that ; then , as one who states a simple truth with feeling . ) It will . And Springs will come when you will want to know that it is Spring . ( The CAPTAIN and BRADFORD appear behind the drift of sand . They have a stretcher . To get away from them MRS . PATRICK steps farther into the room ; ALLIE MAYO shrinks into her corner . The men come in , open the closed door and go in the room where they left the dead man . A moment later they are seen outside the big open door , bearing the man away . MRS . PATRICK watches them from sight . ) MRS . PATRICK ( bitter , exultant ) . Savers of life ! ( To ALLIE MAYO . ) You savers of life ! " Meeting the Outside ! " Meeting  --  ( But she can not say it mockingly again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has broken through , rises . Herself lost , feeling her way into the wonder of life . ) Meeting the Outside !
