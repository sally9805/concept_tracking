txt The ; owing special forecast of the weather in New York to-morrow was made for THE Nsw YORK TIMES to-night by Prof. Edward H. . Bowie of the United States Weather Bureau : " The indications are the least bit doubtful , but if it rains it will not be until late in the afternoon or in the evening . There will be clear weather enough to give ample time for the game . The temperature will be warm  --  about ? i0  --  and the winds will be light and variable . It will be what every one interested will call a fine day for the game . " ' Special to The New York Tints . PHILADELPHIA. , Oct ** the spectre of a crushing 6 to 0 defeat haunted the Giants at Shibe Park today and 20,000 hostile fans were taunting them in their humiliation , 's men threw themselves into the fight in desperation and started a magnificent rally , which cut down the clouting Athletics ' margin of victory to a lone run in the fourth game of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York batsmen fell upon Bender savagely in the seventh and eighth innings and had the stolid Chippewa on the verge of collapse . Shafer . was crouched at third , waiting to dash home with the tying run . On vital punch was needed to end the reign of the tottering Indian . Red Murray was at the hat . If the Mackmen were to be put to rout , it must be done at this time , and quickly . Murray did n't measure up to the dramatic situation . He lacked the essential wallop . pitted his last pitching hope against the batting terrors . He was confident that Al Demaree , with his resin ball , would hold the Athletics in check . Demaree swept through the National League this season , mowing down every team that faced him . He looked like the pitching find of the year . In four innings Demaree 's slow , roundhouse curves were riddled , and he was slugged out of the game . ' had Played his last card and could n't win the trick . Rube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of their batting spree , and he , tou , was batted tastily before he finally settled down to the kind of twirling the Athletics could not reach . It was not the Baker-Collins batting combination which brought about Demaree 's ignopinious exile . Baker and Collins took an afternoon off and let Barry , str.nk. - and Schang cavort in the limesset . Modest Jack Barry was absolutaY lacking in consideration for dethe Giant pitchers and poled out two and a single . Once started , the Athletic avalanche did n't stop until six runs had been piled up . Bender was working smoothly and easily , and for six innings held the Giants to two hits , both singles by Larry . To New York fans it seemed incredible that the crafty , resourceful red man could again humble the Giants as he did in the opening game . His pitching to-day was slow and deliberate . With marvelous control , the Indian flirted with the corners of the plate . He knew the weaknesses of the batsmen and made the most ' of this knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the weakness of tact or judgment . It was the plain physical failure of the tired arm of a man ' silo is no longer young . Athletics Arise to an Emergency : The Athletic team seems possessed of Unlimited latent strength . They hold much playing ability in reserve , which crops out when the crisis comes . The Mack machine never works so smoothly or so well as in a pinch . When the danger is greatest they do not fail to do the right thing . There was something commanding and impressive in the way the . team rallied around Chief Bender in the eighth . When his strength was ebbing and his curves were being- stripped of their trickery , in the fury of the Giant uprising , and it . looked as if a great pitcher was done for , his team mates scented the danger and rushed to his aid . Merkle 's prodigious homer had given the Giants three runs in the seventh . and 's men swung into the eighth inning full of fight and courage . Herzog ? sent -a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rally was on again . Doyle shot a grasser at . Collins , who fell as he choked the bll . Efe came up . again . as if on springs // ATHLETICS AGAIN ; STOP GIANT RALLY1 // and snapped the ball to Barry in time to force Herzog at second . Fletcher jammed a hot grounder at Bender . The Indian gathered it and turned quickly , making a swift , perilously wide throw to Barry . Here 's where the modest . reliable short stop saved the Indian 's scalp . " With his toe tucked into the bag , Barry stretched out as far as his arms could reach and the ball smacked full against his bare hand . Quickly his glove covered the ball and it stuck , Doyle being forced at second . If Barry had missed that throw , it is hardly possible that a tie score could have been averted , and the game might have been won by the Giants . Burns came up next and cudgeled a two bagger to left , scoring Doyle . Then came Shafer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game stopped . Harry Davis rushed out to whisper words of encouragement to the fast fading Redman . Collins and Barry patted him on the back and delayed the game . They were stalling for time , t3 give Bender a chance to pull himself together . Ira Thomas of the Mack strategy board , ran out where Reggie Brown was warming up and told him to be ready to go into the game . Bender saw this arid knew what it meant lie was being knocked out of the box in a world 's series game . No , his great pitching career mus n't end that way , after all these years of glory and fame . Bender begged Harry Davis to let him stay in a while longer . Tilly Shafer took a big lead down the third base line , the Athletic infield came in and set for the batter . And now Red Murray , if there ever was a time when you should deliver a hit , this is it . Slug it , chop it , murder it , but for goodness sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting Madden infielders . Murray hit the ball and Shafer started for the plate . A nasty . bouncing grounder spurted at Eddie Collins . Just as easily as he would stoop over to pluck a buttercup , Collins reached for the ball , whirled about and shot it at Stuffy and the Giants - were beaten . The New York outlook is n't bright The count Is three to one against them now , but Is n't downhearted . Not at all . He never is . Last year the Red Sox of Boston had them in the very same hole , nut the Giants recuperated and caught on with them , even if they were crushed in the final game . He still has Matty to shoot back at them at the Polo Grounds to-morro ? . And with Matty in there pitching , the team will play as they never play behind other pitchers . There 's still hope . The Noisiest Game . Shibe Park was jammed to capacity when the band stopped playing and Connie Mack sprung a big surprise on by sending Bender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . home folks just how the big Indian beat the Giants in New York on Tuesday . Before 2 o'clock all the streets leading to the park were crowded with those who had no chance at all of getting in , but hung around to hear the noise . It was the noisiest game of the series here . for the Athletics got such a big lead early in the game that victory looked as certain as the visits of the rent collector . Speculators reaped a harvest along Broad Street this morning , and tickets brought as high as $15 each . The 4,000 bleacher seats which went on sale at each at 11:30 o'clock were ail gone in a short time . The line for the $1 ticket windows formed early , and thousands - went away in angry disappointment because Shibe Park was n't as big as the Coliseum at Rome . There was a good deal of commotion on Lehigh Avenue about 1:30 o'clock when ' Germany " Schaefer of the Washington Club was arrested for speculating . " Germany " had two extra ? tickets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular price , ee . Jae did not see any familiar faces so he offered them to a- deserving looking citi2en . A policeman saw Mill in the act of turning over the tickets , and arrested him . The patrol wagon came and as the ball player started for the station house . the crowd guyed him unmercifully . " Sao , ' Germany , ' they ca n't arrest you for that , " some one shouted . " I told them that , but they would n't believe me , " answered Schaefer . At the police station Schaefer explained the situation and was released . The officer on the desk first listened to his tale of woe and then said : " How do we know you 're ' Germany ' Schaefer ? " " Listen , " said the comedian , " and I 'll tell you a funny story . I 'll make you laugh , and then you 'll know . " Schaefer told an old story , but it was new in Philly. and they let him go out to the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's series is that of a policeman . The entire force sit about the outfield on soap boxes , just inside the fence , and all they have to do is watch the game . Pretty soft They do n't even have to go into the croWd to recover the bells which are knocked foul . as they do in Nov York . Here the people are so honest that every ball is thrown back . The sun has n't peeked through the clouds once during the series , It tried hard to yesterday and after shining just a little bit before the game , disappeared again as the Mackmen started eo leather the ball . The sun wants to see the Giants win , but every time St gets ready to look down on the fray Baker or Collins is at the bat , So it draws itself into seclusion again . Mack has used the same identical team in every game , changing only the batteries . has been forced ' to change his crippled team every day and when the national argument ' opened today . Snodgrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snodgrass lasted only three innings , for he hurt his injured leg again in trying to run to first , Fred Merlde would never have been able to make a home run ' unless his terrific drive to left in the seventh inning had bounded into the bleachers . As it was , it took him two minutes overtime to limp around the bases . Finding Mr. Demaree No Puzzle . ' The only consolation in yesterday 's defeat was that neither Baker nor Collins had a hand in the daily destruction of the Giant pitchers . Demaree got his first taste of Philadelphia hospitality in the opening verse , when , with one down . Rube Oldring slapped a perfectly healthy three-base drive to right field . Then the artist-pitcher began to wonder what he would draw in his next cartoon . iAs a pitcher against the Athletics , he Shoe:ed. that he was a fine cartooner. e'cliens pushed a grounder at Merkle , and the disabled Toledo Blade soaked the ball home and decorated Oldring with the ball as he slid into the plate on his manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You'r-r-e out " Rube did n't believe It , but that did n't matter . The Giants ' first opportunity to display any activity was in the second , when , with two out , Bender hit Murray on the wrist with the ball and gave him a life . Larry jammed a hit to centre , but Merkle ended the proceedings by lifting a foul to . The Athletics first unit was duly authorized in the second after Merkle had missed an opportunity to make an out when he muffed Barry 's foul fly . Merkle was n't so much- to blame , considerlug his injured leg . Ordinarily the catch would have been easy for him . opened this round with a safe poke to centre . The ball fell between the other cripple , Snodgrass , and DoYle and Murray in a spot which none of the three could quite reach . Strunk sacrificed , and then Barry fouled to Merkle , who dropped the ball over in front of the right field stand . It was a life for Barry . and he celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored . Demaree showed good sense and walked Schang , for Bender riras an easy out on a balloon to Burns . Demaree was further convinced that the Athletics could hit on Fridays as on other days , in the fourth , when they jarred him rudely from the pastime . After - qzmcq#Innis had been tossed out at first , Strunk got an infield . hit by his rapid traveling , and went to third on Barry 's slam to left . Barry went to second when the ball was thrown to third . Demaree thought that he would n't pass Schang this time , and he has been sorry for that thought ever since . " Li Hung " ripped a single to centre , scoring Strunk 441d Barry . He went to third on 's passed ball . Bender then laid a grounder along the carpet in front of first . Crippled Herkle made a game attempt to scoop it , but overran- the ball and got an error for his trouble . Schang ran home on the play . After Murphy lifted a fly at Doyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorks napping when he spilled a bunt in front of the plate , but the ball was right close to 's large shoe , and Larry threw him out at first . That was the end of Demaree . Oldring , s Dazzling Play . Dazzling work by the Athletics put a damper on an imposing Giant opportunity in the first half of the fifth . Murray sojourned at first because of Bender 's ' generosity with passes , and got his second hit . Up to that time Larry was the only Giant who could solve the Indian 's service . 's lumbering slowness on the bases again stared in the face , and he sent Claude Cooper in as a pinch runner . After Bender had fanned Merkle , Harold McCormick , who pinch hits more or less when he feels in the mood , was sent in to bat for the banished Demaree . To alcCormick 's credit it ought to be mentioned that he was just boldly grand larcenied out of a fine threebase , drive , It happened this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left meld on a line . Oldring galloped in to greet it , but it did n't seem as if there was a chance of the two moving bodies meeting on friendly terms . Rube , being a persistent sort of a person , kept right on traveling , and when the ball was about to nestle on the sward he plucked it in a way which was a great surprise to the ball . as well as a stunning shock to Mr. McCormick . Harold thinks there ought to be a law against that sort of thing . Cooper then tried to steal ? second , but Schang made a beautiful throw to Collins and the Texas sprinter was very much out . Marquard 's old friend Frank Baker was the first man to face him in the fifth inning . Rube fed the ball on the outside of the plate as far from Baker 's bat as the rules allow . Rube struck out the famous author of the home run , which showed that Rube is smarter than many people supposed . Rube then tossed out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Marquard . Strunk walked and Barry lammed another two-base drive to left field , sending Strunk around to third . Up to the bat ambled Schang : ready to do the right thing in a pinch . The young catcher banged out another single to centre which lured Strunk and Barry across the plate . That was four runs Li Hung was responsible for . This done , Bender was fired out by Marquard . The Indian 's first sign of weakness came in the seventh when Burns got an infield hit . Shafer skied to Collins and Murray singled to left . Burns and Murray manipulated a double steal . After Wilson fanned , Merkle hammered a long hit to left , which ' bounded into the frenzied folk in the bleachers , and Burns and Murray trotted home ahead of the limping first baseman . The assault on Bender continued in the eighth . It looked like the end of the fast-weakening Indian . The Athletics saw the game slipping out of their grasp , and rose heroical:3 , - to the seriousness of the situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . Murray failed to produce a hit in the pinch , and the Giants ' only chance was ended . To-day 's game was the last hi which the players participated in the receipts .
