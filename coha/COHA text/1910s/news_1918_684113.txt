txt Stock market quotations these days are not criteria of values , This is seemingly apparent in the case of Missouri Pacific . After struggling under an increasingly burdensome ciebt for many years , Missouri Pacific was taken in hand by bankers in 1916 and a reorganization effected providing for the payment of an assessment of $50 per share by the holders of 828,295 shares of common stock of $100 par . For this assessment , stockholders received $50 in new general mortgage 4S5 bonds and $100 in new common stock . This provided the necessary amount of cash-$41,419,750with which to pay off the pressing indebtedness . But stock market quotations have been particularly unfair to shareholders . They figure that their old stock is now selling for but $2 a share . For example , a holder of 100 shares is now the owner of $5,000 general 4s ; on a present market of 58 , these bonds are worth $2,900 , added to which are 100 shares of common at 23 , bringing total worth up to $5,200 . On the basis of $5,000 paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this gives a present market value of but $2 per share for the 100 shares of old stock . Just prior to the reorganization Missouri Pacific was selling in the open market for between $4 and $5 per share . Those stockholders who sold their holdings prior to the reorganization made the better bargain .
