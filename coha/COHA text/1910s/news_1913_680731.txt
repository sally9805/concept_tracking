txt GASPING FOR MENTAL BREATH . This Brooklyn Man Wants Fellowship In Abstract Thought . I am a man in the thirties , alone in Greater New York , where I have lived for four years , and am interested in abstract thought , particularly ethics . My great trouble is that I can find no companions in the discussion of these topics . Of course , there are people occupied in active reform work , but my experience of these indicates that they do not recognize the value of abstract principle . Of what good is practice without theory ? Reformers seem all the time trying to agree upon methods , while they are wide apart in their general aims . The process of acquiring friends and helpers in this serious work through the medium of churches and other formal societies appears very slow . My case is like That of a drowning man ; I am gasping for if-rental breath , and appeal to any men or women who can understand my need to come to my aid .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
