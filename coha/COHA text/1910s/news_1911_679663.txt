txt The police at the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge have been putting in operation in the last fen days a new plan to provide women and children with seats in the outgoing trolley cars in the rush hours . The plan is the idea of Capt . Burke and is said to have proved effective , It consists simply in separating the women and children from the men and allowing them to board the cars first . Since it would be difficult to keep men and women separated where there is no fence . the plan has been confined to the upper tracks of the bridge , where the space between Tracks IL 1 , and S is bisected by a high fence longitudinally . The women and children are allowed behind this fence , where incoming cars stop to let off passengers . Not till the last of the women and - children are aboard is the car moved across the terminal to the opposite side , where the men wait .
