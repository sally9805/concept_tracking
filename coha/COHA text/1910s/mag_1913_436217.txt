OF all the errors of Indian Government none is so serious as the destruction of the village organism throughout India ; none has had such a serious effect in the past ; none is likely to have such bad consequences in the future . It is the village policy of Government which has created for it the most difficulties , and which is at the bottom of the most serious unrest , for it touches not merely a few as criminal law , but practically all the population ; it not only affects a part of the life of India , but it has injured it in its most vital point . In the whole history of administration there is nothing I think so demonstrative of the ignorance of Government as the village policy . The foundation on which not only all government , but all civilization , rests throughout the world is the village . As this is contrary to the usual idea that civilization rests on the family , it will be convenient shortly to show how this is so . The village is the microcosm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupations and races and religions and castes in one community . A family does not do so . A family is by its nature of one blood , it is almost always of one occupation . There are families of cultivators , merchants , priests , lawyers , smiths , and so on . The family is of one religion , of one caste , of one habit of thought . A family is narrow , and a village is broad . Families divide ; villages combine . Societies organized on the family , or clan , or tribe principle have always failed ? by the very nature of things they must so fail . The Jews are a race , or tribe , and not a nation . They have no civilization of their own , but adopt that in which they live . The Highland clans had to be broken before the Highlands could be civilized . The caste system in India ruined its old civilization , and is the bar to any new civilization . The Turkish Empire is dying because it was based on a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people could never amalgamate with others . There is a continual flow of peoples to and fro upon the earth , and village communities absorb the new-comers and thereby acquire new blood and , what is far more important , new ideas , to add to the old and leaven them . Families , classes and tribes can not do this . They become stereotyped and dissolve or die . Thus the basis of all civilization has been the village , or in later times the town . The decay and death of all civilizations has been preceded by the death of the local unit . Thus imperial Rome was itself doomed to death when it destroyed local life , and a new civilization could not be built up till the local communities had attained a fresh life . Flor ? ence , Genoa , Milan , Pisa , Venice , and many others , made the civilization of the Renaissance . So in England a free Parliament was made up of representatives from free cities and counties . These have been destroyed , and the present constituencies are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament , but in secret party con-claw . Members are the nominees of that conclave , not of free local organ-jots. and Parliament has become a machine to register its decrees . So are free institutions passing away . There is no lesson of history more true than this , or more certain , ? that the village or town is the unit of all free life and civilization . It contains all classes , different races , religions , castes and forms of thought , and is therefore a real unit . Now these units have existed all over the world , and when civilizations and governments have disappeared they have been built up anew from the villages . In India the village system was the one organism that survived the long years of anarchy and invasion , and it was in full vigor when we conquered India . In Upper Burma on its annexation in 1885 the village community was strong and healthy ; it alone survived the fall of King Thibaw 's government . Then we deliberately destroyed it , as we had destroyed it before all through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was destroyed in ignorance , not by malice prepense . Throughout India , and especially in Burma , you will find Government reiterating its conviction of the importance of preserving the village organism , repeating its conviction of its absolute necessity , and at the same time killing it . This is but an instance of much of the action of Government . It means well : it does actually see the end to be attained ? it has no idea how to attain that end , but instead it renders it impossible . If I explain what happened in Burma , the history , mutatis mutandis , of what has occurred throughout India will be clear . In the first place , a village does not mean only one collection of houses ; it is a territorial unit of from one to a hundred square miles . Originally , of course , there was in each unit one hamlet , but as population grew , daughter hamlets were thrown off . They still , however , remained under the jurisdiction of the mother hamlet , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a headman and a council of elders . The headman was appointed , or rather approved , by the Burmese government for life or good behavior ; the council was not recognized by law . Notwithstanding this the council was the real power . It was not formally elected , it had no legal standing , but it was the real power . The headman was only its representative , and not its master ; he was but print= inter pares . This headman and council ruled all village matters . They settled house sites , rights of way , marriages of boys and girls , divorces , public manners ; they got up such public works as were undertaken , they divided the tax among the inhabitants according to their means , and were collectively responsible for the whole . There was hardly any appeal from their decision , but the power not being localized in an individual but in a council of all the elders , things went well . The village was a real living organism , within which people learned to act together , to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local pride . Within it lay the germ of unlimited progress . The English Government on taking over Upper Burma recognized the extreme value of this organization . In Lower Burma much of our difficulty arose from the fact that the organization was wanting , and that between Government and the individual there was no one . So one of the first efforts of Government in Upper Burma was to preserve and strengthen this local self-government . Unfortunately every effort that it made tended to destroy it rather than to consolidate it . A wrong view was taken from the beginning . The council was ignored . How this happened I do not know . I can only suppose that it arose from ignorance . The only man recognized by the Burmese Government we replaced was the headman . They dealt directly with him and not with the council . They did not appoint the council or regulate it in any way . In law no council existed . Therefore , when we took over , the law was mistaken for the fact , ? a common mistake due to seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the council was ignored . The following seems to have been the argument : Government appointed the headman , therefore he was an official . Government did not appoint or recognize any council , therefore there was no council . At all events that was the decision arrived at and enforced . There is on record a circular of the local government in which the headman of a village is described as a government official ? to be to his village what the district officer is to his district . That is disastrous . A headman is not an official of the government . His whole value and meaning is that he is a representative of the people before Government . He expresses the collective views of the village , and receives the orders of Government for them as a whole . He is their head , not a finger of Government . He corresponds almost exactly to the mayor of an English town , who would be insulted if you called him a government official . Yet this mistaken view was taken of the village headman , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village organization and its headman . He is appointed by Government instead of being appointed by the people and approved by Government . He is responsible to Government , not to his village , as he ought to be , for the use and abuse of his powers . He is punished by Government for laxity . By the village regulation he can be fined by the district officer . There has grown up among Europeans in the East a custom of impos. ing fines . They fine their servants for breakages and innumerable other small matters , and then complain how scare good servants are . The clerics in Government offices used to be subject to continual fines until Lord Curzon stopped it . Now headmen of villages can be fined by the district officer ; and they are fined ; the proviso is no dead letter . It is a mark of the ' energetic ' officer to use it . Can there be anything more destructive ? Imagine the head . man , the mayor of a community of three or four thousand people , fined five shillings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school-boy to learn a code with the clerks . I have seen this done often . What respect for Government , what from his own people , what self-respect , can he retain after such treat-ment ? Again , by ignoring the council and making the headman an official , Government set up a number of petty tyrants in the villages , free from all control but its own ; consequently it has been forced to allow great latitude of appeal . This still further destroys his authority . He is , under old custom , legalized by the village regulation , empowered to punish his villagers who disobey him in certain matters . The punishments are , of course , trivial . When approved by the council as in old days they were final ; but now they can be appealed against , and are . A headman who endeavors to enforce his authority runs the risk of being complained against and forced to attend headquarters , to waste days of valuable time and considerable sums of money to defend himself for having fined a diger a shilling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort and the headman lets things slide in future . Thus , interference with the village is constant and disastrous . Headmen are bullied , fined , set to learn lessons like children , all in the name of efficiency . And Government wonders why the village-system decays . A continual complaint of Government is that headmen are no longer the men they used to be , that they have lost authority . The best men will not take the appointment , and who can wonder ? Here is a story in illustration . There was a small village in my district , on a main road , and the headman died . It was necessary to appoint a new one ; but no one would take the appointment . The elders were asked to nominate a man , but no one would take the nomination . I sent the township officer to try to arrange it ; he failed . Now , a village can not get along without a headman . Government is at an end : no taxes can be collected , for instance ; therefore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scent to the village myself and called the elders and gave them an order that they must nominate some one . So next morning , after stormy meetings in the village , a man was brought to me and introduced as the headman elect . He was dirty , ill-clad , and not at all the sort of man I should have cared to appoint , nor one whom it would be supposed the villagers would care to accept . Yet he was the only nominee . ' What is your occupation ? ' I asked . He said he had none . ' What tax did you pay last year ? ' I asked him this in order to discover his standing , for men are rated according to their means . He told me that he had paid five shillings , ? less than a third of the average . ' You are willing to be headman ? ' I asked . ' No , ' he said frankly . ' But no one would take the place and the elders told me I must . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . I could take my choice between being headman or a term in prison . ' This was , of course , an extreme case , but it illustrates the position . The headman is degraded , and all administration suffers . It is the same in municipalities . The work is done by the district officer because it is easier for him to do it than to instruct and allow others to do it . The people one and all hate this . The headman hates it because , though he is given much greater power nominally than he used to have , he dare not use this power . He is isolated from his villagers , and so often becomes an object of dislike to them . Through him orders are enforced which are not liked by the people , and he has to bear all the brunt . His dignity is gone . The elders hate it . They have been ignored . They are placed under a headman who may or may not attend to what they say . They have lost all interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no responsibility . The villagers hate it . A council of their own elders they could respect and submit to ; a one-man rule they detest . Their appeal to the council on the spot they know has been lost , and in place of it they have an appeal to a distant officer who , with the best will in the world , can not know . An appeal costs money , and even to win may be to lose . They all want to manage their affairs ; they can do it far better than we can , and there is nothing they so much appreciate as being allowed to do so . Here is how I learned this . Some eighteen years ago I was leaving a station where I had been for a year as subordinate officer , and had to cross the river by launch to the steamer station on the other shore . I went down to the bank to get the launch , but it was late . I saw it three miles away and so sat down under a tree to wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near me . Then came others , till perhaps twenty elderly men were there . I recognized two or three vaguely , but none clearly . I wondered at their being there and asked , ' Are you crossing over too ? ' They shook their heads . What are you here for then ? ' They looked embarrassed and at last one spoke . ' We came to say good-bye to you . ' I stared . ' But I do not know you , except that I suppose you are elders of the town . ' . ' We are , ' they said , ' and you do not know us because you have not ever worried us in any way . When we had business together you did it quickly and decisively ; otherwise you left us alone . You did not treat us as children . Therefore we are sorry you are going . ' I laughed . I could not help it . To come and express regret at a man 's leaving , on the ground that they knew next to nothing of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was true . And often , after , did I think over that ' send-off ' and take the lesson to heart . Now , what is true in Burma is true over all India . The local circumstances of course vary . All organized life is dead . Government , by means of its official , the headman , interferes with almost every detail of life , regulating his conduct by rules drawn up in Secretariats by men who never knew what a village was ; and the appeal is to another alien officer . Further , all morality and all conduct are the outcome of corporate life , that is to say of the village or of a larger unit . Morality is in fact , where it is useful and true , the knowledge of how to get along with your fellow men and women , what conduct offends them and leads to the injury of society , what pleases them and tends to harmony and mutual happiness . It is not fixed , but adapts itself to changing circumstances of the society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But injure the society and both manners and morals are ' shaken . It is a common complaint of India to-day that the bonds of morality have greatly slackened , and that manners have almost disappeared . This is attributed to the waning influence of religions . But , generally speaking , religions have not waned in India ? on the contrary , their influence has increased . The people have fallen more and more into the power of religious systems . Therefore the cause given is absurd and untrue . It does not exist . Further , neither morality nor manners are the outcome of religion . Manners and morals may be said to be the gravity which binds individuals into a community . It makes the community , and is itself the result of the community . Destroy the community and you have destroyed the source from which manners and morals arise . That has been done all through India . The village organization will have to be resuscitated before India can cease to be India Irridenta . II SELF-GOVERNMENT When a start is made with self-government in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the germ from which all self-government that is of any value has always begun , and on the health and vitality of which it must always depend . The whole of the present conception of the village as an appanage of the headman , and of the headman as an official of Government , must be swept away , and a new and true conception must be arrived at . The village is a self-contained ormnism , and the headman is its representative before Government and its executive head , the real power being in the council . Powers and responsibility reside in the village as a whole , and in no individual . The people must not be ruled , but must rule themselves . Now , as to the exact way in which this conception should be carried out , it is impossible to say . In each proince , in distinct parts of the same province , the village-system assumed different forms to meet different circumstances . In Madras the village conmumity was in many details different from that in Burma , and in the Northwest still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be realized would vary greatly . And only by experience could a satisfactory form for each province be evolved . Neither would it.be possible , even in Burma , to go back to the old form exactly . Events have marched since then , and what was satisfactory thirty or more years ago would not be so now . The villages must not be reconstituted by copying the past ; they must be constituted anew , maintaining however the spirit of the past and giving scope for evolution in the future . Therefore the scheme that I am about to unfold must be taken to be merely tentative , and to apply only to Burma . The principles are , I think , right , the details must of course be only tentative . Practice alone would show how far they realized the objec tive that is to be aimed at ? the constitution of a village organism on natural lines , that would govern itself without any need for interference , and would be able to grow and evolve . My scheme is as follows : In every village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its executive head . How this council should be constituted I do not know . I think there should be wards , each of which should have an elder , representative of the people , but no rigid system of election should be laid down . I have found that villages and wards can very often appoint a representative man by general consent , which is much better than by election . That should only occur in case of a deadlock . The council should itself define the wards , and it should be allowed to colipt additional members . All representation by class or religion should be prohibited . The unit is not so many people , but a section of a village , neighbors dwelling together whose interests are thereby united . Appoint . ment to the council should be indefinite , that is to say , an elder should remain an elder until he resigned or until the ward turned him out . I do n't think they would like continual elections . An election is a bad means to the desired end , that of obtaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually apparent without it . The headman should be chosen by the council from among its members , and his election confirmed by Government . His appointment should be according to the wish of the council , that is to say , for life , unless he resigned or the council turned him out . He should be responsible to the council . The council as representing the village should be responsible to Government , and it would always be possible for the deputy commissioner to bring pressure on a recalcitrant council by threatening to suspend the constitution and place the village under an appointed headman for a time if they did not carry out their duties properly . To this village community should be handed over certain duties , rights , and responsibilities , much what the headman has now , the collection of revenue , and the like . All civil , criminal , and revenue cases under certain values and of certain denominations should be handed over to them to try . That is to say , that cognizance should be refused by our police and our courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council if they liked . There should be no appeal from the decisions of the council , no advocates should be allowed , and no record should be required . All penalties imposed should be paid into the village fund . This fund should exist for all villages and its nucleus should be , say , half an anna in the rupee of the revenue collections , to which should be added fines , special rates which the council should be empowered to impose for specific purposes , and other forms of revenue which would vary from place to place . I think a percentage of the district fund should be given to them . A rate on inhabited houses ? a rent on house-sites ? would be a good way of raising money . The purposes for which the fund could be used would be water-supply , sanitation , roads , lighting , watchmen , and so forth . Simple account books would have to be kept , and these accounts would have to be audited once a year . Model schemes for sanitation , village roads , etcetera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as fast as it could . Further , villages should have the power to carry out irrigation works on their own initiative , and under their own control . I consider this a most important proviso , because I know many villages where this could be done by the village , whereas it is not possible to individuals . I also know one recent case in my district where it was done with great success by the headman and council . I got them a small grant and I often went to see how the work was getting on , but I never interfered in any way and the result was most satisfactory . There was at first a difficulty about collecting the rates because there was no legal system under which a man who used the water could be made to pay . However this also settled itself . Irrigation works , roads , and bridges are most necessary to many villages , but now , unless Government carries out the work , there is no one to do it . And Government will not carry out small works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village would prosper , and the village fund grow . Loans should be granted for these purposes by Government , to be repaid out of the profits . Before our annexation all works were executed by the villages , and the considerable irrigation works in many places are evidence of their ability . All this initiative has now been killed . Yet it is a most valuable asset , not only materially but morally . As regards this fund it will , I know , be objected by many people that it will be simply an excuse for peculation . Orientals , ' they say , ' can not be hon. est , and the funds would be misappropriated right and left . ' Exactly this same charge was made when the cooperative credit banks were started . Their history will sufficiently refute such an absurdity . Orientals are just as honest as any other people ; and given a good system , village funds will no more be stolen in India or Burma than municipal funds are in England . In organizing these villages there is another point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid uniformity which distinguishes the Indian Government , every separate hamlet in Burma was put under a separate headman , and thus made a separate organism . Now it may be that occasionally the tillage was too large and a division was needed , but in many other ea sPs the disintegration of long-established units was severely felt . Several hamlets may have one interest in common . They may be grouped round a small irrigation work , or along a stream , or base a fishery in common , or be in other matters of great use to one another . If they are run as separate organisms there is bound to be strife , each striving for its own benefit . If allowed to remain one organism they will be not only more peaceful , but stronger and better able to manage their affairs . Thus the rigid formulae of government in this matter , as in others , should give Place to common sense . Further , in future villages should be allowed to coalesce if mutual interests attract them . Two or three villages if allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see no great difficulty in Burma in thus restoring the organism of village life . It would require mainly tact on the part of the district officer and ability to let alone . His tendency now is aloays to interfere if he can . His rule should be never to interfere if he can help it . When things go wrong persistently it will probably be found that there is something amiss with the way the village is organized , and that it requires some slight modification . Once the village communities are strong and healthy a further step could be made by instituting a township or subdivisional council , and later a district council . For these I am not prepared to offer any suggestions . I think , however , a sound analogy might be obtained from a study of English counties , not so much perhaps as they are now , but as they were , in spirit not in law . After the village organism is established , perhaps even prior to its proper establishment , ? a local government board must be organized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the province . It is , I think , essential that it should be so . What its relations would be with the district officer I do not know . All this , however , is not a matter which can be thought out . It will have to be worked out , and a correct system can only come little by little , experience showing how modifications should be made . I do not see any great difficulty , provided there is common sense and unity of aim on both sides . And from districts , when they had settled down into distinct organisms more or less self-governing , representatives ? not delegates ? could be sent to a provincial council . Then you would have a real council , one representative of the people because proceeding from the people , not less surely because not directly . I am not sure that direct election such as is practiced in England and America , for instance , does cause representation of the people . In England at all events it is not so now . The only power the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or more parties . Beyond this they have no voice or choice . They have no means of expressing their own wishes . Their member may be , probably is , a man they never heard of before the ' party ' sent him to contest the seat . There is in fact in England to-day no real representation of the people at all . By people of course I mean the people as a whole , including all classes . But under some such scheme as I have sketched out for Burma there would be real representation of the people , of localities as a whole , units ; local men acquainted with the local conditions would be chosen , and not pleaders , and the locality would hold them responsible . Thus the opinion of such a council would represent the wishes of the people ; it could be depended on , and to it considerable powers could be delegated permanently . It would in fact in time constitute a provincial government in federal relations with the other provincial governments . That is the only possible way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must always be remembered that the basis is the village . On the health of the village all other things depend ; from the healthy working of the village all things may proceed . It is the first and last word in local self-government . A very integral part of any self-government is education , and to that I now come . III EDUCATION To the success of any form of self-government a good education is absolutely essential ; that a people should be able to exercise self-government , it is necessary that they be educated to self-government , for this capacity no more comes by itself than ability to build a ship or steer it when built . And as the government must be self-government , so the education must be a national education and not an imported one . Education is necessary to every one , man or woman , peasant or prince , merchant or artisan , and that man is best educated who can make the best of his life whatever his station may be . Thus it will be seen that education mainly relative . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life would be hopelessly ignorant if in another . I doubt if Whewell would have been considered educated had fate suddenly made him a soldier , a political officer on a frontier , or a cultivator . There are certain foundation principles necessary to any success in life , to being able to live it , in whatever station , with dignity and with prosper . ity . What are those principles ? I think that the Indian Education Department would say that they are reading , writing , and arithmetic , that is to say , acquirements . I should say they are qualities of character . What are these qualities ? First and foremost is belief in his own people , ? not his caste or his creed , but in the people who inhabit his province , who will eventually make up his nationality . If the man is to do good work for his people , the boy must desire to do good work , he must have a certainty in the unlimited possibilities of his people , that though they may be young now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty to help them . He must be sure that this world is good , to be made better by him and his fellows and his descendants . He has inherited much , he must hand on more . He has no right to live unless he does his duty to life and in life . That is to say , he must have a purpose in life , for without a purpose life can not be lived . Secondly , he must see that for the accomplishment of his purpose , which is but part of the world 's purpose , he must cultivate two qualities : obedience in act , and freedom of thought . He must learn to obey , because he must see for himself that only by men acting together under authority can anything be achieved . His obedience will then be a willing and cheerful obedience , because necessary to his own purpose . lie must obey , that later he may be obeyed . He must keep his mind free , because to admit authority in thought is to kill thought . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he is able to act for himself he may do so on truth and not on hearsay . Ile must learn to respect the opinions of others , which they have founded also on experience , while not necessarily adopting them , because he may see things differently . He must learn self-knowledge , to recognize what he can do and what he recog can not . He should cultivate self-command ; that must not mean selfcot Mellon . On a base like this all other things come naturally . Is there any such ideal in elementary education in India ? I can safely say that there is no such ideal . All that the department seeks to do is to stuff a child with reading , writing , and arithmetic , and other learning , regardless of his character or his objective in life . Therefore elementary education is not popular in Burma , because it seems to have no good purpose . That was true of education before we took the country . It was then mainly , for boys , in the hands of monks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion has been popular anywhere in the world . It has been accepted because there was no other means of education available , but it was not admired . Our govern-swat has accepted the monastery schools and it has also encouraged lay schools , but neither seem to give much satisfaction . Now this is not the place to discuss religion of any kind , and I have no intent ion of entering into such a vexed question . There are good things in all religions ? borrowed from humanity ; there are doubtful things ; there are bad things . But the foundation of every religion is a declaration that this world is evil and that we should despise it . Now the objective of all education is to fit a boy for his life , and he can not be so fit if he despise life . He must love it , admire it , desire in all ways to help it , to increase it , to beautify it . His objective must be in this life . Further , the tendency of all faiths is to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential part of any true education that a boy understand that in striving for the good of the community he must ignore all differences . Humanity is one , and the God of Humanity is One , whatever faiths may say . Thus religions when mixed with education have a paralyzing effect . I have often heard this said in Burma . Here is a conversation I once had at a village I knew very well . It occurred , as did most of the talks I had with the people , just after sunset , when I had my chair set outside my rest-house , and the people came dropping in to gossip . There were a number of people ? the headman , elders , their wives and children , and two monks from a neighboring monastery . They talked quite freely because they knew that after office hours I forgot I was an official , or even an Englishman , and just talked to them as one human being to another . I may add that I had been inspecting the village school where little boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the elder boys went . Well , ' I said , what is the news ? ' There was an expectant silence . Evidently there was some news ; the question was ? who should tell it ? What is it , headman ? ' I asked . The headman rubbed an ankle reflectively . ' The fact is , ' he answered , ' there is no news that would interest your honor , only just village doings , foolish things . ' Hum , ' I said , that sounds to me as if a young man had been doing something . ' Several of the men smiled . ? ' Possibly with the assistance of a girl ' ? and I glanced at some girls . They giggled , and the headman said briefly , Maung Ka 's son has run off with a girl . ' ' Oh ! ' I said , turning to Maung Ka , whom I knew well enough , a tall fine-looking man , who was looking very gloomy . ' It ' s a way boys have . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support her afterwards , ' said Maung Ka gruffly . Ca n't he do that ? ' I asked . It appeared that he could not . He had spent all his boyhood in a monastery learning ' till his father took him out . Then he went to the other extreme and levanted with a girl . He does n't know one end of a bullock from the other , ' said the father . ' He ca n't plough or sow ; he ca n't teach ; he has no common sense . That 's what schooling does for a boy . ' Most of the other men agreed with him , and we had a discussion on education in which every one took part . The general opinion was that schooling should be to fit you for life . The monks said for eternity , but the villagers , though out of respect for the monks they said little , evidently did n't make any such distinction . What was not fit for time was not fit for eternity . Reading , writing , and arithmetic were good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think schooling did harm . A boy learned more from his father and the other villagers than from school . As to a girl , What , ' asked an elder indignantly , is the use of a girl learning to write ? What will she write ? Love letters only . ' Well , ' I asked , and is n't that good ? for the boy who gets them ? ' The fact is the villagers are plain common-sense men and women ; they judge by results , and the results are not good , they say . In fact , except as to the actual acqui-sition of reading , writing , and arithmetic , which may or may not be of much use , the teaching and , still more than the teaching , the influence , is bad . It unfits for life , it gives wrong ideals , or it kills all ideals . It is not national in any way . The higher education is , I think , worse . It follows an imported system , and in the importation all the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education comes from association with the other boys . It is there he learns what . ever he does learn of conduct , of ambition to true ends , of acting in concert , of ability to judge for himself and stick up for himself . In India a wrong ideal has been conceived from the beginning . It has been assumed , tacitly perhaps , that an Eng . lishman is the final and completely perfected work of God and man , and that all nations should copy him and try to become , if not a sterling Englishman , at least an electroplate one . That is disastrous . It depresses the pupils by depreciating their own races and holding up an objective which is impossible , and if possible would be wrong . There are in the hearts of nearly all Oriental people ideals which are quite as good as ours , and far better fitted for them . Are these ever taught to them ? India once led the civilization of the world . Is that past ever brought up and explained and realized for them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any use must be objective . You must know what you want the boy to he . What does Government want the products of its higher education to be : I have no idea . Of what use are these products of the higher education in India ? They are useful but for one thing , to be lawyers or pleaders , or to be clerks . They are dealing in words , and not in facts or in humanity . Government accepts a certain number into its service because the first ideal of Government is a man who can fill up forms and returns , speedily , accurately , and punctually . They can do that . When they have district work to do they fail because they have no personality , no freedom of thought , and because the people despise them . The old officials whom we took over from the Burmese Government , whatever their defects , had auza ? personality . It is a commonplace to say that the Burmese have deteriorated . That is not true . They have as much potentiality as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Personally , if I had to administer a difficult district , I would choose my Burmese assistants from men who had never been to school , and to satisfy Government I would engage some BA. ' s to be their clerks and fill up the forms . I should be sorry for the BA. ' s , because I think they have as good stuff in them as the others , but their want of education has unfitted them for work requiring auza . That is really what it amounts to ; the school-trained boy is not educated , whereas the boy brought up in contact with the world is perforce educated . The first is a hot-house plant ; the second a useful field plant . I am aware that current opinion puts down the failure of the educated young Indian to his want of religion . He has been educated out of his own faith and has not been accepted into any other ; hence his want of character . Of all the wild shibboleths about India and the Indians , this is I think the wildest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foolishness of caste , of infant marriage , of harems and zenanas , of all the forms and ceremonies with which all religions are covered , seems to me a triumph of foolishness . Only the ' occidental mind ' at its best could conceive such an idea . In so far as education destroys these ideas it does good . Wherein it harms him is by taking him apart from his people , rendering him not desirous to help them but to disown them . He is taught that to be an Englishman should be his ideal , that he ' should cultivate English habits of thought , ' ? as if true thought had any habits , ? so that finally he ca n't think at all . He is directed to wrong ideals , he is rendered unhappy , he is dipays ? , he is useless for any work except being a clerk or lawyer , he has no more character than a jelly-fish . Instead of wishing to lead his people he wishes to identify himself with the English Government , be a civilian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boundless confidence in the future of his people , and believe that it is his duty to help that future to be realized . He is discouraged and rendered hopeless . Instead of being a help he is the greatest danger his own people will have to meet when they move forward . The education department of the Government of India is the new Frankenstein , and the higher education is its monster . These men have sunk under their ' education , ' and in consequence they are unhappy . Who wonders ? But in fact an alien power can not introduce or work any real system of education . It must be indigenous , something of the soil and not exotic . It , like self-government , must begin with small things in the village and gradually rise . Like all things , if it is to live and prosper and extend , it must have a soul . And the soul of education , like the soul of life , is an emotion tending toward a desired end . The desired end of education is the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . That has been the soul of the progress of Japan ; it must be the soul of the progress of any people ; and education will be enthusiastically taken up only when it is seen to be a means to that end . Such an education can not be given by Englishmen . Any education department must be provincial and draw its vigor from below . It must not be a machine governed from Simla with textbooks as thumbscrews and manuals as beds of Procrustes . Before there can be a real education department it must be entirely native of the province , responsible to the province for its success . Can we create such a department ? I think we can , slowly , by handing our village schools to district councils , and the university to the head provincial assembly when it comes into being . They will have to think out what result they want , and then how to attain that result . But all must begin with the village ; within it alone is the germ-cell of all future progress .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
