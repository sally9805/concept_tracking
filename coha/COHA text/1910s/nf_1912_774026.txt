txt THE AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION QUESTION that , therefore , the shipper who gets and benefits by an unfair discrimination deserves just as severe condemnation and punishment as the railway man who gives it . We will never stop unjust discrimination , never get fair and salutary regulation of rates , until the public clearly and fully recognizes the fact that in the public interest it is just as needful that public regulation shall protect the railway from the shipper as it is that it shall protect the shipper from the railway . CHAPTER V RAILWAY VALUATION AND PROFITS UNTIL lately the main problem , and aim , of regulation of railways was the suppression of unfair discrimination in rates between commodities , communities and persons . Different states had passed laws to reduce entire schedules on the ground that they were excessive ; but often the belief that they were excessive grew out of comparisons between them and lower rates in other states . It was generally agreed that , on the average , American railway rates were reasonable . But recently the questions ? of what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of each of our railways , and of all of them , are excessive or unremunerative , or just the happy mean between these two extremes ; and of how , when entire schedules are found unreasonable , they shall be made reasonable ? have become of paramount interest and importance . The change is due to two causes . One is the reduction during the past five years in the number and perniciousness of unfair discriminations , which has made the question of their elimination relatively less important . The other is the con- // troversy and struggle between travelers , shippers , and many public men , on the one side , and the managers of the railways , on the other , that have sprung from the belief of the former that rates as a whole are too high , and their attempts to reduce them , and the belief of the latter that rates are too low , and their attempts to raise them . Economists have used three standards for measuring the reasonableness of entire schedules of rates . ' The first is their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is conclusive proof that they exceed the value of the service rendered for them and are excessive ; and the courts of this country will in that case reduce them , even if the effect be to disable the roads concerned from earning any profit whatever.2 The railway 's right to a return is subordinate to the public 's right to reasonable rates . Tested by their effect on traffic the rates of the railways of the United States as a whole can not be regarded as unreasonable . In all parts of the country traffic moves freely , and grows as fast as , or faster than , facilities can be provided to handle it . The second test economists have used is comparison between the rates in question and those of other railways . Owing to the great differences between the conditions under which railways are built and operated , this is seldom an easy standard VALUATION AND PROFITS to apply . Rates that would be excessive on roads built and operated at small cost , and having a large traffic , would be reasonable on lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of traffic . Again , some railways handle a larger proportion than others of cheap , bulky commodities . These must be given comparatively low rates if they are to move freely ; and they can be because they can be hauled in large car loads , or even in solid train loads , at relatively small cost . Then , some roads get much longer average hauls than others , which also tends to enable them to handle the traffic more cheaply and to make lower rates . Adequate weight must be given to such dissimilarities of conditions to make comparison of the rates of different railways at all useful . Now , the railways of the United States have cost a great deal less than those of England , and substantially less than most of those of Europe . On the other hand , the prices they have to pay for materials and labor with which to conduct their operations are much higher . Their density of passenger traffic is much less than that of the railways of Europe . On the other hand , their freight traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is both because it contains a larger proportion of cheap , bulky commodities , and because in Europe the railways handle the very valuable goods moving in small consignments which in this country are handled by separate car- // riers ? the express companies . For these reasons we should expect to find that the average rate per passenger per mile here is higher , and that the average rate per ton per mile is as low as , or lower than , in Europe . And this is the case . The average passenger rate in the United Kingdom is about 1.54 cents ; in Germany , 9.3 mills ; in France , 1.54 cents ; and in the United States , 1.94 cents . The average rate per ton per mile in the United Kingdom is about 2 cents ; in Germany , 1.27 cents ; in France , 1.28 cents ; and in the United States , .753 cents . Allowing fully for differences in conditions , rates in the United States as a whole are as low , if not lower , as anywhere else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the reasonableness of rates as a whole is the net return on their capitalization received by the railways charging them . Measured by this standard also the rates of the railways of the United States are low . They have never in any year paid as much as 4 per cent . on both their bonds and stock . ' In recent years a new theory of the proper way to ascertain the reasonableness of rates has gained wide acceptance . Many believe that the railways of this country are overcapitalized . They think , therefore , that the return on their capitalization is not a criterion of the reasonableness of their // rates . The sole true criterion , they believe , is a " fair return " on the " fair value " of the properties of the railways ; a " fair return " is the current rate of interest ; and therefore the government should make a valuation of the properties , and in future so regulate rates as to restrict net earnings to the current rate of interest on this valuation . All agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given much weight , both in making and regulating rates . The differences of opinion arise over ( 1 ) the basis on which the return should be computed ; ( 2 ) the per percentage of it that should ordinarily be allowed to be earned ; and ( 3 ) the weight that should be given to it in regulating rates , compared with the weight that should be given to other considera tions . Many believe that the just basis on which to compute the percentage of the net earnings of the railways in order to ascertain whether their rates are too high or too low is the capital that has been invested in them , exclusive of earnings . Large amounts of net earnings , that legally might have been paid out to the stockholders , have instead been invested in the properties . The properties also contain a large amount of so-called " unearned increment . " It is argued that , as railways are public service corporations , their owners are not entitled to receive a return on those parts of their value which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by increases in the value of real estate caused by the industrial development of the country . The owners and managers contend , on the other hand , that in any estimate that may be made of the value of the properties on which a return should be allowed to be earned , every factor entering into their present value should be considered . The net earnings , they say , belong to the stockholders . They may either invest them or pay them out as dividends ; and where they have chosen to invest them the value thereby added belongs to them . They also own the real estate used for railway purposes as absolutely ? so long as it is used for railway purposes ? as the farmer owns his farm ; and therefore they have the same right , it is said , to profit by increases in its value . From a legal standpoint the spokesmen for the railways seem to have the better of the argument . The fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Federal Constitution prohibit the Nation and the States from taking private property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation . When the railway , in the exercise of the power of eminent domain , takes the farmer 's land , these provisions are construed to mean that it must pay him for it ? not what it cost him ? but its reasonable market value at the time that it is taken . A similar construction of the same provisions as they apply to railways would require that rates should // be so regulated as to enable the railways to earn a return on the value of their properties at the time that the rates are being regulated , however the value may have been created . For if the rates were so regulated as to disable the company from earning a return on any part of the value of its property this would be , in effect , to take so much of its value . The Supreme Court of the United States has , therefore , indicated that while the original cost of construction of public utilities , when ascertainable , should be considered , this is merely to get such light as it will throw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates of a gas company it said : We concur with the court below in holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates . If the property which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates has increased in value since it was acquired the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase . The United States Circuit Court for the District of Minnesota recently held similarly in a case involving railway passenger and freight rates fixed by the state authorities of Minnesota . It said : The costs of rights of way from 5 to 40 years ago through wild lands , and through towns and villages // whose population and the value of the property in which have since multiplied by from 2 to 10 , is obvi ously no criterion of the value of those rights of way in 1908 , when they were used under these fares and rates and when agricultural lands in Minnesota were worth from $35 to $100 an acre , and rights of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like St. Paul and Duluth have wonderfully increased in value . It is a fair return upon the reasonable value of their Minnesota property in 1908 to which these companies were entitled , and the cost of that property at times varying from five to forty years ago may be some evidence ; but it certainly is no criterion of its value in that year . N It costs on the average from one and one-third to three times as much to get land for railway as for other purposes . This is because its acquisition and use for railway purposes involve damage to adjacent property which must be paid for , and be-cause land that is directly in the path of a coming railway attains a monopoly value . The Railroad Commission of Minnesota , in making its valuation of the railways of that state , held , however , that the appraisal of railway land should be based on the value of adjacent land used for other purposes . V But how , railway men ask , can what the farmer would have to pay for land properly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repro- // duce the railway ? Suppose that adjacent farm land were worth $100 an acre ; that the valuation of an established railway were made on this basis ; and that afterward there was built a new and competing line , to which the actual cost of land was $200 an acre . The competitive rates on competing railways must be the same . If the rates of the older railway were to be so fixed as to restrict it to a return on $100 an acre , the new railway would have to meet them and might thereby be deprived of the opportunity to earn a return on part of its actual investment . This would tend to discourage new railway construction . - ) rThe Railroad Commission of Washington met a situation similar to this when it made its valuation of the railways of that state . The Northern Pacific , many years ago , acquired land for extensive terminals on Puget Sound at a low price . The Harriman lines recently built to Puget Sound , and because of the increase in the value of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two systems were competitors , and had to make the same competitive rates . To have based the valuation of the Northern Pacific 's land on its original cost , or on its estimated value for other than railway purposes , might have prevented the Harriman lines from earning a fair return on the actual cost of their land . The Commission , therefore , based the valuation of the land of both roads on its present estimated cost of acquisition for railway purposes . // In deciding the Minnesota rate case , Judge Sanborn of the United States Circuit Court overruled the Minnesota Commission and held that the proper basis of valuation of land owned by a railway and used for transportation purposes , is what it would now cost the railway to acquire it for those purposes , even though that would be much more than it would cost to acquire it for any other purpose . Another important point in estimating the cost of reproducing the physical plants of railways , is what deduction should be made for ( depreciation ) and what addition should be made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The moment a rail or tie is laid , or a signal tower or station is finished , it begins to deteriorate , owing to use , and the ordinarily insidious , but often violent , ravages of the elements . All of the state commissions that have made valuations of railways have , to arrive at their present value , made deductions for depreciation from their estimated cost of reproduction new . But , say railway men , while the depreciation is going on there is also appreciation going on . As soon as a new line is finished maintenance forces are put to work , if it is well managed , which limit the depreciation that takes place by making constant repairs and renewals . And by their efforts , by the pressure and pounding of trains , and the action of sun and rain , of frost and heat , of drought and flood , weaknesses in fills are // discloses and remedied , watercourses are established , roadbed and embankments are solidified , and , throughout a period of fully ten years , the transportation machine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old railway which has been well maintained is physically a more valuable property than a new one ; and , railway men contend , if a deduction from the cost of reproduction should be made because of depreciation , an addition to it should be made ' because of appreciation . According to the widely accepted theory , as soon as an estimate of the cost of physical reproduction is finished , we should go ahead and so regulate rates on it as to limit each carrier to the same return . But is such an estimate a valuation ? // Indubitably , other things being equal , a railway having a good physical plant is more valuable than one having a poor one . But , surely , the estimated cost of reproducing a railroad 's plant is not the value of the plant ; and the value of the plant is not the value of the railroad . A railway through mountainous country might be more expensive to reproduce than one built through easy prairie country ; but the latter 's plant may be the more valuable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . k Again , of two roads having equally good physical plants , that having the larger net earnings is plainly the more valuable . Now , net earnings do not depend solely on rates . They are the margin between gross earnings and operating expenses . Gross earnings depend not only on the rates charged , but on the nature and density of traffic . These , in turn , result largely from the energy and skill used by the traffic department of the railway in attracting population to its lines , teaching the farmers how to increase the productivity of the soil , securing the opening of mines and the location of factories , and so adjusting rates as to enable producers in the ' territory to compete successfully in the markets of the entire country and of the world against the producers in other sections and countries . Whether operating expenses shall be high or low in proportion to gross earnings depends on the enterprise and skill used by the man- // agement in reducing the grades and eliminating the curvature in track , in enlarging terminals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop efficiency , augmenting tonnage per car and per train load , and in a hun-dred other elements of good management . A road whose traffic is large and whose operating ex-penses are relatively small , obviously would have larger net earnings , and , therefore , be a more val-uable property , than a road on which the traffic is relatively small and the operating expenses rela-tively high , on any basis of rates whatever that might be applied on both . The Union Pacific and the Denver &; Rio Grande , for example , are com-peting lines . Both the average freight rate and the ? average passenger rate of the Union Pacific in 1909 were a little lower than those of the Denver &; Rio Grande . But owing to the greater density of traffic of the Union Pacific and its lower oper-ating expenses per unit of traffic handled , its net earnings were $7,308 per mile , while those of the Denver &; Rio Grande were but $2,535 per mile . ' Footnote // Although their rates were practically the same , if you capitalize their net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $102,312 per mile for the Union Pacific and one of only $35,490 for the Den ver &; Rio Grande . As it renders more service to the public and earns more money for its own ers , the road having the greater density of traffic and the proportionately lower operating expenses is the more valuable to both . Is it not , therefore , entitled to the higher valuation ? 4 , Large traffic and relatively low operating ex penses are strong evidences of good management . If valuation were based entirely on the cost of physical reproduction , and the net earnings of each road could be , and were , limited to the same amount , the better managed roads would be de prived of the fruits of their good management . As a matter of fact , such regulation probably would be entirely impracticable ; for the competi tive rates on different roads must be the same ; andowing to the differences in density of traffic // and operating expenses , no two roads charging the same rates could be made to earn the same percentages on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical valuation alone assumes that the percentage of net earnings on the physical valuation is the measure of the rea sonableness of the rates . As on the same rates one road might earn very much more than what might be considered a " fair return , " and another , having a relatively lighter traffic and relatively higher operating expenses , much less , it would follow , on this theory , that the same rates might be at once both reasonable and unreasonable ! The road having the larger percentage of net earnings might , by less skillful management , so reduce its density of traffic and increase its operating ex penses as , without any change in the rates , to re-duce its net earnings to a " fair return . " On the theory in question , this would make reasonable the rates which previously , as to it , were unrea sonable . A theory so easily susceptible of a re uctio ad absurdum can not be entirely correct . The Supreme Court of the United States has clearly held that the value of a railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac tual use and usefulness of the property . / It said in a railway tax case : ' But the value of property results from the use to // which it is put and varies with the profitableness of that use , present and prospective , actual and anticipated . There is no pecuniary value outside of that which results from such use . Will it be said that the taxation must be based simply on cost when never was it held that cost of a thing is the test of its value ? Suppose there be two bridges over the Ohio , the cost of construction of each being the same , one between Cincinnati and Newport , and the other 20 miles below , where there is nothing but a village on either shore . The value of the one will , manifestly , be greater than that of the other , and that excess of value will spring solely from the larger use of the one than of the other . ! The advocates of exclusively physical valuation rely for legal support mainly on the decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate case . ' But Justice Harlan , in the opinion of the court in that case , mentioned not only the cost of original construction and permanent improvements and the cost of reproduction as . factors to be considered , but also the amount and market value of stocks and bonds outstanding , the sum required to meet operating expenses , and the probable earning capacity of the poperty under the particular rates prescribed by statute . The probable earning capacity of the property under any rates depends on the nature and density of the traffic . Here , therefore , we have , by direct // implication , a ruling of the Supreme Court that the density and nature of the traffic and the operating expenses must be considered in making a valuation . While it is easily shown that of two railways with equally good physical plants , that having the relatively larger business and the relatively lower operating expenses is the more valuable , the value of a difference in volume or quality of traffic , or in operating expenses , can not be expressed in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can only emerge in net earnings after rates expressed in money have been applied to the traffic . But there is , perhaps , a way in which , while using physical valuation as a basis for regulating rates and profits , we might secure to each road the benefit of every element entering into its total value as a going concern . It might be found , if a general physical valuation were made , that some roads could not earn a fair return on their valuations without charging rates which would inter f-e with the movement and growth of traffic . hey would have to be denied it , for , as has already been said , the right of a railway to earn any return is subordinate to the right of shippers and travelers to reasonable rates . Just above this class of railways would be found others in all parts of the country , which would , perhaps , be barely able , with rates that would not oppress the traffic , to earn the current rate of in- // terest on the estimated cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railway , without levying exorbitant charges , can earn a " fair return " on the " fair value " of its property it can not be denied the opportunity to do so ; this would be confiscation . They would hardly hold in any case that the cost of reproducing the physical property exceeded the fair value of such a railway ; or that the current rate of interest exceeded a fair return . It would seem , therefore , that railways of this class could not be restricted to less than the current rate of interest on their physical valuations . Still above them would be found roads , which , on the same rates , could earn more , and in some cases much more , than the current rate of interest on their physical valuations . Should they be permitted to do so ? While they would earn larger percentages of return on their physical value , their percentages of return on their total value , including their physical value and their utility to the public and to their owners , as evidenced by the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they handled it , might be no larger . Even if some railways did earn large profits this might not be proof that their rates were excessive . The fact that other ordinarily well and prudently managed roads in the same territory , charging the same rates , earned no more than a fair return on the physical value of their // properties would be evidence that the rates were reasonable and that , therefore , the more prosper ous roads were entitled to their large profits . The Supreme Court of the United States has never held that a railway is not entitled to earn more than a fair return . What it has held , in Smythe vs . Ames and other cases , is that a public service corporation , so long as it does not charge unrea sonable rates , can not be restricted to less than this . Justice Brewer in Cotting vs . Goddard , ' a case in volving the rates of a stock yards company , said : As to parties engaged in a public service , while the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court has held that the legislature may not prescribe rates , which , if enforced , would amount to confiscation of property . But it has not held that the legislature may enforce rates that stop only this side of confiscation . In another part of the same opinion he said : But it does not follow , therefore , that the legisla ture has power to reduce any reasonable charges be-cause by reason of the volume of business done by the party he is making more profit than others in the same business . . . . The amount of the aggregate profits may be a factor in considering the reasonableness of the charges , but it is only one factor and is not that which finally determines the question of reasonable ness . // Nor have the courts ever held that the current rate of interest or any other specified percentage is a " fair return " under all circumstances . The Supreme Court in the Consolidated Gas case ' said : There is no particular rate of compensation which must , in all cases and in all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in business enterprise . Such compensation must depend greatly on circumstances and locality ; among other things , the amount of risk in the business is a most important factor , as well as the locality where the business is conducted , and the rate expected and usually realized there upon investments of a somewhat similar nature with regard to the risk attending them . There may be other matters , which , in some cases , might also be properly taken into account in determining the rate which an investor might properly expect . The Supreme Court held in this case that the Consolidated Gas Company , the risk in the investment in which was pronounced very small , was entitled to 6 per cent . The United States Circuit Court in the Minnesota rate case held that the railways in Minnesota were entitled to 7 per cent. , saying : To deprive them of such a return would prevent advances and tend to compel reductions in the wages and salaries of their employees , would tend to prevent the extension of their lines into portions of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be welcome and may be needed , to deteriorate the character of the service they render , and to retard the general prosperity . The legal rate of interest on a debt in Minnesota , in the absence of contract , is 6 per cent. , and by contract it may be 10 per cent . per annum . Rational investments in agricultural , manufacturing , mercantile , and other industrial pursuits , and even well-secured loans , yield returns in Minnesota corresponding with these lawful rates . Investments in railroads and the returns there-on are at the risk of failures and partial failures of crops , of the disasters , delays , and expenses of unusu al storms , snow and cold , of the great financial disas ters which occasionally prevent or delay the movement of traffic , and of the burden of continuous operation , whether profitable or unremunerative . It is an axiom in economics that the greater the risk the greater must the return be upon invested capital , and the con clusion is irresistible that a net return of 7 per cent . per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies in Minnesota devoted to transpor tation is not more than the fair return to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States . Letting the more successfully managed roads earn more than the less successfully managed would tend to foster efficient management on all ; no stimulus to the use of enterprise and skill is so potent as allowing enterprise and skill to garner and enjoy the fruits that they have nurtured . // Wages are the compensation labor receives for its services . Profits are the compensation investors in railways receive for their public service in furnishing transportation . There has been much discussion recently of the subject of " scientific management . " The managements of the railways , and of other concerns , have been criticised for not more generally applying its principles to their operations . Now , fundamentally , scientific management consists in adopting such conditions of employment , and such schemes of compensation for labor , as will secure for the employee and the employer the maximum returns for a given expenditure of energy by the employee and a given investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal means to these ends commonly used is to fix a standard wage less than which no employee will be paid , and to then pay extra wages for the exertion by employees of more than average skill and energy , these extra wage payments being so adjusted that as a result of them the employer will get each unit of the products of labor at a smaller cost . The idea is that both employee and employer receive the largest benefits from their joint endeavors when each employee is paid in proportion to the quality and quantity of the work that he does . Opposed to this scheme of scientific management is the plan usually favored by the leaders of the labor unions , of paying the same scale of wages to all men doing // the same kind of work , in substantial disregard of the amount and the quality of the work that they do . Those who advocate " scientific management " condemn the labor union plan of " each for all and all for each " on the ground that it does not stimulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating individual effort can the cost of production be kept down to the minimum and the return to both labor and capital be raised to the maximum . Now , the managements of railways and other business concerns are strictly comparable to individual workingmen . Some managements have great ability and enterprise ; some only the ordinary amount ; some almost none . The public occupies a position analogous to the employer , and the railway to the employee . The public employs the railways to render the service of transportation . As I have shown , it would be impossible , merely by regulation of rates on the basis of valuation , to restrict all competing railways to the same return , because , owing to differences in the operating expenses , in the density of traffic and in other characteristics of competing railways , they are bound , when they charge the same rates , to earn , different net amounts . It has , therefore , been suggested by one eminent economist that all net earnings in excess of a " fair return " be appropriated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for railways in a certain territory // were held to be 7 per cent . and that some of the roads were able to earn 10 per cent . Under the plan suggested the extra 3 per cent . would be taken by the public in the form of taxes . It is questionable if this could constitutionally be done . It is also questionable if , in case it were constitutional , it should be done . For this would be applying to railways the very principle of com-pensation which those who advocate scientific management oppose applying to the compensation of labor ; and its tendency would be to deprive railway managements of initiative and enterprise . At present improvements are undertaken with the hope of increasing profits , but always with the knowledge that their cost may exceed their worth . A reduction of grades is a permanent improve-ment . It should properly be charged to capital account . Its two effects are to reduce the cost of running trains ? in other words , to reduce operat-ing expenses ? and to increase fixed charges in proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it reduces operating expenses or increases fixed charges the more . If it has the former effect the road gains ; if the latter , it loses . Under the proposed policy , if an attempted improvement turned out unprofit-ably the road would have to pocket the loss , until it could get an increase in rates or until the growth of traffic made it whole ; while if it turned out well none of the benefit would go to the railway 's // stockholders in increased dividends , but all would go to shippers and travelers in the form of reduced rates , or to the public in the form of increased taxes . Under such a policy railway managements would not be keen to undertake improvements . They would be more apt to be so inefficient that increases in operating expenses would take place which would raise the cost of transportation . ' The application of the principles of scientific management to the railways would involve permitting them to earn returns increasing with , although perhaps not in proportion to , the energy and skill with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to fostering economical and efficient management than one of // limiting all the railways to the same return , whether that return were made high or low . And the results would be much more likely to be beneficial to the public . The total gross earnings of the railways of the United States in the year ending June 30 , 1910 , were $2,750,667,435 ; their operating expenses , $1,822,630,433 . The interest on their funded debt may , perhaps , be regarded as a practically irreducible amount ; limitation of their profits can affect only the dividends they pay . The net dividends paid by them ? that is , the dividends on stock not owned by railways , but outstanding in the hands of the public ? were almost $294,000,000 , or less than 11 per cent . of their total earnings . // Therefore , if their dividends were entirely wiped out the public 's bill for transportation could thereby be reduced less than 11 per cent. , and if they were doubled its transportation bill would thereby be increased less than 11 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public is paid out for operating expenses , which amount to six and one-half times as much as their net dividends . Obviously , therefore , there is much more chance for the public to gain largely by adopting a policy which will tend to keep down or reduce railway operating expenses than one that will tend to keep down or reduce dividends . Ten per cent . of the operating expenses equals 62 per cent . of the dividends . The courts hold that the railways can not be restricted to less than a " fair return " ? say 6 or 7 per cent . Suppose that the public at the same time provides that no railway shall have more than this . Thus assured of a minimum return and restricted to this as a maximum , the railways would be deprived of all incentive to economical operation . This might easily result in an increase of 10 per cent . in operating expenses ? or prevent a reduction of 10 per cent. , which comes to about the same thing . This , being shifted to the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects as a 62 per cent . increase of dividends . If , on the other hand , the public should adopt the policy of rewarding each road according to its deserts , and this should cause a 10 per cent . reduc- // tion in operating expenses , the reduction in the economic cost of transportation would be equal to a 62 per cent . reduction in dividends . These figures show conclusively that there is much more chance for the public to gain largely by stimulating the railways to adopt more economical and efficient methods of operation than by restricting their profits ; and experience indicates that the public would share in the benefits of better management . It has received a large share of the benefit of the ever-increasing economy and efficiency of railway operation in the past in the form of reduced rates , or of rates which remained nearly stationary while the wages of labor and the prices of commodities were generally rising , which are equivalent to reduced rates . If the public prefers in future to receive its share of the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of higher taxes , instead of low rates , the suggestion that earnings in excess of the percentage held by the courts to be a fair return be appropriated in taxes might be adopted in a modified form . It might be provided assuming this would be constitutional , which it probably would not be  --  that all earnings in excess of , say , 7 per cent . should be divided equally between the railway and the public , the public 's share being paid into the treasuries of the states through which each railway operates in proportion to its mileage in the different states . This would be // much better adapted to securing efficient and economical management than the limitation of all railways to the same maximum return . It would not tend to prevent all reductions in rates , for many reductions so greatly stimulate the growth of traffic as to increase net earnings ; and the railways would still have an incentive to do anything that would increase their net earnings . It might protect the roads against some unreasonable demands of shippers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public 's share of them as well as the railway 's share . It is sometites contended that after a valuation is made rates should be so regulated as to restrict the most prosperous carriers to a fair return . As the competitive rates of competing railways must be the same , the result would be either ( 1 ) to restrict the weaker lines to less than a fair return , or ( 2 ) to cause them to get a fair return by making their rates at non-competitive points very much higher in proportion than their rates to competitive points . The decisions of the courts seem clearly to hold that so long as a road does not make its rates so high that the traffic can not easily move it can not be restricted to less than a fair return . It seems to follow that to restrict the earnings of the stronger roads to the so-called " fair return " would be , in effect , to justify the weaker roads in making their rates to non-competitive points relatively much higher than those to // competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of impairing railway efficiency , but of causing very injurious discriminations against many communities . It has been one of the main purposes of past regulation to prevent such discriminations . CHAPTER VI RAILWAY VALUATION AND PROFITS ( Continued ) I HAVE tried to outline in the previous chapter the only way in which , it would seem , a valuation could be made which would stand the test of the courts , and the only way in which , apparently , it could be used as a basis for the regulation of rates without impairing railway efficiency and injuring rather than benefiting the public . What would be the results of an attempt to carry out such a policy is largely a speculative matter . The making of a valuation of our entire 240,000 miles of railway would involve a very heavy initial expenditure by the government . The appraisal would have constantly to be revised , for a railway 's value , owing to improvements , and variations in the value of its land , may change greatly from year to year ; and , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value at the time that the inquiry is being made regarding the rates that must be considered . Therefore , there would have to be continuing expenditures to keep the valuation up to date . While the initial valuation was in progress investors and railway managers would have a feeling of some uncertainty as to the results of its making and its use , which , like uncertainty regarding public action affecting any large industry , would tend to retard railway development and // cause more or less depression in business in general . It is probable the final results would be surprising to most people . The major premise in the argument for valuation has been that our railways are overcapitalized and that , therefore , the return on their capitalization can not be used as one of the tests of the reasonableness of rates . Some of our railways are overcapitalized ? certain of them grossly so . But on the average they have the lowest capitalization per mile of the railways of any first-rate country in the world , and a much lower capitalization than those of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost // of their road and equipment to the Interstate Commerce Commission , and up to 1909 , this cost , as reported for 221,679 miles of line , amounted to $13,451,451,401 , or $60,679 a mile as compared with a net capitalization of $13,711,867,733 for the entire mileage of the country , or $59 , 259 a mile . Valuations have been made in a number of states ; and in Washington , South Dakota , Michigan , Minnesota and Wisconsin , where the aggregate gross capitalization was $1,210,999,033 , the aggregate estimate of the cost of reproduction , new , of the mere physical properties made by the state commissions was $1,211,806,522 . The only one of these valuations that has been put directly to the test of a court decision is that in Minnesota . The capitalization of the railways in Minnesota , excluding duplications due to intercorporate ownership of securities , was $39,496 a mile ; the commission 's estimate of cost of reproduction , new , was $54,201 a mile , or 38 per cent . greater . And , despite the fact that the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 38 per cent . greater than the capitalization , Judge Sanborn held in the Minnesota rate case that it was 20 per cent . too low as to the Northern Pacific , the Great Northern and the Minneapolis &; St. Louis , the roads directly involved in the Minnesota litigation . The aggregate capitalization of these three roads in Minnesota was $155 , - 051,909 ; the commission 's estimate of their cost of // reproduction was $193,094,302 ; and the valuation put on them by the court was $250,238,300 . If Judge Sanborn 's decision be correct , then not only the Minnesota valuation , but all the other valuations made have been too low . In view of all these facts , there seems ground for the confidence railway men express that an estimate of the cost of reproducing the physical properties of the railways of the United States would equal , and probably greatly exceed , their outstanding capitalization . The demand for valuation was started as a means of reducing rates . Those who started it had no conception of the additions to the values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings in permanent improvements and by increases in the value of real estate . Of course , if a valuation largely exceeded the capitalization of the railways , instead of legally justifying reductions in rates , it would legally justify substantial advances in them . Even if it did so it might be commercially impracticable for the roads to take full advantage of it . It is very widely believed that the railways are not only overcapitalized , but that they have so adjusted their rates as to pay a return on their capitalization . This is a misapprehension . In some periods many have not paid the interest on their bonds , and have become bankrupt . Never have all paid dividends on all their stock . In the three years 1895-1897 inclusive they paid no divi- // dends on over 70 per cent . of it . Not until as recently as 1901 did they pay dividends on 50 per cent . of it . Even in 1907 , their most prosperous year , they paid none on 33 per cent . of it . Of course , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so fixed them as to have made them yield a return on this part of their stock . They have had to make rates which the traffic would bear , and with which they could meet the competition of each other and of the water carriers . Thus conditioned , they have been unable so to adjust them as to earn a return on their aggregate capitalization ? however much they may have longed to do so . They would be confronted with similar conditions after a valuation was made . The rates on each commodity and for each haul would have to be adjusted as they have been in the past ? that is , with reference to what each kind of traffic , according to its value and the competitive conditions under which it was handled , could and would bear ? and if the aggregate valuation of the railways , like their aggregate capitalization in the past , were such that the rates could not be so adjusted as to earn a return on all of it , the roads would have to be content without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imply that no advances would be practicable , but merely that no very great advances might be practicable . No doubt considerable advances on some commodities could and // would be made . But it must be borne in mind that if rates were to be based on valuation , and valuation were to be based on the cost of reproduction of the properties , then every increase in the value of the real estate owned by the railways would entitle their owners to a larger minimum return . If rates were raised accordingly , a crushing burden might ultimately be imposed on the commerce and industry of the United States . The effect would be to hamper their development ; which would react with great and harmful force on the earnings of the railways . ' One reason , no doubt , why valuation has been received with such widespread favor as a possible solution of the problem of determining the reasonableness of railway rates is that in many cases it has served pretty well as a basis for the regulation ii6 VALUATION AND PROFITS of the rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other public utilities in several important particulars . It owns a large amount of real estate , while such public utilities as street railways , light and power companies and water works occupy , in the main , real estate owned by the public . An appraisal of one of these utilities is , therefore , much simpler and easier than a physical appraisal of a railroad . A public utility , such as a street railway or a water works , handles only one kind of business . A railway handles a great many different kinds of traffic which can not bear the same rates . A public utility , such as a street railway or a water works , usually has a monopoly in its field , while steam railways operate under varying physical conditions , have widely varying amounts of traffic , and , despite the fact of these differences in conditions , , , // compete with each other and with water carriers at numerous points , and must make their rates with reference to these competitive conditions . Therefore , while making and regulating the rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively simple matter , involving comparatively few and simple considerations , the making and regulating of the rates of a steam railway , which apply to the carriage of ' passengers and of from six to ten thousand different commodities handled under widely varying conditions , is a highly complex matter . The earnings of a public utility , such as a street railway or a water works , do not fluctuate greatly . In the calendar year 1908 the gross earnings of the railways of the United States declined $300,000,000 , while those of the street railways increased . While , therefore , something like mathematical exactitude is practicable in the regulation of other utilities it does not seem practicable in the regulation of railways . The making and regulation of railway rates ? so long , at least , as they are owned by different companies ? must always be , not merely an exercise in mathematics , but an exercise of judgment guided by a thorough knowledge of economic principles and commercial and transportation conditions . It may be advisable , as a matter of public policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railways . This would // satisfy the public as to whether or not they are earning excessive returns . But whether a valuation be made or not , we must continue to determine the reasonableness of specific rates precisely as railway men and intelligent railway regulating authorities have heretofore ; and it might be wiser , instead of making a valuation and using it as a measure of the reasonableness of rates as a whole , whether those of one road or of all the roads of the country , to judge of the reasonableness of entire schedules of rates in the future , as economists have in the past ? that is , by noting their effects on the movement and growth of traffic ; by comparing them , making allowances for differences of conditions , with the rates on other railways in this and other countries ; by comparing the capitalizations of the railways whose rates may be in question ? allowances again being made for differences in conditions  --  with the capitalizations of other railways in this and other countries ; and by comparing their returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in other industries . If , in view of these considerations , the rates of a railway , or a group of railways , seem unreasonably high , perhaps they should be reduced ; and if they seem unreasonably low , perhaps they should be allowed to be advanced . Personally , it seems to me that very exaggerated prominence has been given in recent years to // the question of the basis on which rates as a whole should be regulated . I believe this for two reasons . First , all my comparisons of rates in this and other countries have led to the conclusion that rates here , on the average , are relatively low . Second , as I have pointed out , the determination of what profits the railways shall be allowed to earn is apt to have comparatively little influence in determining how high or how low their rates shall be . The dividends on their stock amounted in 1910 to but 16 per cent . of their operating expenses . It is , therefore , from the standpoint of those who pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient and economical management , their operating expenses shall be kept down as that their dividends shall be kept down . The great desideratum is the working out of some permanent policy which will tend to secure to the public the best practicable service at the lowest rates practicable for such service . This end is much less apt to be attained by a policy of restrictive regulation which will tend to keep the railways and the people at loggerheads than by a policy of cooperative regulation ? that is , by some policy which will give the railways an incentive to good management and will cause the results of their good management to be equitably divided between the people and their owners . The railway managers have more to gain for the owners by following a course that tends to promote the // interests of both the owners and the public than by following one that tends to promote the interest of the owners at the expense of the public . Similarly , the public has more to gain by adopting a policy that will tend to benefit both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one designed to promote the interests of the public at the expense of the owners . Conditions may change , but for the present it would seem that the best course for the public to take is to cause public authorities to so regulate rates as to establish equitable relations between them ; to exercise some control over the issuance of railway securities mainly to see that none in future are issued except for cash or its equivalent , and that the money derived from them is honestly invested in the properties ; and then to let each railway earn such return as it can , so long as the average return of any particular group of railways , or of the railways as a whole , does not exceed the ordinary rate of commercial return in the territories where they do business . Under this plan some railways would earn very large returns on their capitalizations ; but if other railways operating in the same territory and charging the same rates werO barely able to earn only the current rate of interest on as low or lower capitalizations , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous roads resulted largely from better management ; that they were // entitled to their larger returns ; and that it was expedient for the public to let them enjoy them . This scheme of regulation does not appeal so strongly to minds loving mathematical exactitude as does the plan of making a valuation and fixing the precise percentage of profit on it that each railway shall be allowed to earn ; but it is more feasible and better adapted to secure to the public in the long run low and equitable rates and good service . // properties , however carefully computed , is the sole element to be considered in determining the present value of a railroad , or that the outstanding securities could or should be made to conform to any such arbitrary standard . " In another place the Commission said : " No attempt should be made by statute to limit railroad profits to a fixed percentage , or to treat a high cash dividend as necessarily indicating extortion . Railroad charges must be reasonable ; but to try to control rates by arbitrarily limiting profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and economy on the same level as the one who tries to accomplish the same result through extortionate charges . . . . We hear much about a reasonable return on capital . A reasonable return is one which under honest accounting and responsible management will attract the amount of investors ' money needed for the development of our railroad facilities . More than this is an unnecessary public burden . Less than this means a check to railroad construction and to the development of traffic . Where the investment is secure , a reasonable return is a rate which approximates the rate of interest which prevails in other lines of industry . Where the future is uncertain the investor demands , and is justified in demanding , a chance of added profit to compensate for his risk . We can not secure the immense amount of capital needed unless we make profits and risks commensurate . If rates are going to be reduced whenever dividends exceed current rates of interest , investors will seek other fields where the hazard is less or the opportunity greater . In no event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners such a return as they could have obtained by the purchase of investment securities which do not involve the hazards of construction or the risks of operation . " CHAPTER VII RAILWAY EFFICIENCY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ECONOMY THE public is always concerned as to the efficiency with which our railways are operated . The railway system of the United States is the greatest in point of mileage , of investment represented , and of traffic handled in the world . That public sentiment in this country is still opposed to public ownership is due to the fact that it is believed that government ownership might endanger our political institutions and that private management of this great railway system is more efficient than public management would be . If it should be shown that under private ownership the operation of our railways is relatively inefficient , either as compared with what it ought to be , or as compared with that of railways in other countries which are owned and operated by the state , this would be a strong reason for a change in public sentiment regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient management makes // operation needlessly expensive ; and , in the long run , whatever tends to increase the cost of opera tion tends to increase the rates that the public must pay for the transportation service . Any intelligent consideration of the question as to whether any railway or group of railways is efficiently managed must be preceded by definition of what is meant by " efficiency . " The word is quite commonly used in discussions of railway affairs as if it were synonymous with " economy . " But economy is not the same thing as efficiency . The public demands , and properly , that the rail-ways shall not only be economically operated , but that they shall give good service . Efficient opera tion may , therefore , properly be defined as the rendering , as economically as may be practicable in the circumstances , of such service as best fur thers the public convenience and welfare . The railway managers have reached pretty ac-curate conclusions as to the most economical speed to run any given train with an engine of any given tractive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be inefficient for shippers // who wish their goods rapidly transported to their destination . Mere economy may be hauling cars loaded to their maximum capacity and running trains with enough cars to utilize the engine 's full tractive power . But good service is incompatible with holding cars and trains at terminals until each can be loaded to its capacity . The commercial organizations in several cities , including New York , Pittsburgh , Chicago and St. Louis , have within recent years got the railways to put on many " package cars " which run from these cities to numerous points over a wide area on regular schedules . When the time comes for one of them to go it must start whether it contains 40,000 pounds of merchandise or 4,000 pounds . Therefore , their average lading is small . From the standpoint merely of economy this is inefficient operation ; but the shipper considers it efficient operation , because it is good service . Similarly , in the passenger service economical operation would consist of loading each car to its reasonable capacity and running just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true efficiency of operation involves such frequent train service that the average number of passengers hauled per train in the United States in the year ending June 30 , 1909 , was only 54 , or less than enough to fill an average day coach . If one is disposed to question whether speed and safety are , from the standpoint of the public , as // important elements in efficiency of operation as economy let him consider what is taking place daily on our railways . They have over 2,135,000 freight cars . Perhaps one-half of these are always under load . The average value of their loads is perhaps $500.1 There is , then , at any given time about $530,000,000 worth of goods in transit . The average rate of commercial profit in this country is perhaps 12 per cent. , and 12 per cent . on goods of this amount is over $60,000,000 a year . The more speedily these goods are moved the smaller is the economic loss on them from their being kept unavailable for use , sale or consumption . Nor is this all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw materials , and the jobber and retail merchant smaller stocks of goods if each knows that when he places an order he can rely on the railway to bring it to him within a time both short and certain . To whatever extent speedy and dependable transportation releases capital that otherwise must be kept tied up in goods in transit , in manufacturers ' raw materials and in jobbers ' and retailers ' stocks , to that extent it increases the amount of capital available for other uses . We commonly think of safety in operation as of importance only in the passenger service . This is 1 " Railway Corporations as Public Servants , " by Henry S. Haines , page 154. // far from true . The railways of the United States pay out annually about $30,000,000 for loss of and damage to property . This is economic waste , a large part of which can be eliminated only by increasing the safety of operation . Of course , however , those most interested in safe operation are not the shippers . There are on the pay rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The number of passengers transported by them in the fiscal year 1910 was 971 , 683,199 . On the average every inhabitant takes over ten railway trips a year , riding a total distance of about 350 miles . Regarding the matter from a purely economic standpoint , enormous waste was occasioned by the unsafety of operation which resulted in 3,602 employees and 356 passengers being killed in the fiscal year 1911 , and in 126,039 employees and 13,433 passengers being injured . Still further economic waste was caused by 6,438 other persons being killed and 10,687 others being injured , a total of 10,396 killed and 150 , - 159 injured . ' We want economical operation . We want low rates . But they are of little importance compared with the increased efficiency needed to make transportation safe , almost regardless of what attaining this end would cost . Bearing in mind , then , that railway efficiency // consists , first , of economical construction and working , and , second , of the rendering of good service , let us consider some facts indicating how efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase their efficiency . Have they been produced in their present condition economically ? The cost of road and equipment up to June 30 , 1909 , of railways having 221 , - 679 miles of line was , according to their reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission , $60,679 a mile . The average capitalization of all the roads in the country was $59,259 a mile . It is quite generally believed that they are overcapitalized . This is due to the known facts that in their earlier history many were overcapitalized and that the stock of some has been freely watered since . But , considering them as a single system , the water probably has all been absorbed by increases in the value of their real estate and by the making of permanent improvements from earnings without capitalizing them . Probably to have constructed them and put them in their present condition by an aggregate expenditure equal only to their outstanding capitalization , if every expenditure for capital account , and only expenditures for capital account had been charged to capital account , would have required rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than that of the railways of any other first-class country sup.ports this view . The railways of the United // Kingdom are privately owned . Most of those of France are privately owned . Practically all of those of Germany and Switzerland are owned by the governments . The capitalizations ( or costs of construction ) per mile of the railways of these countries compare with that of our railways as follows : 1 United Kingdom , $275 ; 040 ; France , $139 , - 237 ; Switzerland , $110,740 ; Germany , $109,788 ; United States , $59 , 259 . American railways have not paid as much for land for right of way as have those of Europe . But they have paid more for the labor used in construction . They have not so many miles of second , third and fourth tracks and yards and sidings as some European railways ; but their capitalization per mile of track , as well as per mile of line , is much less than that of any foreign railways with which it is fair to compare them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railways of the United Kingdom is $118,000 ; of the Prussian-Hessian railways , $76,217 ; and of the railways of the United States , $40,052 . In comparing the relative capitalizations ( or costs of construction ) of American and foreign railways one pertinent fact is often overlooked . This is that the European railways were built , // through settled countries that could afford them a large traffic from the beginning and were , therefore , originally very substantially constructed , while those of the United States usually have been originally built through thinly populated territory where the traffic immediately available has been small . In consequence , they have been at first very cheaply constructed ; and then , when increased business has justified , have been partially or wholly reconstructed in order to reduce grades and curvature , and to shorten their lines . The original right of way has in many cases been entirely abandoned for many miles . This method of developing our railroads has been suited to the peculiar conditions of this country ; but obviously it has tended in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction and the resulting capitalization . The railways of New South Wales have been built by the government . They were constructed under conditions similar to those of pioneer days in the United States . They are physically much inferior to our railways . Yet their cost of construction has been $64,000 per mile . ' As I have already shown in the chapters on " Railway Valuation and Profits , " the valuations // of railways that have been made by the various state commissions and courts tend to show that our railways could not now be reproduced for an amount equal to their capitalization . The conclusion is hard to escape that , however it may have been in individual cases , comparative economy has been used in the development of our railways as a whole . In considering whether any railway , or number of railways , is operated with reasonable economy we should not fix our attention on any part or parts of them , as , for example , their shops or their station service . We should consider the results of their entire operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions . None of its parts can with exact justice be compared with similar concerns not connected with the transportation business . It might be shown , for example , that the cost per unit of doing many different kinds of work in a railway 's shop exceeds the cost per unit of doing the same kind of work in factories engaged in purely commercial business . But this would not prove that the shops of the railways are inefficiently managed . When business gets dull the manager of a factory may close down entirely until enough orders accumulate to enable him to resume operations on a scale on which he can turn out each unit of product economically . But the railway must operate its trains continuously , whether traffic is light or heavy ; the // capacity of its shops should be the maximum that the maximum business may require ; and , there-fore , they will , necessarily , when business is light , be operated with relative want of economy . The agents at a good many country stations have only enough work to keep them busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires that they be kept on duty throughout the day . To train them to do their work in one-third less time would , therefore , be merely to give them more hours of idleness , which would not measurably increase the economy of operation ! But while the economy with which a railway is managed can be judged only by its entire results , it is exceedingly difficult , owing to the great dif ferences between the conditions under which railways are operated , to devise any standards for measuring the comparative economy of their man agement . The business of railways is that of pro ducing transportation for the public . The units of their service are one passenger hauled one mile and one ton hauled one mile ? the " passenger mile " and the " ton mile . " The expenditures that they make to produce passenger miles and ton miles are of two classes . These are ( 1 ) the fixed investment in their plants , represented more or less accurately by their capitalization ; and ( 2 ) their operating expenses . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions , and handling the same kind and amounts of // traffic , the number of passenger miles and ton miles that they produced for each dollar of investment and each dollar of operating expenses would be a very satisfactory test of the economy with which they were constructed and are operated . But the conditions required for such exact and satisfactory comparisons of the results secured by different companies can seldom be found . Take , for example , the railways between whose capitalizations I have made comparison ? those of the United Kingdom , Germany , France , Switzerland , and the United States . As I have said elsewhere , the railways of the United Kingdom collect at , and deliver from , their stations much of the freight they transport . The railways , both of the . United Kingdom and of other countries of Europe , themselves handle the business which in this country is handled by express companies . The average distances that freight and passengers are hauled there are much less than they are in the United States . ' The density of passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mile per mile of line per year ? is much greater in , // Europe than in the United States . On the other hand , the density of freight traffic  --  that is , the number of tons hauled one mile per mile of line per year ? is greater in the United States than in most of the countries of Europe and very much greater than in many of them . Now , while either a dense passenger traffic or a dense freight traffic may be handled more economically per unit than a light one , freight traffic is much more susceptible to the introduction of economies of operation than is passenger traffic . All these conditions tend to make it practicable for the railways of the United States to render more units of public service per dollar of capital and of operating expenses than can those of Europe . On the other hand , the prices of materials and equipment are as high here as , or higher than , in Europe , and the wages of labor are fully twice as great . On the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical operation , and the statistics bearing on the subject disclose that they have taken advantage of them to a very marked degree . // The following table shows in detail the relation between capitalization , operating expenses and public service rendered : The above table shows that in proportion to capitalization the railways of the United States handle 1.47 per cent . more passenger traffic than those of the United Kingdom , 56.50 per cent . less than those of Germany , 21.61 per cent . less EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY than those of France , and 41.81 per cent . less than those of Switzerland . On the other hand , in proportion to capitalization , they handle 738.02 per cent . more freight than those of the United Kingdom , 113.39 per cent . more than those of Germany , 350.70 per cent . more than those of France , and 296.30 per cent . more than those of Switzerland . In proportion to their operating expenses they handle 47.22 per cent . less passenger traffic than do the railways of the United Kingdom , 52.5 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than those of France , and 60.41 per cent . less than those of Switzerland . On the other hand , in proportion to their operating expenses , they handle 321.21 per cent . more freight than those of the United Kingdom , 124.19 per cent . more than those of Germany , 107.46 per cent . more than those of France , and 202.17 per cent . more than those of Switzerland . ' Now , while unquestionably the difference between the results got from each dollar of investment and each dollar spent for operation here and abroad can be largely accounted for by differences in conditions , it can not by any means be wholly so accounted for . It is very largely due to the superior courage , enterprise and skill with which the railway managers of the United States have so developed the facilities of their lines as to // make economical operation practicable . ' The capacity of freight cars in Europe is usually from 10 to 15 tons . The average probably does not exceed 124 tons ; and there has been but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average capacity in 1909 was 35 tons , an increase of 25 per cent . over that of 1902 . The differences between the tractive powers of locomotives , and between the sizes of the car loads and train loads in which traffic is handled , in Europe and the United States , correspond to the difference in the capacities of . as noeen // freight cars . The average tractive power of locomotives in the United States in 1902 was 20,485 pounds . In 1909 it was 26,601 pounds , an increase of 30 per cent . The number of passengers hauled one mile per passenger locomotive increased between 1889 and 1900 from 1,474,765 to 2,185 , 877 , or 49 per cent .

The tons of freight hauled one mile per freight locomotive increased from 5,966 , - // 193 to 6,447,708 , or 8 per cent. , and the tons hauled one mile per freight car increased from 95,458 to 105,518 , or 11 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee , largely in con-sequence of improvements such as these , increased from 113,915 in 1889 to 148,837 in 1899 , and to 164,946 in 1909 , an increase for the latter year over 1889 of 45 per cent . Meantime , innumerable other improvements were made tending to increase the economy of op eration , such as reductions of grades , eliminations of curvature , the laying of heavier rail , strength ening of bridges and other structures , building of more main tracks , side tracks , yards and termi nals , adopting of more refined methods of opera tion , such as carefully regulating locomotives , run ning them at the most economical speeds for the train loads they haul , etc . The average tons per train increased in the ten years from 1899 to 1909 from 244 to 363 , or 49 per cent . ' The average freight train load in Europe is certainly not more than one-half of what it is in this country . From a study of the meager data available , I believe that in England it is not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train loads are , // the more economically , other things being equal , traffic can be handled . ' W. M. Acworth 2 is the leading authority on ' Perhaps the tendency to take advantage of improve ments in roadway and rolling stock to increase the train load can be best illustrated by some striking examples , all of them afforded by the year 1909 . The New York Central hauled with a Consolidation locomotive a train consisting of 105 cars of coal , the gross weight of the train ? including both freight and dead weight ? being 7,381 tons . The Lake Shore a little later , with a Consolidation engine , hauled a train load of ore containing 100 steel cars and having a gross weight of 7,433 tons , from Ashtabula , Ohio , to Youngstown , a distance of 65 miles , in 5 hours and 15 minutes .

The cars were 43 feet over couplers and the caboose , which weighed 18 tons , was 30 feet long . The weight of the train behind the engine was 7,562 tons . The grade on which it was hauled was easy , but there was some opposing grade . Later a Mallet engine hauled on the Virginian a train composed of 120 steel cars , which , with the engine and caboose , was 6,286 feet long , or 6 feet more than a mile . The weight of the coal in the train was 6,000 tons , or 12,000,000 pounds . In such trains as these the cost of hauling one ton of freight one mile seems reduced close to the practicable minimum . Perhaps , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost can be made still less . , // transportation in England . He has studied railways and their operations extensively and is probably as competent to judge of their relative efficiency as any other man . In a recent newspaper interview , ' given as he was starting to England after two months in this country , Mr. Acworth said : It has always been my opinion that in actual economy of operation the railways of the United States are the first in the world . In the number of tons per car , cars per train ; in the fullest utilization of locomotives ; in the obtaining of the greatest measure of result for each unit of expenditure , they are not equaled by the railways of any other nation . When the Greek commanders after the battle of Salamis voted who should receive the prize for valor each put his name first , but all put the name of Themistocles second . And Themistocles received the prize . So , too , though German , French and English railway men would , I dare say , all put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am sure , put yours second , and on the voting of the experts your railways would come out first . Mr. J. Kruttschnitt has pointed out ' that between 1894 and 1909 , a period of fifteen years , the average wages of labor and prices of commodities // in the United States increased 32 per cent. , as shown by bulletins of the United States Bureau of Labor . Meantime the average freight and passenger rates in the United States slightly declined , the average rate per ton per mile in 1894 being 8.6 mills and in 1909 , 7.63 mills ; the average rate per passenger per mile in 1894 being 1.986 cents , and in 1909 , 1.982 cents . Mr. Kruttschnitt calculated that if railway rates had increased as much in proportion during this period as the prices of commodities and the wages of labor , the country 's bill for transportation during the period would have averaged $1,300,000 per day more than it actually did ; that for the year 1909 it would have averaged $2,760,000 per day more than it did ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7,844,343 , - 000 more than it actually was . This is the reply of the railway managers to the statement which has been made that by more efficient management they could reduce the cost of transportation a million dollars a day . They say that these figures show that by efficient management in the past they actually have saved the country more than a million dollars a day ; and that this shows they can do so in future if given a chance ; but that they must be given a substantial amount of time and the cooperation of other interests in order to accomplish these results . To say that our railways are operated with comparative economy is not equivalent to saying they // are operated as economically as they could be , or , perhaps , ought to be . There is constant complaint from railway officers that the efficiency of labor has not increased with its wages , but has declined . The Interstate Commerce Commission , in its opinion in the " rate advance " cases in the spring of 1911 , intimated that the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some concerns making and selling railway supplies and equipment and some railways , has caused railways to pay higher prices for some kinds of supplies and equipment than they would have paid in a market where all buyers and sellers dealt at arm 's length . Ground is not entirely wanting for this charge . It can be shown that the amount of work done by engines and cars has not increased as much as their capacities . ' The efficiency of labor , the number of // miles made by each car and locomotive daily , ' the tons hauled per car and locomotive , ought to be increased wherever this can be done without impairing the service . Probably the railway mana- // gers can not effect these economies without the cooperation of employees , shippers and public authorities . They must have the cooperation of shippers , be- // cause without it they can not secure such prompt loading and unloading of cars , and such large car loads and train loads , as are necessary to the most economical operation . They must have the cooperation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in the chapters on " Railway Valuation and Profits , " the adoption of a policy of restricting all railways to the same return would deaden enterprise and prevent the introduction of improvements in methods and plants . Another reason why they need the cooperation of the public and public authorities is to prevent legislation which increases the cost of operation without conferring any real benefit on any one . Of this class , for example , are the laws that have been passed in several states prescribing the number of men that must be employed in train crews . Ten or fifteen years ago two brakemen were sufficient for a freight train , although then the cars had to be coupled and the brakes applied by hand . There has been since then a very substantial increase in the tonnage hauled per train . This is partly because the number of cars per train has been increased , but it is also largely because cars of greater capacity are now used . In spite of the increased size of train loads there is not ? owing to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all cars with automatic couplers any more work for brakemen to do now than there was then . Nevertheless , the state // laws referred to commonly require three brakemen on a train . The effect of such legislation is to increase needlessly the number of men the railways must employ , and thereby raise the cost of transportation . ' Most important of all , the railways must have the cooperation of their employees ; without it all efforts from whatever source to increase the economy of operation will be nullified . The wages annually paid by the railways of the United States now amount to over $1,000,000,000 . This is 60 per cent . of their total operating expenses . Unfortunately , the relations between the roads and many of their employees are not such ? nor is there now any promise of their becoming such ? as to promote the greatest reasonable economy in opera- // tion . Scientific management requires the training and compensating of each employee so as to get the maximum reasonable results , both in quantity and quality , from his labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once relatively high pay for the employee and a low unit cost of production for the employer . The leaders of the labor unions very generally oppose any scheme of wages under which one man doing a given kind of work is paid more than another man doing the same kind . One objection made by them to piece work and bonus wage systems is that after employers , by the use of such systems , have increased the average output per employee , they often have reduced the piece rate or the bonus , the consequence being that the employee has to do more work than before the introduction of the piece work or bonus system to earn the same pay . There is much ground for this com plaint . Employers often have been guilty of this injustice . Another reason why labor unions often oppose schemes of wages designed to increase the work done by each man is their belief that this would tend to reduce the number of men employed . Of course , every economist knows that this is a fallacy . The amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed quantity . Work is done to produce things . The nominal wages of labor are money , but its real wages are not money , but what money buys . The things money buys are the // products of labor . The less labor , as a whole produces , therefore , the less , in the long run , it tends to make its own wages ? not its nominal , or money , wages , which by limitation of production may be actually increased , but its real wages ? the products in which it is paid ? which by the very same process are reduced . Therefore , by limiting the amount it produces labor is apt simply to bite off its own nose to spite the capitalist employer 's face . But while the antagonism of labor unions to any system of wages that tends to increase the amount of work done by each employee is unreasonable , it is very real ; and nowhere is it more real , or more vigorously manifested , than on the railways . Railway train employees are paid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten hours ' labor , or work on a train during the time that it moves 100 miles , is counted a day . If the employee works more than ten hours , or his train runs more than 100 miles , he is entitled to " overtime . " He may run only 90 miles in 10 hours ; if so , he has worked a day . He may run 110 miles in 3 hours ; if so , he has worked 10 per cent . more than a day and is entitled to credit for a proportionate amount of " overtime . " This wage system originally was adopted for the purpose , and no doubt had the effect , of expediting the movement of trains . But in consequence of the development of the railway business it has become an irrational and unduly I F ? EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY expensive method of compensation . The wages of the employee should depend only to a limited extent on the speed of the machine he operates . They should depend mainly on results due to his own efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubling the speed of a locomotive that pulled a train might double the wages paid to every man employed on it . The speed of engines and trains has been in very many cases greatly increased since this scheme of wages was adopted ; and in consequence many employees are now earning very high wages for doing a comparatively small amount of work . For example , a locomotive engineer may make a three or four hour run out of Chicago , and then in a short time make the same run back , covering 200 miles in six or eight hours . He thereby earns two days ' pay in this short time , not because he is a specially skilful workman , but because he has a fast train . Another just as good engineer may run another train over the same division the same day , and because he pulls a train that is scheduled slower may earn but half as much . A piece-work system that is based so largely upon what machines do , and to so very slight a degree upon what the men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to stimulating individual effort , almost worthless . But while the railway brotherhoods defend this system and would resist the substitution of some more equitable and economical one , they fight // every effort to introduce any method of fixing wages that is designed to reward each employee according to the quality and the quantity of the work that he does . The managers of the railways have introduced and retained piece work and bonus wage systems in various places . But before they could put the wages of all , or even of any considerable part , of their more than a million and a half workmen on an individual effort basis they probably would have to have and win a great strike . The public , before it criticises the railways for being less economically managed than they might be , should know these facts and look them squarely in the face . CHAPTER VIII RAILWAY EFFICIENCY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PUBLIC SERVICE WE have now considered at some length the economy with which the railways of the United States are operated . In this respect they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has been pointed out , economy is not the sole measure of efficiency . Unfortunately , quality of service , unlike economy , is not susceptible of admeasurement and comparison in terms of comparative statistics . Furthermore , good service in one country may not be good service in another . It is the duty of railways to supply the kind of service the public demands and needs ; and it may demand and need a different kind in one country from what it does in another . So the truest measure of the quality of the service in any country is not how it compares with that in others , but how it fills the requirements of the public served . The traveler is most interested in the quality of the passenger ? the shipper in the character of the freight ? service . Travel ever has been deemed one of the principal diversions of leisure and chief // means of culture . In our country of magnificent distances and intense commercial activity much of it is also necessary to the transaction of business . Under rather unfavorable conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most favorable conditions it has its pronounced discomforts . There are few ways in which we can add more to the pleasure and welfare of all than by increasing the convenience , comfort and speed , and ameliorating the inconvenience , discomforts and danger , of passenger transportation . Much has been done along this line ; but there is yet much to do . The typical railway station in the United States has been ugly , dark and dirty . Within recent years numerous fine and some truly magnificent stations have been built . Every one knows of the great Pennsylvania and New York Central terminals in New York City ; of the Union terminals in Washington and St. Louis ; of the Chicago &; Northwestern terminal in Chicago ; of the Union terminal now under construction in Kansas City . The tendency to improve station architecture is not restricted to large cities ; comfortable and attractive structures are being built at many towns and small cities . It is a tendency meriting emphatic and generous public encouragement . It does not increase railway efficiency from the standpoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in a station costing 154 ? EFFICIENCY AND PTJBLIC SERVICE $500,000 as in one costing $5,000,000 , But it does increase efficiency from the standpoint of the public , for a commodious and beautiful station contributes to the comfort , delights the eye and improves the taste of all who use it . In every city and town , for both practical and esthetic rea sons , the railway stations should be among the most sanitary , commodious and artistic buildings . It is generally agreed that the best passenger trains in the United States are the best in the world . There are usually three classes of service on European railways . Theoretically , we usually have only one , except on certain railroads . In fact , however , on long runs we have three : first , that rendered on standard sleeping and parlor cars ; second , that on tourist cars ; and third , that on ordinary day coaches . For the last named only the regular fare is charged . For the others addi tional tourist car , or parlor , or sleeping car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , l an English writer , who has studied American railways , says that in proportion to the rates charged our ordi nary day coach service is not as good as the third class service on English railways , but " comparing the ordinary American service , plus the charge for sleeper , with the English first class service , plus the charge for sleeper , the advantage is in favor of the former . " On the other hand , Mr. Logan // G. McPherson , ' one of the most intelligent American students of European transportation , says : The accommodations provided for first and second class passengers on the European railways , are , as a rule , almost identical ; a principal difference seems to be in the color of the upholstery ; usually , however , there are fewer seats in the first-class carriages , so that the traveler has more elbowroom . The accommodations for third-class passengers are sometimes nearly as good as those for second-class , but generally they are much worse , so deficient in ordinary comfort that they would not be tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railway ticket . On the early morning and late evening trains that carry workingmen into and out of the large cities , the thirdclass cars have hard wooden benches upon which their occupants may be seen huddling together , each passenger supporting the person next to him as they smoke and sleep in the stifling atmosphere . There is no such rude equipment in the United States , not even in the trains in the mining and lumbering regions . 2 The suburban dweller , or the farmer riding only 10 miles from his home to the nearest county seat // town , does not expect or need the comforts pro-vided for those journeying from Chicago to the Pacific coast or from New York to Florida . Mr. McPherson indicates that the local service in Europe is poor . " On local trains and in the back-ward regions , " he says , " the passenger service is an abomination . " While we have some of the best suburban service in the world , it is hard for me to believe there is any local service in Europe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . The only excuse for the very wide difference between the kind of service given on our good through trains , and on most of our local trains , is that the traffic available for the latter is so small that even the most economical service is apt to be unprofitable . Of course , this , again , is largely explainable by the fact that the density of the passenger traffic of our railways is much less than that of most European railways , being about one-fifth that of the German and British railways and about one-fourth that of the French railways . In point of frequency of passenger service none of our steam railways , outside of New England and a few other parts of the East , will compare with those of the leading countries of Europe . The passenger service in England is 2i times as frequent as in New York , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Delaware and Maryland , the region of the densest railway traffic in this country . It is de- // sirable that passenger service shall be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public convenience . Where the density of population is considerable increased service creates a large amount of new local business . Even where the rates of the electric interurban lines have been substantially as high as those of the steam roads the conveniency and frequency of their service have enabled them in many cases to take 75 to 90 per cent . of the local business from the steam roads , and to create a vast amount of new business . Passenger service often could be made better with a reduced expenditure . Four different railways operate four trains daily each way between Chicago and St. Louis . Four times a day a quartette of trains departs and arrives at almost exactly the same time . Many of them run half empty . If half of the sixteen were taken off and the schedules of the rest were arranged so that they would arrive and depart at eight different hours the service rendered to the public would be improved , while the cost of rendering it would be reduced . But if the railways should enter into an agreement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such hours as would better serve the public convenience they would be more apt to be criticised than commended for doing so ? and might be prosecuted under the Sherman antitrust act for combining in restraint of trade ! There // are hardly two large cities in the country between which the service could not be improved , and at the same time its cost and the economic waste involved in rendering it reduced , by taking off some passenger trains and spacing the hours of departure and arrival of the rest farther apart . It is no advantage to the traveler for four trains to leave for his destination at the same hour ; he can ride on only one at a time . One of the chronic nuisances on American railways is the late passenger train . Its frequent causing of long waits at uncomfortable stations , and of the missing of train connections and business and social engagements , has been an important provocative of public irritation . It is not confined to sections where population is sparse and traffic small . One of the first duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York after its creation in 1907 was to investigate the passenger service of the railways of that state . Some of the facts disclosed were very discreditable to railway management . The Commission found a train on one road which never reached its destination on time in July or August . It found a train on another road which was never on time from October 20 to December 1 . It found still another on another road which was never on time in November ; and yet another on another road that never was on time in December . // The unavoidable shortcomings of a highly complex machine such as the steam locomotive , and the more avoidable shortcomings of the men who run trains , are to blame for many of them being late . Competition , the prolific mother of so many evils in the railway business , is responsible for many more . Competing railways differ in their lengths between large centers , in their grades , in the condition of their roadbed and equipment , and , consequently , in the time they can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates the roads having the faster trains would get all the business . Threats by the weaker roads ? sometimes executed ? to cut the rates unless the stronger roads hold down the running times of their trains result in tacit agreements under which all make practically the same schedules . The result is that the stronger lines do not run their trains as fast as they could , and yet set a pace that the weaker roads can not keep . The public does not get as speedy service from the stronger roads as it is entitled to , and suffers from trains being chronically late on the weaker ones . The best remedy ever applied , perhaps , is the arrangement under which the railways between Chicago and New York are divided into two classes , " standard " and " differential , " the latter charging a lower basic rate than the former ; the rates via different trains on the same road varying with their running times , and the excess fares // on the faster trains being paid back if they fail to make their scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always has been one of the worst shortcomings of American railway service . The ticket agent whose answers to travelers ' questions are curt and whose manner is supercilious ; the churlish conductor ; the waiter and porter who inspire every one with a desire to break their heads ; the information clerk who tries more to make the traveler feel his want of knowledge than to give him information ? are among the railways ' worst enemies . ' We have all met them . Recently the higher officers have become acutely aware of the extent to which such employees irritate public sentiment , and numerous roads have been conducting campaigns for the education of employees on the subject of courtesy . These efforts are having good results ; but much more will be done before the traveler on American railways will get the sort of treatment which he has a right to demand and for which he pays . In the interest of more economical operation it is desirable that in the freight service of American railways there should be substantial increases in the tonnage hauled per car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle much larger average loads than they do . But , as I have // pointed out elsewhere , economical operation , whether in the passenger or freight service , is not necessarily efficient operation . From the standpoint of the shipper increased efficiency would in many cases consist in speedier , more regular and more frequent service . Probably the service rendered in hauling the higher classes of commodities between the larger commercial centers of the United States compares well with the similar service rendered in other countries . The railway tariffs in the leading countries of Continental Europe contain two sets of rates , one for ordinary , the other for specially expedited , service . In Germany the railways are required to dispatch quick-service freight from the station within one day after receipt , and to carry it at the rate of 198 miles a day . I have no information as to whether they customarily give merely the minimum service required or better service . Fast freight trains run on regular schedules between Chicago and New York , a distance of 1,000 miles , in 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules between Chicago and East St. Louis , a distance of 280 miles , in 15 hours and between Chicago and Kansas City , a distance of 500 miles , in 36 hours . This is typical of the fast freight service rendered between all our large business centers . The German railways are required to dispatch ordinary-service freight from the station within // two days after receipt , and to transport it within one day to a distance of at least 66 miles . A further allowance of one day is made for each additional 132 miles . If there is delay for more than twelve hours beyond these requirements portions of the freight charge are refunded unless the railways can prove that no loss has been sustained by reason of the delay . The fastest and most regular freight transportation in the world is that of England . Consignments of merchandise received at the freight stations in London up to 4 P.m. are delivered throughout the country by 9 o'clock the next morning . To give this kind of service it is necessary to haul very much smaller car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run many more trains in proportion , to have many more double track and four track lines over which to run them , and to charge the shippers very much higher rates . An engine can not pull as much at high speed as at low speed , and cars and trains can not be loaded as heavily on the average when they have to be forwarded on regular and frequent schedules as when they do not . It is a matter for serious consideration if American railways have not increased the capacity of their equipment unduly , and if the public is not pressing too hard its demands for low rates . Is not the sort of transportation efficiency the need for which our commerce will feel with increasing // force that consisting , not in relatively slow , infrequent , irregular and economical service , but in faster , more frequent and more regular service ? The former can be rendered at less cost to the railway and lower rates to the shipper . But it is not improbable that the difference in service is worth the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the amount of short haul traffic in the more valuable commodities increases in proportion to the long-haul traffic in the less valuable , we may conclude that a mean between the extremes of our present comparatively slow and economical freight service and the relatively fast and costly service of England is best adapted to our commercial needs . Under normal business conditions the traffic of the railways of the United States increases more than 100 per cent . in each decade . ' To keep pace with this wonderful growth it has been , and will continue to be , necessary for the roads to enlarge the capacity of their plants greatly and at a very rapid rate . The increases in facilities , and in the efficiency with which they were operated , did not keep up with the growth of traffic between 1897 and 1907 . In consequence our transportation system broke down . The farmer was unable to ship // his wheat and saw it rot on the ground ; the man-ufacturer could not bring raw material to his plant or send finished goods from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freezing ? because means were not available for moving the country 's commerce . The volume of freight traffic decreased after the panic of 1907 . Just about that time the many cars and engines of large capacity which the railways had bought when it was growing so fast , the many new sid-ings that they had built , and the enlargements of yards and terminals that they had made became available . They have , therefore , been able since then to handle their business ? including that of 1910 , which exceeded in volume that even of 1907 ? without the costly trouble and delays of 1906 and 1907 . But when prosperous conditions return commerce will again grow as it did before 1907 ; and new railways will have to be built ; much more equipment will have to be bought ; and the mile-age of second , third , and fourth track , and of sid-ings , yards , and terminals , will have to be rapidly and largely increased . The greatest , most neces-sary and most expensive task of all will be the providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate runs from $100,000 to $1 , - 000,000 an acre . One has but to realize that the railway managers of the United States must make both their passenger and freight service faster and more regular and dependable , and at the same // time provide adequate facilities for satisfactorily handling so swiftly augmenting a traffic , to form some notion of the big task before them . To do that task satisfactorily they must not merely improve railway operation in the United States ; they must revolutionize it . While our railway service has a great many needs , the greatest is that for increased safety . As I have already said , during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1911 , 10,396 persons were killed and 150,159 were injured on the railways of the United States . Nor is that record , dark as it is , the blackest . In 1907 the number killed was 11,839 , and the number injured 111,016 . These figures tell their terrible and pitiful story in terms needing no emphasis . There is a common impression that not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been steadily growing worse in proportion to the number of employees and to the amount of traffic handled . This , at least , is not true . Between 1900 and 1910 the passengers killed , per 1,000,000,000 passengers carried one mile , decreased from 15.56 to 13.03 , or 17 per cent. , and the employees killed , per 10,000 employees , decreased from 25.07 to 19.9 , or 21 per cent . These figures indicate an improvement . Comparisons of figures for one year with those for another , however , seldom throw satisfactory light on the extent to which changes are taking place in railway affairs . Comparisons of period with period are much more apt 166 to be profitable . Taking the most recent statistics of the Interstate Commerce Commission regarding accidents , ' we find that in the four-year period ending June 30 , 1907 , the number of passengers killed was 2,002 and in the four-year period ending June 30 , 1911 , it was 1,513 , a reduction of 25 per cent . Similarly , in the former period the number of employees killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction of 18 per cent . The Commission 's statistics show a larger proportionate increase in injuries than in fatalities since both ten and twenty years ago ; but this is rather because a proportionately larger number of injuries is reported now than that a proportionately larger number occurs . There is , however , no room for question that the accident record of our railways is still very bad . It is the worst made by the railways of any first-class country . But candid analysis of the facts is prerequisite to understanding of them or intelligent suggestion of remedies ; and while they are the subject of much denunciation , they are the subject of very little discriminating analysis . The following table gives the total railway accidents in the United States in the year ending June 30 , 1911 , as reported by the Interstate Commerce Commission : THE AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION QUESTION The significant column in the table is that headed " killed . " An injury may mean the loss of a leg , or merely the bruising of a thumb . Whether it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person making the report as to what really is an injury ; the criterion usually applied in the case of employees is whether thE . employee is disabled for work for three days out of the ten immediately following the accident . On the other hand , a fatality is a constant quan tity and therefore is sure to be reported . In our analysis we shall , consequently , confine ourselves to the statistics for persons who were killed . It will be seen that 51 per cent . of those killed in all accidents were reported by the Interstate Commerce Commission as " trespassers . " As the Commission says , they were persons who were stealing rides on trains or walking on railway tracks . These unlawful intruders on the property of railways usually make more than one-half of the number killed . On the average fourteen tres passers are killed on the railways of the United // States every day in the year . In European countries trespassers are arrested and fined or imprisoned , both to protect the roads and in the interest of public safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States the public is chiefly responsible . As individuals it has persisted in using railway tracks as highways , despite the fact that this is obviously hazardous ; and in its collective capacity it has persistently refused to pass and enforce laws to stop trespassing , although this is the only way it can be done . It is a stigma on the American public that it has denounced and attacked every abuse for which the railway managers have been responsible , but has refused to do anything to stop this great evil of trespassing , for which it is responsible . The streets of Jerusalem are said to have been kept clean by each man sweeping before his own door . The American people in their dealings with railways might well follow this venerable example . It is a common impression that most of the persons who are killed in railway accidents are passengers , and that most passengers are killed in true train accidents , such as collisions and derailments . The table shows that only 356 , or but 3.4 per cent . of the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 , - 000,000 passengers an average of about 33 miles . This is equivalent to hauling every inhabitant of the country about 350 miles . The total number of // passengers killed in collision and derailments in 1911 was 141 , or only 1.3 per cent . of the total per-sons killed in all accidents , and but 2.6 per cent . as many as the number of trespassers killed . One hundred and thirty-one passengers were killed while getting on or off trains , locomotives or cars , or by falling from them . Thirty-nine were killed by being struck or run over by engines or cars at stations or yards . The deaths of the rest were due to miscellaneous causes . Only 142 of the total of 356 were killed in true train accidents . About 33 , 000 , 000 , 000 passengers were carried one mile in 1911 . Therefore , the average passen-ger could travel 60 miles an hour for 216 years , or around the earth 4,584 times , without meeting with a fatal train accident . On this showing , the perils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as newspaper accounts of accidents would indicate . About 30 per cent . of the fatalities on railways are suffered by employees . The total number of them killed in 1911 was 3,602 . Of these , 209 were killed while coupling and uncoupling cars , in spite of the fact that 99.3 per cent . of the locomotives and cars in service have been , at heavy expense , equipped with automatic couplers . One thousand four hundred and twenty-nine were killed by be-ing struck or run over by engines or cars , which , of course , were being operated by their fellow em-ployees . One hundred and ninety-seven were killed while getting on or off cars or engines . // Three hundred and ninety-one were killed by falling from trains , locomotives or cars . The deaths of 439 , and the injuries to 79,237 , or a majority of the total number injured , were due to " industrial accidents , " resulting from the handling of tools , machinery , supplies , etc. , getting on or off locomotives and cars while at rest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trains . The foregoing figures account for over 70 per cent . of the fatalities to employees . The total number whose deaths resulted from collisions and derailments , from locomotives and cars breaking down , etc. ? in other words , from true train accidents ? was 633 , or but 17 per cent . of the total . The number of persons killed at highway grade crossings was 992 , of whom 124 were described by the Interstate Commerce Commission as " trespassers . " The injuries and fatalities , aside from those to trespassers , are due to three general causes : ( 1 ) Shortcomings of railway operating rules and methods ; ( 2 ) defects of railway plants ; ( 3 ) lack of proper discipline , manifested by failure of employees to obey the rules of the companies and the orders of their superiors . Probably the smallest number is owing to the first-mentioned cause . The American Railway Association has developed a code of operating rules which , if employees would obey them , would make most accidents impossible . There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The block-signaling rules , for example , are not as nearly uniform as they should be . Trainmen often go from the employ of one road to that of another ; and owing to this lack of uniformity , and consequent mistakes on their part , accidents sometimes result . There are places where as many as three railways are operating under trackage rights over the same track under three different sets of rules . The danger of this is plain . Sometimes , too , the companies have good enough rules but impose requirements for the movement of trains that make it very difficult for employees at once to meet these requirements and obey the rules . Again , many accidents are due to defects of railway plants . The Master Car Builders ' Association , by years of intelligent and earnest work , developed an excellent set of standard safety appliances for cars , but a good many individual roads , for one reason or another , refused to equip their cars according to one or more of these standards . The result was the passage in 1910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specify the standards to be used . Similarly , every one knows that the only way to stop accidents at highway crossings is to protect them with watchmen , gates or electric bells , or , better still , especially where the traffic is dense , entirely to eliminate the crossings by separating the grades ; but the railways are slow to do these things voluntarily . The block signal system ? i.e. , // the system of maintaining in one way or another a space interval between trains ? is the best means yet devised to prevent collisions , and block signals ought rapidly to be installed on every railway ; but while the total mileage operated in the United States is about 240,000 miles , the mileage operated with block signal protection on January 1 , 1911 , was only about 72,000 miles , or about 30 per cent . of the total . Of this , about 18,000 miles was automatic and about 54,000 miles non-automatic . We shall never have safe transportation until all these and numerous other shortcomings of the operating rules , methods and plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and rules of operation will not alone make transportation safe . Failures of the human element cause most accidents ; and you can not abolish the human element in railway operation , nor prevent its failure from causing accidents , with any number of automatic devices . There is a vein of recklessness in Americans ; we chafe under restraint ; we like to " take a chance . " This leads many employees to disregard rules and orders , and " take a chance " with the limbs and lives of others , as well as with their own . To check this tendency several railways have made use of " surprise signal tests " ; that is , one or more officers go out on the line and set signals against the enginemen and note the vigilance with which they observe them and the // promptitude and strictness with which they obey them . The result usually has been to cause much stricter obedience and increased safety . Unfortunately , however , while discipline is as essential to safe operation on a railway as to vic-torious fighting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American railways . The brotherhoods of train employees are the strongest labor unions in the world . They are composed of the most intelligent and best paid workingmen in the world . In many ways they are the best labor unions in the world . But , unfortunately , they have not heretofore exerted themselves to promote the efficiency and safety of railway operation . Indeed , their influence has been in the opposite direction . They have insisted on the rule of sen-iority in promotion , the effect of which is to put the oldest employees in the most responsible places in the service , whereas the public welfare requires , in the interest both of efficiency and of safety , that the most competent shall be given such posi-tions ; and it does not follow in any trade , business or profession that the most experienced will be the most competent . The brotherhoods have been very successful in getting ever higher wages for their members , and I , for one , would be glad of it if only their influence tended to increase the quan-tity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , they have made concerted and successful efforts to get legislation requiring rail- // ways to install safety appliances , to increase the number of men in train crews , to limit the hours of labor ; but they have made no concerted efforts to get their members to so act as to increase the safety of transportation . On the contrary , when an employee has committed a violation of rules or orders that has , or might have , caused an accident , and the railway superintendent tries to administer exemplary punishment , he is sure to be waited on by a committee from the man 's brotherhood who will , if needful , carry his case to the highest officers of the road ; and over and over , because either tacitly or by express words a strike is threatened , the management weakly yields , although it knows that thereby discipline will be impaired . Repeatedly strikes have been not only threatened , but declared , to protect men whose indefensible conduct has endangered the limbs and lives of hundreds ; and usually a misguided public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management which was acting in the public interest . To educate the public about the true causes of accidents the operating departments of the Union Pacific System and the Southern Pacific Company ? the " Harriman Lines " ? have adopted the policy , when an accident occurs , of impanelling a board of inquiry , composed of their division officers and representative citizens ? local newspaper men being preferred  --  of having this board make a searching investigation of the cause of the acci- // dent , and of then giving widespread publicity , on bulletin boards at stations , shops , etc. , and through the press , to the facts disclosed and the identity of those at fault , whether officers or employees . This is adapted both to educate public sentiment , and to cause employees , because of fear of disclosure of their misconduct and public condemnation of it , to be more careful . The Chicago &; North-Western , for the purpose of removing the causes of accidents , has organized " Committees of Safety " on every division , composed of both officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line at frequent intervals and investigate both the condition of the railway plants and the conduct of employees . This is bringing about needful cooperation between management and men which must have wholesome results . No one who investigates the subject of railway accidents , intelligently and without bias , can reach any conclusion but that cooperation between the public , railway managements and railway employees is essential to their reduction . The public should first perform its duty of passing and enforcing laws against trespassing . It should allow the railways to earn enough money to make needed improvements in their plants and should then compel them to make them . And , it should hold railway employees to a stricter accountability for the performance of their duty . // The railway owes special duties to the public because it is a public service corporation . It is not merely the superintendents , the general managers , the presidents and other officers who assume a part of this duty when they enter the service ; every employee , from the conductors and locomotive engineers to the track laborers , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become morally , although not legally , just as truly " public service " institutions as the railway corporations . They have no more moral right to cause a cessation of the railway 's public service by striking than the management has by locking them out ; they have no more moral right to make the railway 's service unduly expensive by insisting on unreasonable conditions of employment or excessive wages than the management has by charging excessive rates ; and it is just as much their duty as that of the management to do all they can to make transportation safe and to refrain from doing anything that will make it unsafe . The railway brotherhoods have become a powerful imperium in imperio ; and the public will not be as economically , efficiently and safely served as it ought to be until it clearly recognizes the duty of the brotherhoods to it , and makes them recognize that duty and strictly live up to it . CHAPTER IX RAILWAYS AND INLAND WATERWAYS : COSTS OF RAIL AND WATER TRANSPORTATION WATERWAY routes may be roughly divided into two classes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transportation between coun tries or parts of countries entirely , or almost en tirely , separated by the sea ; and ( 2 ) coastwise and inland routes , which may be used alternatively with railways . ' The railways are naturally con nections , rather than competitors , of the transoce anic routes . While they are often connections , they are more commonly competitors , of the coast-wise and inland water routes . ' The transoceanic // routes being the only means for handling most of our foreign commerce , it follows that if we desire that commerce handled satisfactorily we have no choice but adequately to develop our harbors and otherwise give necessary encouragement to transoceanic traffic . Coastwise and inland water routes , being alternative and competitive with railways , it is an important question of public policy to what extent the public , to secure good and ample facilities for transportation between the different parts of the United States , should give encouragement to the development of coastwise and inland water i 79
