txt With one automobile show in full swing , and another but a few days distant , there is timeliness in the publication by the Department of Commerce of several Consular reports on trade openings for the export of American-made motors . It is within easy recollection when the idea would have been an absurdity , but it Is already as little absurd to ask who uses an American motor car as to ask who reads an American book . The answer depends as much on the judgment of the man who wants the book or the car as on the excellence of the article wanted . That time is past . Americans going abroad now prefer their own country'a product for foreign use . This Is the best advertisement they could have . It is a natural complement that foreign cars are less in demand for home use . They are still wanted for a certain quality of trade and use , but there Is an immensely larger trade which can not supply its needs equally well from foreign makes . We excel in this trade exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' in the standardization of manufacture and large-scale production . We have not displaced the highest grade of hand-made watches , but we have made our teachers In the art wonder at the facility and cheapness with which we produce very excellent timekeepers at prices which put them into the ' lockets of those who could never hope to have a watch rthttle otherwise . We have done the same thing for the motor trade . Price- and quality considered , our care " can not be beat " If there are better foreign cars they may not be worth the higher price . It not be long before these facts make their way ' - wherever our cars are seen in performance . Therefore it is well for these eonternplating a foreign.trade  --  if ever they get ahead of their home demand  --  to - know that in all Scotland ' there are only two factories making complete cars , . and they are small concerns . Russia offers a good opening ; and in all Russia there is but one American seeking custom , although there is not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few machines are made to order to suit individual tastes . The machine ' for the many has yet to be introduced . But our pride should not outrun discretion . Our peculiar excellence lies in our methods . Our product can not unqualifiedly be said to be better , and our materials are certainly less good . The nature of automobile work is such that it demands materials kf exceptional fitness as well as superior quality . It Is useless to place the hardest metal where I toughness is wanted , and a metal may be both hard and tough and yet fail in qualities adapting it for easy and cheap manufacture . It may be an excellent metal , . and yet suffer from heat in manufacture or from jibration in use . In.these qualities . we are not hopelessly distanced , but we are far enough behind to put our chemists on notice that they must place themselves on a par with our mechanicians . We should still be modest , but we have a growing cause for pride         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
