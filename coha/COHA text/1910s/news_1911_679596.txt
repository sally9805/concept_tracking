txt Place for Negro Policemen . Your " Topic " entitled " The Negro as a Policeman " amply covers the questions on that point , and leaven us well equipped for observation of the experiment howsoever we may have felt disposed to view it . There is one thing , though , that occurs to me in this connection , which is , the utilization of the negro policeman where he may be most likely to prove his efficiency , where he may be given the fairest chance , In short . To that end I would suggest his employment In a. quarter of the city where his own race abounds , where he understands his people , and his people understand him . There he should figure as a power of peaceful control as he could do nowhere else , and where few white " coppers " can get on hopefully . We already have the " Italian Squad . " Why not the " Colored Squad , " and so on ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
