SESAME HOUSE in St. John 's Wood , London , is one of the most remarkable institutions in the Anglo-Saxon world . It is a training home for ideal childhood and ideal womanhood . It is under the administration of renowned workers who are the direct descendants by association from Pestalozzi and Froebel . In this child garden , set clown in the midst of one of the picturesque centers of the British capital , are being carried out the practical plans and the splendid dreams of the two great educators whose lives were consecrated to the development of child life along beautiful , normal lines . Annette Schepel , who twelve years ago organized the child garden at the request of the famous Sesame Club of London , ? a club which took its name and its splendid inspiration from Ruskin 's " Sesame and Lilies , " ? was the student and comrade of Henrietta Schrader , and that gifted woman was the niece , companion and student of Froebel . It was Annette Schepel who carried the great work for children down to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was there , under her active guidance , that Miss Emily Last , now the head of the Sesame House in London , perfected her training which was destined to enable her to give world-reaching scope to new standards of life and teaching . The readers can thus readily understand the spirit of the remarkable institution in St. John 's Wood . It brings to the young womanhood and to the childhood of England , and now to nations and dominions beyond the sea , not only the message of the great teacher of Zurich and his equally famous pupil who , in the old powder mill at Blankenburghe started the first kindergarten , but has been able to add to the gospel of natural education the modern progress of science along every path . Sesame House has adopted as one of its mottoes Froebel 's saying that " Simpler , far simpler than we think , is the foundation of humanity 's true welfare and happiness . We have all the means thereto , easy and near at hand , but we use them not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young women I saw at the first glimpse that the dreams of the two great teachers of Switzerland and their followers had been translated into vital reality . Young ladies who are both students and teachers , imparting what they had learned from highly and specially trained educators to eager little ones about them , were at work at spring planting in the garden . Sesame House receives thirty children a day without charge . The children have their own garden lupins and pansies , mustard trees and Virginian stock . They plant cress and radishes and pull up weeds , working with their teachers , carrying out the details outlined and super- intended for them by Helen Colt , a famous expert of the Royal Botanic Gardens , who got her original training herself in Sesame House . Thus , while horticultural science is developed along trench and furrow , the little people learn to live Froebel 's philosophy of sharing in the common service of the home . It was not a regular visiting day , and neither the girl students nor the children expected anyone to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not along dilettante botanical lines for the purpose of seeing a few blades shoot up to be dissected in a hunt for corollas , pistils and tetradynamous stamens ? they were planting things in furrows and in trenches , things to grow into beauty and utility . All the planting is for a purpose . What they sow at Sesame House gardens , they reap . They enjoy the fruits of their own industry . Everything is done in keeping with the highest teachings of science , including the final conversion of the garden yield into tempting dishes for the table . Grapevines , wistaria and creepers , planted by trained and loving hands , adorn the three buildings which now house the students , teachers and children . Twelve years ago the first children brought into Sesame House planted acorns , chestnuts and sycamores , which were soon transplanted from bottles and moss-filled bowls into the gardens , and other children today work and play in the park their little friends prepared for them . In the course at Sesame House there is no place at which one kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . It is the teaching of life and harmony and the highest happiness . Which some of the children were helping in the  | garden , not idly , as little ones are seen digging for imaginary purposes with tiny buckets , but working with a will and with intelligent forecast of results , other children were at little benches taking care of their live pets , ? for it was morning , ? washing out the canary 's cage , for example , while the bird took its bath . And some of the boys were cleaning the hutches of the rabbits while their sisters were feeding the turtle doves . Others were sprinkling and tending the growing window plants . There was nothing of the ordinary school with its gravity and stern laws of silence . One little child came running from one of the groups as I talked with Miss Last at the door . Something had convulsed her with laughter and she was trying to regain composure . " Oh ! " she lisped when she saw the woman who is the gifted director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing so much ! " Certainly a striking example of the freedom , the naturalness of the institution . We followed the child back into a classroom . No one could imagine a busier scene . Many of the little ones were so absorbed and delighted with their work that they did not even look up as we walked among them . Some of them were having instruction in the laws of light . These children , mind you , were five years old and were being instructed to observe nature and to enjoy the phenomena of beauty about them . Sunbeams were coming through the windows , and the children in this morning class were marking the outline of the reflection on the wall with chalk , to which outline was added the date and hour . Other children with blocks were working out problems in arithmetic , adding and subtracting and writing down in little books what they learned . Miss Last w anted me to see some of these completed record books . Instead of asking the teacher to get them she asked one of the smallest children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept . The tiny pupil said she knew and went forthwith to one of the shelves and brought me the books traced by infant hands . In the laundry building connected with Sesame House , girl students ( this was on  | dents and the children alike learn to love every form of beauty . From the institution they go back to perfect and beautify the homes from which they came . They go with the knowledge that life is beautiful and bountiful for the people who come under the influence of this school ; life is no longer sordid and a depressing struggle . It is an opportunity , an opportunity to be Wednesday ) were overhauling the place , washing benches and floors after the strenuous ironing of the day before . It was real work , not a picturesque pose for the camera . " If we give a girl or a child a broom to handle , " said Miss Last , " it is not for her merely to flourish it , but to sweep with it . " There is a green avenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central home set backward in the gardens . In the autumn days when the approach is covered with leaves , the children and students sweep and gather them up and compress them into heaps for conversion into mold to fertilize the soil in the following spring . At Sesame House they come in touch with reality . Human life and its relation to living things and laws is the theme , and m quickening all the one activities of the institution is the law of Love . The girl stuof service . What they do they do thoroughly ; and they do much ; and they are kind . For them nothing is jangled . The teachers who have created this institution do not look backward to a vanished Eden or forward to a promised land . They have beautified the living present . The chief aim of Sesame House is to prepare girls to be wives and mothers and to lend a new meaning of life for them . The proportion of girls who take the course to prepare themselves for occupations is very small . " Several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a group of happy young women in structing children in the child garden , " have recently become engaged z to be married . They learn not only how to do everything regarding children and the home , but to do it with sunny cheer . " And this statement of the director , who has devoted thirty years to the work of developing a practical ideal for contempo- rary womanhood , is borne out by the testimony of hundreds of graduates who have becomewives and mothers , and have put to the test the standards of the life bountiful . The aim of the institution is most comprehensive . It is nothing less than the complete preparation of the girl for the woman 's life . I told Miss Last , who has been in America , of the motto of one of the great colleges for women in the New World , which reads : " Not to be ministered unto , but to minister . " The Director was greatly interested . That is precisely the spirit of this institution in St. John 's Wood . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the world is that its students are not only prepared by lectures and books and beautiful associations for a practical role to be filled after the day of graduation , but are instructed in the profound ways of life from the beginning . Among the endowments of Sesame House and its splendid nursery , for example , are infants of ages ranging down to two weeks . They are the pride and the glory of the institution , and they have the constant , scientific , affectionate care which perhaps not even the children of kings have known . When I talked with Miss Gordon-Smith , who is in charge of Sesame House nursery , ? a beautiful , old-fashioned house where everything within is brought up to date , and where warmly clad and happy babies are cared for by young girls who are taking the course in this English " College of the New Life , " ? she told me she had just received a letter from one of the alumnae who had married and was now enjoying the happiness of caring for her own baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me of the joy of her home life and saying that she wished that all her young women friends could take a course in Sesame House and learn the great laws of baby life and child life , and home-making , which were now making her days days of gladness . " And this thought has begun to spread in England . Young married women are applying for entrance into Sesame House and several are now enrolled among the student corps . International Influence The influence of Sesame House has begun to be world-wide . A Parsee lady came from far Bombay to study there . She has now gone back to India and established a Sesame House there ! An Indian gentleman has since been sent to London by the Madras Educational Board and is now arranging to introduce the Froebel plan of teaching , as perfected in London , in the public schools of India . An Englishwoman from Egypt has just completed a study of Sesame House teaching and is establishing an institution along the same lines in Cairo . Mlle. Monod and Mlle. Babut came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindergartens in the French capital . A young girl from Russia , graduated from this institution in St. John 's Wood , has established a child garden in connection with a school for German-Russian children near Riga . In Great Britain there have been a number of institutions which have taken their inspiration from Sesame House . In Edinburgh , following the example of the first child garden in that city , which was an outgrowth of the Sesame House in England , another has just been opened . And in Birmingham , the success of the first people 's kindergarten under the guidance of a  | graduate of the Sesame House , has resulted in the opening of two other establishments devoted to the same idea . The work at Sesame House in general begins with a morning course in the kitchen . Instruction there is under the teaching of a trained lady chef , and , like all other instruction at this institution , what is done is performed for practical ends . The dishes the girl students prepare under skilful guidance comprise the meals at the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were preparing lunch . The picturesqueness of the cooks in their college costumes , the cleanliness of the kitchen and the savory fragrance of dishes under way , make a picture for a Dickens to describe . One of the girls with a kitchen textbook before her and an experienced cook looking on , was preparing creamed sweetbreads . She looked up as I watched her and said : " We happen to have for the moment an invalid among us and these are for her . " Although the title given the girls at graduation , according to law , is that of Lady Nurse , the institution is in no sense a hospital . It is a center of training of healthy , happy children and girls , that they may give a splendid efficiency and radiance to homes . No girl less than eighteen years old is admitted for instruction . The training is planned for gentlewomen and girls having for a first object their own development , whether they wish afterward to use the knowledge and experience thus acquired in their own homes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining a livelihood as lady nurses to children , kindergartners or nursery governesses . The entire world is becoming interested in race improvement , as the international congress of eugenists held in London in July 1912 , attested . Their work is for the future . Their ambitious hope is to do for the human family ma . vets akin to those wrought in the vegetable world by Burbank in California and De Vries in Holland . Some of the Practical Courses But Sesame House has not waited ! Every branch of domestic work , every moment spent in the child garden , every lecture delivered , every outing and diversion ? all the work and play ? has the underlying principle that links it to Froebel 's idea of the unity of life . In the course in light , for example , the children are told of the speed of light and learn to compare that pace with the speed of sound . Then they are taught the position of the earth and planets ; the meaning of the ecliptic , of circles and degrees ; and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " night , the students dress in white , perform a masque in a darkened hall , in the center of which the Sun , represented by one holding a lighted globe-lamp , turns on its axis , while Earth and Moon , bearing the zodiacal signs of the months , perform their revolutions , showing actually and in turn the phases and eclipses.  | Later on , spring work in the garden leads to comparisons between the blossoming of bulbs and seeds ; the unfolding of buds and scales ; and then , to a study of the flowers and catkins of trees . The summer term begins with the celebration of May Day . A historical sketch of its parallels in former ages is given . During the year 's course practical instruction is imparted in every field of value to the home . Students are sent to do shopping . They go to the butcher 's and to the grocer 's and to the vegetable markets . They learn not only how to buy , but how to cut meats . They learn how to appraise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the accounts and pay the bills under competent auditing . They actually make butter at Sesame House . Here in the little dairy established for this course by the college , little children work . They fetch fresh milk every day , place it in bowls , and when the time comes these little ones skim the cream . They skim it daily for Sesame House tea , and once a week they help at the churning , and make the butter into pats . Also the little ones model the jugs and pans seen in the dairy . The young girl students , using the dairy experience for other purposes , prepare tables of the structure and habit : of the cow as a typical ru minant , and compare these studies , in the biological course , with the records of other mammals . The practical spirit , beaut lied by idealism , runs throng out the motive of Sesame House as it does at the club which created it . The debates held in this famous club 's drawing-room in Dover Street , for example , disclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of supreme importance to womanhood . Last year an evening was devoted to discussion of the ' topic , " That most of us conduct our shopping on entirely wrong principles . " Yet the club , like Sesame House , also looks behind the veil of the visible and has devoted evenings to such topics as " That we live more by matter of fancy than by matter of fact . " Another debate was on the subject , " That a new aristocracy is needed , " and they listened to a lecture by the Reverend Canon Hensley Henson of Westminster Abbey , on " The Influence of the House of Lords on English Political Life . " Sesame House teaching , true to its inspiration from the club , has a catholic outlook upon all life . It sees in the primrose by the water 's brim all that Wordsworth saw , and sees in clover and cornstalks even more than the ordinary farmer sees , for the students , under scientific guidance , study ultimate food values of products . If one will picture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the daily life of women and affect the significant privileges of motherhood , and , considering this , will picture a Yuletide spirit carried throughout the whole college course , some proper conception can be gained of the far-reaching practicality and ideals merged at this truly wonderful Sesame House . The Christmas holidays themselves are  | the highest embodiment of the life beautiful . It is the children 's special season . It is then that the " birds ' Christmas tree , " planted in a tub by little ones , is carried into the garden . Branches of the evergreen are strung with cracked nuts in nets , and with ears of corn for the winter birds . This is the great event at Sesame House , eagerly looked for by the children as the year draws to a close . At every lesson and at every diversion , and at all the work of the home , everyone assists with common gladness . Nothing is done laggardly . Whether they are caring for tiny infants , preparing their food scientifically , learning and applying the laws that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting out and making costumes for the little ones , cleaning and caring for the house , making the environment of the child ideal , cultivating the garden or feeding the birds , the girls recognize , as they are taught , and as they in turn teach the children , that life in all its phases is divine : Sesame House students are putting into practice the philosophy which Plutarch and Quintilian prophesied would be the ultimate heritage of the race . The young girls have adopted as the motto governing their activities : " To love is to serve , " and they are led forward by Henrietta Schrader 's injunction to the womanhood of the world to " practise spiritual motherhood . " The course entitled " History of educational reformers " as given at Sesame House is in itself a stimulus . " It is , " said Miss Last , " a new thread on which to string old studies . We trace the early educational ideas of the Greek . We study the effect of Christianity on the Middle Ages , the training of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We explore the beauties and practical values in the teachings of Pestalozzi and Froebel and of Comenius , the gentle Moravian . And then this most remarkable course ends with a sketch of the rise of the elementary and public schools in Great Britain . " Nothing is too big , nothing too small , to escape the searching instruction at this institution . From the earth 's elliptic to the earwigs and the ' beetle-grubs in the garden , the course which the happy children and the young women at Sesame House take touches life and law in all its forms . The life of birds and their nesting is studied with eagerness and love . An old robin 's nest built in a small canister in the garden is a heritage that has come from the first year of the establishment of the school . Wood-pigeons now nest in the trees under which children and girls work and play . A gray squirrel , recently set free with others from the Zoological Gardens , has found its way to the Sesame Garden . In the eleventh year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds . These are unusual visitants in a London garden , for St. John 's Wood , despite its alluring name , is not wooded and is in a solidly built section of the city . But Sesame Garden , in which love and laughter , progressive science and the sweetest feminism have found their way , is a little park in the midst of the busy section . It is a corner in the modern kingdom of happiness . It is an Arcady of earnest but merry children and maidens busy at the Tree of Life ! Their eyes and minds are opened to every beauty that art can find and every law that science can attest .  | The spirit of Sesame House is attuned to every cadence in the melody of being , and , above all , it is attuned to the harmonies that come from choirs invisible . England , past or present , can not point to a nobler institution than the " Garden of Love and Learning " in St. John 's Wood . p 300         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
