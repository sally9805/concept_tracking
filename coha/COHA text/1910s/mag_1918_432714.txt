WE were not always with the Tanks . We came from the infantry , from the cavalry , from the artillery , from the Machine-Gun Corps , the Motor-Machine guns , the Flying Corps , the Army Service Corps , and even from the navy . We came at first in the varied uniforms of our various regiments , and a motley crowd we were ? the British infantryman in his turned-over trousers , the Scotsman in his kilt , the artillery boys in riding breeches and jaunty bandoliers , and he of the senior service in regulation navy blue . Some of us came with the mud of the trenches on our boots and the stains of war on our clothing ; others , who had not been overseas , were More presentable in clean khaki . We were not always known as the Tanks . At first , a great deal of secrecy was thrown about us , and we were called the Heavy Branch , Machine-Gun Corps , wearing the crossed-machine-gun insignia of that service . Later , in the summer of 1917 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our own account , we became the Tank Corps , and the insignia was changed to a tank surrounded by laurel leaves , surmounted by a crown . By that time we had grown , and four original companies had become many battalions , the first handful of tanks had been multiplied and were legion , and we had established a depot in France in addition to degas in England , schools for gunnery and for driving , great workshops and stores behind the line , and advanced workshops and stores near the line . Also , we had taken part in many battles , and done a little toward winning some of them , perhaps , learning how most effectively to use our new engine of war , and improving upon so much that , when the enemy used tanks against us , we were able to outdistance and outmanoeuvre his machines to his very great astonishment and dismay . The spirit of adventure called /nest of us to the Tanks . This was not because we were any braver than our comrades-in-arms , but because our natures demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind whose natures always demanded a change . And so the call for volunteers found us ready , and when the word of acceptance came , our hearts beat quickly and our hopes rose high ; for we were tired of the monotony of the trenches and the monotony of the guns . And yet , when we came together , we wondered why many of us were there ; for while some of us were selected because we were machine-gunners , and others because we were motor-drivers , there were many of us to whom the machine-gun and the motor were incomprehensible things . But in the end we did not find this lack of knowledge any handicap ; for the army authorities , who were wiser than we , knew that to men of average intelligence and education these things were easy to learn ; and to our very great amazement , we found t hat a week was all that was necessary I horoughly to master any machine-gun and to qualify with it at the range , and t hat two weeks were all that was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of the tank . All that , however , was only the preliminary training , and there followed weeks and often months of instruction and of drill until we became letter-perfect . In those later weeks , of course , some of us fell by the wayside and were returned to the infantry or the cavalry or the guns . There were times when the spirit of adventure within us received a severe jolt . That was when we had to haul about cases of petrol , drums of oil , and tins of grease ; for with every move ? and we were constantly moving ? it was necessary to form a dump ' of such things as were necessary for the beast to move and have its being ; and our minds will always turn back to nights of rain , and to roads of mud along which we struggled bitterly , bearing upon our shoulders or our backs great loads , the petrol leaking from its tins against our heads and so into our eyes , the thick oil escaping from its drums and trickling down our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all what we expected , but it was most necessary . Later , when we converted obsolete tanks into supply-tanks , much of this work was done by them and it became so organized that supply-tanks brought petrol , oil , and grease up to us in action , or established dumps at certain designated points to which we turned back during the course of the battle , so that we could refill , return , and carry on . Thus the beast of prey did not alto- gether lose its usefulness with old age . but became a beast of burden and , as such , took no small part in making the fighting tank an efficient and formidable weapon . Not all tanks were to survive for this service , however , for many went into action never to return ; others sank from view in the Flanders mud , and our men dug down to them and converted them into bomb-proofs ; and six of the first ever to be used lie along the Arras-Albert highroad , some on their sides , some on their backs , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them broken and black with rust ; for time and battle have shown them little mercy and left them merely unattractive hulks on the high tide of the German trenches . Our first impression of the tank was one of disappointment . So much had been printed , after their first appearance in battle , of their freakish appearance and their great size , that we expected something far more strange in design , more monstrous , more dragon-like , and twice as big . However , when we came to go into action with them and to see some of them lurch clumsily when they were struck by armor-piercing shells , we inclined to the belief that they were quite large enough , and we even came to cherish a secret feeling that it would be much nicer and more comfortable and safer and healthier all round , if the tank could be made smaller and less conspicuous . Later it was made smaller ; but the small tank was for special work and the large tank remained as large as ever , although certain internal improvements made it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly difficult to hit they became , may be appreciated when it is known that the first time the improved tanks were used in battle , not one of them was lost . That action took place during the mer- cifully sheltering cover of the darkness of a morning in the early summer of 1918 ; and while sixty tanks were used , the German official statement gave the number as eight hundred ! We were disappointed , too , to find that the tank could not do all that we had heard it could do . We had quite expected to climb to the house-tops , or , failing that , to go right through houses , to uproot great trees , and to waddle through wide rivers . The newspapers had depicted the tanks doing all these things ; but we were to learn that roofs have a habit of giving way under the weight of 35 tons , which is the weight of a large tank , and that it was easier to go round houses than to go straight through them ; and we were to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , and that the rivers of France are so muddy in the bed , that to cross them , as indeed once we had to in action , it was necessary to lay down a causeway of barrels filled with cement . But , in spite of these early disappointments , there was much about the tank that satisfied the spirit of adventure , and there is not one of us who will ever forget his first ride ? the crawling in at the sides , the discovery that the height did not permit a man of medium stature to stand erect , the sudden starting of the engine , the roar of it all when the throttle opened , the jolt forward , and the sliding through the mud that followed , until at last we came to the ' jump ' which had been prepared . Then came the downward motion , which suddenly threw us off our feet and caused us to stretch trusting hands toward the nearest object ? usually , at first , a hot pipe through which . the water from the cylinder jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down , the throttle almost closed , the engine just ' ticking over , ' until at last the bottom was reached , and as the power was turned full on , the tank raised herself to the incline , like a ship rising on a wave , and we were all jolted the other way , only to clutch again frantically for things which were hot and burned , until at last , with a sm lag over the top , we regained level ground . And in that moment we discovered that the trenches and the mud and the rain and the shells and the daily curse of bully beef had not killed everything within , for there came to us a thrill of happiness in that we were to sail over stranger seas than man had ever crossed , and set out on a great adventure . And some of us were to do great deeds , and others were to do simple things ; some of us were to win great glory , and others of us were to crumple up against the engine or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were to learn that it is not life that matters , but the courage which one brings to life . ii One who volunteered for the Tanks waited for four months outside Lens before the call came . During all that time he did his turn in the trenches and his ' rests ' in a concrete dugout in Noulette Wood . And as the weeks passed and no word of his transfer came , he despaired of its ever being granted . Lens has since fallen into British hands , but when he was there , the enemy 's position was too strong to be captured by direct assault , although the fighting reached the outskirts of it and hiding man threw bomb at hiding man in the little yards and gardens where once children played . Also he heard that the French civil authorities had requested that the city be shelled as little as possible , because it was understood that the enemy was holding civilians there , women as well as men , and because it was sought to save Lens from the ruin and desolation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high ground that borders the Lens plain , to see the leafless , lifeless thing which was once the wood of Notre Dame de Lorette , the wreck and ruins which were once Souchez and Angres , and the fallen towers which were once the coal-mines of Lievin . And in those weeks while he waited for his transfer , it was to this high ground that he often walked on summer evenings and , standing where the wire is still black and the bones of those who died upon it could even then be disturbed by the trespasser , he would look out into the night upon the lights that went up from the line , as far as La Bassee and Armentieres . Once , after a visit to Chtsteau Noutette , of which part of the walls alone stand , and where a great German dud ' shell may yet be seen on the ground between the greenhouse and the artificial lake , he returned , to be told that the orderly sergeant had been looking for him . It 's about your transfer to the Tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten about that . And now it had come through ! With a queer feeling inside him , he looked at the men with whom he had shared so many hardships . That right ? ' he asked casually , as if it did not matter at all . Some one replied that he was to start in the morning ; so he turned to his kit and started packing that and buckling it together without a word , for he could not trust himself to speak . And he was engaged in that when the orderly sergeant came and told him what he already knew . In the morning , after shaking hands all round and wishing and being wished good luck , he paraded at the company office . He was given a movement order forHeadquarters , Tanks , and instructed to go to Noeux-les-Mines , the nearest railhead . You 'll have to march it , I 'm afraid , ' the captain said , ' because the road 's under shell-fire and closed to lorries . ' The soldier saluted and moved off . Across country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , on the shell-riven trees of which were nailed signs that read , DRIVE SLOWLY to avoid raising dust which attracts SHELL-FIRE In most cases , however , the last line had been altered by erasing the S , making it ' Hell-Fire , ' which was more appropriate and exact . There was little shelling of the road that morning , however , for it was under observation from the German ' sausages , ' and for that reason was void of transport and troops . Shells could be seen dropping in the general direction of Noeux-les-Mines , though , and the prospect was not quite pleasant . At times the soldier , in whose pocket was the paper which stated that he had been transferred to the Tanks for the good of the service and at his own request , ' unbuckled Isis equipment and , dropping it to the ground beside the road , flung himself there to rest and smoke , for the way was long and dusty and the day was Isot . But at last the great slag-heaps which surround Noeuxles-Mines came into view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there in ruins , the result of shelling or of bombs . Some shells were falling on the railhead as the soldier made his way toward the station . He was very dusty , very hungry , and very tired , and he wanted to wash , eat , and rest , for it was past noon and he had been marching since early morning . Arriving at the station , he reported to the Railway Transport Officer , more generally known as the R.T.O. ; for the army delights in being enigmatical and has its A.G. , its D.A.G. , its D.A.A.G. , its H.Q. , its B.H.Q. , its G.H.Q. , and , perhaps , its Deputy R.S.V.P. , until one 's head swims trying to make out who or what is meant . After examining the soldier 's movement order , the R.T.O. looked up and said that the train for that day had gone . Come here to-morrow morning at 10.25 , and report to me . For to-night , go to the Town Major , tell him I sent you , and he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III Each one of us who transferred in France came to the reinforcement and training am &; with a secret hope that he might be sent to Blighty for instruction . ( Blighty is the soldiers ' name for England . It is a corruption of the Indian word for home . ) But in the first five minutes at the clepOt , that hope disappeared , and we knew that we should not see Blighty except in the ordinary routine of leave and wounds . As leave is granted only about every fifteen months , and even wounds are frequently difficult to get , the prospect of going home was soon dispelled . In those days the dt ,  |p6t  was only in its infancy . It consisted of a score of tents for the men , and half a dozen small Armstrong huts for the officers . But each week it grew , and after we left and went to various battalions , it was moved elsewhere , and huts such as are used in the British camps were erected . On our arrival at the depot we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the sheep and the goats , as it turned out to be later , for the better pay fell to the drivers and the dirtier work to the gunners . We were all given the rank of gunner , however . This was a relief . In the infantry we had been privatee , but the term private soldier had ever been a source of mystery to us , for we had never discovered anything private in our lives to warrant the title . Even our private letters were not sealed , and had to be censored before they could be dispatched . Also , we were not permitted to have any private property ; for a soldier belongs , body , soul , and belongings , to the army , at least theoretically , for of course we did have private property . This consisted mostly of the photographs of our wives , our children , and our sweethearts . The rest was what we bought in the way of soap and polish ; for the one piece of soap and the single tin of blacking which the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to last through a campaign , be the soldier ever so economical in washing his body or in cleaning his boots ! Just what was the mode of procedure in selecting some men to be drivers and other men to be gunners , we never knew . Perhaps it was gauged by the size of one 's boots or the color of one 's eyes . At any rate , quite frequently a skilled motor-mechanic would be sent to the gunners ' company , while an expert machine-gunner , who knew nothing about internal-combustion engines , would find himself among the drivers . In the long run , however , it did not matter much , for each driver had to qualify as a gunner , and each gunner was given an elementary tank course and taught how to drive . The reasons for so complete a training were obvious . In case a tank was knocked out or developed serious engine-trouble , the entire crew could carry on in the trenches or the field with the guns ; whereas , if all the drivers were killed , any gunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy this dual instruction boded ill , for the soldier believes that the less you know , the better off you are . For instance , if you are a machine-gunner , a bomber , and a signaller , you will probably come in for more ' shows ' than if you are simply a rifleman ; wherefore a little knowledge is considered a dangerous thing . But later each one of us thanked his lucky stars that he was gunner and driver too ; for there came a time when we did have to carry on in the trenches or the field with the guns , and there came a time , too , when the drivers all went West , ' and the gunners had to bring back the tanks . With the rank of gunner we drew slightly higher pay . In the infantry our rate of pay had been one shilling a day , half of which we turned over toward the support of our dependents , the government supplementing the allowance . As the Tanks were classified as artillery , and the daily rate of pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drew this additional twopence halfpenny . Later , when the Tank Corps was established and pay in the army generally increased , we drew as much as two shillings and eightpence a day as first drivers , plus war-pay of a penny a day extra for each year we had been in the army ; and the government relieved us of compulsorily contributing to the support of our dependents and itself undertook their entire support , which , however , we were permitted to increase by voluntary contributions from our pay . The depOt was in a back area . The site was ideal , a valley with woods on either side , making it difficult to observe from the air . Not infrequently hostile aircraft sailed overhead as if in search of us ; but they failed to find us , for we were never subjected to aerial attack . The camp was in a large field . The field itself was used as a parade and sports ground . Along either side were two rows of tents in which the men were housed . At one end was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . The entire camp was surrounded by a hedge and poplar trees , so that little could be seen from the road which bordered the eastern side . Along the western side ran a double-track , wide-gauge railway , and a spur of this led into Central Workshops , less than a quarter of a mile away . In a sense , Central Workshops was a tank hospital , for it was there that tanks which had been damaged in action went for overhauling and repair , and there at any time one could see tanks with great wounds in their sides , and , searching among the heap of cartridges on the floor , find some button or shred of clothing which told only too clearly what had happened . Later we were to see much of Central Works , for it was here , too , that all new tanks arriving from England were first tested before being turned over to the men who were to take them into battle ; and it was upon flat cars moved into this siding that we were to drive our tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting line . It was to a tent on the side-lines that the new arrival was sent . If he was lucky , he found himself in one occupied mostly by cooks . The luck manifested itself after ' Lights Out , ' when tins of sardines and jam and pieces of bread and cheese would mysteriously appear and be passed around ; for while the army ration is sufficient , manna from the soldiers ' heaven , which is the cookhouse , is always welcome . And almost nightly this manna rained upon this tent , and from the beginning the new arrival got a portion , for soldiers always share . For the most part the men at the deptit were recruits from England sent out to reinforce battalions which had suffered losses in action . A few battalion men were there , though , and these could be distinguished by the colors on their shoulder-straps . In those days the battalions were designated by the letters of the alphabet : A Battalion , B Battalion , C Battalion , D Battalion , and so on , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , of C Battalion green , of D Battalion blue . Later , the lettering system was discontinued , ? why , we never knew , ? and A Battalion became the First Battalion , B the Second , C the Third , D the Fourth , and so on . At that time those of us who had only had instruction on tanks in England , and those of us who had never seen a tank , looked with awe upon these battalion men ; for most of them had seen action in the tanks , and many of them had been wounded , gone to hospital , and subsequently been dispatched to the depOt for return to their respective units . And because so much mystery attached to the tanks , we came to think that their risks had been greater than any we ourselves had run , and we often tried to get them to talk of it all ; but found them strangely silent . Later , we were to learn how ridiculous this sense of awe had been , for we in turn were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear people in the streets murmur hoarsely to each other , ' He 's with the Tanks , ' as if we were the pick of the army , undergoing greater hardships than anyone else . The officers at the depot were there under circumstances similar to our own . Some of them were battalion officers who had been wounded ; others were reinforcements sent from England , and others were officers who had transferred in France from as many different units as ourselves . Usually the routine of the day included physical training , squad-drill , gas-drill , machine-gun instruction , preliminary tank instruction , and fatigues . Fatigues were doing any odd job around the camp , from peeling potatoes for the cooks to unloading quartermasters ' stores . And , the day finally ended , there were still pickets and guards to be done in tum . The fire picket was a more or less informal affair which we did not mind ; but guard had to be mounted in full marching order , and so searching was the inspection that a spot of grease on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be confined to camp as well . Guard-mounting in steel hats some thirty miles behind the line seemed to us only a ceremonial instituted purposely to aggravate the soldier , and we groused a great deal about it until we heard the reason , which may or may not he the true one . It was said that , in the first few weeks after the depin was started , and when there was one tank there , guard was mounted in the usual manner , the men wearing the soft field-service cap . A sentry was posted at the tank , and that night , when the corporal of the guard marched the relief to that point , he fell over the prostrate body of the sentry . He picked him up and carried bins to the guard-house and later had him removed to a hospital , for he had been struck over the head with some blunt , weapon . Why or how he had been struck , he never knew , nor how long he had been unconscious ; but the affair was put down to espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when on guard . Color was lent to the theory of espionage by a later incident ; for through papers found on a man arrested in England the intelligence officers traced a German spy , and caught Ishii on that spur of the railway track leading to Central Workshops . It was while marching to the baths that many of us saw our first tank . For two days rain had been falling and the parade-ground was camouflaged by two inches of water and four inches of mud . Of the two the water was probably thicker than the mud ; so , because we could not do squad-drill , we were warned for the baths . These were shower-baths , two kilometres distant , but they were more like an anzemic fire-sprinkler system than anything else . They were housed in a dilapidated old barn , the roof of which leaked more water than came through the sprinklers . With towels over our left shoulders we were lined up and marched off , grousing a good deal , for it was still raining and the road was in a wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank appeared , moving along the road slowly , making less noise than we expected , for we were to learn that most of the noise is internal and little except the exhaust can be heard from without . We marched to the side of the road to let Behemoth pass , and in that moment forgot the mud and the rain , and laughed as it slid past , much as the infantry are said to have laughed on that summer morning which marked the beginning of the Battle of the Somme . But our merriment lasted only a moment , for a sharp order brought us to a realization that we were marching to attention ; so we set our faces and trudged on . It has been printed that the tanks were called Willies . ' We ourselves never used the name . At first they were known as landships , and II.M.L.S . Campania comes to mind . In those days all the tanks were named . There were Explorer and Explosive , for instance ; and when the Germans came to use tanks we found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first German tank-commanders called his tank Elfreda , probably after his sweetheart . But Elfreda turned out to be fickle and quickly deserted to our side , and we made much of her , for she was the first of her type to be captured . With us , however , names quickly fell into disfavor , and in the end were discontinued , and tanks fell to the military routine of carrying regimental numbers . In those early days a tank always to be relied upon to create inure than usual interest was one presented to the British army by a councilor of the Malay States . In front of the tank , on either side , was painted a large staring eye , such as may be seen on the bows of Chinese junks ; and the idea probably was the same , for the Chinese say , if a ship has not got eyes , how in the world can it possibly see to go ? To-day tanks are largely of four types : the male tank , the female tank , the gun-carrier ( or supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male and female tanks are of the heavy type , and are identical in size . They differ only in armament , for the male tank carries two large cannon and five machine-guns , whereas the female variety is armed with seven machine-guns , reversing the poet 's assertion that the female of the species is deadlier than the male . While male and female work together , and probably would have entered the Ark side by side had they existed in those days , they are used for entirely different work . Generally speaking , the male tank is used first to pass over barbed wire and flatten it , so that infantry may walk through , and then goes on to the more important work of destroying ' pill-boxes , ' ? machine-gun emplacements , ? so-called because of their appearance . It is for this work that the cannon are used and armor-piercing shells are fired , and not infrequently what remains of the emplacement is sat upon by the tank itself . That , however , is a dangerous undertaking , for the tank might be hoist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The female tank , moving in the wake of the male , passes over the wire in the same spot , effectively flattening it , and acts as mopper-up ' of the infantry , with the exception of those who come into direct observation of the male ; for while the male is pounding the ' pillboxes ' with her guns , the female is going across the enemy 's trenches and moving along the tops of them , firing her machine-guns at the infantry there . In shape male and female , as they are to-day , are identical with that first tank used at the Battle of the Somme . One attachment that was immediately discarded , however , was the trailer of wheels . These great wheels were used to assist in steering the tank , and were so devised that , when it went into a shell-hole or a trench , they could be lifted clear by internal mechanism . They were found to be of little value , however , and were discarded without delay . That was the first improvement , and later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manoeuvred so much better and went so much faster that , when those which had been captured from us were patched up and used against us , we found that we were able to run circles around them and defeat them at each encounter . Of all our tanks the least successful was the gun-carrier . This was of greater length than the fighting tank , and was designed to carry a piece of ordnance of large calibre into advanced positions , newly captured ; and the arrangement was such that the gun could either be fired from the tank or be dismounted and put on wheels . For some reason , however , this plan did not work out as well as was expected , and many of the gun-carrier tanks were used to bring up supplies , and as such did highly efficient work , more than making up for their early failure . Of all our tanks the ' whippet ' was the big surprise . This was a small tank , built for the purpose of pursuit on ground which could not be traversed by an armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much along the lines of the gun-carrier , succeeded in traversing ground which invariably ditched the bigger supply-tank . With the failure of the gun-carrier , we of the heavy fighting tanks came to the belief that to have the tracks ? or caterpillar tread ? pass completely round the hull was an essential to success ; for in the gun-carriers this was not done and they found difficulty in getting out of holes . But when the whippet , whose tracks , like those of the gun-carrier , did not pass completely round the hull , proved a success , we came to change our views and to lay the blame to incorrect balance . While whippets were first used in the early part of 1918 , it was not until the second defeat of the German army on the Marne and the Somme , that this type came to be generally known . The enemy 's forced retreat to the old Hindenburg line was an ideal condition for the whippet , and these little tanks , which have a greater speed than their bigger brothers and sisters , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear-guard machine-gun fighting which he attempted to put up . This they did so effectively that , in the late summer of that year , civilians seemed to talk in terms of whippets , not realizing that the preliminary work of the male and female tanks in flattening down wire , breaking pill-boxes , ' and causing the enemy to give up his lines of defense , was needed before the whippet 's effectiveness could be complete . These , then , were the tanks which our men took into action . In the beginning none of us knew anything about tanks . We had learned the engine and the mechanism , and had driven them over holes and trenches ; but battle conditions we found to be entirely different . And because this engine of war was new , our high command had to learn tank tactics ; and not before all of us had made many mistakes , did we learn how tanks should be handled and where they should be used . Those mistakes cost us dear , both in men and in tanks , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a valuable instrument , we quite understood that the confidence of the public had been shaken by our failures . How near the Tank Corps came to being abandoned , few persons know . Its fate was decided by one single engagement , and only a minor operation at that . At one point on our line there was a German position of seven machine-gun emplacements , or pill-boxes , ' which was forever causing trouble . It was planned to take that position , and the commander there was ordered to draw up a plan of attack and an estimate of casualties ; for in the British army no attack is made without an estimate of casualties , and if they are out of proportion to the zenith of success , the attack is never made . In this instance the number was placed between 400 and 500 . This figure the high command thought too high , and the tanks were asked if they could capture the position . Officers of our corps looked over the ground and examined aeroplane maps . Then they announced that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry would be used only to consolidate the ground won , the casualties would not be nearly so high as the first estimate . And so the attack was made , and the position was taken . The casualties were only seventeen and the Tank Corps was saved . We called them ' busses , ' and the name stuck . Landship ' was too long and too clumsy to last . Even ' tank ' did not stand the test of time , except officially in the army forms and the army correspondence . Always it was busses . To each bus a crew was assigned . The duties of the crew were to keep the mechanism and the guns in working order , and to take the tank into battle . With the large busses the crew consisted of one commissioned officer , one non-commissioned officer , and six men . In the case of the gun-carrier , when those busses were relegated to supply-work , only drivers were carried , as there were no guns . With the whippets the crew was not so numerous as with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were fewer guns to be operated . The general shape of the heavy British fighting tank is well known . The elevation is roughly that of a rhombus , with the two acute angles rounded off . The plan resembles somewhat the letter H , with a heavy cross-bar for the body , the sides of the letter representing the tracks . For the most part the tanks are made of armor-plating . In some places the armor is thicker than in others , but at the thickest it is not more than three eighths of an inch . This may seem ridiculously inadequate , but the armor is hardened by a process used for ships of the British navy . It is bullet-proof and bomb-proof , and shrapnel more often than not does no harm . Armor-piercing shells , however , are effective when direct hits are made . The Germans even use an armor-piercing shell weighing only one pound , and seem to deleted material on unresteieted view in all directions . Thus he can watch for ' targets , ' and , being in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He is so close to most of the gunners that he can communicate with them either by shouting or by making signs ; but so terrific is the noise of the engine that it would be utterly impossible for the non-commissioned officer and the driver to hear him , so speaking-tubes run from the conning tower to the driver 's cab . In action in a tank , heat is one of the great hardships , for it is so exhausting that the men frequently have to buck themselves up with restoratives , carried in the tank 's medicine bag . Usually , in the ordinary course of travel , or going up , men walk outside the tank , or ride on top , the driver alone being inside ; but in action all have to be inside , and the tank is shut up so that in broad daylight it is quite dark within . Observation for the driver and gunners is made possible by lookout ports , in which eight tiny holes are drilled . These holes are about this size , but set farther apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , observation is not so difficult as might be imagined . It is above these holes that the only padding in the tank is placed ; for , contrary to the general impression , tanks are not padded inside , nor are men strapped into seats . The gunners for the most part stand ; the two men forward are seated , and when the driver is about to take a severe drop or incline , he shouts back through the speaking-tube and the men hang on , bracing themselves against the engine or the guns . The padding over the lookout holes consists of a head-rest against which one presses the forehead in order to bring the eyes as close to the holes as possible . These lookout holes superseded periscopic prisms , which proved unsatisfactory . The prisms were made of glass about two inches thick ; but bullets striking this glass , while not breaking it , starred it so that observation became difficult if not quite impossible . To meet this , a steel reflector was tried out , but did not answer the purpose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation involves an unnatural straining of the neck , it is effective . While bullets do not penetrate the armor , but only ruffle it up a bit at the point where they are deflected , a great deal of bullet splash ' does come in . This is more annoying than serious , and after an action one could pick out any number of these tiny splinters from one 's face . So , as a means of protection against splash , ' face-armor was invented . This looks much like a bandit 's mask , with a steel-mesh chain hanging from it . The mask itself is of thin steel , with slits for the eyes , the whole padded for the face and adjustable to it . The greatest danger , however , whether in or out of action , is that of fire . Smoking inside a tank is forbidden . Usually smoking is not permitted within twenty yards of one . This is because of the great amount of petrol , or gasoline , carried , and because of the fumes . Thus an armor-piercing shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , but usually sets the machine on fire . When that happens , men have to escape as best they can , tumbling out of the doors , usually to be greeted by the enemy 's machine-gun fire . Often , however , so much damage was done by the shell itself , that only those nearest the doors ever escaped . The rest perished in the flames , and those who have ever had to go back to a tank and see their comrades burned almost beyond recognition , will bear testimony that death by fire was feared more than anything else . 848 THE EDUCATION OF WILLIAM II Such , then , is the tank . It came at a time when intense artillery barrages made the ground in front and behind the lines almost impossible to traverse . Thus the infantry was hampered in movement , and often reached the enemy 's barbed wire only to find that , while its form had been destroyed , it lay there as tangled and as dangerous as ever . Furthermore these barrages were enormously expensive , and one British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the most serious fault of the barrage , however , was the notice of attack which it gave the enemy . While an attack might be on a limited front and the barrage on an extended front , it was like sending a visiting card . So the Germans watched and prayed . Often they prayed for the attack to begin ; for after two or three days and nights of intense artillery and trench- mortar fire one longs to have it over and done with . The tank virtually abolished this method of attack . Artillery barrages were kept up even after the tanks were perfected , but frequently the element of surprise was attained by the use of tanks without a preliminary lire . And so , in the dark of the early morning , the tanks go over , male and female , ahead of all others , and they cross the enemy 's wire and flatten that , and then press on against his pill-boxes , ' leaving the infantry with their bombs to settle affairs in the dugouts . Often the artillery-assists the tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn breaks and visibility exists . That they put up smoke-barrage , and the tanks carry on with the assistance of these screens , smashing down defenses , mopping up personnel , and creating terror in the hearts of the enemy .
