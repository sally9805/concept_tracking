ALL day they loitered by the resting ships , Telling their beauties over , taking stock ; At night the verdict left my messmates ' lips , " The Wanderer is the finest ship in dock . " I had not seen her , but a friend , since drowned , Drew her , with painted ports , low , lovely , lean , Saying , " The Wanderer , clipper , outward bound , The loveIiest ship my eyes have ever seen " Perhaps to-morrow you will see her sail . She sails at sunrise " : but the morrow showed No Wanderer setting forth for me to hail ; Far down the stream men pointed where she rode , Rode the great trackway to the sea , dim , dim , Already gone before the stars were gone . I saw her at the sea-line 's smoky rim Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on . Soon even her masts were hidden in the haze Beyond the city ; she was on her course To trample billows for a hundred days : That afternoon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of east ; " Oh , fair for her , " we said , " to take her south . " And in our spirits , as the wind increased , We saw her there , beyond the river-mouth , Setting her side-lights in the wildering dark , To glint upon mad water , while the gale Roared like a battle , snapping like a shark , And drunken seamen struggled with the sail . While with sick hearts her mates put out of mind Their little children left astern , ashore , And the gale 's gathering made the darkness blind , Water and air one intermingled roar . Then we forgot her , for the fiddlers played , Dancing and singing held our merry crew , The old ship moaned a little as she swayed , It blew all night , oh , bitter hard it blew . I looked with them towards the dimness ; there Gleamed like a spirit striding out of night , A full-rigged ship unutterably fair , Her masts like trees in winter , frosty-bright . Foam trembled at her bows like wisps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not dreamed That work of man could be so beautiful , In its own presence and in what it seemed . " So , she is putting back again , " I said . " How white with frost her yards are on the fore . " One of the men about me answer made , " That is not frost , but all her sails are tore , So when a ship appeared among the haze , We thought , " The Wanderer back again " ; but no ; No Wanderer showed for many , many days , Her passing lights made other waters glow . But we would often think and talk of her , Tell newer hands her story , wondering , then , Upon what ocean she was Wanderer , Bound to what cities built by foreign men . And one by one our little conclave thinned , Passed into ships and sailed and so away , To drown in seine great roaring of the wind , Wanderers themselves , unhappy fortune 's prey . And Time went by me making memory dim , Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unreached ocean 's rim , Brightening the water where her breast was bared . And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships , Hoping to see her well-remembered form Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips Bright to her berth , the sovereign of the storm . I never did , and many years went by , Then , near a Southern port , one Christmas eve , I watched a gale go roaring through the sky , Raking the caldrons of the clouds upheave . Then the wrack tattered and the stars appeared , Millions of stars that seemed to speak in fire , A byre cock tried aloud that morning neared , The swinging wind-vane flashed upon the spire . And soon men looked upon a glittering earth , Intensely sparkling like a world new-horn ; Only to look was spiritual birth , So bright the raindrops ran along the thorn . So bright they were , that one could almost pass Beyond their twinkling to the source , and know The glory pushing in the blade of grass , That hidden soul which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not revealed , Unearthly meanings covered every tree , That wet grass grew in an immortal field , Those waters fed some never-wrinkled sea . The scarlet berries in the hedge stood out Like revelations but the tongue unknown ; Even in the brooks a joy was quick : the trout Rushed in a dumbness dumb to me alone . I had not walked that glittering world before , But up the bill a prompting came to me , " This line of upland runs along the shore : Beyond the hedgerow I shall see the sea . " And on the instant from beyond away That long familiar sound , a ship 's bell , broke The hush below me in the unseen bay . Old memories came : that inner prompting spoke . And bright above the hedge a seagull 's wings Flashed and were steady upon empty air . " A Power unseen , " I cried , " prepares these things ; " Those are her bells , the Wanderer is there . " So , hurrying to the hedge and looking down , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquil town , With lapsing waters glittering as they grew . And near me in the road the shipping swung , So stately and so still in such great peace That like to drooping crests their colors hung , Only their shadows trembled without cease . I did but glance upon those anchored ships , Even as my thought had told , I saw her plain ; Tense , like a supple athlete with lean hips , Swiftness at pause , the Wanderer come again Come as of old a queen , untouched by Time , Resting the beauty that no seas could tire , Sparkling , as though the midnight 's rain were rime , Like a man 's thought transfigured into fire . And as I looked , one of her men began To sing some simple tune of Christmas Day ; Among her crew the song spread , man to man , Until the singing rang across the bay ; And soon in other anchored ships the men Joined in the singing with clear throats , until The farm-boy heard it up the windy glen , Above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the lifted song ? Blind pieces in a mighty game we swing ; Life 's battle is a conquest for the strong ; The meaning shows in the defeated thing .
