txt For twenty-eight days Salvatore , the 3-year-old son of Ce.logero Buffs , an importer , has been missing from his father 's home , at Elizabeth and Broome Streets , almost within a stone 's throw of Police Headquarters . Many threatening telephone messages and letters have been received , but have not furnished the unhappy father and the Italian branch of the Detective Bureau sufficient clues to find those who are holding the child for the $10,000 asked for his return . This is far more than Buffa has in the world , so that he can only shrug his shoulders in despair and pray that the little boy may be brought back unharmed . Threats of what would happen to the boy if the money was not paid or if breath of what had befallen him should reach the police had kept the Buffas sick with fear . It took courage for them even to admit to Lieut . Vachris that the boy had been kidnapped at all , and the fear that some one Might know they had been to the police with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their work has been thorough , but so far without result Buffa has five children , of which Salvatore is the youngest . The fear that one of them might be kidnapped was always with the Buffas , and last Winter , shortly after the Christmas holidays , the mail brought Buffa short letters that threatened the death of Fred , the oldest boy , unless the father paid *5,000 . Buffa said nothing of the threats , but kept a. close watch on the children , forbidding them to wander from the doorstep and escorting the older ones to and from school . But nothing happened , and as the week slipped by the anxious watch relaxed , and the little ones wandered further and further from the house in their play . On May 4 Salvatore was sunning himself on the Broome Street doorstep , where Mrs , Buffa could see him as she moved about . the store . She glanced his way gyery few ? moments , for watchful- 1I ness had become a habit , when one time she looked and he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the house did not discover him . None of the neighbors could say where or how he had gone . Whether he wan-dered down the street and was picked up , or whether some one led him from I the doorstep , the father and niother can not tell . That night by mail -- came a letter that confirmed their worst fears . Salvatore had been stolen and would be returned alive only when $10,000 had been paid , over by Buffa . If it were not paid the child would be killed , the note said , and not only that , but Buffa 's place would be blown up . According to the elder Buffs boy it was a vivid threat carried in the letter ' which first asked for the $1.0,000 . In it the father was warned that his failure to pay the ransom would mean that little Salvatore would be sent back to him , cut into small pieces and preserved in vinegar . - They would send him back " pickled " was the way his brother put it . , There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of the wire has been an Italian in each case , using the Calabrian dialect that Buffa himself speaks , for Buffa is from the " toe of the boot . " Neighbors say that the letters have brought as evidence of their genuineness a little brown curl that the mother knew was Salvatore 's , a bit of the red gingham dress he wore the day he was sitting on the doorstep . and once , they say , a package was delivered by the post , containing the saint 's image which had been tied around Salvatore 's neck to shield him from evil . But if they are pressed ? " Yes , yes , ? he was lost . He walked too far one time and lost his way . He was away three days , five days , and then we found him on the street and brought him back , and now he is with my sister in the country . He is all right " If they say he was stolen , they lie .

" And what am I to do ? " he asks , helplessly . " r have not the money they ask . I have no money . " The trouble is that down in his neighborhood the people think that Baffa is not so poor as he says . The sign on the window of his establishment proclaims him an importer of wines and produce , and the store inside Is piled high with stock . " But it is all I have , " he explains , " it is nothing . I do business on credit and manage to get along . The neighbors , they may not think so , but I have no money . " Buffa believes that the people who have stolen his boy ar-A Calabrians , like himself , and he has suspicions as to who they are . When he is asked about this he shakes his head vigorously and retreats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , and that all this talk of kidnapping is neighborhood lying . Meanwhile , twenty-eight days have gone slowly by , and each visitor to the store , each arrival of the postman , each telephone message carries with it a nervous shock . The Buffas feel no confidence that the authorities can bring back a child stolen under such circumstances and by such men . They do not even know that the boy Is alive , and can only hope that some miracle will restore him to them .
