SIR ' The struggles of the people of California with their Constitution during the past year have been so notable as to be worthy of record in the Nation . In November , 1910 , the people voted on and adopted eight amendments to the Constitution aggregating about 4,400 words Eleven months later in October , 1911 , they voted on twenty-three amendments to the same Constitution , aggregating above 15 , - 000 words . The Constitution so amended was adopted in 1879 and was of the voluminous legislative sort , aggregating above 22,000 words The significance of these figures may be better appreciated if we recall that the entire Cbnstitution of the United States , without the amendments , amounts to about 4,000 words . Restated , in terms , of the Federal Constitution as a unit , California has by popular vote in less than a twelvemonth , in two elections and by thirty separate enactments , amended a Constitution five and one-half times as long as the Constitution of the United States by matter nearly five times as long . I submit that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California has probably captured another record But at least the endurance record remains to be contested for One of the amendments lust adopted contains 3,600 words , and three of them above 2,000 words each They range ? I had almost said from grave to gay  --  but at any rate from initiative , referendum , and recall , judges included , to woman suffrage and the prescription of a thirty-day compulsory recess for the Legislature , after the main grist of the bills has been introduced . The whole structure of the State has been vitally altered , and it would be interesting to know to what extent it represents the real intelligent will of the electorate Of course , there are obvious physical , if not intellectual , limitations on the effective digestion of such a mass of legislation by four hundred thousand electors . As an aid , the secretary of state , under authority of law , sbnt to each registered voter a broadside thirty-eight by twenty-five inches in size and a supplemental sheet nine and one-half by twelve and one-half inches , containing the proposed amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . These sheets were densely printed on both sides in nonpareil type Figures and specifications convey no idea of the repellent , not to say impossible , nature of this huge double-faced broadside , packed with scores of thousands of minute words as close together as the linotype could stick them . No doubt this was profitably referred to here and there , and without some such assistance the vote would have been a mere farce , but the writer has not yet discovered anybody who claims to have deciphered the entire sheet , nor is it conceivable that one voter in ten can by any possibility have read even the 15,300 words of the amendments themselves . As bearing upon the amount of intelligent volition which such law-making involves , it is important to note that but one of the thirty-one amendments submitted in the year , involving as they did , and as it may well be believed they would , the government of the State in almost every aspect , was defeated . Everything else that was proposed went , though by varying majori-ties - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable one toform some estimate , though not a very satisfactory one , of the extent to which a civic revolution represents deliberate public opinion . The total vote of the State for Governor at the election in November , 1910 , when the first eight amendments were adopted , was 385,713 . The vote at the recent election ranges from 246,487 down to 193,778 , or , say , from 64 to 50 per cent of the gubernatorial vote in the preceding November ; the average vote on all the amendments being about 54 per cent . of the standard That the vote would have fallen far below this but for the interest taken in the suffrage amendment is undoubted . But , as it is , 55 per cent of the people have , ' under circumstances of the utmost disadvantage and necessary unintelligence , passed a small volume of legislation on such other topics , besides the matter already mentioned , as weights and measures , city and county government , eminent domain , legal procedure , compensation for accidents , the civil service of the State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , justices of the peace , railway passes , clerks of courts , and exemptions from taxation . The woman suffrage amendment was carried by less than 11/2 per cent . of the less than 64 per cent of the electorate who voted on it . Some light is thrown upon the probable working of such wholesale popular legislation by the fact that , with the exception of one virtually non-contentious amendment ( as to appeals in criminal cases ) , the largest vote ( 77 per cent . of the total cast ' on it ) was given to the provision for the recall of all elective officers ( which includes judges ) ? a measure which , whatever one may think of its merits , would , I suppose , quite generally be adna.itted to be in an experimental stage . Evidently , in California there are other things besides the guns that have no doubts , or none worth mentioning There is some occasion for encouragement in the fact that one relatively unimportant but vicious amendment authorizing peace officers and members of the Railroad Commission to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of 6,000 in a vote of 206,000 , after having been denounced by the entire press and all the intelligent opinion of the State . While defeat is better than passage , its narrow escape from becoming fundamental law under even these circumstances is not calculated to exalt one 's confidence unduly in direct legislation by the multitude . HOWARD L. SMITH Palo Alta , Cal , November 27 THE SHERMAN LAW . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION ' SIR ? The editorial on " General Laws " in your issue of November 23 , commends the Sherman law for " its wide scope and careful use of legal terms " I am unable to reconcile this statement with the one quoted below from the Harvard Law Review for November Speaking of the two recent decisions of the Supreme Court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases , the writer , Mr. Robert L Raymond , says : These decisions , when they came , justified those who believed that the logic of facts was stronger than the logic either of theories or even of tolerably well-settled law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually changed existing law . Confronted by a crisis , the judges had to choose between intellectual consistency and the practical demands of a difficult situation In preferring the latter they merely obeyed -a characteristic trait of the English-speaking race What advantage , may I ask , is there in the " wide scope and careful use of legal terms , " if the law in which they are employed was not capable of being executed , was in fact an Impracticable law . The logic of events in the twenty years since the Sherman law was passed has so thoroughly demonstrated this truth that argument ought to be unnecessary . The conditions of modern industry were such that whenever and wherever unregulated competition became a destructive force , trade combinations in some form were sure to arise No statute could prevent them , for two of the strongest economic forces , cupidity and necessity , dictated them . Necessity knows no law , and where fear of failure in business is in conflict with fear of the law , the latter has but little effect on conduct What is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administrative act , which shall put into the hands of a commission , made up of able men who have had business experience , the proper regulation of all trade combinations If this is combined with a carefully drawn Federal franchise , for all who are engaged in interstate commerce , we shall have gone far towards settling the problem of " the Trust " ROBERT MATHEWS Rochester , N. Y December I. " A MODEST PROPOSAL . " TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR ' The methods of the spelling reformers remind one of Sandy , who , when his frayed buttonholes would no longer retain the buttons , removed the latter , and sewed on larger ones Will not the results in both cases prove equally desirable ? The point of the whole matter is this . there is a disCrepancy in the English language between spelling and pronunciation . Hitherto it has been taken for granted , so it seems , that the whole fault lies with the spelling Now it is certainly possible to regard the pronunciation as at least equally to blame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronunciation should be accommodated to the spelling ? Is it not as well established as any law of Gresham or Ricardo that , as regards permanence , pronunciation can not , be compared with written forms ? It is a truism that the spoken English of Shakespeare 's time would be unintelligible to modern ears ; whereas , the same printed page appeals to the eye now as then . Hence the logic of the lexicographer , who says . Much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions of oral utterance , or copy that which every variation of time or place makes different from itself , and imitate those changes , which will again be changed , while imitation is employed in observing them . . . . To change all would be too much , and to change one is nothing . If , then , there is a discrepancy , why may it not best be removed by modifying that element which admittedly is least resistant to change ? Those who have heard German savants pronounce Locke , after the analogy of Dante , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held up to us as a Mustersprache in the matter of phonetic spelling , but is it spelling or pronunciation which makes anade phonetic , and gnat unphonetic ? As a matter of fact , even the latest German spelling is far from being phonetic ; but , if the discrepancy is slighter than in English , it is due largely to the persistent tendency of the Teuton to pronounce what he sees If Germany has led the way in phonetic spelling , it must not be overlooked that even more emphasis has been placed upon uniform , grammatic pro nunciation This is for many reasons a primary desideratum , and , when attained , little will be heard about phonetic spelling ALBERT J R. SCHUMAKER Upland Lawn , Pa. , November 19 BARGAINS IN SICILY . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION ' SIR . The ruins of Messina are now being taken to pieces , and there is an opportunity to buy beautiful fragments of carving  --  columns , cornices , etc ? such as could be used with great effect in ' gardens and terraces These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new earthquake-proof cement structures . Also there are wood carvings The cost of transportation is , of course , great , but many beautiful bits are being irretrievably lost for lack of any one to take an interest in them . The contractors in Messina themselves deplore this , but lack the funds to find a market If any architects or dealers in America wish to find more definite particulars , I should be very happy to put them in connection with the people who have this work in charge MARY MOSS Villa Niclo , Taormina , Sicily , November 11 . JONATHAN EDWARDS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . The essay on Nietzsche ( Nation , September 21 and 28 ) called attention to the growth of the principle of sympathy in the eighteenth century " The man who effected this great ' evolution , partly by virtue of his own genius , and partly as spokesman of his time , was John Locke , whose ' Essay Concerning Human Understanding , ' pithlished in 1690 as the result of eighteen years of reflection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next century " It is quite striking that this same important book was the occasion of intellectual activity in the greatest thinker in America in the eighteenth century . Allen , in his life of Jonathan Edwards , says . The intellectual impulse came from the philosophy of Locke , whose " Essay on Human Understanding " Edwards read when he was but fourteen years old . The impression left on his mind was a deep and , in some respects , an abiding one . In his early years Edwards established all his theology on this principle of sympathy The results of this important thinking will be found in the " Notes on the Mind " He begins with the ' study of excellence , and comes to the conclusion that excellence , the highest good , is existence . In vain he tries to think of nothingness , and , in a very beautiful phrase , he speaks of nothing as " that which the sleeping rocks do drearii of . " The supreme law of existence is love : We are to conceive of the divine excellence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect purity and sweetness , ea it includes the true love of all creatures for that is His spirit , or , which is the same thing , His love . And if we take notice when we are in the best frames fined tat ng on the divine excellence , our ideal of that tranquillity and peace which seems to be overspread and cast abroad upon the whole earth and universe naturally dissolves itself into the idea of a general love and delight everywhere diffused Meditating on the divine excellence ! How that phrase rings with Platonism ! For it is quite familiar to all students of Jonathan Edwards , and the observation is impressively made by Allen , that Edwards , in his first years as a student , was a Platonist . To this early position on the principle of sympathy , he returned as a man of fifty in his essay on the " Nature of Virtue . " True virtue , he declares , is love for being in general The foundation of our existence is the infinite sympathy of God for man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God So in his last work and in his first , when he was removed from a stormy parish and a parochial controversy when he lived in quietude in New Haven and Stockbridge , he made central and positive in his thought , " the divine excellence , " " the love for being in general , " the principle of sympathy . WARREN S. ARCHIBALD . Pittsfield , Mass. , November 24 , DICKENS IN FRANCE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR French interest in Dickens is at present manifesting itself in two unexpected ways at Paris . " Pickwick " has been a daily attraction for some weeks at a moving-picture show , while an adaptation of " David Copperfield , " by Max Maurey , which has just been put on at the Odeon , appears to be the most promising of the newest productions of the legitimate theatre . The former is , of course , only one item of an evening 's programme , but the latter deserves consideration as a serious effort to adapt the novelist to the French stage It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , with surprising unanimity , accepts the new play as a faithful rendering of the matter and manner of Dickens , and prophesies for it a long and successful career There can be no doubt that the play makes a very direct and simple appeal to the audiences which have filled the Oddon Theatre since its first presentation . Most of these present must be entirely unacquainted with Dickens Their approbation was , therefore , called forth by the humor and pathos of the play itself , and not by any recollection of the novel . One naturally asks how adequately such a production represents in its new form and language the mind of the master who made it , and how faithfully it follows the work from which it professes to be taken . It is difficult for one not a Frenchman to know how things English look to French eyes , and still more difficult to know how far the spiritual vision of the one race corresponds to that of the other One thing is certain , however . the new version is not caricature . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered that a dramatization of the whole of the novel in one play of reasonable length is an impossibility . Maurey decided to deal only with David 's neglected boyhood . In doing so , he borrowed , however , incidents from later chapters of the novel , made an excursion into " Oliver Twist " for the fourth act , and inserted some details which , though possibly Diekensesque , are certainly not from Dickens David gives a certain unity to the whole which Justifies the title , but Micawber , in a desultory way quite in keeping with his desultory character , is actually the more prominent figure The acting was , of course , excellent , but was the Micawber of the Odeon the Micawber of Dickens ? The Paris newspapers found him true to life . Having seen the same actor very recently in two rfiles of Moli  --  re , I must confess to some doubts , but perhaps there is , after all , some resemblance between Moli  --  re and Dickens which has escaped the observation of most people heretofore .
