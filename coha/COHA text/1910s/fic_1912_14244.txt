SCENE : At rise of curtain the stage is dark with the exception of one light in the reception hall L. Off stage the wedding march from " Lohengrin " is being whistled off key , the inference being that the men are drunk . RANKIN , the man servant , comes on from R. , goes up to window C. , looks out , C.L. , then comes down L. and as he hears JACKSON coming in from L. he goes over C.R. of piano and stands until JACKSON sits at table L.C. JACKSON enters , staggering R. , goes up to window C. , waves his handkerchief to men outside , then comes down to L. of piano and turns on piano lamp . He sees a photograph on piano , picks it up , looks at it intently for a moment , and then puts it down and bows to it very solemnly . He then comes down and sits R. of table L.C. , and is just about to fall asleep when RANKIN comes forward from R. and taps him on the shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder ) Mr. Jones !

JACKSON JONES ( Faces him ) Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? When you were a little boy your mother had great hopes for you  --  thought you were going to be President of the United States . Now you see you 've disappointed everybody  --  you 've turned out to be nothing but a butler . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . RANKIN Ah , but see whose butler I am , sir .

( Waves his handkerchief at RANKIN and starts toward door R. , laughing and whistling . ) RANKIN ( When JACKSON gets to door ) When do you wish to be called , sir ? JACKSON JONES ( Turns toward RANKIN ) What 's that ? RANKIN I say , when do you wish to be called ? JACKSON JONES ( Leaning over settee R. ) Oh , that 's so , I must be called . RANKIN Yes , sir .

Bell rings off stage and RANKIN enters from R. , crosses stage and exits door L. to answer bell . Off stage . ) RANKIN ( Off stage ) Good morning , Mr. Wallace .

He opens paper , he carries and starts reading . ) RANKIN ( Has followed WALLACE and stands R.C. ) Shall I tell Mr. Jones you 're here ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Looking at paper ) Great Scott ! Here it is on the front page of this paper ! p. 6 RANKIN ( Turns to WALLACE ) I beg pardon , Mr. Wallace , but is it all true , sir ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Looks at RANKIN ) What ? RANKIN The story in the morning papers , sir , about  --  ( Points to room R. ) His  --  engagement ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Over to RANKIN R.C. ) I do n't know . That 's what I 'm here for , to find out if it is true . I was at the dinner party and stayed till 12:30 . The engagement was announced , I believe , shortly after I left .

I could n't quite understand why they kept whistling the Wedding March until I saw the morning papers . p. 7 ROBERT WALLACE Well , what do you think of it , Rankin ? ( As RANKIN shrugs his shoulers . ) Oh , come on , you can tell me  --  just between us . RANKIN ( Confidentially ) She 's old enough to be his mother , sir .

ROBERT WALLACE What do you think of it ? MRS . GERARD I 'm as happy as a little bird in a tree top . ( WALLACE laughs uproariously . MRS . GERARD looks at him in surprise and then in indignation . ) ROBERT WALLACE You 'll pardon me , Mrs. Gerard , but I was thinking of something funny . MRS . GERARD Something that just happened ? ROBERT WALLACE No , something that happened years ago . MRS . GERARD Oh , I see . For a moment I thought you were laughing at me . ROBERT WALLACE Oh , Mrs. Gerard , how could you ? MRS . GERARD I know I 'm horribly touchy in some respects . Mother always calls me a silly child . ROBERT WALLACE Your mother ! Is your mother still living ? MRS . GERARD Why , yes , of course . And what a mother ! What a wonderful mother ! Sixty-five . p. 11 ROBERT WALLACE Sixty-five children ? MRS . GERARD No , no , of course not !

That 's twenty long years ago . ROBERT WALLACE Do you mean to tell me that you 're  --  MRS . GERARD ' Ssh ! ( Puts her finger to her lips and looks around room . ) I do n't tell my age to everyone . ROBERT WALLACE I can readily understand that . MRS . GERARD How old are you , Mr. Wallace ? ROBERT WALLACE I 'll be twelve in October . MRS . GERARD Twelve ! ( Looks puzzled , then laughs . ) Oh , I see , you want me to add about twenty to that . p. 12 ROBERT WALLACE ( Gets up ) Yes , and add about thirty to your own . MRS . GERARD What ! ROBERT WALLACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect me to believe that  --   --  MRS . GERARD ( Gets up and crosses to settee R. ) How dare you , sir ! Do you know what you 're saying ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Follows her over to settee ) I know what I 'd like to say . MRS . GERARD About what ? ROBERT WALLACE About your engagement to young Mr. Jones . Why , you 're not taking this fellow seriously , are you ? MRS . GERARD What do you mean ? ROBERT WALLACE Just what I say , that it 's all wrong ; it 's laughable ! The idea of a woman of your age imagining for a minute that this boy is fool enough to mean such a thing ! Do you stop to think what people will say ? Do n't you realize that it ca n't be ? That it 's simply preposterous ? Why  --   --  MRS . GERARD Are you trying to insult me , sir ? ROBERT WALLACE No , I 'm trying to save you from being humiliated and laughed at . Deny the story at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say anything , but for heaven 's sake , do n't let it go any further . ( Walks away from her to L. , then back again . ) Surely , you do n't think he really intends to marry you ? p. 13 MRS . GERARD And why not ? ROBERT WALLACE Because it 's ridiculous . You 're a sensible woman . Give it serious thought . Why , you 're over twice his age . MRS . GERARD What ! ROBERT WALLACE Why , he 's only twenty-five . MRS . GERARD You 're a brute ! ( Flounces into settee angrily . ) ROBERT WALLACE I 'm your friend and I 'm trying to save you from being made the laughing stock of the town . MRS . GERARD Do you mean to insinuate that Jackson does n't love me ? ROBERT WALLACE Jackson love you ! Say , Jackson does n't love anything but a good time . Why , he does n't take anything seriously , especially women . To my knowledge he 's been engaged to thirty of them during the past two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . GERARD ( Follows WALLACE to L. ) I do n't believe you . ROBERT WALLACE Very well , go ahead . It 's no affair of mine . MRS . GERARD You 'll do well to attend to your own business , Mr. Wallace . ROBERT WALLACE Excuse me , I 'm sorry I spoke . p. 14 JACKSON JONES ( Is heard singing " I Love You , I Love you " off R. He enters , still singing , and goes to MRS . GERARD . ) Beatrice , my Beatrice ! MRS . GERARD ( As she runs over R. to him he takes her hand ) Jackson ! ( WALLACE sits at L. of table , looking thoroughly disgusted . ) JACKSON JONES Good morning , Bob . ( To MRS . GERARD ) And how is my little banquet queen this morning ? MRS . GERARD I came here happy as a lark , but now I 'm horribly upset . JACKSON JONES Why , what 's happened to my little round of pleasure ? ( Gesture of disgust from WALLACE . ) MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ( Nods in WALLACE 'S direction . ) JACKSON JONES ( Crosses to L. and stands R. of table ) Why , Bob , what have you been saying to little Beatrice ? ROBERT WALLACE Oh , do n't ! ( Turns from JACKSON , annoyed . ) JACKSON JONES ( Over R. to MRS . GERARD ) Tell me , what has he been saying to you ? p. 15 MRS . GERARD Called it a ridiculous match . Said I should n't take you seriously . Intimated that you did n't love me , and  --   --  JACKSON JONES ( Over to WALLACE ) You said these things ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes , and a great deal more . JACKSON JONES Bob Wallace , I 'm surprised ! Shame on you ! ROBERT WALLACE Oh , rats ! JACKSON JONES What the deuce do you mean ? ROBERT WALLACE Oh , cut it out , be sensible . JACKSON JONES Sensible ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes , a joke 's a joke , but you 're carrying this too far . Do you know that the whole town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . GERARD ( Tearfully ) See , there he goes again ! JACKSON JONES ( To WALLACE ) You mean the announcement of our engagement ? ROBERT WALLACE Of course that 's what I mean . If you think it 's funny , your sense of humor has got the better of you . You 're making a fool of yourself and one of Mrs. Gerard . MRS . GERARD How dare you , sir ! p. 16 JACKSON JONES ( Turns slightly toward MRS . GERARD ) Wait a minute . ROBERT WALLACE You see ? You 've got her believing it 's true , and pretty soon the whole town will be taking it just as seriously . ( Gets up and faces JACKSON across table . ) Jackson , if you do n't telephone the newspapers and deny this story at once , I 'll do it myself ! MRS . GERARD Jackson , are you going to stand there and allow this man to  --   --  JACKSON JONES ( Over to MRS . GERARD ) No , no , no ! ( Crosses to WALLACE standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Wallace ! I 'm over twenty-one years of age and can come pretty near handling my own affairs . Without any particular reason , you 've insulted this lady , and you 've insulted me . Now , sir , I demand an apology . ROBERT WALLACE Now , see here , Jackson , I  --   --  ( Grabs JACKSON by coat lapels . ) JACKSON JONES ( Pulling away impatiently ) Do n't do that ! Do n't do that ! You 've insulted my future wife and I want you to apologize ! ROBERT WALLACE ( Thunderstruck ) You mean to say you 're really going to be married ? p. 17 JACKSON JONES Of course we 're going to be married . MRS . GERARD Of course we 're going to be married . ROBERT WALLACE Very well , then , I apologize . JACKSON JONES ( Pointing to MRS . GERARD ) Not to me , to the lady . ROBERT WALLACE ( Hesitates , then crosses over to MRS . GERARD , JACKSON following ) Mrs. Gerard , I offer a thousand apologies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know that I can accept your apology . ROBERT WALLACE But , do n't you see , I thought it was all a joke . MRS . GERARD Why should you think such a thing ? Is it at all unusual that people in love should marry ? ROBERT WALLACE ( After a look between JACKSON and WALLACE , goes upstage L. ) Why , no , of course not , but I  --  I did n't understand . I  --   --  ( Rushes over to JACKSON , who is over L. , walking up and down , singing or humming snatches of Wedding March . ) Now , see here , Jackson , if you 're trying to fool me , I want to know . I  --   --  p. 18 MRS . GERARD There he goes again  --  another insult ! ROBERT WALLACE ( Turning to MRS . GERARD ) Really , Mrs. Gerard , I did n't mean it . MRS . GERARD Then what did you mean ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Over to MRS . GERARD R. ) Why , I  --  Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted to C. ) JACKSON JONES ( Crosses over R. to L. of WALLACE ) Well , I think I do . You 're still in doubt as to whether or not we 're really going to be married . Is n't that it ? MRS . GERARD ( Half tearfully ) But why should he imagine such a thing  --   --  JACKSON JONES ( To MRS . GERARD , trying to soothe her ) Sweetheart , dearie , please ! ( To WALLACE ) Come on now , tell the truth . ROBERT WALLACE Well , I will admit I did think at first that it was all a joke , but  --   --  JACKSON JONES And you 're not quite satisfied yet that it is n't ? ROBERT WALLACE Well , of course , if you say so , why  --  p. 19 JACKSON JONES Then I 'll put you right . It 's all true . We 're engaged . We 're going to be married and we expect to be very happy . Do you believe it now ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , certainly , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might I ask how long you 've been engaged ? MRS . GERARD We became engaged last night at dinner . JACKSON JONES That 's right , last night at dinner . It was during the ice cream . MRS . GERARD It all happened in a moment . JACKSON JONES It happened just like this  --  you see  --  ( Snaps his fingers . ) That 's just the way it happened . Only one question asked , " Will you marry me ? " and I said , " Yes . " MRS . GERARD What ! JACKSON JONES I mean she said yes . Beatrice said yes . MRS . GERARD We 're going to spend our honeymoon in Spain . ROBERT WALLACE Spain ! JACKSON JONES Yes , Spain . I 'm going out this afternoon to buy a tambourine . Dear old sunny Spain ! ( Executes a few Spanish dance steps , while singing . ) Congratulations ? p. 20 ROBERT WALLACE Now see here , Jackson , if you 're trying to fool me I want to know . MRS . GERARD There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here and be insulted in such a manner . ( Starts upstage , taking her wraps from piano as she passes it , and goes up to L. door , JACKSON following her . ) JACKSON JONES ( Up L.C. ) There , there , do n't lose your temper . Mr. Wallace thinks we 're fooling him . MRS . GERARD Why should he think such a thing ? JACKSON JONES ( To WALLACE , as the latter follows him upstage , expostulating ) Go away ! ( WALLACE comes down stage and sits on settee R.C. , disgusted and sore . ) JACKSON JONES ( To MRS . GERARD , near door L. ) Now you leave him to me and in five minutes I can convince him that it is absolutely true . MRS . GERARD ( Peeved  --  disappointed ) Then you wo n't come for a drive ? JACKSON JONES I tell you what you do  --  stop for me in , say , half an hour . p. 21 MRS . GERARD ( Brightens ) Very well , then I 'll run along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a dreadful headache . JACKSON JONES ( Looking at WALLACE on settee and shaking his head at him ) You should n't have done that , Bob , it was dead wrong . ( WALLACE shrugs his shoulders impatiently . ) MRS . GERARD ( At arch L.C. ) Bye , bye , dearie ! JACKSON JONES Bye , bye , sweetheart ! MRS . GERARD In half an hour . JACKSON JONES About that . MRS . GERARD Do n't you listen to that man . JACKSON JONES No , I 'm going to make him listen to me . MRS . GERARD Oh , you dear boy ! Bye , bye , dearie ! ( Exits upstage L. ) JACKSON JONES ( Goes to arch ) Bye , bye , sweetheart ! ( Stands looking out door L. , singing " Good-bye , Sweetheart , Good-bye " until WALLACE crosses C. stage and comes up and faces JACKSON at door L. , when the latter stops abruptly and comes shamefacedly down to R. of table L.C. ) p. 22 ROBERT WALLACE ( Coming down L. of table ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seriously ) Nothing of the kind . I 'm perfectly all right . ROBERT WALLACE ( Still unable to believe ) You mean to tell me  --   --  JACKSON JONES Sit down , sit down ! I 've got a whole lot to tell you . Sit down . ( WALLACE sits L. of table . JACKSON L. of C. Bell rings . RANKIN enters from R. and crosses to L. to answer bell . JACKSON calls to him as he gets near L. door . ) If it 's anyone for me , I 'm not at home . RANKIN ( Stops as JACKSON calls ) Yes , sir . ( Exits L. ) JACKSON JONES ( Across table , rubbing eyes , after RANKIN exits ) . Now , in the first place , I want you to thoroughly understand that I 'm positively serious about this whole affair , and nothing you can say will change my plans . Is that understood ? ROBERT WALLACE Well , go on . JACKSON JONES Mrs. Gerard and I are going to be married , and it 's going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , if you care to retain my friendship you must get used to it the same as I will have to do . Am I clear ? p. 23 ROBERT WALLACE ( Grimly ) Well , I 'm listening . JACKSON JONES I know several girls who will cry very bitterly  --   --  ( WALLACE gives a contemptuous grunt . ) And I know a lot of fellows who will laugh very heartily . But the fact remains that the lady you just saw leave this room is to become my wife , so once and for all get it out of your head that it 's a joke . And do n't sit there like a pall-bearer . Smile ! ( WALLACE forces a grin . ) Utter a few kind words . Say something  --   --  ( WALLACE leans forward to expostulate . ) But do n't give me any argument about this thing , for it will only be a waste of time . My mind 's positively made up . ROBERT WALLACE But do you realize what  --   --  JACKSON JONES What people will say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I 've threshed it out with myself from every possible angle . I know what they 'll say and I know exactly what they 'll think . ROBERT WALLACE Well , what will they think ? JACKSON JONES Well , the natural thought will be that I 'm marrying her for her money . ROBERT WALLACE Why , they know better than that . Everyone 's aware of the fact that you have all the money you need . p. 24 JACKSON JONES ( Laughs ) Do you think so ? ROBERT WALLACE Well , have n't you ? JACKSON JONES Just a second . ( Goes upstage L. and calls ) Rankin , oh , Rankin ! RANKIN ( Enters from L. with telegram , which he hands to JACKSON . ) Telegram , sir . JACKSON JONES Telegram ? ( Puts it in his pocket without looking at it . ) Say , Rankin , I do n't want to be disturbed for the next five minutes . I want to talk over some business with Mr. Wallace . RANKIN Very well , sir . ( Exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Bob , I 'm going to let you in on a little secret  --  my secret . No one else in the world knows . I would n't tell anyone but you , and I would n't tell you if it were n't for the fact that we 've always been so close and such good friends . But , remember , this is Masonic . ROBERT WALLACE Why , certainly . JACKSON JONES ( Frankly ) I 'm broke . ROBERT WALLACE ( Startled  --  sits up eagerly ) You 're what ? p. 25 JACKSON JONES Broke , dead broke . Are you surprised ? ROBERT WALLACE Say , what kind of a joke is this ? JACKSON JONES It 's no joke to be broke , Bob , but it 's even worse than that with me . I 'm in debt . ROBERT WALLACE In debt ! JACKSON JONES To the extent of about fifty thousand dollars . ROBERT WALLACE Well , what have you done with all your money ? JACKSON JONES Put it back into circulation where it came from . ROBERT WALLACE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT WALLACE Investments gone wrong ? JACKSON JONES I never invested any money . The only thing I ever did was to spend it . ROBERT WALLACE But you could n't spend the money you had . JACKSON JONES I did n't have any trouble getting rid of it . Everybody seemed very glad to take it . ROBERT WALLACE But I always thought you had an enormous income . JACKSON JONES Well , that 's what they all thought , and still think . That 's why I 've been able to go along and run head over heels in debt . I owe tailor bills , boot bills , jewelry bills , flower bills , restaurant bills  --  I 've got a flock of bills over there in that room  --  ( Points to room R. )  --  that would make Rockefeller complain of the high cost of living , and I ca n't pay them because I 'm broke , flat broke . It 's hard to believe , is n't it ? p. 26 ROBERT WALLACE Why , you always led me to believe you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that , I could have been worth a million by now if I 'd had any business ability with the bank-roll I had to go with . When I came here to New York five years ago and started to burn up Broadway I had two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . My father died and left me that when I was ten years old ; did n't come into it until I was twenty-one . There was a whole lot of cash , some real estate , and a half interest in a chewing gum factory . The first thing I did was to sell the real estate , and then I sold my interest in the gum plant . I wanted cash  --  had n't use for anything else . My father 's partner , his brother ( my uncle , old Andrew Jones ) , bought me out , and cheated me , too . A measly hundred thousand , that 's all I got . Since then I understand he 's made a dozen fortunes with the darned old gum . I heard the Gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . You 've often heard me speak of the gum ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes , Jones 's Pepsin . JACKSON JONES Yes , that 's right . Jones 's Pepsin , made in Jonesville . The town was named after my grandfather . He was in the gum business before his two sons . It 's the oldest gum on the market . Ever chew it ? p. 27 ROBERT WALLACE No . JACKSON JONES Do n't ! It 's awful ! It 's terrible stuff ! ROBERT WALLACE Well , go on , tell me what happened . JACKSON JONES Nothing happened except that I could n't wait to get hold of that money and get out of that town . I wanted New York , nothing but New York . I had heard about New York ; I 'd read of New York ; I talked New York ; I dreamed New York . Why , from the time I was a kid in knickerbockers up to the day I left Jonesville , everybody in the town called me " Broadway . " ROBERT WALLACE " Broadway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " just because I wore patent leather shoes and put on a clean collar every now and then . That 's the kind of a town it is . Oh , I 've lived up to the name , all right . I know every newsboy , policeman , actor , chorus girl , wine agent , gambler and bartender in the town . I 've been to bed just one night in four years before four o'clock in the morning  --  one night , and that was because I had a toothache and my face was swollen . It was n't the pain that kept me in , it was the looks of the thing . Oh , what I have n't done to Broadway ! Well , you know , you 've been with me . ROBERT WALLACE Well , I always said you were pretty speedy , but I thought you could afford it . The trouble with you is you 've been too liberal . p. 28 JACKSON JONES I know it . I 've been the bright-eyed baby boy around this town , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've had a wonderful time ! ROBERT WALLACE How long have you been broke ? JACKSON JONES About six months . My credit 's carried me on . When I first went broke I made up my mind I would n't run in debt no matter what happened . You know what I did ? I put on an old suit of clothes that morning and started out looking for a job . ROBERT WALLACE ( Laughs ) What kind of a job ? JACKSON JONES Any kind of a job . Elevator boy , messenger boy  --  I did n't care . I promised myself I 'd earn a living without begging , borrowing or stealing . ROBERT WALLACE Well , what happened when you went out looking for a job ? JACKSON JONES I know it sounds funny to tell , but it 's a positive fact . I started out looking for a " Boy Wanted " sign . My intentions were the best in the world . I got to thinking of something else , and when I came to , where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Delmonico 's , having breakfast . Turned in there out of force of habit . I made a dozen attempts to do the right thing . I cut out automobiles and rode in street cars for two or three days ; I went to an opening night at a theatre and sat in the gallery ; I bought a pair of ready-made shoes ; I ate my meals at a forty-cent table d'hote and smoked five-cent cigars , just practicing , trying to get used to it all , but I could n't , I simply could n't . All my good resolutions went to smash every time I took a look at Broadway . I knew my credit was good  --  the things I wanted were there  --  I could have them , and , well , I took them , that 's all . p. 29 ROBERT WALLACE And now you 're fifty thousand dollars in debt . JACKSON JONES I do n't know the exact amount , but that 's a fairly good guess . ROBERT WALLACE Well , you 've kept pretty quiet about it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES It has n't worried me , eh ? ( Gets up . ) Well , I do n't mind telling you that I just woke up out of the first sound sleep I 've had in weeks . The first month I went broke I bet I walked to Chicago and back every night . ( Crosses to R. and back to R. of table again. )  --  if you measured the carpet by the mile . I thought so much and worried so much that I did n't dare trust myself alone . I had the weirdest ideas  --  I did the craziest things you ever heard of . ( Sits R. of table . ) I 'll tell you something you do n't know . I belong to the Salvation Army . ROBERT WALLACE What ! JACKSON JONES On the level . It 's a positive fact . I went over to Newark and joined it one night about two months ago . ROBERT WALLACE What was the idea ? JACKSON JONES Well , I was discouraged . I thought it would be a good way to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights and could n't stand it any longer . Have you ever been to Newark ? p. 30 ROBERT WALLACE Yes . JACKSON JONES Well , then , you know what I suffered . Oh , you ca n't realize what I 've been through , Bob . I 've made a bluff and pretended to be happy all along , but you can believe me , old pal , there have been times when I actually started out for that old Brooklyn Bridge . ( WALLACE lays one hand on JACKSON 'S in sympathy . ) I did n't care about the money I 'd spent , mind you , it was n't that . It was the fact of piling this debt up day in and day out , with no chance of ever paying it . ROBERT WALLACE And still you kept on accepting credit . JACKSON JONES I know it was wrong , dead wrong , but it was in my blood . I could n't help it . ROBERT WALLACE But your uncle ? JACKSON JONES My uncle ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he 's been tried  --  and found guilty . I wrote and told him I was short of ready cash and I asked him for a few thousand dollars . ROBERT WALLACE Did he answer ? JACKSON JONES Yes , he answered . Sent me a package of his gum and a note : " Chew this and forget it . " He 's in Europe now ; he 's been in Europe for weeks . That old fellow 's worth a million if he 's worth a nickel . p. 31 ROBERT WALLACE Well , tell me , where have you been getting enough for tips and pocket money ? JACKSON JONES You know that big French car I said was in dead storage ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . JACKSON JONES I sold it . Remember , I told you I had lost a lot of jewelry ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . JACKSON JONES Well , I did n't . I pawned it . How is my work ? ROBERT WALLACE You 're a wonder . I 've got to hand it to you . But why have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Troubled ) Because I did n't have courage enough to confide in anyone . ( Gets up , goes over R.C. , then back to table . ) All I 've been waiting for is some miracle to happen to set things right . All I 've been thinking of is money ; how to get it ; where to get it . ( Sits R. of table . ) And , Bob , last night at that banquet table I sat there looking at Mrs. Gerard and thinking of her millions and wondering what she 'd do if I told her my story  --  trying to pluck up enough courage to take her into my confidence and ask her to help me . I did n't realize what I was doing , but I must have been staring at the woman for fully ten minutes when a waiter came up and handed me a note . p. 32 ROBERT WALLACE A note ! JACKSON JONES It was from her . ROBERT WALLACE What did it say ? JACKSON JONES " Why do you stare at me so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROBERT WALLACE What did you say ? JACKSON JONES Oh , I could n't help it , Bob , I was desperate . ROBERT WALLACE Come on , tell me  --  what did you say ? JACKSON JONES ( Sheepishly ) " Because I love you . " ROBERT WALLACE Did she answer that ? JACKSON JONES Yes . " I love you , too . " ROBERT WALLACE Then your answer ? JACKSON JONES " Not as much as I love you . " ( WALLACE turns from JACKSON with a snort of disgust . ) Oh , we had quite a correspondence  --  seven or eight notes either way . ROBERT WALLACE Who sent the last one ? JACKSON JONES She did . " Will you marry me ? " p. 33 ROBERT WALLACE She proposed to you ? JACKSON JONES On the level . ROBERT WALLACE And you said yes ? JACKSON JONES I did n't put it in writing . The letter-carrier lost his job right there . ( Gets up and leans over table . ) For fear she 'd change her mind before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollered , " Yes . " ( Goes over toward R.C. ) ROBERT WALLACE Well , what happened then ? JACKSON JONES ( Turns and comes back toward table L. ) She fainted . Table deserted ; general excitement ; smelling salts ; usual speech ; " Where am I at ? " ; embrace ; kiss ; announcement ; wild applause . Then somebody ordered twenty cases of wine and the next thing I remember Rankin called me and told me you were here . ( Sits R. of table . ) Well , what do you think of it all ? ROBERT WALLACE I think it 's terrible ! JACKSON JONES How ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , you ca n't afford to do this thing ! JACKSON JONES I ca n't afford to do anything without signing a tab for it . p. 34 ROBERT WALLACE ( Impatiently ) Oh , you can do something . Have n't you got any " get up and go " ? JACKSON JONES Yes , that 's all I can do  --  get up and go ! ROBERT WALLACE If you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . JACKSON JONES If I go to work , I wo n't have the makings of a cigarette . I know what I can do . ROBERT WALLACE How do you know ? You have n't tried . I 'll get you a job . JACKSON JONES Where ? ROBERT WALLACE With my firm ; on my recommendation . JACKSON JONES Yes , I 'd look funny in the advertising business , I would . ROBERT WALLACE I 'll see the Guv'nor to-morrow . I 'll get you about five thousand a year to start with . JACKSON JONES Five thousand a year ! What good is that in New York ? I pay more than that for these apartments . I owe ten times that amount right now . ROBERT WALLACE Well , I have about twenty thousand of my own . I 'll lend you that . JACKSON JONES That 's very nice of you , but I 'd never be able to pay it back . p. 35 ROBERT WALLACE That does n't make any difference . JACKSON JONES Oh , yes , it does . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd still be in debt , would n't I ? What 's the odds whether I owe it to you or the other fellow ? ROBERT WALLACE But you ca n't do this thing , Jackson ; it is n't right . JACKSON JONES How do you mean ? ROBERT WALLACE Do you mean to tell me you 'd do such a low , contemptible , despicable thing as to deliberately marry a woman for money ? JACKSON JONES Who says I 'm marrying her for her money ? ROBERT WALLACE Well , you know you do n't love the woman ! JACKSON JONES I do n't know anything of the kind . ( WALLACE gets up with an exclamation of anger , and stands L. of table , in front of mantel-piece . ) Now , see here , suppose you were in trouble , would n't you love some one who came forward and helped you out of it ? ( Gets up and paces back and forth from L. to R. ) Besides , it 's too late now , the engagement 's been announced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engagements are broken every day in the week . You leave the whole thing to me . I 'll have a talk with Mrs. Gerard , and I 'll guarantee to prove to her that it 's an utter impossibility . You need n't enter into it at all . I 'll take the whole thing on my shoulders and she  --  p. 36 JACKSON JONES No , there 's no use , Bob . I told you before I started I would n't listen to any argument against it . My mind 's made up , that 's all there is to it . I 'm going through with it  --  I have to . ( WALLACE gets his hat and cane from piano . ) I 'll show you something . See this ? ( Pulls a banknote from his pocket . ) A hundred dollars  --  that 's my bankroll . ( Goes C. , near WALLACE . ) ROBERT WALLACE You 'll lose every friend you ever had in the world . JACKSON JONES No , I wo n't . People with money never lose their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON JONES ( Goes up L. near window-seat . ) You ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . And unless you tell me within the next twenty-four hours that you 've reconsidered this matter and that you 're going to fight it out in a real way , I 'll never speak to you again as long as I live ! JACKSON JONES You do n't mean that . ROBERT WALLACE You bet I mean it . There are other things in the world besides money . JACKSON JONES ( Sits on stool in window-seat ) Huh ! p. 37 ROBERT WALLACE ( Leans against R. of table L. ) Oh , I know it 's an old speech , but in this case it goes . Is it getting me anything giving you this advice ? It is n't putting a dollar in or out of my pocket one way or the other , whether you marry this woman or not . You 're nothing to me except a friend and a pal , but I do n't want to see you do something you 'll be sorry for all your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry you 're in trouble , and there is n't anything I wo n't do to help you . I 'll go the limit for everything I 've got , but if you do n't give up all idea of this marriage , never expect the friendship of any man who has any decency or selfrespect . That 's all I 've got to say  --  now I 'm going . ( Starts toward door L. JACKSON goes after him and brings him down C. , throwing his arm around WALLACE 'S shoulder . ) JACKSON JONES Wait a minute , Bob . Do n't go like that . Gee whiz ! I had a wild night . Give me a chance to think  --  please . ROBERT WALLACE All right . Go ahead and think . ( Sits R. of table L. ) It 's about time you began to think . JACKSON JONES ( Standing back of WALLACE ) Do n't you suppose I know it 's a shabby thing to do ? But , Great Scott ! look at the fix I 'm in . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 ROBERT WALLACE I 've had my say ; you 've heard my opinion . JACKSON JONES Do you think everybody will feel that way about it ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , certainly . JACKSON JONES ( Nervously walking back and forth , L. to R. and back ) If it was n't for all those debts  --  all those bills on my hands . ROBERT WALLACE You do n't know the exact amount ? JACKSON JONES No . ROBERT WALLACE Well , why have n't you added them up ? JACKSON JONES Because I have n't had time , I 've been too busy . ROBERT WALLACE Doing what ? JACKSON JONES Well , I  --   --  Now , do n't give me the third degree , will you , please ! Look , see here , I 'm so nervous now I 'm trembling like a leaf . ( Over to WALLACE , holding out his hand . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Gets up ) Where are those bills ? JACKSON JONES ( Points to room R. ) In my room in the desk . ROBERT WALLACE Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES No , I wish you would . Will you do that , Bob ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , certainly . ( Crosses over toward door R. ) JACKSON JONES ( Goes after WALLACE R. and brings him down to C. ) Say , Bob ! ROBERT WALLACE Well ? JACKSON JONES Suppose I take your advice and call this thing off , what am I going to say to Mrs. Gerard ? ROBERT WALLACE You wo n't have to say anything  --  I 'll manage her . JACKSON JONES Well , what are you going to say ? ROBERT WALLACE Will you please leave that to me ? Go over there and sit down and do some more thinking . You 've got many a think coming to you , young fellow ! I 'm going to see how much you owe the world . ( Exits door . ) JACKSON JONES ( Stands thinking a moment , then goes to table L. , picks up ' phone and sits R. of it . ) Hello , give me 4000 Bryant , please . ( Wait . ) I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Hello , is this Sperry 's Restaurant ? I want to talk to Mr. Armstrong . Oh , is that so ? I did n't recognize your voice . This is Jackson Jones . Yes . Say , Mr. Armstrong , have you made up my bill for last night 's affair ? Yes , I know , but I just want the total , just the total . Well , you look it up for me , will you ? I 'll hold the wire . Thank you very much . ( To RANKIN , who enters from R. and places flowers in jardinierre near door R. ) Say , Rankin  --   --  p. 40 RANKIN Yes , sir . ( Crosses toward JACKSON at table . ) JACKSON JONES ( Looks toward him , ' phone to ear ) I 'm sorry , Rankin , but you 'd better look around for another job . RANKIN Has n't my service been satisfactory , sir ? JACKSON JONES Oh , yes , every little thing has been all right , Rankin , but you see I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traveling . RANKIN I should like to accompany you , sir .

RANKIN I speak Japanese very well , sir . I was in service with two of them for over five years , sir , and in case you 're thinking of China  --   --  ( Outside door-bell rings . He starts for L. door . ) JACKSON JONES ( In ' phone ) Hello . Just a moment . Hold the wire a second , please .

It would be just the same to me if you said twenty-three thousand . Yes , much obliged . Goodbye .

Then turns up near L. door as RANKIN enters . ) The twenty-third ! No wonder ! RANKIN ( Enters from L. Holds out card to JACKSON . ) A gentleman to see you , sir . JACKSON JONES ( Comes down to C. ) Did n't I just tell you I was n't home ? RANKIN ( Following JACKSON down C. ) I told him that , sir , but he said he 'd wait . He says it 's imperative that he should consult with you on some matter as soon as possible . JACKSON JONES ( Takes card from RANKIN and says impatiently ) Peter Pembroke  --  I do n't even know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of some importance , sir . JACKSON JONES Does he ? RANKIN Yes , sir . JACKSON JONES Well , you 've told him I 'm here  --  all right . RANKIN Yes , sir . ( Exits L. ) JACKSON JONES ( Crosses over to door R. , opens it and calls ) Bob ! Oh , Bob !

RANKIN exits L. , after showing PEMBROKE in . ) PETER PEMBROKE ( Crosses to settee R. , standing in front of it . To JACKSON , who has followed him over ) Mr. Jones ? p. 43 JACKSON JONES Yes , sir .

( Sits on couch and takes papers from his pocket and looks them over while JACKSON talks to RANKIN , who has entered from L. and starts to exit to R. ) JACKSON JONES ( Goes up L. of piano and snaps his finger to attract RANKIN as he is crossing to R. RANKIN comes to JACKSON , who hands him a bill . ) You pay the chef a month 's salary and discharge him . Tell him I do n't like his cooking any more . RANKIN Shall I engage a new man , sir ? JACKSON JONES No , I wo n't want any new man . Did n't I just tell you that I expected to locate in  --  in Egypt ? RANKIN Egypt ! Oh , what a delightful country , sir . I lived there for two years . I 'll be of service to you , I 'm sure , on the entire trip . I 'll see the chef , sir .

PETER PEMBROKE You most certainly have , sir . I knew your uncle very well . A fine , able man . JACKSON JONES Yes , he 's abroad . PETER PEMBROKE Yes . Too bad it should happen at such a time . Very unfortunate , indeed . JACKSON JONES ( Has been looking at PEMBROKE wonderingly all this time , now gets up , opens telegram and reads ) " Cable from Dr. Graham , London , England , announcing your uncle 's demise , received late last night . His last will and testament , made prior to his sailing , places you in possession of the estate .

PETER PEMBROKE It all happened so suddenly I could hardly believe it . JACKSON JONES That 's just the way I feel about it , is n't that funny ? PETER PEMBROKE Your uncle was worth his weight in gold . JACKSON JONES How much was he worth , do you know ? PETER PEMBROKE That I ca n't say . We offered him twelve hundred thousand dollars for his business and good will less than two months ago . The proposition still holds good , Mr. Jones . We stand ready to close the deal in forty-eight hours . I realize that in your time of trouble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is vitally important that we bring the matter to a closing point by Saturday noon , as we are considering the Sprucemint Company at the same time , but our preference leans toward the Jones gum , and we  --  JACKSON JONES Wait a minute .

( Suits action to words . ) See , I 've got a lead pencil and everything . ( Takes pencil from his pocket and flashes it . ) Certainly I mean business . PETER PEMBROKE You mean you 'll sign the articles today ? p. 48 JACKSON JONES For twelve hundred thousand dollars I 'd sign a murderer 's confession .

Where do you live ? RANKIN Harlem , sir . JACKSON JONES Got a flat ? p. 50 RANKIN Yes , sir . JACKSON JONES Like this furniture ? RANKIN Beautiful , sir . JACKSON JONES It 's yours . ( Crosses to L. ) RANKIN ( Following JACKSON L. ) Oh , thank you , sir . Anything else ? JACKSON JONES No , what else do you want ? Get out ! Do n't bother me !

ROBERT WALLACE Sixty-one thousand , four hundred and eighty-two . JACKSON JONES ( Laughs and slaps WALLACE on back ) Spending money , my boy , spending money ! ( He circles the room , firing flowers , cushions , photo frames , etc. , in the air and smashing vases on mantelpiece , all the while singing , " As We Go Marching Through Georgia . " ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Following JACKSON , expostulating at his behaviour ) Say , what 's the matter with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down to C. ) Do you know what I 'm going to do from now on ? I 'm going to make the loudest noise Broadway has heard since Pershing came home from the war ! ROBERT WALLACE ( R.C. ) Say , what 's the matter with you ? JACKSON JONES Do you know what 's happened since you left this room ? A messenger with golden wings and a jeweled harp blew in through that window , handed me this message  --  ( Hands WALLACE the telegram )  --  and flew right back to the Golden Gate . Read , read , read ! ( JACKSON goes flying around the room as before , singing " Marching Through Georgia .

A fellow ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SPOTSWOOD ( Over to SAM at C. ) Oh , you want the big city life , I suppose . SAM SPOTSWOOD Yes , that 's what I want , and as soon as I can I 'm going to live in New Haven . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Laughs heartily ) Yes , you 'd do well in New Haven , you would . ( Goes upstage and arranges tidies on sofa L. , laughing . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Crosses up to MRS . SPOTSWOOD , who is L.C.U. ) What are you laughing at ? All the great men come from small towns . When Abraham Lincoln was my age he did n't amount to much , either . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Annoyed and out of patience ) Oh , go eat your supper ! p. 61 SAM SPOTSWOOD Well , I 'll fool you all some day . ( JUDGE enters . SAM turns R. and starts to exit . ) I know it 's in me if I ever get the chance . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Here , Sam ! ( Hands SAM a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go to my office and bring me that bundle of papers on my desk . The Yale key opens the desk . They 're important papers , so be careful of them . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Takes keys and starts toward door R. ) All right . Say , Pa , did n't you tell me that Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , sir . What of it ? SAM SPOTSWOOD Nothin ' . I just wanted Mom to know , that 's all . ( As he exits R. , sulking ) I have n't got a chance to practice or do anything around here . ( MRS . SPOTSWOOD laughs as SAM exits . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Where does the joke come in ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD He 's going to become a great man and live in New Haven ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , that 's a novel idea , at any rate . ( Sits R. of table. ) p. 62 MRS . SPOTSWOOD What time do you expect your callers ? ( Sits L. of table , opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel they were ordering supper . They said they 'd get here around seven or a little after . ( Looks at watch . ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD Why did n't you invite them here to supper ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , they had to clean up and everything . I guess they were pretty well tired out after four hours on the train . It 's quite a journey . MRS . SPOTSWOOD How does the boy look ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Broadway ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD Yes . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He looks ten years older . My , how that boy 's changed ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Sighs and shakes her head dolefully ) Hard work , I suppose . What business is he in , did he say ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes . He said that he had invested most of his money in the wholesale liquor business . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Shakes her head ) Did anybody recognize him at the depot ? p. 63 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD No , nor at the hotel , either . He just registered his first name , Jackson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in town . MRS . SPOTSWOOD I do n't blame him . My goodness , what a curiosity he 'll be to the folks here ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Charlie Gilroy , the hotel clerk , got off a pretty good one . I had to laugh . ( Laughs . ) Broadway 's friend wanted to know if they could have their supper served in their room , and Charlie asked them if they wanted him to go up and feed them . ( Both laugh very heartily . ) You know , Gilroy 's very witty . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Is he ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Very . He 's from Bridgeport . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Did you tell Broadway we had read in the New York Herald about him going to get married ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , I asked him about that . MRS . SPOTSWOOD What did he say ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , he started to say something , but his friend spoke up and told me not to believe what I read in the New York papers . ( MRS . SPOTSWOOD gets up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 MRS . SPOTSWOOD No ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD No , his friend did most of the talking . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Why , who 's he ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD His name is Wallace . He seems to be a right nice chap . ( MRS . SPOTSWOOD crosses over toward C. He turns to her . ) I tried to pump him about what the boy intended to do in regard to the gum plant , but he did n't seem inclined to talk about it , so I dropped it . The Consolidated people telephoned me to-day for his New York address . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Comes back to JUDGE at table ) They did ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , and I wanted to find out if they 'd made any proposition at all . ( Gets up and paces back and forth in front of table . ) I 'm worried about this matter , Mom . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Did you talk to the boy about it at all ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD I did n't have time to talk about anything . ( Looks at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . He wants to settle everything up right away . He says he has to get back to New York and attend to business . ( Goes L. of table. ) p. 65 MRS . SPOTSWOOD Well , I hope he 'll consider us all before he does anything rash . ( Starts toward R. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Thinks ) I hope so . Oh , say , Mom ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Turns and looks at JUDGE ) Yes ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( L.C. ) Tell Clara I want to see her when she 's through supper . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Very well , I will . ( Starts to exit R. and meets SAM coming in . ) Did you eat already ? SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Chewing mouthful of food ) Yes , Ma'am . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Did n't I tell you to stop gulping down your meals ? You 'll get indigestion . You 're cranky and fussy enough now without that . ( Crosses SAM to door R. ) SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Turns and faces MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin was cranky when he was a boy . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Do n't forget the errand you 've got to do for your father . ( Exits door R. JUDGE sits L. of table. ) p. 66 SAM SPOTSWOOD Oh , all right . ( Crosses to L. and stands R. of table ) Say , Pa , I wish you 'd ask Ma to quit pickin ' on me all the time . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Looks up quietly ) Why , what 's the matter now , son ? SAM SPOTSWOOD Well , she does n't understand me . I 've got good stuff in me . I 'm going to amount to somethin ' some day . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles ) Do you think so , Sam ? SAM SPOTSWOOD Yes , I do . Every time I read about a great man I wish I was him . ( Stands back of table . ) That 's a good sign , ai n't it ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles , looks over his newspaper ) Why , yes , I guess so . SAM SPOTSWOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her to let me alone . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Ignores SAM 'S last speech ) Hurry up and get those papers for me . I 'll need them in a few minutes . ( Resumes his reading . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD Nobody can tell . Maybe some day they 'll be pointing to this house and tellin ' people I was born in it . ( Goes to door C. upstage , turns back and comes down to R. of table . ) Say , Pa , give us six cents for a soda , will you ? p. 67 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Reaches in pocket for money , then pauses ) You 're sure it ai n't for cigarettes ? SAM SPOTSWOOD No , honest ! I ai n't smoked since you caught me . ( JUDGE hands him nickel . ) Thanks , Pa . I remember what you told me about cigarettes , all right . No more of them for me .

JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , Clara , I want you to do me a favor . Run over to Josie Richards ' house and tell her I want to see her to-night about something very important . CLARA SPOTSWOOD You want her to come here ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes . Tell her it 's something about the plant . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Has the trust bought it ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles ) No , no ! Did your mother tell you who 's in town ? p. 68 CLARA SPOTSWOOD No . Who ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD The new owner , the young man himself . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Eagerly ) Honestly ? When did he get here ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD On the five-fifty . Do n't tell that to anyone but Josie , and tell her to keep it quiet . He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pa .

( Goes up and puts hat on , standing in front of mirror in organ . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD You understand now ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD Sure ! I wo n't breathe it to a soul but her .

SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from door R. quickly ) Did Clara go to the door ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Half whisper ) Is it him ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Anxiously ) I expect so . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Off stage C.R. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you remember me , Mr. Jones ? ( At the sound of voices off stage , JUDGE and MRS . SPOTSWOOD start primping . MRS .

JACKSON JONES ( Off stage ) Well , what do you think of that ! Why , you were a little girl the last time I saw you . This is my friend , Mr. Wallace . This is the Judge 's daughter , Bob . ROBERT WALLACE ( Off stage ) I 'm pleased to meet you , Miss Spotswood. p. 70 CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Off stage ) Thank you , I 'm pleased , too . Go right in the parlor  --  straight ahead .

WALLACE looks off C. at arch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome , my boy ! ( Points to MRS . SPOTSWOOD over R.C. ) Remember that lady ? JACKSON JONES I should say I do . ( Goes to MRS .

( WALLACE and JUDGE are up C. , shaking hands . JUDGE places hat on sofa up L.C. ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Turning JACKSON round to get a good look at him ) Well , well , well , Broadway ! It does n't seem possible that it 's you . JACKSON JONES ( Laughs ) Yes , I guess I have changed . ( Turns upstage to WALLACE and JUDGE . ) There 's a funny thing . Nobody seemed to know me , and I saw only one that I recognized . ( To MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) This is my friend , Mr. Wallace , Mrs. Spotswood . ( JACKSON goes over R. , back of them , looks at pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to WALLACE , who advances to meet her . She shakes his hand heartily . ) How do you do , Mr. Wallace ? Make yourself right at home . I guess Broadway knows that all his friends are our friends . ROBERT WALLACE You 're very kind , Mrs. Spotswood . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Following WALLACE down C. ) Wo n't you sit down , Mr. Wallace ? ( Points to chair R. of table . ) ROBERT WALLACE Thanks . ( Sits R. of table . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Shall I take your hat ? ( Takes WALLACE 'S hat and places it upstage on sofa . ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Turns to R.C. to JACKSON ) ' T was all very sudden , was n't it ? JACKSON JONES ( Turns to MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) What 's that ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD I mean about your uncle . JACKSON JONES Oh , yes ! Too bad , too bad ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Tenderly ) He was so good , so generous ! p. 72 JACKSON JONES ( Alert ) Was he ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up .

SPOTSWOOD Yes , of course , I understand . ( Goes over C. to WALLACE R. of table , drying her eyes . ) Will you have a glass of milk and some cake ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Eyes JACKSON ) No , thank you . JACKSON JONES We 're very much obliged , Mrs. Spotswood , but we just finished dinner at the Grand Hotel . ROBERT WALLACE ( Correcting JACKSON ) Supper . JACKSON JONES I mean supper . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Well , I 'll make a pitcher of lemonade , anyway . You 're liable to get thirsty while you 're talking . ( Is standing C. ) JACKSON JONES ( Has gone up R. and is looking at picture on wall . ) Oh , Bob , come here . This is my uncle 's picture . ( Points to picture. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON ) Is that so ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Standing in front of L. table ) Yes , that was taken about ten years ago . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Coming down C. , faces them ) But he did n't change much in the last ten years . JACKSON JONES You bet he did n't . ( WALLACE and JACKSON talk in pantomime during following lines . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Over to MRS . SPOTSWOOD at C. Aside to her ) Say , Mom . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Aside ) Yes ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Aside ) Is Dave out in the kitchen ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Aside ) Yes . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Aside , handing her a quarter ) Well , give him this quarter and tell him to go over to the drug store and get me six good cigars . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Aside ) I 'll send him right away .

She 's quite a young lady now , is n't she ? ( JUDGE , JACKSON and WALLACE start slowly toward table L. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Nineteen . ROBERT WALLACE She 's a mighty pretty girl , Judge . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , we 're very proud of her . ( As the three get to table L. , the JUDGE takes a flask from his pocket , looks anxiously toward R. door , half whispers  --  smiles . ) I thought maybe you boys would like a little drop of something , so I brought home this flask . Can I fix you up a drink , Broadway ? JACKSON JONES Not now , thanks . ( Sits back of table . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Offering it ) Mr. Wallace ? ROBERT WALLACE A little later , Judge .

Mrs. Spotswood would raise thunder if she thought I brought it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 JACKSON JONES Not a word out of me , Judge . ROBERT WALLACE Nor me . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( As he sits L. of table ) Wait until you see Sammy . You wo n't know him . He 'll be here directly . I sent him down to my office for some stuff I forgot to bring . I want you to see a copy of that will . JACKSON JONES ( Eagerly , across table ) Yes , I 'd like to as soon as possible . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( To WALLACE ) You know , very few people imagined that this boy would come in for it all . JACKSON JONES I ca n't understand it myself . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Of course I knew . JACKSON JONES You know , Judge , I always thought the old gentleman hated me . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD No , siree ! Of course he did n't like the idea of you not wanting to take up the partnership where your father left it off . He 'd never bought you out only he thought you 'd sell to someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't want you to go to New York , either , for fear you 'd get to squandering your money . ( Look of amusement passes between WALLACE and JACKSON . ) But he was really very fond of you . Naturally , he would be ; never married , no children of his own . He used to feel hurt that you never came to see him , but he always felt that the plant belonged to you . You know , your father was the one who made the real success . p. 76 JACKSON JONES ( To WALLACE ) What did I tell you ? ( WALLACE nods understandingly . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD That 's the real reason why your uncle never let go to the trust ROBERT WALLACE It must be an immense fortune , is n't it , Judge ? ( JACKSON listens eagerly across table . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD The Consolidated people offered him twelve hundred thousand dollars for the plant and the trade mark . You see , those trust fellows have been so anxious to get the Jones gum that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a fund for advertising purposes , but they killed that fund for us two years ago with one of their business tricks . ROBERT WALLACE ( Across table ) How do you mean ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , they sent in such a demand on us that we added to the size of the plant and spent the money for machinery . We never realized that it was anything but a legitimate increase until the sudden smash came  --  and no advertising done all that year . JACKSON JONES ( To WALLACE , assumed sympathy  --  but not understanding ) Can you beat that ? p. 77 ROBERT WALLACE Just shows you what chance the little fellow 's got . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD None at all against capital . JACKSON JONES ( Tries hard to assume understanding ) What did he do then , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He turned everything he had in the world into money and put it right back in the business . JACKSON JONES ( Uneasy ) Then you mean that aside from the business he left very little ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALLACE . ) Well , I believe the plant did show a profit last year . I expect Miss Richards here shortly . She can tell you exactly what it is  --  she 's got it at her finger-tips . ROBERT WALLACE Miss Richards ? JACKSON JONES Who 's she ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD She 's our chief accountant . I sent Clara over for her . She 'll tell you all about it . ROBERT WALLACE We 've very anxious to know . ( DAVE enters from R. , with cigars in paper bag . ) JACKSON JONES ( Uneasy ) I should say we are . p. 78 DAVE ( Goes directly to JUDGE at table L. ) Here 's the cigars . Judge . The Missus said you wanted them in here . ( Puts cigars on table in front of JUDGE . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , thanks , Dave . ( DAVE exits R. ) Have a cigar , Broadway ? ( Passes cigars to JACKSON . ) JACKSON JONES ( Takes a cigar ) Thanks , very much , Judge . ( Smells it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Puts cigar in his pocket . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Mr. Wallace ? ( Passes cigars to WALLACE . ) ROBERT WALLACE No , thanks . I use cigarettes . ( Takes a cigarette from case . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from door upstage ) Oh , excuse me . ( Comes forward to between JACKSON and JUDGE and places keys and papers on table . ) Here 's your papers , Pa , and here 's your keys , too . ( Goes R.C. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD And where 's your cap ? ( SAM removes his cap . JUDGE points from SAM to JACKSON ) Do you remember him ? p. 79 JACKSON JONES ( Faces JAM , assuming interest ) That is n't Sammy ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles ) That 's him . JACKSON JONES ( Laughs , amused at SAM 'S appearance ) Well , what do you think of that ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Come and shake hands with these gentlemen , Sammy . JACKSON JONES ( As SAMMY comes to him , he turns in his chair and shakes hands with him . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shakes his hand . ) How are you , young man ? ( Both WALLACE and JACKSON laugh at SAMMY . WALLACE lights a cigarette and starts smoking . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He was only nine years old when you left here . JACKSON JONES Sure , I remember him . ( To SAMMY ) Well , Sammy , you have n't grown very tall , but you got a little wide . You 're a great big boy now , Sammy . SAM SPOTSWOOD Napoleon Bonaparte was short and stout . ( All laugh . ) Well , what are you laughin ' at ? I seen his picture . p. 80 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Looking through papers , but smiling at SAM ) Sam reads the pictures of all the great men . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Has been watching WALLACE , sulking ) Say , if you keep on smokin ' cigarettes you 'll weaken your brain . ROBERT WALLACE ( Turns to SAM , astonished ) What ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Gets up and says sternly ) Sam , do n't you know better than to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you told me . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Points to door upstage C. ) Go on  --  get out of here . ( As SAM exits upstage , the JUDGE seats himself . ) JACKSON JONES ( Laughs ) He gave you away that time , Judge . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He sure did . ( They all laugh . ) ROBERT WALLACE Do you object to cigarettes , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Confidentially , across table ) Lord , no ! I smoke them myself once in a while , when there ai n't anyone looking . I guess Sam does , too . ( Both laugh . JUDGE takes will from bundle of papers and hands it to JACKSON . ) Here it is . It 'll take quite a while to read it ; better put it in your pocket and look it over to-night . ( Gets up with the rest of the papers and places them on top of bookcase L. , speaking as he gets up . ) We 'll go over this other stuff later on . ( Bell rings . ) Someone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see who it is . ( Exits to upstage door , C. to R. ) p. 81 JACKSON JONES ( Uneasy , gets up and stands back of WALLACE 'S chair . ) You see , nothing but the plant . I 've got to sell . ( Goes up to door C. upstage and back again . ) ROBERT WALLACE But not at their price ! Did n't you hear ? The plant showed a profit last year without any advertising ? JACKSON JONES ( Sits L. of table in chair JUDGE has vacated ) I know all about that , but this is Thursday , and Pembroke said they 'd have to know by Saturday , sure . ROBERT WALLACE That 's a bluff . JACKSON JONES ( Impatiently ) You do n't seem to realize the enormity of the amount . This is twelve hundred thousand dollars ! We 're not talking about a nickel , you know . ROBERT WALLACE ( Across table ) I tell you to hold out . JACKSON JONES But I tell you I ca n't afford to hold out . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from R. ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Sees MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) Piano ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD Did the Judge go to the door ? p. 82 JACKSON JONES Yes , Mrs. Spotswood . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Brings tray over and places it on table . ) Here 's some nice lemonade . I made it myself , so you must enjoy it . ( The boys nod their thanks weakly . ) I did n't bring any for Pa . He never drinks it . ( Sits back of table between boys . Both show hesitancy in tasting the lemonade , then show surprise at finding whiskey in it . ) I put a little drop of whiskey in it . The Judge would have a fit if he even knew it was in the house . He 's a temperance crank . ( They both then drink quickly . The boys finish drinking and put glasses on tray . ) JACKSON JONES I 'll keep your secret . ROBERT WALLACE It 's sacred with me . MRS . SPOTSWOOD If you want any more , just shout out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON JONES I 'm liable to shout any minute for that . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Looks at both boys and laughs , then turns to exit R. , when she sees the JUDGE entering from door C. upstage . ) Who was at the door , Pa ? p. 83 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Going toward JACKSON ) Someone to see you , Broadway . JACKSON JONES ( Gets up from table surprised and goes to JUDGE up C. ) To see me ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Comes down stage R.C. ) I thought nobody knew you were in town . ROBERT WALLACE ( Rises ) Someone about recognized you in the street . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Lord , that settles it ! Now the whole town will turn out . ( Exits R. WALLACE at JACKSON 'S L. , faces off R.U. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD This man 's a stranger . I told him you were n't here , but he said he knew better . He knew the time you left New York and all about it . JACKSON JONES ( At R. of arch ) Was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're thinking of Pembroke , it was n't him . I know him . ( JACKSON again looks off C.R. ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Comes down to C. ) Who the deuce was it ? p. 84 JACKSON JONES ( Down L.C. to WALLACE quickly ) Mrs. Gerard 's lawyer ! ROBERT WALLACE ( Laughs ) No , no ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He said he 'd wait for you at the Grand Hotel , that it was very important and he had to see you to-night . JACKSON JONES ( To JUDGE , sorrowfully ) Did he go to the Grand Hotel ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes . JACKSON JONES Did you tell him I would n't see anybody ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD I did n't even admit that you were here . ROBERT WALLACE ( To JACKSON ) Perhaps I 'd better go to the hotel and see who it is . JACKSON JONES Yes , will you do that for me , Bob ? ROBERT WALLACE Sure . ( Crosses JACKSON to L. below table , thinking . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Here 's your hat over here , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to WALLACE . ) ROBERT WALLACE Thanks . p. 85 JACKSON JONES ( Has gone below L. of table  --  goes up L. to mantel ) Say , Bob , hurry back , will you ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Starts up stage C.  --  gets L. of arch ) I wo n't be any longer than I can help . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( JOSIE and CLARA enter from upstage door ) Here 's Josie , Pa . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Hello , Josie . JOSIE RICHARDS Good evening , Judge . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD This is Miss Richards , Mr. Wallace . ROBERT WALLACE Miss Richards . ( Bows to JOSIE . She returns bow . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( To WALLACE ) You 've met my daughter . ROBERT WALLACE Yes , I 've had that pleasure . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Crosses to WALLACE R.C. and shakes hands with him . ) Yes , I met him out in the hall , Pa .

This is the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 86 JACKSON JONES ( Shakes hands with JOSIE ) How do you do , Miss Richards ? I 've been hearing a lot about you . ( Motions her to sit at table L. ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Comes in front of table and sits L. of it . ) I 've heard a lot about you , too . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Goes to WALLACE and CLARA R.C. ) Think you can find your way all right , young man ? ( JACKSON crosses up to mantel  --  eyes JOSIE . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Starts upstage toward door C. ) Yes , I think so . Let me see , it 's three blocks down and then to the left . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD No , to the right , and then across the square . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Up to WALLACE at door , smiling ) Where are you going , to the hotel ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Well , I 'll show you the way , Mr. Wallace . ROBERT WALLACE Oh , please do n't trouble . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going down that way , anyhow . p. 87 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , you 'd better do that , Clara . He 's liable to get mixed . It would n't do to get lost in a big city like Jonesville . ( All laugh . CLARA and WALLACE exit , laughing and talking ad lib. through upstage door . The JUDGE stands at door C. , looking after them until they exit , then goes over R.C. as MRS . SPOTSWOOD enters R. ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from R. and goes toward door upstage , watching CLARA and WALLACE off , then turns to JUDGE ) Where 's Clara going ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD She 's showing Mr. Wallace the way to the hotel . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Oh , I see . ( Sees JOSIE at table and comes down to her , R. of table . ) Hello , Josie , dear . I did n't know you were here . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Gets up ) Mr. Spotswood sent for me . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Oh , I see . Have you met Mr. Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( JACKSON bows , but does not speak . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Come , Mom . We 've got important things to talk about . p. 88 MRS . SPOTSWOOD Yes , I understand . ( Turns to JACKSON L. ) Will you have another glass of lemonade , Broadway ? JACKSON JONES No , thanks , not now . ( Goes up to mantel  --  eyes JOSIE . ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD Have a cup of tea , Josie ? JOSIE RICHARDS I do n't think so , Mrs. Spotswood . ( Sits L. of table . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Up R.C. , annoyed with MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) Mom , Mom , please ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( A little huffed ) Yes , I 'm going , I 'm going . ( Starts R. When near door she turns to JUDGE ) You have to be polite to people , do n't you ? ( Flounces angrily out of room R. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Starts talking as he goes toward table L. ) I 've explained to Mr. Jones , Josie , that the affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON comes down stage and stands back of table . ) You can give him a pretty good idea of how matters stand without the books and figures in front of you , ca n't you ? p. 89 JOSIE RICHARDS Well , hardly , Judge . There are so many things to go over and so much detail , I 'm afraid I 'd have to have the figures for that . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD The old gentleman told me you showed a profit of about forty thousand dollars last year . JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , it was more than that . JACKSON JONES It was ! ( Becomes interested at this statement and sits back of table , looking closely at JOSIE . ) JOSIE RICHARDS Why , yes , nearer fifty , if I remember rightly . JACKSON JONES Well , that was n't so bad , was it ? JOSIE RICHARDS Why , no . Considering the fact that we 've been fighting the trust all the time , I think it was perfectly remarkable . JACKSON JONES ( Draws chair closer  --  more interest ) You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JACKSON JONES Sure , I think it 's all right . What do you think , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Emphatically ) I always said it was the best chewing gum in the world . JACKSON JONES We 're talking profits , not chewing gum . ( JOSIE laughs. ) p. 90 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Gets up from table , laughing ) Well , you talk it over with Josie . I 'm a poor hand where figures are concerned . ( Walks toward door R. while finishing speech . ) I want to see Mom about something , anyway . ( Looks at JOSIE and JACKSON a moment , then exits R. ) JACKSON JONES ( Makes sure JUDGE is gone  --  leans over table toward JOSIE , speaking earnestly and confidentially  --  quickly ) Now , see here . I want to find out whether or not I 'm in a position to hold out for a bigger price against this Chewing Gum Trust . They 've made me an offer of over a million dollars for the plant , but a friend of mine wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is business right now ? JOSIE RICHARDS We did over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars worth of business last month . JACKSON JONES You did ! A hundred and twenty thousand dollars worth of business last month ! Can I go down to the bank and get that money right away ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Laughs ) Why , certainly not ! JACKSON JONES You do n't understand . Now this is between us . ( Draws chair close  --  then across ) You see , I 'm broke , I 'm in debt , and I must get some money , quick money , and I want to know how much cash you have in bank this minute . p. 91 JOSIE RICHARDS You mean our cash balance ? JACKSON JONES ( Eager ) Yes . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Thinks a moment ) Over eighteen thousand dollars , I should say . JACKSON JONES Eighteen thousand dollars ! Eighteen thousand dollars , and you did a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ' worth of business last month ! ( Gets up and takes chair JUDGE has vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not thinking seriously of going over . JACKSON JONES Going over where ? JOSIE RICHARDS To the trust . JACKSON JONES Why ? Do n't you think the price they offer is big enough ? JOSIE RICHARDS It is n't a question of price , Mr. Jones , it 's the principle of the thing . JACKSON JONES ( Across table ) You 'll have to explain that to me . JOSIE RICHARDS Why , think of what you 're selling . The thing your grandfather worked for and handed down to your father ; the thing that he worked for and handed down to you ; and now the thing that you should work for and hand down to your children , and then to their children , and so on and so on . Why , think of what you 're selling . p. 92 JACKSON JONES I ca n't see where there 's any sentiment connected with this thing . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Spiritedly ) You ca n't ? You 'd ruin the town you were born in ? You 'd see seven hundred men and boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and butter taken from the mouths of their families ? You 'd see all this without a regret ? JACKSON JONES ( Facing her ) How is all this going to happen ? JOSIE RICHARDS Because if you sell to the Chewing Gum Trust it means that this plant will close . JACKSON JONES Why ? JOSIE RICHARDS They manufacture in Ohio . JACKSON JONES Are you sure about that ? JOSIE RICHARDS Positive . I 'd give it very serious thought if I were you , Mr. Jones . Oh , it would be perfectly great of you to stand by and protect the people of this little town . You 've a chance to do something very , very big , a really wonderful thing . I hope you 'll do it  --  and I think you will . ( Pauses for a moment , then gets up . ) I must run along now . ( Goes toward door upstage C. , then comes back to JACKSON at his R. ) You 'd better come to the plant as early as possible . There 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . ( Pauses for a moment . ) Think it over , Mr. Jones . ( JACKSON gets up , pauses for a moment , thinks deeply  --  impressed . ) Good-night . p. 93 JACKSON JONES Good-night . ( JOSIE goes up toward door C. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from door R. ) Are you going , Josie ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes . Good-night , Judge . ( Starts up C. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Going over toward C. JACKSON sits L. of table . ) Well , you did n't have much of a talk , did you ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Slowly , drops L.C. ) No , but Mr. Jones is coming over to the plant to-morrow morning and we 're going over everything very thoroughly . ( Comes down to C. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Oh , I see . ( Eyes JACKSON . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( To JACKSON ) What time did you say you 'd be at the plant ? JACKSON JONES ( With a dazed look on his face ) I do n't know . ( To the JUDGE . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at watch ) Just seven-thirty. p. 94 JOSIE RICHARDS ( To JACKSON , smiles ) I 'll expect you about ten in the morning , shall I ? JACKSON JONES ( Still dazed ) Make it ten minutes after ten . JOSIE RICHARDS Very well . ( Starts upstage C. , then comes back to JACKSON . She takes a package of gum from her purse and places it on table in front of him . ) I do n't think you 've seen this  --  our latest , Jones 's Pepsin Wafers . Good-night , Mr. Jones . JACKSON JONES ( Still looking dazed ) Good-night ( JOSIE turns to door C. JACKSON goes back of table . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( At door she turns and looks back at JACKSON ) Good-night . ( Exits upstage door R.C. ) JACKSON JONES ( Thinking deeply  --  full front ) Miss Richards was just explaining to me that if I sell to the chewing gum trust , this plant will close . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , they do n't care for that old shack and the machinery . What they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sits R. of table . ) She 's a nice girl , is n't she ? p. 95 JACKSON JONES Yes , she seems to be a very nice girl . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , how did she strike you ? JACKSON JONES An awful blow ! ( Hand raised . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Awful blow ? JACKSON JONES ( Explaining quickly  --  strings him ) No , no ! I said blue , awful blue . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD You 're awful blue ? JACKSON JONES No , no . I mean her eyes  --  her eyes are awful blue . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Smiles ) Everybody in this town is just mad about her . JACKSON JONES She 's a very nice girl . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Points to cigars on table ) Have another cigar ? JACKSON JONES No , thank you . I would n't mind having another glass of lemonade . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Rising ) Sure ! I 'll tell Mom that . It 'll tickle her to death . ( Exits door R. ) JACKSON JONES ( Picks gum up from table ) Jones ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll give it to their children . ( Shakes his head dubiously. ) p. 96 ROBERT WALLACE ( Enters from upstage C.R. with CLARA on his arm . She is eating from a box of chocolates . They come down to R.C. , laughing and talking , walking together . ) Do you like chocolates ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD Oh , they 're fine ! The ice-cream soda was good , too . You know , that 's the only decent soda water fountain in town . ROBERT WALLACE ( Assuming seriousness , winks at JACKSON , who eyes him quickly on " soda water . " ) It 's not bad at all . CLARA SPOTSWOOD When I was in New York last August I used to go to Huyler 's every day for ice-cream soda . Do you ever go there ? ROBERT WALLACE Oh , yes , I hang out there all the time . All the boys I go with meet there every afternoon . ( JACKSON looks at WALLACE in derision , then gets up and paces back and forth . WALLACE has turned to JACKSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , watches him for a moment , then goes back to CLARA over R. ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Giggling ) Funny , you like the same flavor I do . ( JACKSON comes in from hall and sits back of table. ) p. 97 ROBERT WALLACE Yes , is n't it strange ? You know , there is n't anything I like so well as orange ice-cream soda . ( Turns and gives JACKSON a look . ) I just love orange ice-cream soda . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Giggling ) So do I. I 'll tell Pa we 're back . ( Starts toward door R. ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Goves over toward R. with her , seriously ) Just a moment . Tell him I want to talk to Mr. Jones privately for a few minutes  --  that is , if it is n't too much trouble . CLARA SPOTSWOOD It 's no trouble at all  --  it 's a pleasure . ( Exits R. , giggling , smiling at JONES . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Stands R.C. , bowing extravagantly to CLARA until she is off stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finally looks up , and , seeing she has gone , he turns to JACKSON , laughing heartily . JACKSON gets up and goes out into hall , pacing back and forth . ) She was waiting for me in the drug store on the corner . ( Goes C. and stops JACKSON as he is coming into room . ) Say , I 've got a real live knock-out surprise for you , young fellow . Pembroke was waiting at the hotel office . p. 98 JACKSON JONES ( L.C. ) He was ? ROBERT WALLACE That was his man he sent here . He knew we were leaving New York before we started . He was telephoned to from the Grand Central . That 's how skilfully they work in these days offrenzied finance . He did n't wait to take a train . He made it by motor . And just to show you what a smart little fellow you are for wanting to close at their price at two o'clock to-day , I , who represented myself as Henry Wilson , your secretary , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen hundred thousand dollars . He 's burning up every telephone and telegraph wire between here and Cleveland right now , and unless I miss my guess I 'm making you richer by several hundred thousand dollars , just proving to you the value of patience . ( WALLACE sits R. of table JACKSON L. of him , back table . ) Fiften hundred thousand dollars . A million and a half . ( Leans back in his chair complacently . ) What do you think of that ? JACKSON JONES Bob , I 've given this thing a whole lot of thought , and I ca n't sell this plant . ROBERT WALLACE You ca n't ! ( Great surprise  --  quickly sits up . ) JACKSON JONES ( Seriously ) You do n't know , you have n't heard . Why , just think what I 'd be selling . Now , you figure this thing out . ( Picks up gum from table , imitating JOSIE 'S speech . ) See this ? Here 's the thing my grandfather worked for and handed down to my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to me ! Now this is the thing I should work for and hand down to my children , and then to their children , and so on and so on . ( WALLACE pulls his chair back , thunderstruck. ) p. 99 ROBERT WALLACE Say , what the hell 's the matter with you ? ( Looking at JACKSON in amazement as curtain falls. ) @x SCENE : Business office of the Jones Chewing Gum Factory . Time : Morning . AT RISE of curtain HENRY , the stenographer , is seated at desk R. , writing . JOSIE enters from door upstage R.C. , places a book she carries on a filing desk upstage C. , then sits at desk . HENRY goes over R. to his typewriter . As soon as JOSIE is seated she touches buzzer in desk . SAMMY enters from door L. JOSIE RICHARDS ( Hands SAMMY a letter from desk C. ) Take this letter to Mr. Davis in the shipping department and tell him it 's a record of the last St. Louis shipment he asked for . Tell him to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and wants to see you . JOSIE RICHARDS Tell the Judge to come right in . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Goes to door L. and calls ) All right , Pa . Come on in . ( Crosses back of desk and exits door R. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from L. and goes to JOSIE 'S desk ) Good morning , Josie . How are you to-day ? p. 101 JOSIE RICHARDS Very well , Judge , thank you . ( HENRY , who is seated at his typewriter R. , comes to JOSIE with a letter to be signed which he has just taken from his machine . To JUDGE , as she signs paper ) Excuse me just a moment . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( L.C. ) Go right along . Do n't let me disturb you . HENRY HOPPER ( Standing R. of desk ) Good morning , Judge . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD How are you , my boy ? JOSIE RICHARDS Get that right off , Henry . Put a special on it  --  it 's important . HENRY HOPPER Yes , ma'am . ( Exits door R.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Hotel . JOSIE RICHARDS Did you see the young man ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Only for a minute . He was eating breakfast in his room and his valet was pressing his clothes . ( Laughs as he sits L. of desk , facing her . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Surprised ) His valet ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , he just got here this morning . It seems that both the young men came here without any baggage , so they telephoned the valet last evening to bring them on some clothes . p. 102 JOSIE RICHARDS He promised to be here at ten minutes past ten . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes , that 's what brought me over . He asked me to tell you he 'd be a little late . I guess he did n't sleep very well . He says he had a lot of horrible dreams . What sort of a talk did you have with him last night , anyway ? JOSIE RICHARDS Did n't he tell you ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD No , he left the house soon after you did . You must have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSIE RICHARDS I simply told him the true state of affairs and explained to him what the plant meant to the town . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD What did he say ? JOSIE RICHARDS Nothing much . He kept inquiring how much cash we had . He does n't seem to be much of a business man . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He struck me that way , too . Did he say the trust had made him an offer ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD That 's what I thought . Did he talk as if he intended to sell ? JOSIE RICHARDS I 'm afraid that 's what he 's thinking of , Judge . We must do all we can to influence him against it . p. 103 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Leans toward her ) You have influence with him , Josie . JOSIE RICHARDS Do you think so ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD I know it . ( Gets up and stands leaning on desk L. of it . ) You made a great impression on him . He likes you , Josie . JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , nonsense , Judge ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , after you left last night he just raved about your eyes ! JOSIE RICHARDS My eyes ! JUDGE SPOTSWOOD That 's what he did . He said you had the bluest eyes he 'd ever seen . JOSIE RICHARDS Why , Judge , my eyes are gray . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Are they ? ( Looks at her closely , surprised . ) Why , so they are . ( Walks away from her , perplexed . ) Well , what do you think of that ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Laughs ) Perhaps he 's color blind , Judge . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Maybe that 's what it is . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from door R.U. ) The foreman wants to know if he can see you about something . p. 104 JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , tell him I 'll see him in just a few minutes . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Opens door upstage and calls loudly ) She 'll see you in a few minutes , Mr. Higgins . ( Closes door and exits L. , leaving door slightly open . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Comes to L. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Josie . Nobody but us knows that the young fellow 's in town . He registered at the Grand under the name of Jackson . Do n't you think it would be a good thing to spread the news around the plant ? JOSIE RICHARDS Perhaps that would be a good idea . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Starts toward door upstage . ) Well , you leave it to me . I wo n't have to tell over one or two of them . You know how everything travels in this factory . I 'll stop on my way out and tell you what effect it has . ( By this time he is at door upstage . ) JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , Judge , do . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Opens door and sees HIGGINS outside . Turns to JOSIE ) Are you ready for Higgins ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , tell him to come in. p. 105 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Through open door to HIGGINS ) Miss Richards says all right , Joe . ( Holds door open for JOE , who enters and comes down R. ) How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruffly as he comes down R. ) I do n't feel well . ( JOSIE takes book up to filing desk as HIGGINS enters , then comes back and stands R. of desk . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD You never do , do you ? ( Laughs sarcastically and exits upstage door . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Standing R. of desk ) Well , what is it , Higgins ? JOE HIGGINS I want to ask you a question , Miss Richards . JOSIE RICHARDS Go right ahead . JOE HIGGINS ( Threatening ) I 'll expect you to tell me the truth , too . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Facing him ) I 'm not in the habit of lying . JOE HIGGINS ( Surly  --  vigorous ) I 'm speaking for every man in the plant . We had a meeting this morning , and we want to know whether this concern is going over to the trust or not . We decided that we 're entitled to some information , and that 's what I 'm here for  --  to find out what you know about it . p. 106 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Writes . ) JOE HIGGINS ( Surly ) Well , if you do n't , who does ? JOSIE RICHARDS I 'm sure I do n't know . JOE HIGGINS Well , we want an answer one way or the other . It 's our work and our living , and we 've got to know where we 're at . JOSIE RICHARDS You 'll have to get your information from the man who owns the plant . JOE HIGGINS ( Quickly ) Where 's he ? JOSIE RICHARDS He 's here in town . JOE HIGGINS Young Jones here in town ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , he 's stopping at the Grand Hotel . JOE HIGGINS When did he get here ? ( Over to JOSIE at desk . ) JOSIE RICHARDS Last evening . JOE HIGGINS ( Eager ) Have you seen him ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes . JOE HIGGINS ( Suspicious  --  surly ) He got here last evening , eh ? That settles it ! ( Goes down R. , then back to JOSIE . ) He came here with that trust fellow , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What trust fellow ? JOE HIGGINS Pembroke , one of the head men of the Consolidated . JOSIE RICHARDS Is Mr. Pembroke here in town ? JOE HIGGINS ( Wisely ) Oh , you did n't know that , eh ? JOSIE RICHARDS I certainly did not . JOE HIGGINS Well , he 's here . Several of the men saw him and recognized him . I suppose he 's here with Jones to close us out , is that it ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Coldly ) I do n't know any more about it than you do , Higgins . JOE HIGGINS ( A step R.  --  turns ) You say the young fellow 's stopping at the Grand ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes . JOE HIGGINS ( Suspicious ) Well , nobody there knows anything about it . JOSIE RICHARDS I believe he registered under another name . JOE HIGGINS ( Snarling , a step to her ) Well , what did he do that for ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Coldly ) How should I know ? p. 108 JOE HIGGINS ( Very vigorous  --  surly ) Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak . He knows it 's a rotten thing he 's doing and he 's afraid of the consequences . ( Goes down R.  --  turns threateningly ) The men are not in a very good temper . You mark my words , there 'll be the devil to pay around here before the day is over unless we get some satisfaction and find out exactly what he intends to do . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Coldly  --  looks up from writing ) I would n't talk that way if I were you , Higgins . JOE HIGGINS ( Surly ) Oh , you 're on their side , are you ? I thought so . ( Up to JOSIE . ) I never did believe in you . ( Down to R. , turns . ) I told the men that this morning . For all we know you 've been working for the interest of the trust all the time . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Rises  --  down R. to HIGGINS ) That will be about enough , Higgins . Now get out of this office ! JOE HIGGINS I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go ! JACKSON JONES ( Enters quietly from L. and goes directly to HIGGINS R.C. , passing in front of desk . To JOSIE ) Good morning . p. 109 JOSIE RICHARDS Good morning , Mr. Jones . ( Sits at desk . ) JOE HIGGINS ( As JACKSON gets up close to him ) Hello , Mr. Jones ! I did n't know you were in town . JACKSON JONES Yes , you did . Miss Richards just told you . I 've been standing out there listening to what you had to say . I remember you , Higgins . You always were a grouch and forever nosing into other people 's affairs . Now I want to tell you something . This plant belongs to me , and it 's nobody 's business whether I keep it or sell it or give it away , do you understand ? JOE HIGGINS ( In a surly tone ) Well , the men asked me to come here and get the information . JACKSON JONES They did n't ask you to come here and insult this girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , and I 'll throw you out of the plant , and I 'll drive you out of the town , if I hear any more red-fire talk out of you . The trust is n't going to buy this plant  --  it is n't for sale . You go and tell the men I said so . ( JOSIE sits up , interested . ) JOE HIGGINS ( Very apologetic  --  shuffling with hat in hand ) I 'm sorry I was hasty , Mr. Jones . I did n't mean to lose my temper . p. 110 JACKSON JONES You do n't want to lose your job , do you ? JOE HIGGINS No , sir . JACKSON JONES Then go on and get out of here . JOE HIGGINS Yes , sir . ( To JOSIE . ) I hope you 'll forgive me , Miss Richards . I know I 've got a rotten disposition , but my heart 's in the right place . JOSIE RICHARDS I understand . JOE HIGGINS I 'll tell the men what you said , Mr. Jones . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to them all . ( Starts whining . ) It 's made a different man out of me already . ( Cries . ) JACKSON JONES Well , what are you crying about ? JOE HIGGINS ( Weeping between words ) Because I 'm happy . It 's the first time I 've been happy in twenty years . ( Exits upstage , crying . ) JACKSON JONES Can you beat that ? He 's so mean he 's crying because he 's happy ! I wonder when he laughs ? ( JOSIE laughs . ) He 's a nice , cheerful little fellow . I 'd like to be around him a whole lot . ( Sits L. of desk. ) p. 111 JOSIE RICHARDS Did you have a good night 's rest ? JACKSON JONES Oh , my back is broken ! Who named that hotel ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Laughs ) The Grand ? JACKSON JONES ( Grimaces ) Oh , it 's an awful thing ! JOSIE RICHARDS Is it as bad as all that ? JACKSON JONES There are men in prison for doing less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you open your uncle 's home ? JACKSON JONES My uncle 's home ? JOSIE RICHARDS It 's a beautiful place . JACKSON JONES You do n't think it will be necessary for me to live in this town , do you ? JOSIE RICHARDS Well , the business will need your attention . JACKSON JONES Go right on with the business . Do n't pay any attention to me . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Goes upstage to filing desk with papers . JACKSON gets up while her back is turned and surreptitiously looks over papers and books on her desk . When he is seated again she returns to desk , standing R. of it . ) Have you thought of what we talked about last night ? p. 112 JACKSON JONES All I dreamed about was poverty-stricken families crying out for food . Thousands of men , women and children chased me through the streets , out of the town and into a wild forest where there was nothing but chewing-gum trees . ( JOSIE laughs and sits at desk . ) Oh , I had an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elks started to rehearse their minstrel show across the street , so I got up and ordered breakfast . Did you ever eat breakfast at the Grand ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Smiles ) No . JACKSON JONES I dare you ! ( Business  --  gesture signifies awful . ) JOSIE RICHARDS It 's the best hotel in town . All the theatrical troupes stop there . JACKSON JONES Well , they probably deserve it . I do n't know . It 's an awful thing ! JOSIE RICHARDS I 've worked all morning with the auditor on a statement which shows the year 's business up to the first of this month . ( Goes to JACKSON with trial balance sheet , holding it out to its full length for his inspection . ) Do you care to go over it now ? JACKSON JONES ( Appalled at the length of the paper ) No , not right now . Mr. Wallace has promised to do that for me. p. 113 JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , you mean your friend . ( Puts sheet back on desk . ) JACKSON JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to go to the barber shop . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Comes upstage and gets yellow papers from filing cabinet . Then comes back to desk before speaking . ) Do you know that Mr. Pembroke of the Consolidated is here in town ? JACKSON JONES Yes , I know it . JOSIE RICHARDS Did he come here with you ? JACKSON JONES No , he followed me here . JOSIE RICHARDS Have you seen him ? JACKSON JONES No , but Mr. Wallace saw him last night and turned down his offer , too . JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , I 'm so glad ! ( Sits at desk . ) JACKSON JONES ( Gets up ) We gave him to understand we would n't sell for less than a million and a half . We expect him here at eleven o'clock with his answer . ( Puts his chair upstage L.C. , then comes down L. of desk . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Faces him ) But you just sent word to the men that  --   --  p. 114 JACKSON JONES Oh , do n't be afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins . I do n't mind telling you that when I came here yesterday my intention was to sell this business and get it off my hands at any price or sacrifice , but Rockefeller could n't buy it this morning if he offered me every dollar he 's got in the world . Mr. Wallace and I sat up talking it over until two o'clock this morning . I told him everything you said and went over the whole situation with him . I promised to take his advice , and he 's convinced me that the right thing for me to do is to stick right here and put up a fight for these people the same as my uncle did . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Feelingly ) I knew you would ! JACKSON JONES Did you ? ( Crosses in front of desk to R. of it  --  turns upon her  --  speech-making style , very earnest ) Now I do n't know anything about business and I do n't know anything about money . I never did a day 's work in my life , for the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've entered into in the last five years is a contest to see who could stay up the longest . I 've never done anything good before because I 've never had anything good to do . What I 've needed all along  --  what I 've needed all along  --  was an incentive  --  that 's what I 've needed , an incentive , something to inspire me , something to spur me on  --  to bring me to a realization of  --  to bring me to a realization of  --  can you beat that ? ( Takes written speech from his pocket and hands it to JOSIE . ) I knew that thing by heart when I left the hotel . Read the rest of it , will you ? ( JOSIE laughs and starts reading it . ) Wallace wrote that . He thought I could learn it . Not a chance in the world ! p. 115 SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from L. quickly ) Are you too busy for company ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Turns  --  facing him ) Who is it , Sammy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON inquiringly . JACKSON goes up R.C. ) JACKSON JONES Tell them to come in . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Goes to door L. and calls ) All right , Mom . Come on in . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Enters with CLARA from L. and goes over toward JOSIE ) Good morning , Josie . JOSIE RICHARDS ( Nods , rises ) Good morning , Mrs. Spotswood . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Sees JACKSON over R.C. and crosses to him , passing in front of desk . JACKSON comes down stage R. and he and MRS . SPOTSWOOD meet R.C. , front of desk . CLARA goes to JOSIE and the two girls talk in pantomime . ) Oh , hello , Broadway . I 'm awfully glad to see you here in the plant . Did you have a good night 's rest ? p. 116 JACKSON JONES How do I look ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD Grand ! JACKSON JONES Do n't mention the name , please . ( CLARA upstage L.C. ) MRS .

SPOTSWOOD I thought he would be . We were down town shopping , and I thought we 'd drop in . ( Aside to JOSIE , first turning to see if JACKSON is looking . ) Anything new ? ( JOSIE and MRS . SPOTSWOOD talk in pantomime during following . ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Trifle gushily ) Do you expect Mr. Wallace here ? p. 117 JACKSON JONES Yes , he 'll be right along . CLARA SPOTSWOOD You know , I think he 's an awfully nice fellow . JACKSON JONES ( Stringing her ) Do you really ? I 'll tell him you said that . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Yes . He treated to ice-cream soda last night and bought me a box of chocolates , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what he does with his money . CLARA SPOTSWOOD He does n't ? JACKSON JONES No , he spent over thirty-two dollars one night . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Shakes her head ) He must have just thrown it away . ( Cheering heard outside in plant . All turn and look upstage . CLARA goes up to door R.C. Opens it and stands there for a moment looking out . ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Turns to JOSIE , startled ) What 's that ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Surprised ) I do n't know , I 'm sure . ( She goes up to door R.C. , looks out and then comes down to L. of desk . As she goes to door , CLARA comes down L. of desk and MRS . SPOTSWOOD goes up to L. of door upstage. ) p. 118 MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( To JOSIE , as the latter crosses to L. of desk ) What is it ? JOSIE RICHARDS I do n't know . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Enters upstage R.C. in great excitement and stands R.C. ) Great Scott ! Talk about excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( R.C. , very excited ) Did you send a message out there by Higgins ? JACKSON JONES Yes . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Well , that 's why they 're cheering . The men are yelling and the boys are dancing  --  you 'd think Bedlam had broken loose . They 're hollering for you , Broadway . Come out and let them see you . JACKSON JONES ( Holds back ) No , not now , please ! ( One cheer heard outside . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Listen to that ! MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Over to JACKSON ) Oh , do go out and say something , Broadway . JACKSON JONES I ca n't say anything . I never made a speech in my life . ( By this time he has worked to R. of desk. ) p. 119 JOSIE RICHARDS ( Comes below desk and hands JACKSON speech he gave her . ) Read this to them . ( Cheers outside , which keep up until JACKSON is well offstage , then loud applause , then one big cheer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --   --  JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Oh , come on . It 'll make them all feel good . ( MRS . SPOTSWOOD and the JUDGE coax JACKSON to door , all talking ad lib . When JACKSON gets up to door , he stands irresolute for a moment , then squares his shoulders and goes out , followed by the JUDGE , MRS . SPOTSWOOD and JOSIE . CLARA stands at open door looking out , then closes it . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from L. ) What 's all the hollering about , Clara ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD Mr. Jones is going to make a speech . ( Goes over to L. of desk , passing back of it . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD A speech ! ( Rushes upstage R.C. , passing front of desk . ) Gosh , I 've got to hear that ! ( Runs out of upstage door R.C. to L. ) p. 120 ROBERT WALLACE ( Enters from door L. ) Oh , hello ! CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Turns smiling ) How do you do , Mr. Wallace ? You did n't expect to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly . This is an unexpected pleasure . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Mr. Jones will be back in a few minutes . He went out in the works to make a speech . ROBERT WALLACE ( Startled ) To make a speech ! ( Backs away L. , laughing heartily , then goes over front , extreme R. , and places his hat on rack near door R.C. CLARA follows him over as he goes , stopping in front of desk C. ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD Well , you should have heard them cheering ! That 's more noise than this town has ever heard before . ROBERT WALLACE Yes , I dare say it is . ( Comes down to CLARA in front of desk , R. of her . ) Funny , I was thinking of you as I passed the drug store now . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Little bashfully ) That 's strange ! I 've been thinking of you , too . p. 121 ROBERT WALLACE Have you , really ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD Yes . Oh , the chocolates were fine . I ate them all before I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you do . ROBERT WALLACE ( Thunderstruck ) What ! CLARA SPOTSWOOD Mr. Jones told me you were a regular spendthrift . ( WALLACE backs away from her down R. ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Gets wise ) When did he tell you that ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD Just a little while ago . He said you spent over thirty-two dollars one night . ROBERT WALLACE ( Gets the humor of it ) Oh , did he tell you about that night ? CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Finger up ) Yes , and you must n't waste it that way , either . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from R.C. door upstage , laughing  --  quickly , at door looks C. ) He 's going all through the works , shakin ' hands with everybody ! CLARA SPOTSWOOD Who ? Mr. Jones ? SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Crossing back of desk to L. ) Yes . Gosh ! He was afraid to make a speech . I wish I had a chance to make a speech . I bet I would n't be afraid . If ever I amount to anything , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech about myself . p. 122 ROBERT WALLACE ( Laughs as he sits in chair R. ) You 've got the right idea , Sammy . SAM SPOTSWOOD You bet I 've got the right idea . I 've got some darned good ideas if I ever get a chance to develop them . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Oh , Sammy ! Shut up talking about yourself . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Takes a couple of steps toward her ) You shut up yourself ! You do n't understand me . There 's more to me than you think . I 've got a brain , I have . ( WALLACE and CLARA exchange amused looks . ) ROBERT WALLACE You never can tell , maybe he has . SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Angrily ) I 'll surprise you all some day , see if I do n't . ( Exits L. , slamming door . ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Goes over to WALLACE . He gets up as she starts for him . ) Ai n't that funny ! He really thinks he 's going to be a big man . ROBERT WALLACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's liable to fall away to nothing . ( Up close to CLARA . ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Giggling ) Oh , I see what you mean ! You 're always joking , are n't you ? p. 123 ROBERT WALLACE ( Kidding her , takes her hand ) Are n't I the cut-up , though ? ( They stand laughing and swinging hands . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Entering from upstage door R.C. , and as she notices their intimate attitude , she coughs to attract their attention ) Ahem ! ( WALLACE and CLARA separate , confused , CLARA going L. and WALLACE over R. ) ROBERT WALLACE Good morning , Miss Richards . JOSIE RICHARDS ( At R. of desk , upper end ) How do you do , Mr. Wallace ? ( Going toward desk C. ) Mr. Jones is causing quite a sensation out in the works . ( Sits  --  writes . ) ROBERT WALLACE So I understand . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Crosses over to WALLACE R. ) Shall I tell him you 're here ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Smiles ) I wish you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Not at all . I 'll be only too pleased . ( Looks to see if JOSIE is listening before next line . ) Nobody ever calls me anything but Clara . p. 124 ROBERT WALLACE ( Aside ) Oh , you Clara ! CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Giggling , backs up R.C. ) I 'll tell him right away . ROBERT WALLACE I wish you would . ( Follows her up . ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Upstage , giggling ) Good-bye . ROBERT WALLACE Good-bye , good-bye . ( CLARA exits upstage giggling . To JOSIE ) Has Mr. Pembroke called ? JOSIE RICHARDS No . Mr. Jones was saying he expected him at eleven o'clock . ROBERT WALLACE ( Looking at watch ) Yes . Well , he 's got a few minutes yet . ( Sits R. of desk . ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( To WALLACE ) Mr. Jones told me of the advice you gave him . We have a great deal to thank you for , I 'm sure of that . ROBERT WALLACE I do n't see why . He 's only doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same . Of course , my influence may have had some bearing on his decision , but believe me , his mind was fully made up when you got through with him last night . p. 125 JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , it means so much to so many . ( Goes toward R. door . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Thinks a moment , goes C. , then back to R. ) Anyway , I think he 'd be a fool to sell . JOSIE RICHARDS You do ? ( Turns to WALLACE . ) ROBERT WALLACE Certainly . A proposition that showed the profit that this did last year without any advertising ! Why , it 's wonderful ! I know what I 'm talking about . I 'm with the biggest advertising firm in New York City . JOSIE RICHARDS But we could n't afford to advertise except in a small way , and the big firms would n't handle a petty contract . ROBERT WALLACE Why did n't you try the Empire ? JOSIE RICHARDS We did . They refused to handle us at all . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess that 's the reason . ROBERT WALLACE Oh , no . We do n't make agreements of that kind . No corporation can dictate to us . The Empire 's my firm , my Guv'nor 's the president . JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , well , then perhaps you know all about it . ROBERT WALLACE ( Thinks ) You say they refused to handle your work ? p. 126 JOSIE RICHARDS Absolutely . ROBERT WALLACE ( Thinks a moment , rises , then goes to ' phone on desk . ) May I use your ' phone ? JOSIE RICHARDS Certainly . ROBERT WALLACE ( At ' phone ) Long distance . ( To JOSIE ) You know that 's a pretty rotten trick if it 's so  --  to squeeze the little fellow out like that . You 're sure it was the Empire ? JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , we tried all the big advertising firms . ROBERT WALLACE There is n't any other big advertising firm . If there was , we 'd whip it over to the Empire in pretty quick shape ! ( In ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York  --  444 Spring . Mr. Grover Wallace . Just a minute . ( To JOSIE ) What is this number ? JOSIE RICHARDS Two-two Main . ROBERT WALLACE ( In ' phone ) Two-two Main  --  the Jones plant  --  all right . ( Hangs up receiver , rises and goes over R.C. , thinking . ) There must be some mistake about this , Miss Richards . JOSIE RICHARDS I have all the correspondence if you care to see it . p. 127 ROBERT WALLACE I 'd like to very much . ( Goes toward JOSIE . ) JOSIE RICHARDS I 'll look it up in a very few minutes . Excuse me . ( Starts to exit R. ) ( WALLACE goes over L. of desk . OUTSIDE : " What 's the matter with Broadway ?  --  He 's all right ! " This is repeated three times with cheers . As JOSIE exits R. she meets JACKSON coming in from upstage door R.C. The JUDGE and MRS . SPOTSWOOD follow JACKSON on . ) JACKSON JONES ( Enters waving his handkerchief ) I 've shaken hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Crosses in front of desk to L. , speaking to WALLACE ) Hello , Mr. Wallace . ROBERT WALLACE ( L. of C. table ) How are you , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Why did n't you come out and see all the fun ? MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( R. ) You ought to feel very proud , Broadway . It was a grand reception . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Comes down stage to R. of desk ) I should say it was . p. 128 JACKSON JONES ( Down L. to WALLACE . Aside ) Funny Pembroke is n't here . ROBERT WALLACE He 'll be along . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Are you going to stay here , Judge ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Crossing back of desk toward R. ) For a while . I 'll be home at twelve . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Starts L. , passing front of desk ) Come on , Clara . We 've got to get up town . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Following MRS . SPOTSWOOD ) I 'll be right with you , Mom . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Wallace . Broadway 's coming . I 've invited Miss Richards , too . ROBERT WALLACE Thank you . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( To WALLACE L. of desk ) You 're surely coming to supper ? ROBERT WALLACE Yes . CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Holds up finger ) That 's an appointment , is n't it ? ROBERT WALLACE It 's a godsend. p. 129 MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( To JACKSON when she is standing in doorway L. ) What would you like with your supper , Broadway , tea or coffee ? JACKSON JONES ( Smiles ) I 'll take some of your lemonade , if you do n't mind . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Laughs ) You shall have it . Come on , Clara . ( Exits L. ) CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( Starts toward door L. ) I 'm coming . ( To WALLACE , as she gets to door L. ) Good-bye , Bob ! ROBERT WALLACE Eh ? ( Looks at her in surprise . ) Oh , good-bye , Clara ! CLARA SPOTSWOOD Good-bye . ( Exits L. giggling . ) JACKSON JONES ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking at his watch ) Just . JACKSON JONES ( Over to WALLACE L.C. ) What are we going to say to this fellow Pembroke when he gets here ? ROBERT WALLACE Now remember , I told you to let me handle him . He thinks I 'm your secretary , anyway . p. 130 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Drops down R.C. ) If you boys want to talk things over I 'll skip along . JACKSON JONES ( Turns to L. of desk ) No , stay right here , Judge . We may need a lawyer . ROBERT WALLACE We 're just waiting for Pembroke , that 's all . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Pembroke ? Oh , yes , some of the men told me he was in town . ( Sits in chair R. of desk  --  pulls chair out to R.C. ) What 's he coming here for ? ( JACKSON sits in chair at back of desk . ) ROBERT WALLACE To try to give us a whole lot of money . ( Stands L. of desk . ) But we 're not going to take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we ? JACKSON JONES ( Seated at desk in JOSIE 'S chair ) Do n't make me laugh . I did n't sleep well . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD You 've made the people of this town very happy to-day , my boy . They owe you a great debt . JACKSON JONES Please do n't talk about debts , will you , Judge ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Looking around him ) The old gentleman has pretty nice offices here , Judge . p. 131 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Yes . Seems strange , though , not to see him sitting at that desk . First old Oscar Jones sat there and he died ; then John sat there and he died ; then Andrew sat there and he died ; and now  --   --  JACKSON JONES ( Gets up and goes to chair L. of filing desk , upstage ) That 's the last time I 'll ever sit there . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Every man in the plant loved the old gentleman . They all feel awful bad . Just think , he was alive forty-eight hours ago , and now the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes toward door L. ) JOE HIGGINS ( Enters excitedly from upstage and goes toward JACKSON , who comes toward R. as HIGGINS enters . JOSIE enters and stands back of JUDGE . HENRY follows her on and sits at typewriter R. ) Excuse me , Mr. Jones . The men want to know if you have any objections to them celebrating to-night . They 're thinking of having a torch-light procession and fireworks in honor of your arrival . Is it all right ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Gets up ) That 's a bully idea ! JOSIE RICHARDS Why , Judge ! p. 132 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Turns to JOSIE , surprised ) What 's the matter ? JOSIE RICHARDS ( Turns L. toward HIGGINS ) Higgins , you tell the men to do nothing of the kind . Do n't they realize what happened ? How can they forget so quickly ? JOE HIGGINS Oh , that 's so . I 'll have to remind them of that . ( Exits door upstage R.C. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD By George , I forgot all about it myself ! ( Goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT WALLACE ( Over to JACKSON , who is standing above desk ) The King is dead ! Long live the King ! JACKSON JONES Get away from me ! ( Pushes WALLACE away L. ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Steps forward to WALLACE and hands him papers ) Here are those letters , Mr. Wallace . ( Starts R. slowly . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Crosses to her ) It 's the Empire , all right . I know the pink paper . ( Is about to examine papers when SAMMY enters ) p. 133 SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from L. ) Mr. Pembroke and Mr. Leary to see Mr. Jones . ( At this announcement JOSIE stops dead up R. ) JACKSON JONES Tell them to come right in . ( Goes L. near door a step . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD Yes , sir . ( Exits L. ) ROBERT WALLACE Judge , did you ever see a man refuse to take a million and a half ? ( Goes up R. ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Not yet . ROBERT WALLACE ( Points to JACKSON ) Well , watch the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that desk and look business-like . JACKSON JONES ( L. of desk ) In that chair ? Not after what he said . JOSIE RICHARDS ( To JACKSON ) Shall I go ? JACKSON JONES No , please do n't . ROBERT WALLACE You 'd better remain , Miss Richards . ( Goes up to her . ) ( PEMBROKE enters from L. and stands near door , followed by LEARY , who stands back of him . WALLACE and JOSIE are standing in front of filing desk . The JUDGE is R. ) p. 134 JACKSON JONES How do you do , Mr. Pembroke ? PETER PEMBROKE Mr. Jones . ( Bows . ) JACKSON JONES ( Crosses back of desk ) Sit right down there . ( Points to chair at desk . ) PETER PEMBROKE No , thank you . JACKSON JONES He 's on ! PETER PEMBROKE ( Bowing to each as their name is called ) Judge  --  Miss Richards  --  Mr. Wilson , I 've met . ( They acknowledge salutation by bowing . ) JUDGE and JOSIE . ( Together ) Wilson ! ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , that 's my name . PETER PEMBROKE ( Turns L. toward his stenographer JOHN ) Mr. Leary . ( LEARY bows , sits on stool by door L. , and takes out stenographer 's notebook . ) Take the entire conversation , John . ( JACKSON comes down stage R. of PEMBROKE . ) JOHN LEARY Yes , sir . JACKSON JONES ( Watches LEARY taking out his notebook , then looks over at HENRY , who is sitting R. at typewriter . He points to him and says to JOSIE ) Is he a stenographer ? p. 135 JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , sir . ( Calling ) Henry . HENRY HOPPER ( Rises ) Yes , sir . JACKSON JONES Take the entire conversation , Henry . HENRY HOPPER Yes , sir . ( Reaches for his notebook . ) PETER PEMBROKE Are we to talk in the presence of all here ? JACKSON JONES I 'm satisfied if you are . Sit down , Judge . ( JUDGE sits in chair down R.C. WALLACE and JOSIE are leaning against filing desk up R.C. JACKSON stands L. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. door . ) PETER PEMBROKE Very well . Mr. Jones , I am not in the habit of doing business through hirelings . Your Mr. Wilson , your secretary as he represents himself to be  --  and whose impertinence , by the way , is beyond description  --  has had the audacity to state that I should have to do business through him or not at all . JACKSON JONES ( Earnestly ) Those were my instructions . PETER PEMBROKE I should like to understand the reason for so unusual an arrangement ? p. 136 JACKSON JONES Well , you want to buy something I own . He 's the salesman , that 's all . ( Points to WALLACE upstage . ) John Wanamaker owns a store , but he does n't wait on the customers , does he ? Ha , ha , ha ! ( Laughs boisterously , then turns quickly to WALLACE ) How was that ? ROBERT WALLACE You 're immense , on the square ! PETER PEMBROKE ( Indignantly , to JACKSON ) You are flippant , sir ! You gave me your word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock yesterday afternoon . The price was settled and agreed upon by both of us . I returned by appointment with my solicitors and papers ready to sign , and upon inquiring from an insolent butler as to your whereabouts , I received the information that you were on your way to Egypt , and that the only word you left for me was a profane request that I go to  --  well , never mind . Believing you to be a man of integrity  --  unfortunately for me  --  I had no witness present at the binding of the bargain . Still , I ask you now , as a man , is your word worthless ? JACKSON JONES ( Leans over desk ) Yes , when I 'm doing business with unscrupulous people . PETER PEMBROKE ( Turning to LEARY ) Have you got that , John ? p. 137 JOHN LEARY Yes , sir . JACKSON JONES ( Looks over at HENRY ) Got that , Henry ? HENRY HOPPER Yes , sur . JACKSON JONES ( A pause , then hesitatingly to PEMBROKE , gathering strength as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football business methods yesterday and agreed to sell , I was n't aware of the low , contemptible tricks your company had stooped to in the endeavor to put my poor uncle out of business . I did n't know it was the result of the business blows you 'd dealt him that sent him to his grave . I did n't know it was the purpose of the company with which I was dealing to throw out of work hundreds of men that eked an existence from the very thing I was selling . Lots of things I did n't know yesterday , Mr. Pembroke . But I 've found them all out since , and that 's why I broke my word . ( Smashes desk , with his fist . ) You did n't think I could talk like that , did you ? ( To WALLACE ) How was it ? ROBERT WALLACE Great ! JACKSON JONES ( To PEMBROKE ) Go on now , you say something . Tell you what I 'll do with you . I 'll talk you for a thousand dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price is  --   --  p. 138 JACKSON JONES The salesman will quote the prices . I 'm the owner . ( Motions to WALLACE to come down to table . The latter comes down pompously and stands R. of table , opposite PEMBROKE . JACKSON steps directly back of table , between the two men . ) PETER PEMBROKE ( Comes to L. of desk , facing WALLACE . ) I do n't consider any commercial trade mark worth a million and a half of dollars . ROBERT WALLACE Neither do I. PETER PEMBROKE ( Slowly and coldly ) Still , even in business we sometimes desire to satisfy our pride . It has always been the ambition of our company to control this output . For ten years we have tried to absorb it into the Consolidated without success . I have communicated with my people in Ohio , and while we feel and know the price to be highly exorbitant , we have decided to take it over , and I am prepared to buy . ROBERT WALLACE ( Slowly and emphatically ) Well , we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to your terms . ROBERT WALLACE I heard everything you said . PETER PEMBROKE I do n't quite gather your meaning . p. 139 ROBERT WALLACE No , and you 're not going to gather our chewing gum , either . We 're not going to sell . We 're going to fight . You have n't a tottering old man to deal with now , but a youth full of fire and fight and energy and ambition . Look ! ( Points dramatically to JACKSON , who straightens up and tries to look impressive . ) We have an article that on its own merits has stood up under almost impossible competition . We have the goods to deliver and we 're going to fight and beat you at your own game . We 're going to make you take your own medicine , Mr. Pembroke . We 're going to make you compete with us . We 're going to advertise as no article was ever advertised before . We 're going to post and plaster from one end of the country to the other . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to do , and we 're in a position to do it . JACKSON JONES ( To PEMBROKE ) What do you think of that ! PETER PEMBROKE We spend a million dollars a year advertising , Mr. Wilson . ROBERT WALLACE No , you do n't ! I know what you spend better than you do yourself . And my name is n't Wilson , and I 'm not Mr. Jones 's secretary . Here 's my name and here 's my business . ( Hands PEMBROKE his card . ) PETER PEMBROKE ( Takes card , reads it , then looks at WALLACE incredulously ) You mean the Empire Advertising Company is behind this concern ? p. 140 ROBERT WALLACE That 's just what I mean , and we 're going to do five times as much advertising as you ever did at about one-tenth the cost . PETER PEMBROKE Then my people do no more business with the Empire . ROBERT WALLACE All right . Then see how much outdoor advertising you get this side of the Rocky Mountains ! PETER PEMBROKE Very well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns toward L. Gets to door , then comes back and points his finger menacingly at JACKSON 'S face . ) You mark my word , Mr. Jones ! You 'll be glad to do business with us before another year has passed . JACKSON JONES All right . Come around and see me in about a year . I may want to buy your company . PETER PEMBROKE ( Turns angrily to door ) Come , John . ( Exits L. JOHN starts after him . ) JACKSON JONES ( Calling to JOHN as he starts to follow PEMBROKE off ) Say , John ! ( JOHN turns and looks at JACKSON . ) Take down that last one I said . I thought it was a corker ! ( JOHN smiles and exits door L. ) p. 141 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Gets up ) I 'd give ten years of my life sooner than have missed that ! JOSIE RICHARDS ( Enthusiastically ) It was all wonderful . ( Comes down R. of desk . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( To JOSIE ) Have the boy make carbon copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exits R. , HENRY following . ) JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Incriminating , every word of it ! ROBERT WALLACE ( To JACKSON ) Did n't I tell you I 'd scare the life out of him ? JACKSON JONES I was n't so bad myself , was I ? JUDGE SPOTSWOOD ( Starts for door upstage ) I 'll tell Higgins . He 'll spread the news in a jiffy . ROBERT WALLACE That 's a good idea . Go on . ( Goes upstage , urging the JUDGE off , then comes downstage C. to JACKSON . ) Well , what do you think of it ? JACKSON JONES It 's a good plot , but how are we going to play it ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , it 's the biggest cinch in the world . If this plant showed the profit they say it did last year , I 'll bet you that  --  ( Telephone . Starts for ' phone as it rings . ) I 'll answer that . p. 142 JACKSON JONES You want to do everything now , do n't you ? ROBERT WALLACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously ) Hello , hello ! Oh , hello , Guv'nor ! This is Bob . Yes , I called up . I 'm up here in Connecticut Oh , no , strictly business . Say , Guv'nor , I can get a big contract from the Jones Pepsin people . ( JACKSON sits on desk , dumfounded at this statement . ) They 're going in heavy , I hear . I can close the deal , right away . What do you think . New owners take possession today . Yes , they 're all right . I looked them up . Well , will you let me use my own judgment about that ? I think I 'll make a splendid deal . Say , Guv'nor , will you send me a wire authorizing me to sign the contract ? Thanks . No , I wo n't be back until to-morrow . ( Hangs up receiver . ) JACKSON JONES ( Going over C. to L. of desk ) See here ! What are you going to do ? ROBERT WALLACE ( Going down R. of desk ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going back to-morrow and cover New York for a starter . JACKSON JONES ( Both are now standing C. in front of desk ) Where 's all this money coming from ? What are you trying to do , ruin me ? p. 143 ROBERT WALLACE I 'll draw the contract and give you a year to pay for it . You 'll be the best advertised article in America in a month . JACKSON JONES But Great Scott ! I ca n't afford to take a chance like that , Bob . I do n't know anything about this chewing gum business . ROBERT WALLACE Say , will you give me all you make over a million in the next two years if I give you this advertising free ? JACKSON JONES ( Astounded  --  quickly ) Over a million ! I should say I will ! ROBERT WALLACE Shake hands with your partner . ( WALLACE and JACKSON shake . ) This will be the quickest , softest and first important money I ever made . JACKSON JONES Do you mean it ? ROBERT WALLACE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean it ? ROBERT WALLACE You bet I 'm sure . JACKSON JONES Bob , this is the happiest minute of my life ! ( They stand shaking hands as SAM enters . ) SAM SPOTSWOOD ( Enters from L. ) Mrs. Gerard to see Mr. Jones . p. 144 JACKSON JONES ( Grabs WALLACE , clinging to him in his fright ) Mrs. Gerard ! ROBERT WALLACE ( Yells at SAMMY ) Tell her to wait ! SAM SPOTSWOOD The gentleman wants to see you first . JACKSON JONES Gentleman ? What gentleman ? SAM SPOTSWOOD Mr. Rankin . JACKSON JONES Rankin ! Tell the gentleman to come in , but have the lady wait . ( Shoves SAMMY over toward door L. ) SAM SPOTSWOOD Yes , sir . ( Exits L. , leaving door partly open . ) JACKSON JONES Mrs. Gerard , where the deuce did she come from ? How did she know I was here ? ( RANKIN enters from L. ) ROBERT WALLACE ( Points to RANKIN ) There 's Rankin now . RANKIN Mrs. Gerard 's here , sir . JACKSON JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she come from ? RANKIN She did n't say . She got to the hotel five minutes ago , and demanded to be brought to you . I could n't help it , sir . p. 145 JACKSON JONES Great Scott ! What am I going to do ? I 've got to get her away from here . I 've simply got to get her out of town ! ( Tears from L. to L.C. , desperately excited . ) ROBERT WALLACE I 'll get rid of her somehow . Go on , hurry up ! Take it on the run ! JACKSON JONES You bet I will ! ( Grabs hat and cane from desk near L. door , then rushes over R. , passing in front of desk just as JOSIE enters from R. door , dressed for the street . ) JOSIE RICHARDS Why , where are you going ? JACKSON JONES Any place . Where are you going ? JOSIE RICHARDS I 'm going to dinner . JACKSON JONES Come on . I 'll go with you . ( Grabs JOSIE by the arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lib . ) Let 's go out this way . I love to walk through the works . ROBERT WALLACE ( Sits at desk and touches button . SAMMY enters from L. ) All right . Show the lady in . SAM SPOTSWOOD Yes , sir . ( Exits L. , leaving the door open. ) p. 146 RANKIN ( Who has been standing up L. ) Shall I go , sir ? ROBERT WALLACE Stay where you are . ( MRS . GERARD enters from L. , out of breath . WALLACE gets up and advances to meet her , apparently surprised . ) ROBERT WALLACE Why , Mrs. Gerard , what are you doing here ? I know you 're looking for Jackson . He 's on his way to the depot . He 's going to make that eleven-forty to New York . I think you can catch him if you run all the way . ( As GERARD exits on a run he calls after her ) But you 'll have to run all the way ! ( Turns quickly to RANKIN , speaking quickly and excitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get her on that train if you have to bind and gag her . And do n't lose sight of her until you see her safely landed in New York , do you understand ? RANKIN Yes , sir . ROBERT WALLACE Well , go on ! ( WALLACE pushes RANKIN off stage L. , the latter closing the door . Cheering heard off stage . JUDGE enters from door upstage R. , smiling . ) ROBERT WALLACE ( To the JUDGE ) Well , what are they cheering about now ? p. 147 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Broadway is making a speech . ( Motions to WALLACE to come upstage . ) ROBERT WALLACE Making a speech !

ROBERT WALLACE You told me over the ' phone that I could use my own judgment . GROVER WALLACE Well , I did n't suppose I was talking to a crazy man . Do you know you 've guaranteed to cover every eastern and middle west state at a price that would n't pay for Pennsylvania alone ? What the devil do you mean by making a statement to the Consolidated Gum people that the Empire was behind the Jones Company ? ROBERT WALLACE Why , I was bluffing them , that 's all . GROVER WALLACE And for what purpose , sir ?

JACKSON JONES Yes , and I think I know what it is. p. 158 JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Something the young fellow did ? JACKSON JONES I 'm afraid so . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Nothing wrong ? JACKSON JONES I hope not . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD Oh , I 'm sure it ca n't be . If I 'm any judge of character , that young man is incapable of anything but good . He 's a great friend of yours , my boy . ( MRS . SPOTSWOOD enters , carrying JUDGE 'S hat , followed by CLARA and JOSIE . ) JACKSON JONES I should say he is . MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( Over R. to JUDGE ) Come on , Pa . We 've got to get home .

( JOSIE and CLARA are standing in front of steps. ) p. 159 CLARA SPOTSWOOD ( To JACKSON ) Where 's Mr. Wallace ? JACKSON JONES He went to take a stroll with his father .

SPOTSWOOD ) You do n't mind if Clara stays over a while , do you ? ( To JOSIE ) You 're not in a hurry , are you , Miss Richards ? JOSIE RICHARDS Why , no , I  --   --  JACKSON JONES Oh , please do n't go . I ca n't bear to be left alone . MRS . SPOTSWOOD Well , you girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back .

( To CLARA , sternly ) Half-past eight , Clara . p. 161 CLARA SPOTSWOOD All right , Pa . ( Goes to JACKSON R. ) MRS . SPOTSWOOD ( As she and the JUDGE exit through gate R. ) What Sammy needs is a good talking to . JUDGE SPOTSWOOD He 'll outgrow these things . MRS . SPOTSWOOD The only thing he 'll outgrow is his old clothes . It keeps me poor dressing him the way I do . He 's just as mean , etc. , etc . ( Ad lib. as they exit through gate R. ) JACKSON JONES ( To CLARA , laughing ) Your brother is the cause of all this . CLARA SPOTSWOOD Pa said Mr. Wallace 's father was angry about something . Was he ? JACKSON JONES Well , he was n't exactly in the best of humor . I guess it was nothing serious , though . CLARA SPOTSWOOD I wish I could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ( She goes upstage to gate and looks off R. ) JOSIE RICHARDS ( Goes over to JACKSON near bench ) Do you think it was the advertising contract that brought Mr. Wallace here ? p. 162 JACKSON JONES I do n't think there 's any doubt about it . JOSIE RICHARDS I thought it was a pretty liberal agreement . JACKSON JONES Liberal ! It was criminal ! I told Bob that , when he fixed it up . I do n't blame the old gentleman at all . Did you enjoy the dinner ? JOSIE RICHARDS Very much indeed . JACKSON JONES Did you really ? You must come over often . JOSIE RICHARDS Thanks .

She calls him Bob and he calls her Clara . p. 163 JOSIE RICHARDS Yes , I noticed that . JACKSON JONES Did you notice it ? I did n't think you noticed it . ( Looks around at house and grounds . ) Nice little home , is n't it ? JOSIE RICHARDS Oh , I just love it ! JACKSON JONES Do you ? JOSIE RICHARDS Why , yes . Do n't you ? JACKSON JONES Sure .
