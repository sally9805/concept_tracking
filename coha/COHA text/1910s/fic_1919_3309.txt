Produced by William Coon THE NOBLE LORD A Comedy In One Act By PERCIVAL WILDE The Noble Lord CHARACTERS HE . SHE . PETERS . THE NOBLE LORD A secluded spot in the Maine woods in the neighborhood of a summer hotel . It is the middle of July . The trees are covered with foliage , a hot sun casts dancing shadows upon the mossy ground , and the air is full of the twittering of birds and the rustle of leaves . A winding path crosses from one side to the other , and near the center is a little clearing : the stump of a felled tree , with the lichen-covered trunk itself near it , and a patch of grassy turf . The eye can not penetrate far through the riotously growing underbrush , but as one looks upwards , to the left , a thinning of foliage , allowing a glimpse of the sky , gives evidence of the near proximity of some small body of water . As the curtain rises the scene is empty . There is only the song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a few seconds nothing else is heard . Then , suddenly , not far away , there is the sound of a splash , followed by the scream of a drowning woman , " Help ! Help ! Help ! " There is a tremendous crashing through the underbrush , and another voice , very masculine , very English , shouts , " Where are you ? Where are you ? " Rather indefinitely the first speaker answers , " Here ! Help ! Help ! " Another crashing through the underbrush , followed by a second splash , and presently , after a short pause , there enters upon the stage a tall , much bedraggled Englishman , bearing in his arms the motionless body of an extremely good-looking girl . Both of them are very wet , and a trail of water marks their progress across the scene . Reaching the clearing , the Englishman methodically deposits the girl on the ground , backs away a foot or so , and notices that his hands are wet . He reaches into a hip pocket and draws forth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a gesture of vexation he throws it away , and gives his attention to the girl . He looks at her quizzically ; then , rather timidly , he kneels at her side , and lays his ear over her heart . He rises promptly with a satisfied nod , carefully removes his dripping coat , folds it neatly , and places it on the log . Again he kneels , this time with his knees on either side of the girl 's head , and laboriously begins to apply the Sylvester method , counting audibly as he does so . At " ten " he stops wearily , pauses , and again applies his ear to her heart . The result is evidently pleasing , and after a few more Sylvester movements , he begins to vary the procedure by removing her shoes and alternately chafing her hands and feet . Presently she sighs deeply . For the third time he pauses to listen to her heart . Slowly and deliberately her left arm rises , to encircle his neck in a confiding clasp . He sits back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mother ! Mother , dear ! HE . Eh ? SHE . Mother , dear , I 'm so glad --  --  HE . ( Interrupting energetically ) Really , I beg your pardon . SHE . ( Continuing without a break ) I 'm so glad you 've come . HE . Ah , yes . . . . Quite so . SHE . Kiss me , mother . HE . ( Trying to rise ) Eh ? ( She does not release him . ) SHE . Kiss me , mother . HE . But I 'm not your mother . SHE . ( Plaintively ) Wo n't you kiss me , mother ? HE . ( Looks around furtively . Then he obliges her . ) SHE . Ah ! That 's so nice . ( She pauses . Shudders . ) Hold me close , mother , hold me close . I 've had such a terrible dream ! HE . Good Heavens ! You 're not dreaming now . . . . SHE . I dreamt -- I dreamt --  ( He has raised her to a sitting position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? HE . ( Surprised ) Do n't you know ? SHE . No . HE . ( In a matter-of-fact tone ) We are about half a mile away from the Poland Springs Hotel , Poland Springs , Maine . SHE . ( Vaguely ) Oh ! ( She pauses . ) And you , how do you come here ? HE . Strolling . SHE . Strolling ? HE . I reached the hotel this morning . It was hot -- beastly hot . I went for a walk in the woods . SHE . And then ? HE . I beg your pardon ? SHE . What happened then ? How did we meet ? HE . Do n't you know ? SHE . I remember nothing -- I 'm confused . ( She tries to get up , but sits on the log with a little exclamation . ) My shoes -- where are my shoes ? HE . ( Fetching them ) Here they are . SHE . Thank you . . . . ( She looks at them . ) Those are n't my shoes ! HE . ( Politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Nodding ) They would be . SHE . But they 're not mine . HE . ( Shrugging his shoulders ) I found them on your feet . SHE . ( Confused ) On my feet ? HE . Yes . . . . ( An afterthought ) One on each . SHE . Oh ! . . . ( She tries to put them on . ) I ca n't get them on . HE . No ? SHE . Will you help me ? ( He assists her ; she feels her clothes and exclaims ) : Oh ! HE . Did I hurt you ? SHE . ( Astonished ) My clothes are wet ! HE . ( Thoughtfully ) Yes . SHE . How funny ! ( Noticing him . ) And you -- you 're wet also ! HE . ( Nodding ) Soaked . SHE . What a coincidence ! How curious ! How did it happen ? ( She pauses . ) Oh , if I could only think ! Think ! ( He rises , and waits politely . ) Tell me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolling through the woods . I heard a splash SHE . ( Interrupting ) A splash ! Oh , do n't say any more : I remember ! That horrible lake ! Horrible ! It was so warm at the hotel : I had gone off to the woods . I was sitting at the edge of the lake -- on a rock -- reading . I must have been sleepy . I fell in . HE . Then you screamed . SHE . Yes : I was drowning ! Drowning ! I called for help ! HE . I heard you . SHE . I sank -- I sank , oh , miles and miles ! It felt as if hands were trying to pull me down to the bottom ! I screamed again -- and then -- then -- I felt a strong arm around my waist -- I was dizzy --  there was a roaring in my ears -- I knew no more . HE . ( Sympathetically ) Too bad , too bad . SHE . And you --  ( rising to her feet enthusiastically ) you were the man who jumped in ! HE . ( Apologetically ) I was passing by . SHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever thank you ? My hero ! ( She throws her arms about his neck . ) HE . That 's all right . . . . SHE . But it 's not all right . I can never repay you ! Never ! Never ! Not if I live to be a thousand years old ! ( She kisses him . ) HE . ( Calmly ) That 's the second time . SHE . The second time ? HE . ( Nodding ) I kissed you before . SHE . Oh ! ( Releasing him quickly . ) You did n't ! HE . Yes , I did . SHE . While I was unconscious ? HE . Precisely . SHE . Oh , how could you do such a thing ? How could you ? HE . ( Taking up his coat ) It was by request . ( Takes cigarette case from pocket . ) SHE . ( Incredulously ) I asked you ? HE . You said , " Mother ! Mother ! Kiss me ! " ( Takes cigarette from case . Pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . ) SHE . I said that ? HE . They were your first words . ( Produces match-safe from trouser pocket . ) SHE . But you did n't have to kiss me . HE . No ? ( Trying to strike a match . It is wet . So are the others . ) SHE . You did n't have to ! HE . I tried to explain that I was not your mother , but you seemed to know better . ( He throws the cigarette away . ) You insisted . I could n't help it . SHE . ( After a pause , coquettishly ) What do you mean : you could n't " help it " ? HE . ( Perfectly willing to flirt ) You know --  ( He hesitates . ) SHE . ( Encouragingly ) Yes ? HE . You 're a pretty girl -- a deucedly pretty girl . SHE . Oh , no ! HE . But you are ; honor bright ! SHE . You really think so ? HE . ( Nods ) There was no one around . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself every day : life is so --  monotonous . And you did n't seem to object . SHE . ( Coyly ) I could n't very well -- not while I was unconscious . HE . That 's so . I am a man , with a man 's tastes . And you begged me so hard -- it was so inviting -- well , I kissed you . SHE . ( After a pause ) On the lips ? HE . Yes . On the lips . SHE . ( After a pause ) How often ? HE . Eh ? SHE . How often did you kiss me ? HE . Only once . SHE . Was that all ? HE . ( With a smile ) Why , it 's hardly worth mentioning . SHE . ( Going to him and taking his hands magnanimously ) Well , I forgive you . HE . Thank you . SHE . ( Invitingly ) Two kisses is not a great deal for saving my life . HE . No ? SHE . I owe you much more than that ! HE . ( Standing motionless ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch from his ) Really ! ( A pause . ) Really ! ( He does not kiss her . She gives it up . Sits on the log , drawing him to her side . ) You must tell me all about yourself . Just think : if it had n't been for you , I would be at the bottom of the lake now . What a horrible tragedy that would have been : to die in such a way ! . . . ( She pauses . ) It 's natural that I should want to know something about the man who saved me from that . . . . HE . ( With embarrassment ) I do n't like to talk about myself --  --  SHE . ( Interrupting encouragingly ) You 're still a young man , are n't you ? HE . Thirty-one . SHE . ( Laying her hand on his ) Are you ? HE . ( Nodding ) Last November . SHE . ( Lying with the insouciance of expertness ) I 'm just twenty . ( He nods his head , without showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . HE . Just the right ages , are n't we ? SHE . ( Leaving her hand where it is ) Do you think so ? HE . Eleven years difference -- ideal ! SHE . Ten and a half . HE . Eh ? SHE . I was born in June . HE . Oh , were you ? ( Sagely . ) That 's better yet . SHE . Do you think so -- Lord Brookfield ? HE . ( Surprised -- or simulating it effectively . ) Eh ? SHE . Lord Brookfield ? HE . How on earth did you know it ? SHE . ( With a laugh ) Oh , I am not so stupid as all that ! HE . You recognized me ? SHE . No . I have never seen you . HE . A photo ? SHE . No . HE . Then how did you know ? . . . SHE . ( Interrupting ) Lord Brookfield is a well-known man . The papers said he was coming to the hotel . I knew every other guest --  --  HE . But three or four others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! SHE . You are English . I could see that right away . HE . ( After a pause ) How clever of you ! SHE . Oh , Lord Brookfield ! HE . And how curious that I should meet you in this way -- informal , so to speak . SHE . ( Laughing ) Odd , was n't it ? ( She rises . ) Ugh !  - -  how my clothes are sticking to me ! HE . That 's so . You had better change . SHE . And you ? HE . I 'm rather wet myself . SHE . Will you take me back to the hotel ? HE . The sun is very hot here . SHE . ( Instantly changing ) Oh , would you rather stay ? HE . ( Does not answer for a few seconds . Then , a little abruptly ) Tell me : can you swim ? SHE . ( Startled ) Eh ? HE . Can you swim ? SHE . Lord Brookfield ! Of course I ca n't ! HE . That 's curious . SHE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staggered , but returning to the attack with magnificent self-possession ) Oh , but you swam splendidly ! Clothes and all ! All the way from the other side of the lake ! HE . Did I ? SHE . Of course you did ! One plunge , and a few magnificent overhand strokes . . . . ( She notices his peculiar expression , and hesitates . ) HE . ( Thoughtfully ) Plunge ? SHE . Why , certainly . HE . ( Shaking his head ) I would have sworn I waded . SHE . ( Laughing uneasily ) You are really too modest , Lord Brookfield . HE . Let 's see . ( He picks up his coat , and shakes it out . ) Of course , I might have swum , but -- Ah ! the water line comes only as far as the waist ! SHE . That means nothing . HE . No ? ( Feeling his head . ) If I had plunged , my hair would have been wet . SHE . It dried in the sun . HE . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . ) SHE . The case is waterproof . HE . Still , the matches are wet . ( Producing the box from his trouser pocket , and trying to strike one . ) You see ? SHE . ( With a forced laugh ) Lord Brookfield , do n't deny that you saved my life ! HE . That is what I am trying to do . SHE . ( Frigidly ) I beg your pardon ? HE . I jumped in without thinking . It was the natural thing to do : I heard you scream for help . But the moment the water came to my waist I knew that if it went any deeper I should have to call for help also . SHE . Well ? HE . I was spared that humiliation : the pond is n't over three feet deep in any place . And I waded the whole twenty feet from one end to the other . . . . And I ca n't swim . SHE . But I was drowning ! Drowning ! HE . ( Politely ) Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rising indignantly ) Lord Brookfield ! HE . I nearly forgot to mention --  --  SHE . What ? HE . That I saw you jump in . SHE . Oh ! HE . It was pleasant while it lasted , was n't it ? And romantic ! Why , romantic does n't begin to describe it ! ( Imitating ) " Mother , kiss me ! " SHE . Oh , how can you ? HE . **26;997;TOOLONG you did n't remember ! Not even the shoes . That was clever -- very clever ! And the hands trying to pull you down to the bottom : that was the touch of genius ! ( He pauses with a smile . ) Ah , well , I was willing to have a little fun . ( A man is heard whistling a popular song in the distance . He listens attentively . ) SHE . ( After a pause ) You played with me -- played with me . Oh , you 're disgusting ! Revolting ! What a thing for a man to do ! I thought --  --  ( She breaks off . ) HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . . . . ( Then , seeing no reason to restrain herself . ) I thought Lord Brookfield was a gentleman ! HE . Oh , but I 'm not . SHE . Not a gentleman ? HE . No . . . . I 'm not Lord Brookfield . SHE . Not Lord Brookfield ? HE . No . SHE . Then who on earth are you ? HE . ( Sweetly ) I ? I 'm a friend of his . SHE . A friend ? HE . A close friend -- very close . SHE . Who ? Who ? HE . ( Leisurely ) I 'm not related , you know , but I see a lot of him . We 're thick -- very thick . SHE . ( un patiently ) Who are you ? HE . ( Simply ) I 'm his valet . SHE . ( Horrified ) Oh ! . . . And you kissed me ! A valet ! You dared kiss me ! HE . At your request . SHE . ( Almost choking with rage ) But a valet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the best there is . SHE . Your insolence ! Oh ! ( She seizes the handkerchief which he has left on the log , and wipes her mouth furiously . ) HE . My handkerchief . SHE . ( Throwing it to the ground ) Oh , you coward ! You . . . . You ( She sits on the log , inarticulate with rage . The whistle is heard again . ) HE . Listen to me . SHE . I wo n't . HE . ( Earnestly ) Listen to me . SHE . I do n't want to talk to you ! HE . I 'll help you . SHE . ( Rising ) I do n't want your help . HE . ( Bluntly ) Then you 're silly . SHE . ( Wheeling furiously ) How dare you --  --  HE . ( Interrupting ) I 'll make a bargain with you . SHE . ( Scornfully ) What dealings can there be between us ? HE . Did you hear the whistling a minute ago ? SHE . Well ? HE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( After a pause ) Well ? HE . The path leads here . He is following the path --  --  SHE . ( After still another pause ) Well ? HE . You and I might be very good friends --  --  SHE . ( Thoughtfully ) Oh , you mean --  --  HE . A valet is not paid very well --  --  SHE . No . . . . Still --  --  SHE . If anything comes of it --  --  SHE . ( Slowly ) Comes of what ? HE . You understand me . ( He pauses ; smiles . Then , in a Mephistophelian manner ) : Your clothes are still wet , are n't they ? SHE . ( With full comprehension ) Yes --  --  HE . Enough said ! ( The whistle is heard , close at hand . ) Quick ! SHE . ( Going off ) You wo n't tell ? ( He shakes his head . ) I 'll remember you . ( She runs into the woods . ) HE . ( Sits on the log , laughs heartily . He produces another cigarette , and tries in vain to light it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily , he addresses him sharply ) Peters ! PETERS . ( Surprised ) M'lord ? HE . Give me a light , Peters . PETERS . Yes , m'lord . ( Produces match , etc . ) HE . Thanks . ( He blows a few whiffs into the air . Then stops , and surveys PETERS thoughtfully . ) Peters , you 're a brave man , are n't you ? PETERS . ( Modestly ) I am ' andy with me fists , m'lord . HE . That 's not quite what I mean , Peters . . . . ( He pauses . ) Peters , you have the making of a hero in you . Something tells me that you 're going to have your chance . ( There is a loud splash from the same direction as before , followed by screams of " Help ! Help ! " ) PETERS . ( With excitement ) M'lord ! HE . ( Quietly ) Yes , Peters ? PETERS . Somebody 's calling for ' elp , m'lord ! HE . Yes , Peters . PETERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peters . . . . Gallop ! And as PETERS . ( Charges wildly into the shrubbery , shouting ) : H'I 'm coming ! H'I 'm coming ! THE CURTAIN FALLS
