WE regret that the appearance of this issue of the Nation has been delayed by a pressmen 's strike affecting nearly all the printing establishments of New York . C INCE the leading articles in this issue were put into type , the President 's note to Germany , of October 23 , has appeared . It is a highly inconsistent document . He is first so favorably impressed by the assurances that Prince Max gave as to the changes in the German Government that " he can not decline to lay the matter of an armistice before the Allies . " Later he swings completely around , declaring that the United States " can not trust the word of those who have hitherto been the masters of German policy , " and can only deal " with veritable representatives of the German people , who have been assured of a genuine constitutional standing as the real rulers of Germany . If it must deal with the military masters and the monarchical authorities of Germany . . . it must demand not peace negotiations , but surrender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the President 's attitude now is , is obvious in the press and the printed opinions of public men . But several things are perfectly clear . The reforms the President demands of Germany can not be accomplished under many months except possibly by a Bolshevist revolution . Again , the President , while temporizing plainly , yields in this note to the " bitter-enders . " He discards in this matter his principle of self-determination ; he absolutely takes back his words of January 8 , 1918 : " Neither do we presume to suggest to her ( Germany ) any alteration or modification of her institutions . " The outlook at this writing is for a continuance of the war with the German people , perhaps for the first time , whole-heartedly united against us . T HE separation of Hungary from Austria , prematurely announced as already decided on at Budapest , is at least under discussion on motion of Count Karolyi , and it appears to have a strong body of opinion behind it . Austria and Hungary are not so much one country as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , would not involve the breaking of serious bonds . Apart from the slender tie of personal union under the same sovereign , the main common matters are only three . These are foreign affairs ( implying common diplomatic representation ) ; army and navy ; and finance so far as it relates to common concerns . There is no common parliament and the two " delegations " which regulate common business do not even deliberate together , but communicate their decisions to each other in writing . The commercial agreement which gives Austria and Hungary the same coinage , weights and measures , and a joint bank of issue , and forms them into practically one customs territory , is not permanent but is supposed to be renewed every ten years ; at present it is provisional until the end of 1919 . Hungary , while posing by preference as Austria 's victim , has been in a position to exact good terms for herself in their recurrent bargains . If she now , whether from dislike of the proposed federalization of Austria , from dread of increasing German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " fears to be infected with Austrian rottenness , " it will mean that the ruling oligarchy see their own advantage in the move for separation . rr HE capture of the German submarine bases along the North Sea will undoubtedly affect the circuitous route which European neutrals have been obliged to follow for almost three years . There is another question which affects the Central Powers and the neutral nations which the defeat of Germany 's continental ambitions will soon bring forward . We refer to the economic treaties which Germany has concluded with all of her neutral neighbors . Denmark , Holland , and Switzerland depended for their fuel supply upon the generosity and willingness of Germany . The Berlin Government used the threat of a coalless winter to force Copenhagen , Berne and The Hague into a number of economic agreements which come under the distinct heading of " international blackmail . " The tables are now being turned and these experiments of the General Staff may prove as unfortunate as the Brest-Litovsk adventure . La Fontaine wrote fables about the dangers of trying to get too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole series of exasperated small neutrals may prove to be distinctly unpleasant during these days of final settlement . MEANWHILE the appointment of Mr. J. T. Cremer as Netherlands Minister to the United States is another evidence of that increasing interest which this country and the Netherlands take in the development of commerce between the Dutch East Indies and the United States . Mr. Cremer has twice been Minister of Colonies and is regarded as one of Holland 's foremost authorities on the subject of colonial government . No doubt the preliminary agreement which now exists between our Government and the Dutch authorities in regard to East Indian trade will receive further substantial development . In addition , negotiations for a new rationing agreement with Holland have been resumed in London , and now that the German bases of Ostend and Zeebrugge no longer threaten the British Channel , the direct route betwen Rotterdam and New York becomes independent of German interference . Altogether , the relations between this country and the most important of Europe 's commercial neutrals seem to be rapidly improving . P-THE successful flotation of the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement of a war that has been full of financial marvels . The conditions of the campaign were difficult . In the first place , the amount asked for was staggering , exceeding by more than a billion dollars England 's largest offering , that of February , 1917 . But while England 's loan was placed no less than a year and eight months after the last preceding call for funds , it is only five months since we raised $4,190,000,000 by borrow-ing from our citizens . Further , we have- seen a huge in-crease in taxes , and we now stand face to face with a new measure , whose details we do not yet know , that will call for eight millions of tax revenue during the current fiscal year . The relatively long maturity of the bonds also was a somewhat unattractive feature in the present market . In the midst of the drive came the news of the German peace proposals , which inevitably raised a question in many minds whether so large a loan at this time was really necessary . And to crown all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important sections of the country and crippled the machinery set up for the floating of the loan . The gratifying success of the campaign under such circumstances , and especially the large number of individual subscriptions , now estimated at 22,000,000 , is evidence of the stern purpose of the country to do whatever may be necessary to enable the Government to carry to a successful conclusion the enormous enterprise in which we are so heavily involved . It is evidence , too , of our extraordinary financial resources , and of the remarkable power of advertising and organization . In some sections of the country the quota was apportioned among the people in proportien to their known means , and in some cases those who failed to meet the requisition were actually fined . No thoughtful American can be happy over all the methods that were employed to make the drive a success , yet he can not but rejoice in the ability and willingness of the people to meet financial burdens in a cause that they believe to be right . HOW heavy those burdens are likely to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , we fear , by either the people or their representatives in Washington who are so light-heartedly calling for a march to Berlin , no matter what the cost in blood and treasure . Congress last week passed , almost without discussion , a deficiency bill appropriating 86,345,755,666 for the army . The total of our borrowings since the war began comes to more than 816,000,000,000 . Let people soberly consider what these figures mean , and the tone of much current discussion will , we are persuaded , be seriously modified . We do not mean that we shall for a moment slacken in our efforts to secure a just and permanent peace because of the financial sacrifices involved in the attempt . We do mean that it would be a piece of criminal folly to prolong the war a day beyond what is necessary to the attainment of the best possible approximation to that result . Quite aside from planting the seeds of new wars , a prolongation of the war out of revenge or lust of power would mean the placing on our children 's backs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of democracy and welfare that uphold the people to-day . The wealth of the United States , as yet only partly mortgaged to the military god that has consumed the substance of Europe , is our chief material hope for the financial rehabilitation of an impoverished world . Every one of the beggared small countries is to-day stretching out its hands to us , asking our help for the days of restoration . Shall we recklessly cast aside the opportunity to do the work of healing , shall we mortgage beyond redemption our financial capacity to erect the structure of a sound social life at home , and all for the sake of taking a bloody revenge on a people misled and mistaught by their militaristic rulers ? It is a serious question for the bitter-enders . WHILE clouds of red bunting were waving for twenty-two days above marching soldiers and sailors on the Avenue of the Allies in New York , rare bits of color have been drifting down cavernous side streets and into remote sections of the city . Carnivals have been rife . Up and down Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Little Italy , Brooklyn , and Harlem , men , women , and children have been getting up block parties . Walking about the streets , one turns a corner and comes suddenly on a block all decorated with flags , confetti , and paper lanterns . Money is raised by a house-to-house canvass ? enough for a band for open-air dancing , and for a parade , but primarily for a service flag and for payment of the priest who shall bless the flag before it is hung . For the party draws its solemnity and purpose from the boys of the neighborhood , over there . It is truly democratic ; everybody in the block is invited . To be sure , the festival is not always entirely harmonious . Carmine Street says that Jones Street put 85 stars in the flag when it is well known that only 67 from the block are abroad , but Jones Street answers that it has a right to include stars for those who hung around Jones Street all day long , whether they lived somewhere else or not . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though they perhaps originated in New York , they will beyond doubt spread rapidly to other towns . THE New Jersey Senatorial situation has now cleared . It is a straight fight between George M. La Monte and Governor Edge . Our sympathies are entirely with Mr. La Monte . A liberal , a man of highest character , with nothing of the professional politician about him , his election would mean a marked strengthening of the Democratic representation in the Senate . We shall be surprised if the President does not openly support Mr. La Monte before the campaign is much older . In any event , New Jersey has a chance here to uphold the President 's hands . The election of Governor Edge  --  his record as Governor we do not now criticise  --  would mean the strengthening of the partisan Republican opposition to Mr. Wilson and , perhaps , before long , opposition to the President 's efforts to obtain a reasonable peace before the war has wrecked Europe beyond repair . Under these circumstances , no true Democrat in New Jersey should hesitate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be watched with great interest by those who are interested in progressive politics is going forward in Montana . Congressman Jeannette Rankin , having been jockeyed out of a renomination for the lower house in the Republican primaries , was put up on the National Party ticket as a candidate for the Senate ; she has been endorsed by the Non-Partisan League , which is very strong in the State , and with the support of the labor element , which was pleased with Miss Rankin 's Congressional record , she is making an unexpectedly strong showing . A recent report from Montana indicates that the campaign is having " magnificent results in uniting labor , farmers , women , and liberals from both Democrats and Republicans . " Miss Rankin 's supporters believe that if the funds necessary to present her cause to the voters are forthcoming , she can be elected  --  a result much to be desired , in our judgment . Miss Rankin has shown that she is thoroughly alive to the importance of the great social and industrial issues that are going to press for solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated the possession of abundant courage . Labor and taxation problems have been acute in Montana for a long time , and there is an imperative need , both in Helena and in Washington , for political leaders who realize that labor is not to be kept quiet by mere repression , and that the attempt to maintain the status quo in the face of real wrongs can lead only to continuing strife . The rapprochement between organized labor and the Non-Partisan League , with its radical programme , and the steady breaking down of old party lines in the Northwest indicate the possibility of a new political crystallization based on real issues instead of meaningless shibboleths . The fate of this or that party is of comparatively little importance . What does matter is that we should have some clean-cut politics , and the whole political situation in the Northwestern section of the country indicates that we may be approaching such a consummation instead of mere struggle for office . THE California campaign has produced an interesting piece of propaganda on the part of the single taxers in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures as to the land-holding of private corporations and firms with a map of one county , said to be " a fair sample of the fifty-eight California counties , " which shows it to be owned chiefly by four companies . Three interests , it is stated , own more acres on the Pacific coast than there are in the German Empire , while one of the three had about as many men on horseback guarding their fourteen million acres from hunters , squatters , and tramps as there were in the United States cavalry before the present war . - Land which , it is declared , could not be bought for $200 an acre , is assessed for $13.90 . The State Commission on Land Colonization is quoted as saying : " California has an immense area of fertile and unpeopled land . . . . Comparatively few settlers are coming here and many who came in recent years have left . Costly advertising and still more costly personal solicitations have not served to attract colonists . We have not found a single settler who , bringing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his land in the time agreed upon in his contract . " The pamphlet goes on to point out that the war , by raising prices all around , automatically increases the value of these under-taxed " private empires , " and that every advance of our men on the European fronts makes it harder for any one to get a footing on the land at home . IN School Life for September 19 we note an interesting statement , based on information furnished by Ambassador Page , concerning German instruction in Great Britain . It appears that out of the 1049 secondary schools in England and Wales in receipt of grants from the Board of Education , German is taught in 379 . This compares with 387 in 1911-12 . All the important public schools , some 65 in number , continue to make provision for instruction in German , and the same thing is true of the six universities and the six constituent colleges of the University of London . Whatever decrease in German teaching has taken place is said to be due largely to the necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober second thought of our own people will soon begin to assert itself in regard to the question of foreign-language teaching . It is not an edifying spectacle to see legislatures in a fit of rage prohibiting instruction in the German language throughout whole States , or Governors and councils of defence forbidding the use of the tongue in gatherings of three or more persons . Whatever reasons existed for teaching German before the war have in general been strengthened by the events of the past four years ; we ought not to act like angry children . AN interesting experiment in popular education begins in Concord , Massachusetts , on Sunday , October 27 , with the first of a ten days ' series of free popular lectures on the peace conference and its tasks . Each day will have its special subject , and each subject will be presented twice , once before the high school and the older students in the grades , and once in the evening before a large general audience . All the speakers are specialists , expert in eliciting and guiding popular discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great questions that we must soon face , and to give it material for sound thought . Public debates will be a part of the programme , and groups for continuation study are being formed . Many persons who believe in democracy 's capacity for managing its own affairs when properly instructed are coming to Concord to watch this experiment . Professor H. W. Rolfe , formerly of Stanford University , who is in charge of the work , has already carried to success a similar undertaking in Santa Monica , California . The Concord enterprise is to be followed by a similar experiment in the Connecticut valley , extending over a longer time and covering a wider territory . From Northampton as a centre the work will radiate into certain of the communities containing a large foreign-born population , and into the villages of the farming regions . Here the lectures will be given before adult groups already formed , such as fraternal orders , trade unions , and clubs of various kinds . The entire undertaking has more than ordinary interest and importance inasmuch as we are just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the problems of the peace makes the present a particularly advantageous time for such an experiment , at the same time that popular feeling over the war renders it peculiarly difficult . WHILE the English have never been among the leading musical nations , at least from the creative point of view , it may nevertheless be said that the products of their composers , apart from Arthur Sullivan , have not received as much attention as they deserve in this country . Percy Grainger is very popular here , but he was an Australian and is now an American citizen . He thinks that Delius , Cyril Scott , and other English composers are among the leading musical geniuses of the time , and that their day will come . May we hope the same of Parry ? Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry  --  whose death was announced recently ? In Grove 's " Dictionary of Music and Musicians " two columns in fine type are devoted to a mere list of his compositions , many of which are held in high esteem in England ; yet one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His books , on the other hand , are well-known and highly esteemed here . No other writer anywhere has given so lucid an account of the evolution of the tonal art , from scales and folk song to modern sonatas and operas , as he has in " The Art of Music . " His work on Bach is far superior to that of Germany 's Bach specialist , Spitta , nor has anyone else given such admirable summaries of the lives and careers of great musicians as Parry in his " Studies of the Great Composers , " of which many editions have been printed . The five volumes of " Grove " and the Oxford " History of Music " owe their excellence largely to his contributions . As director of the Royal College of Music and in other similar positions he exerted a wide and salutary influence on musical education . Whatever may be the ultimate fate of his compositions , he may surely claim the title of England 's foremost musical scholar .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
