txt South American Trade Catalogues . In a recent issue you print a letter from M. Dante , In which he points out that experience dictates that catalogues intended for South American trade must be translated Into good Spanish . Why Spanish alone ? I presume M. Dante Is aware of the fact that almost half of the South American population speak Portuguese . Many American manufacturers know better than to have their catalogues translated into Spanish alone , ( if they have them translated at all ; ) quite a number of them issue their catalogues in Spanish and Portuguese , and to save the trouble of ascertaining first for which country the catalogue is intended , they make one edition of both languages . I admit that many manufacturers have their catalogues printed In Spanish only ; some do so to economize ; others do so because they have been " informed " that south Of the United States Spanish is spoken .
