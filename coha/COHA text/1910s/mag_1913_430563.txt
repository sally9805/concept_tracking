 | IT seems not unreasonable to assume that a hundred years from now Woman will be ruling the world or Man will have beaten her into an abject and primitive submission . It is not possible within the limits of an article to give the history of woman throughout the ages ; but few readers of the YALE REVIEW need to be reminded that she is , au fond , by far the more tyrannical of the two sexes , and that whenever peculiar circumstances , uncommon strength of character , or a keen driving intellect have given her power , no matter how sporadic or limited , she has used it ruthlessly . Even in the small world of the home , the moment a woman discovers that her own weaknesses are less ingenuous and uncontrollable than her husband 's , her coolness and patience greater , her wit keener , or that she can club him mentally with her temper , then is the man lost . He may rule the nation , but he carries a secret sense of failure because one woman rules him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have made to impress the world with the durable quality of their greatness . ) With hardly an exception , the leaders of men have been under the thumb , sometimes once , often many times , of a woman ; the soft spot in their otherwise mighty brains is where woman 's magnetism and charm are generated , and without these silent partners the most brilliantly equipped can not sway the multitude , or rouse that fanatical personal devotion necessary to insure a practical success . If a great man is ruled by his wife he is fortunate , for her ambitions are bound up with his , and by the time he is old enough to climb up to his pedestal she too is poised and wary ; she may keep him from feeling wholly a god , but at least she will  | not wreck his career . We hear every day of fortunes undone or jeopardized by extravagant wives , but we never hear of a public man 's wife making him ridiculous with the methods of a Kitty O'Shea or a Lola Montez : summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power . But in these United States , particularly , where men are too busy to indulge in feminine psychology , and where tradition still fosters the old practice of idealizing woman a little and indulging her a great deal , she has attained to a power far in excess of anything enjoyed by her sex in older lands . It took her some time to awaken to the deeper significance of this fact , but as soon as she did she began to replace those silken fetters with strands of steel . No doubt that in the higher civilizations of Europe where men have more leisure to think , to say nothing of ancestral brain cells , their persistent attitude of authority over women , often amounting to brutality , is due to the fact that they recognize not only the feminine instinct to rule , but the latent and formidable powers behind . Secretly and in stealth women have tyrannized over men since the world began and Eve held the fragrant apple under Adam 's unwary nose ; flattering him into the belief that it is he that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior of woman , even as he so indisputably is the more powerful in body . When a woman is in love she really believes this , which causes the honeyed accents to vibrate with the ring of truth . These are easily counterfeited later on . After marriage , when the glamour has been supplanted by the hard light which beats alike on throne and hearth , she either despises or maternally loves and tolerates her man according to the strongest if most secret qualities of her nature . It is safe to say that save in the rare instances where man approximates the well-nigh impossible ideal of woman ? the man who combines mastery of self with sympathetic understanding , who is intellectual without dullness  | and too much egoism , who is honorable to his marrow , who is strong in little things as in great , masterful without being pig-headed , and above all who is able to refrain from making a fool of himself in private as well as in public ? putting this demi-god out of the question , it is safe to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard their men as overgrown boys , and to love them the more , or to endure , or hold in contempt , according to their own pattern . The world is full of disenchanted wives , but the grand army of the maternal women have learned a sort of divine philosophy , and enjoy the major portion of the meagre share of happiness allotted to this planet . But there is also the grand army of non-maternal women , who have been finding themselves during the last twenty-five or thirty years , and who care more for liberty than for any happiness their mere sex can give them . This army is growing wider and wider awake every moment , more lustful of power , of complete independence ; and it increases in numbers at an incredible rate . The maternal woman , even if she have no child but her husband , is content to rule in the home . Not so the other . Her masculine components are overbalancing her mere womanhood ; and these components , these profound and formidable qualities of the mind , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogated to himself . Now , given the fundamental instinct to tyrannize , add to it the long centuries of repression , of enforced submission , followed by another century of slow but persistent endeavor to obtain for their sex the natural rights of human beings ; reflect upon , their full realization of man 's injustice to woman , as to all creatures weaker than himself , and add again this sudden determined uprising of women in all centres of civilization ( the most significant expression so far of the real birth of democracy into the world ) ; reflect furthermore upon the moral support these increasing numbers give to one another , the rapid development of brain and  | character , even of strength of body , also upon the sweets of revenge ; ? and it is hardly necessary to add that man 's position is no longer unchallenged , nor particularly stable . It is possible that the Englishman is wiser than we have thought , farsighted rather than merely obstinate and egoistical . He has a far more formidable article to deal with than his American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years of inflexible mental sternness , infinite resource , and physical endurance , may well fill his soul with prophetic terror . Whether he can hold out or not , no one may venture to predict ; but if he does not , he goes down to a long and ignominious , possibly a permanent defeat . The women of Great Britain have quite as good brains as the men ; their minds are as well-trained , as logical , as executive and accomplished , as crowded with the furniture of politics ; and while the men have a tendency to grow soft , after their cricketing days are over , as the result of too much good living and club haunting , the women keep themselves as hard as iron , if only to preserve their figures . Nevertheless , the actual physical superiority of the male still persists , and nobody knows better than an Englishman how to put himself into proper condition ; either deliberately or instinctively he recognizes all this and prefers to conquer now instead of rousing himself after a long period of humiliation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of ostensible supremacy , but man has no one to thank but himself . Woman , since the dark ages , has been too clever for him , and infinitely more patient . He had but to put his intense masculine egoism aside long enough to realize this , put on his armor and keep it on . He did nothing of the sort . Tradition and woman lulled him and blinded him ; and , coincidently with progress , that progress of his own making , he lost one after another of the props that supported his throne . Now that old relic of antiquity is about to go the way of lesser thrones . It is , in p 416 fact , supported to-day by two props only : physical superiority and custom . He undermined both when he permitted woman to leave the deep seclusion of the home , go forth to be educated with her brothers , thence to toil for her bed and board . One of man 's own distinguishing traits is to bite the hand that feeds him . Ingratitude ? What theme save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and makers of fiction ? It is , indeed , man 's own invention , antedating by many centuries the development of the productive faculty in the brain of woman . It is as well before going any further to examine certain characteristics and traits of men and women and endeavor to ascertain in what they fundamentally differ , or if their sex differences are really as radical as we have been content to believe . One argument against the importance or permanence of woman as a factor in the conduct of the world , is that she is more dishonest than man . Is she ? An article appeared recently in one of the more serious magazines adducing this argument as the best in the repertoire of the " antis , " and dwelt principally upon woman 's inherent tendency to smuggle . This reminds me of a little speech made in my presence some fourteen years ago by an Englishman who had lived for many years in Japan . The Japanese , he assured us , could never be a great or even a conquering race because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to smuggling . The author of this curiously shallow argument could have had no real knowledge of our Custom House . Any inspector would have told her that men are by far the greater offenders . They bring in articles of enormous value , of a serious menace to trade , and secrete them with deeper deliberation and craft . With the exception of the professional female smugglers , women are rather childlike in their attempts to swindle the government . It is , so far , natural to their sex to enjoy a healthy fear of the law . But they make more picturesque  | " copy " for the newspapers , and therefore we hear more of them . Moreover , who are the prestigious criminals of the world , political and private , men or women ? What is the sex of the bank-wreckers , the embezzlers , forgers , safe-crackers , burglars , sneak thieves ? Of the " con " artists , grafters in politics and business , of the lawyer sharks , robbers of the widow and the orphan , of the robber baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international swindlers , including the ocean card-sharps , of the inventors and purveyors of poisonous patent medicines , of the get-rich-quick fraternity , of the millions , in fact , that live by playing upon the credulity of the human race ? Of diplomats , spies , and editors of sensational journals ? Are they men or women ? Now and again we read of the picturesque girl thief , " lady burglar " ? mainly in fiction , ? of the pedlar of spurious beauty recipes , or that some woman is the brain of a gigantic swindle ; but these instances are too rare to weigh a feather in the scale against man 's centuries of record for dishonesty , the infinite variety of which he invented himself , assisted by the devil . The newspapers give us daily proof of man 's congenital dishonesty , and it is seldom that a woman is arrested for thieving or cheating save as the accomplice of some man . To this every man will make immediate response : Yes , but wait until women are granted the full liberty and enfranchisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , living the man 's life . Then she will be as bad as he . I should n't think of contradicting . I feel quite sure she will be , unless civilization undergoes startling changes meanwhile , owing to a miraculous improvement in human nature . Beyond woman 's physical disabilities , her more consistent and tender love of young , the stunting of certain traits and the over-development of others , wholly the effect of custom , I can see little difference between the two sexes . Man and woman ( we have not only the poets ' authority for it ) are  | but one being split in two , differently sexed for the benefit of the race ; otherwise they would be as alike as two peas in a pod if primeval conditions had not given the man an advantage he has taken care to retain , and if he had not later on elected to cut his hair . If man desired to cultivate hair to his waist and wear it on the top of his head , he could do it as easily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilette have a larger sale than depilatories . No woman can be more vain , more cowardly , more spiteful , more pettily jealous ? in matters far removed from sex , ? more lacking in will power , more confused in thought , more absurdly nervous , even hysterical , than certain types of man can be , ? than nearly all men can be upon occasion ; and few men have shown more positive heroism than women display in every war , or more consistency and cast-iron endurance than the Militant Women of England are displaying to-day . They rarely exhibit more fortitude in illness , or when hurt , than women do every day ; nor do they endure poverty and privation more silently . Some day , when all the nonsense and sentimentality have died out of the world , it will be universally admitted that men and women are made up of the same ingredients and that the preponderance of good or bad , weakness or strength , is in the individual not the sex . When women have achieved full liberty , in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their swelling ranks , stand squarely on their own two feet , they will be just as rapacious , just as dishonest , just as sharp and overreaching as conditions and the law permit . The weaker or less resourceful will drop to the underworld as they do to-day ( where they will continue to divide the honors with men ) , but those women of brains and character that deliberately select the open for their talents instead of the home , will fight man at his own game , and , it may be , rout him , dispossess him , eat him up . That honesty is not a fundamental instinct in the human  | race but an arbitrary product of certain civilizations , arbitrarily exercised even there , is proved by its variations . The British and French tradesmen are notoriously dishonest ; as fighters and as man to man , the best of both races are honorable . The French law protects the most dishonest native against the most honest and outraged foreigner . The German and the Swiss are normally honest , the South German more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinaman honest . In Zululand the biggest liar was king . Law and social usage compel most men to refrain from flagrant offenses , but within those confines , the temptations to honesty for its own sake have never been overwhelming ; religion and good breeding are responsible for our pleasant sense of security when with our own sort . That we sometimes receive severe shocks , as when we find ourselves financially outwitted by acquaintances , even friends , whom all the world we know trusts , or discover the hand of a virtuous citizen in our pocket , is something which we view with more and more philosophy as time goes on . Man is no stronger than his temptations , and such men , at least , fall later than those engaged in the hand to mouth struggle with life on a lower plane . There is no question that our civilization has bred a class of men that never have been tempted to act dishonestly , to whom such a temptation is as unthinkable as its execution , and who would be utterly incapable of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains were poisoned , decentralized with the miasma of starvation . The best of men have eaten one another , killed , lied for a woman or a friend , grown to hate their wives , love their friends ' wives , but their provocation has been inordinate , and , as man to man , their honor has remained impeccable . On this planet no man may be perfect , and that so many of civilization 's flowers find it impossible to hold unswervingly to their high ideals , forces us to be charitable to those more faultily combined , in whose poorly trained minds ideals are too confused  | with personal wants to reinforce their respect for civil law . When a man that lives and struggles in the complex centres of civilization , remains true to the high standards of his inheritance and his youth , he is to be enrolled among the small army of the real heroes of the world . It is a clear case of the survival of the fit . That men in small communities , especially where there is a strong intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die in financial honor , is little to their credit , though vastly to that of civilization . The mere fact that so many normal men of decent circumstances are willing and eager to uphold high standards shows the direction in which the world moves . All this is so self-evident that it would hardly be worth mentioning if it were not necessary to emphasize the fact that it applies equally to women . If anything , women are more honest than men , partly because , not coming into frequent contact with the law , they stand more in awe of it , partly because the small economies of the home have made them exact and conservative . Moreover , a mother clings to a certain set of rules instilled in youth , long after men have learned to keep them plastic , and to a form of caution that breeds honesty , if only because she , in turn , is distilling high and utile precepts into the little minds for which she is responsible . Woman will steal for her children long before she is starving herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sake that she would not do for her own , or for her man ; but there she obeys a law that transcends civilization , and only a greater civilization will repeal it . Personally , I have found women more honest in money matters than men . I suppose that all people , not misers , could tell a tale of impositions , swindlings , above all of borrowings ; more especially women widowed too young to have any practical knowledge of the maze called " business . " Also if they are impulsive and what is ungratefully known as " easy . " Furthermore , if they have lived in Europe and been the prey of enterprising or impecunious countrymen .  | Women , I have discovered , almost invariably return money lent them ; men , never . After a considerable experience , if a woman in good repute asked me for money to set herself up in business , I might feel convinced that she would lose it , but I should credit her with the intention to repay me ; a man in similar conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man that borrows money from a woman is the sort that repays no one if he can avoid it . This is one of the first of the disagreeable truths a woman standing alone must learn ; also that even normally honest men in every sort of business will overreach her where they would be quite square with other men , both because they feel themselves safe , and because centuries of power have taught them to take advantage of the weak as a matter of course . It is safe , therefore , to predict that women , no matter what the extent of their invasion into the realms of finance , business , or politics , will not lower the moral standard . Will they raise it , is the more pertinent question . They will make a desperate effort , no doubt of that , if we may judge by the class of women already before the public and making herculean endeavors not only to acquire rights of citizenship but to ameliorate the lot of the unfortunate . That eventually child-labor will be abolished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion ; also that they will succeed in limiting the toil of the poor mother , possibly in pensioning her until some of her children are old enough to work for all . To a great extent they will also get rid of the white slave traffic , and manage to protect the girl that has no instinct for prostitution . The last will be their most difficult task , for it means almost an economic revolution if they are to compel the employers , now almost universally men , to pay girls a living wage . But there is reason to believe they will succeed , and soon after they have acquired the ballot in those communities where the evil is greatest . It is a significant fact that in  | these communities the resistance of man is most determined . So far , so good . Already from a considerable number of States liquor has been ( officially ) banished , mainly through the efforts of women , as well as horse-racing , cigarettes , dance-halls in connection with saloons , where saloons still flourish , all-night resorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that the removal of too many temptations tends to weaken character , that man grows strong only through conquering himself , without too much assistance from the law ; moreover , that if a man is weak or vicious , these defects will manifest themselves in one way or another , no matter how we shelter him ; also that such men are no good anyway , and that the sooner we rid society of them the better . The women hold that such men must be protected from themselves for the sake of their families ; and that if young men can only grow to maturity without being subjected to demoralizing temptations , or even familiarized with the sight of them , they will have better physique and better morals ; in other words , be fortified for life . Perhaps we should be impressed by this argument if we were not reminded of the historic parson 's son . Personally , I agree with the cynical philosophers . I do not believe that the weak can be forcibly held up , any more than that the Socialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast army of clods upon which society must rest until the end of time . The exceptional laborer rises inevitably from his class , is eagerly promoted by employers , always on the watch for that rare endowment , the initiative brain ; for any sort of a brain , in fact . The fond belief that the great mass only needs opportunity to develop brains , is cherished by no one who has seen the vain attempts of schools and parents in the most favored classes to implant mind where mind is not . Every man should be given the opportunity that lies in education , and be protected by sane and beneficent laws , but beyond that only he can help himself .  | Just so does the strength in a man counterbalance , gradually conquer the weakness in him if he has mind enough to engage in the struggle . If he has not , it seems to me that the more quickly his family as well as society is rid of him the better . But I may be all wrong . Let us have the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual experiments which governments eventually push to conclusion , or ignore , as they think best . And experiments are the very spice of life , containing as they do that most stimulating of all qualities , uncertainty . They are , in fact , the grand gamble , and the women in attempting to make the world better by holding it by the throat , not only will enrich and elevate their own characters , but will fill their lives with interests that will make them young at seventy . But if people that live to do good improve themselves , it has yet to be demonstrated that they accomplish any radical changes in the instincts , impulses , and general human nature of the race . To say nothing of the fact that a million more cigarettes were consumed in 1912 than in the record year of 1911 , and whiskey in proportion , in spite of heaven knows how many years of strenuous endeavor of the W. C. T. U. , it is evident that vice flaunts itself more brazenly in every circle than it did ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous revelation of moral turpitude ; ? but all this and far more does not disturb the splendid , if not too intelligent , optimism of women . Nothing can daunt them , and by mere pegging away they will accomplish something , no doubt of that . They can not turn the Great Clock back , compel a somewhat blase world to view with horror what it has come to accept with indifference ; nor can they check the growth of individualism which involves thinking for oneself ; but they can and will , in time , remove or neutralize certain evil causes which develop in so many strugglers the basest or the most contemptible qualities in human nature . And having accomplished this , they will not only have justified them- selves in demanding equal rights with men , but they will more than counterbalance that even greater army of women who do not care a rap for reform , who are as wholly selfish as life will permit them to be , and who so often are far more liberally endowed with brains than the rank and file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . These other women , long embryonic , flowering only in the twentieth century , are so far its one distinctive product . They are the reapers rather than the sowers , and they alone of all looming factors are likely to give a new color to civilization as we know it to-day . There is no reason to believe that women are fundamentally more moral than men ; that is to say , that they are guided by an instinct unknown to the great body of virile , careless-living men . Certainly they are not born impeccable , if the little girls of poor parents in swarming districts display the normal instincts of their sex . The vicious tendencies of poor children are appalling to anyone that has cherished illusions about the natural purity of a child 's mind . Let him who still harbors this illusion spend a few days with the Juvenile Courts of our great cities , and the Detention Homes connected with them . Two years ago it occurred to me , while in San Francisco , that it would be an interesting experience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picturesque than for any other reason ; poverty in California never having become the terrible problem of older , larger , and less recklessly generous cities . Naturally , I met the officers both of the Court and the Detention Home , men and women devoting their lives , and in several , cases , their incomes , to the rescue of boys and girls under legal age , finding homes or work for them , bestowing sympathy , advice , and moral help . From these good people I heard more horrors than I had heard in all my former life put together . I thought I knew the world , but it was the world of men and women . This was the world of children , and infinitely worse . Most of  | the hideous stories were about the most attractive and wellmannered little girls , who were faintly amused by them . Of course these children had really no home life , their parents being overworked or intemperate ; some of the children had been sent from one " institution " to another , and emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My informants told me that although a larger percentage of boys were vicious , owing to their superior opportunities , it was easier to reclaim them than the girls , but that the latter ( save when definitely of the prostitute type ) were by no means hopeless if segregated , and treated kindly in some good woman 's home . Small wonder that in the beginning of the world it never occurred to the male to idealize the female . It took civilization to manufacture that pedestal , and for all we know it was woman herself , her brain sharpened by some education and much experience , that subtly suggested to man the wisdom of publicly exalting virtue , beauty , and domestic accomplishments . At all events she never could have done it while still grovelling on the lower levels with her man . All that I heard at the Juvenile Courts is , of course , just as true of country children if neglected , and would happen to those now petted and sheltered , were their conditions suddenly reversed . Nevertheless , the percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only because they are sheltered , or fearful , but because maternity breeds a certain order of selflessness . Even when the children are too old to demand constant care , the laws laid down for a woman 's guidance have become a habit ; she feels commonplace , settled , and lives vicariously in fiction . If she is still physically active , and her individuality not wholly extinguished , she joins a club and presently graduates as a social worker , or , discovering unsuspected powers , flings herself heart and soul into the great reforms . The ten millions of women in the United States to-day , who are members of one organization or another having as its object the improve- ment of the race and the mitigation of the lot of the poor , are largely middle-aged wives , or widows , although their ranks are swelled by spinsters that no longer hope or wish to marry , and by childless younger women upon whom society or a merely personal life has palled . Few recruits are found in the ranks of youth , either married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly if addicted also to the pleasures of society ; the pretty girl is awaiting the prince ; the parasite takes as much interest in the race as she does in an empty pocket book ; the vast army of self-supporting women are more concerned with personal comfort and occasional amusement than with abstractions of any sort ; and that ever augmenting army of young women of a higher class , non-maternal , passionately independent , exulting in modern conditions that permit their sex at last to live unyoked and unregulated without loss of prestige , and with a fair chance of success in whatever active field they elect to enter , are far too individualistic to merge themselves in the general idea of reform . It is in the last two classes that woman 's morals will tend to become one with man 's . Man invented the present code of morals . Without some such definite code or standard , there could be no civilization . Aside from utility , men and women must have an ideal to look up to , to admire , even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical faculty . There is said to be honor among thieves , a code of sorts in politics and business ; men on the Stock Exchange are expected to tell the truth or retire summarily to the elasticities of private life . Without standards there can be no stability anywhere ; and so far , nothing has been invented to make civilization hang together which promises any improvement upon the stern code of sex morality . Man having firmly established his code , with the help of both law and society , has never had the least hesitation in violating it himself ; openly , if he is a loose liver , indifferent  | to the pleasures of social groups composed of stricter or more circumspect men and women , or if he is young enough to be forgiven his " wild oats . " If he is none of these things he discovers himself to the world accidentally . A large number of men are too indifferent to women to venture into the zone of danger , and there is still another class , men of stern , unyielding morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties , however , unite as one man upon the question of the conduct of the sex that gives them birth . She must be good , or she must emigrate to the garish and definite district beyond the pale and stay there . So far , not even as a result of the modern rapid expansion of the civilized conscience , has anything been said about girls sowing their wild oats . Now , how far have women been controlled by this law , invented by man and upheld by society ? At what period of the world 's history have women ? sheltered women ? been invariably chaste , what period has been without its scandals ? I can recall none ? in the Occident ? save ancient Greece , where the mothers , present and potential , were segregated , the hetcerce a triumphant class by themselves , and the admiration of men was reserved for their own physical perfections ; or , perhaps during those long periods when all the world was at war , in other words , all able-bodied men on the battle-field and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , if history is to be believed , the irregular relations of men and women have ever diverted society , inspired poets and romancers , and been the mainspring of the world 's tragedies , great and small . There is no reason to believe that women are not innately as immoral , or as unmoral , as men ; but they have held their propensities in leash ? when they have ? through pride , fastidiousness , fear , custom , or at the command of two forces more restraining still , maternity and religion . Nevertheless the license of the upper classes in Europe has  | been notorious for centuries ; the working girls of the old world have their lovers as a matter of course , openly and without shame . In Bavaria a peasant will not marry his girl until she has provided him with three children to relieve him of work in his old age . In the United States liaisons in society are by no means openly condoned , but they are overlooked , if the offenders are strong in their position and reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest in the world , but it would be interesting , nevertheless , to sit down and recall how many weeks we could segregate in our lives in which we had not heard a bit of scandal in one set or another ; how many days , in fact , when we have dwelt in cities at the height of the season . The hope for us is , or has been , that we loudly upheld our standards , ceaselessly reiterated them ; that our women , if they fell from grace , did so with the violence of the unhinged , or with the utmost circumspection ; and that girls whom circumstances forced to earn their own bread , monotonously and with hateful toil , preserved a haughty front , or took to the streets altogether . But what of the present ? The women of the world are but a trifle more indifferent to public opinion than formerly , being tolerably fastidious and having more to sacrifice , if they lose their sense of proportion and go a step too far ; but the independent young woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is particularly true of girls that move to the newer Western towns in search of lowered pressure and higher wages . Whether as office , telephone , telegraph girls , clerks , or servants , if they have any ability whatever , coupled with industry , they soon find money easy , and conditions far less exacting than in the swarming communities of the East . In consequence their bodily fatigue is less , their hours of leisure longer , their demand for pleasure , for " life " more eager and insistent . Add to this the reckless atmosphere of towns scarcely a generation old , where everybody when not working is " out for  | a good time , " where a dollar is valued as a dime instead of the reverse , where caste lines are fluid , where the new-rich women , conspicuously in the eye , are innocent of either traditions or mental resources , concerned only with making time and money fly , and it would be more than amazing if these girls , scantily educated , full blooded , with no restraining hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing letters home .

These ladies find no difficulty in filling their rooms with the incompetent , the unattractive , the timid , the innately virtuous ; but the bolder and thoroughly capable damsels laugh at their best efforts to provide innocent amusement . They are enjoying life precisely as men enjoy it , and with no call for the subterfuges forced upon the girls at home . And if they are not blest with the respect of men , pray , ? they ask you ? what good does a man 's respect do a girl when she is tired out or bored to death ?

It was a little earlier that Henry James lamented he could not write what he wished on account of that literary bugaboo , the Young Person . Well , there practically is nothing he can not write to-day . Mrs. Fiske told me that she revived " Tess of the D'Urbervilles " two years ago , but never should do it again .

This has been true for a good deal longer than twenty years , human nature being human nature ; but this is the first time in our United States , at least , that the outcry is feeble and the enjoyment open . Sex has succeeded sentiment , possibly because the latter ran wild and degenerated into sentimentality . Will the result be to coarsen women , and to annihilate romance ? Possibly it may make the world an easier place to live in by weakening hypocrisy , letting people work out their own problems , giving women the same privileges of reinstatement as men , when they have sown their oats and are ready to become wise and useful members of society . The development will be highly interesting to watch .

Nor , until the last quarter of a century , have they shown any real tendency to sustained or widely concerted action ; not until the past ten years has woman become formidable . To-day , what with the moral support of numbers , and a strength of will bred by a firsthand knowledge of life and its cruel conditions , she is as ready to make her own code of morals as to keep her body  | housed and fed . Conditions have forced millions of fairlyeducated young women into the personal struggle for existence who in former generations would have lived on their male relatives and obeyed them , grown bitter and yellow , driven often into lunatic asylums by the sheer monotony of their lives . To-day the girls of this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when young , but neither do they sour . They find life interesting even when tired , and nothing can persuade them that , no longer obliged to feed from the hand of man , they should be expected to subscribe to his laws of conduct ; laws laid down for their progenitors , and for the parasites of to-day . If they are by nature chaste , or imbued with ideals , they obey those laws of their own minds ; and if they are not , they obey other dictates . The same is to be said of a still more interesting class , the increasing number of young women , born of well-to-do parents , often brilliantly educated , who , with an innate distaste for domesticity and children , are no longer forced to choose between a husband and the ignominy of spinsterhood . This is almost an intermediate sex , never recognized until of late years ; but in their ranks have existed the real martyrs of private life . The maternal woman finds compensation for every ill , but these unfortunates , automatically female and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful potentialities , perhaps , but astray in a onesided civilization . Their only hope was in some artistic gift , and this they exercised in stealth , and apologized for its possession by giving its fruits to the world under the penname of a man ! Save in small , obscure communities , that condition has passed ? possibly forever . It is a poor specimen of a woman to-day that would condescend to sign her work with the name of a man . If these girls have artistic gifts they use them openly , flaunt them , and drive hard bargains with the purveyors of their wares . If they lack the artistic endow- ment , and can not even write stories for the magazines , they study , travel , enter one of the professions , or engage in business , of which they have invented more than one new form . Although by no means altruistic , they often engage in some public work , because their brains dictate that most reforms if carried through would make life easier for everybody ; and they naturally incline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , the sense of playing a real part in the world ; their determination to live as men do waxes , and they despise the ordinary woman whole-heartedly . Now the logical result of this attitude to life will be their cold-blooded use of men in every way , precisely as their sex always has been and still is used by men . They will fight them at their own game in politics and business , avenging their sex in general and taking a keen delight in the game ; and in time there will be women publishers , bankers , brokers , ward politicians , managers of big business , with thousands of subdued males under their heel . They will soon begin to invade the professions , where already they have obtained a foothold , as rapidly as men . Their private morals will depend entirely upon their normal tendencies , secret principles , and the time left on their hands . There is an enormous percentage of lazy , idle , virile men in the world , and they are not confined to the nethermost stratum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the breed will increase as women tend to demonstrate their ability as money-makers . Let not the " antis " seize upon this as an argument . It will not make the least difference in the progress or the morals of these women whether they get the vote or not . One has only to look back over the past twenty-five years to see what woman has accomplished for herself , with no aid from the ballot . There are only two arguments for giving women the vote : first because it is absurd that she should not have it , and second because the millions of women devoting their lives to the betterment of human conditions can do  | more with than without it . The individualistic woman does not care a snap of her finger for it . Whether these women will prove a rampart upon which the spirit of solidarity abroad in the world will break its shins , or whether they will capitulate to a force stronger than themselves ? assuming that this spirit is something more than a boneless ideal ? remains to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All one can venture to predict is that this vast and increasing army of able , often brilliant and highly-gifted , women , by inheritance more thorough than men in whatever they undertake , untrammelled , more and more conscious of their power ? aided materially , as they will be by eugenics , and other forms of science devoted to the annihilation of ancient enemies ? these women will crowd men more seriously every year ; they will be reinforced by disillusioned wives , and by those who , however unwittingly , married but to be mothers , and have long since outstripped their husbands in the variety of their mental development . What then ? Every woman that has gone out into the world to carve a career , or to earn her bread in conditions hitherto sacred to man , has had more or less experience of sex jealousy . Men that are grubbing along will forgive other men success , but women never . A man must be high above the breakers , or endowed with uncommon nobility , to view a woman 's persistent successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support themselves rarely come in contact with that brutal side of a man 's nature reserved for the women dependent upon his favor , but they quicken the smaller qualities of spite and jealous hatred . This is natural enough , for it is merely an expression of sex fear , ? the unconscious admission that the stately fabric of centuries is weakening at the foundation . It can mean nothing personally to men that women are succeeding brilliantly as doctors , lawyers , authors , journalists , or as more humble breadwinners ; their unfailing antagonism means only a sort  | of dismal prophecy . They believe it to be inspired by disapproval because these women are depleting the home market , deserting their " natural sphere " ; forgetting the millions of sour old maids of former days , whom they may have despised but never treated with active disapproval . They complain that women are " crowding men out " ; forgetting that no woman can hold a man 's job ( business being run for profit ) , if she is inefficient , and that many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the women that write books , or paint , or model , or draw great salaries on the stage , their success is due entirely to their ability to please the public ; and if they often make more money than men in the same arts , that is due not only to the fact that their gifts may happen to be more distinguished , but to their persistence in developing them and to the congenital difference in their habits . Women , unless of uncontrollably wayward tendencies ( which soon dispose of them ) , do not sit up late drinking , waste time at clubs , indulge inordinately in any vice . This natural and easy abstinence , their inheritance from generations of domestic women , makes them painstaking and thorough in all they undertake , gives them an enormous advantage over men . Men , consciously or otherwise , feel this , uneasily sense the danger ahead , will realize it still more definitely when even the wife has achieved the economic independence she is making for in a straight line . So far they have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can they do ? Nothing but pass a law that no woman shall be permitted to earn her bread , and that every man living shall be taxed to keep her handsomely in the sphere to which she was born , or to which her talents bid fair to raise her . Either that or war at a later date . By that time women may be as strong of body as men , as the pit-brow women of Lancashire are to-day . The men may have grown flabby of mind as of body , demoralized by their humiliations . Perhaps they will have done nothing of the sort , but will have reverted to  | primitive brutality . Then the world , civilization , will begin all over again . The same old treadmill . And what does it all mean ? That only a relatively low order of human nature has been allotted to this planet , and that we must await translation to another before reaching a plane revealed to our imaginations in discouraging visions ? ? visions which serve a good purpose in inducing a mirage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than it is , and yet never realized by the wholly sane ? Otherwise , what is the explanation of this exotic , irreconcilable mental quality we call imagination , tantalizingly superimposed upon the ever definite limitations of human nature ?
