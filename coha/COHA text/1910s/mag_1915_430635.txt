 | The articles which the Nation has recently published in review of Dr. Benjamin Rand 's Berkeley and Percival suggest , in the last two paragraphs , some important considerations connected with the critical study of English literature . " Berkeley 's system , " says the writer , " remains one of the great influences not only in metaphysics but in the wider field of thought which we call literature . " He concludes by assigning to Berkeley a connection " with the later literary revolt against rationalistic compression for the unhampered expansion of the emotions and for what we regard else as the forces of personality . " Any disposition to relate philosophy to movements which took rise in the literature of the eighteenth century is encouraging . Critics have been almost unanimous in undervaluing the immediate effect produced upon popular ideas by the philosophic theories of the time ; the neglect is all the more unaccountable in view of the truism that most writing of the time was didactic . On the other hand , some of the criticism which does take the relation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or is made with so little reference to the literature itself , that the conclusions reached are highly questionable . The articles in the Nation , by Mr. Paul Elmer More , are brilliant and stimulating ; but his suggestions concerning Berkeley 's relation to the evolution of literary taste , though offered so tentatively as to be somewhat vague , are in danger of this second error . The impression given is that Berkeley was more directly influential than , I think , the actual evidence warrants . If Berkeley was part of the spirit of enthusiasm " which all through the eighteenth century was preparing for the revolution of the nineteenth , " his influence , it may fairly be presumed , manifested itself somewhere in the first half of his  | century . Certainly it would not be easy to find in the second half any writers who listened to the gentle voice of Berkeley amid the clamor excited by Rousseau and other radicals . If any considerable inspiration flowed from him to the romanticists of the early nineteenth century , it was probably filtered through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great popular influences . References to Berkeley in the first half of the century , however , are extremely scarce ; they are to be found almost exclusively in minor poetry ; and if they commend him at all , it is for his private character as a philanthropist and not as a philosopher . To John Dyer , for example , Berkeley 's name suggests only the invention of tar-water for the cure of man and beast . Some of the poets took delight in ridiculing his scheme for converting the Indians , and the writers of the period were practically unanimous in ignoring or ridiculing his doctrine that there is no reality outside the percipient mind . Mr. More cites the emphatic denial of Dr. Johnson . Berkeley 's own Hylas states the prevailing attitude quite accurately : " What ! Can anything be more fantastical , more repugnant to common sense , or a more manifest piece of scepticism , than to believe there is no such thing as Matter ? " Even Clarke , author of the dry Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use on account of their abstruseness . " It may be confidently asserted that as a theorist he was strictly unpopular , that he contributed little or nothing to the popular notions of his day except in regard to tar-water , and that the few writers who began to show signs of what we vaguely call romanticism found nothing in Berkeley to inspire new thought . It is possible , however , that Mr. More intends to lay only slight emphasis on Berkeley 's immediate influence ; that he means rather to point out in Berkeley 's personal reaction against the prevailing mental habits of his time a spirit prophetic of the later romanticism . This opinion is confirmed , the author might argue , by the very indifference of Berkeley 's contemporaries . But is there evidence that he exhibits tendencies of thought which are ahead of his time in their anticipation of a new school of literature ? To say merely that he anticipates some part of the general change is to say little ;  | Addison admired popular ballads , Prior awkwardly imitated Spenser , and Pope frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hardly think of them as manifesting " an enthusiasm belonging to a different school altogether . " The probability that Berkeley was one of many writers who contributed something to the late metaphysics of Shelley is scarcely to the point ; these are exceptional ideas of an exceptional poet . Apparently , too , the critic had no such ideas in mind in his reference to the various hints of romanticism exhibited by Berkeley . For one bit of evidence in Berkeley 's case he refers to the " Quixotic fervor with which he threw himself upon the belief ( so unchristian and so dear to Rousseau ) in the innocence of the natural state of man . " The real significance of Berkeley 's utterances on the subject depends largely upon their relation to the views then current in learned and popular philosophy . The " State of Nature " and its corollary , the " Social Compact , " had been familiar topics since Hobbes had assumed them hypothetically to support his theory of Divine Right . Later philosophers were practically unanimous in denouncing Hobbes ' main contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pretty general agreement also in opposition to his doctrine of absolute sovereignty and the similar doctrine of " Passive Obedience . " But the philosophers of the Whig opposition differed among themselves on the question whether human beings had ever actually lived in " a state of nature . " By assuming that they had , Locke 's Two Treatises of Government ( 1690 ) came near proving more than was convenient even for the liberal notions of the Whigs . Thereafter the tendency was to avoid such an issue by placing all the emphasis on man 's natural goodness and leaving the historical question untouched . Shaftesbury made one side of the argument destructive of the other : the very fact that man is by instinct a benevolent and social creature precludes the possibility of such a " state of nature , " the " herding instinct " being so strong in man that he could not be conceived in any stage of history as having lived unrelated to his fellows by strong social bonds . The same view is presented in the anonymous pamphlet Moderation Truly Stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Mary Astell , thought all had agreed " that a State of Nature was a mere figment of Hobbe 's Brain , or borrow 'd at least from the fable of Cadmus , or Aeacus his Myrmidons . " In political theory , however , the argument had one definite effect ; it practically gave a deathblow to " Divine Right " and " Passive Obedience . " For the purpose of literature , it opened a still wider field of speculation than was encouraged by the philosophers . The fictionists were united in their opposition to Hobbes ' derogatory estimate of natural man , and at least for the purposes of art they were pleased to find the Golden Age of the classics confirmed by this equally hazy " state of nature , " where primitive man lived an idyllic life of virtue untainted by the luxuries and vices of civilization . The example had been set by Mrs. Behn 's Oroonoko ( 1688 ) even before Locke had pronounced his opinion ; though some critics have taken Mrs. Behn 's purpose too seriously , she was ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the " state of nature " became a favorite topic with the poets . Since their flights were somewhat restrained by political considerations , they were satisfied usually to employ natural man for decorative purposes and to keep their proposals within the limits of mild sentimentalism . It is in keeping with the complacence of the age that the poets who dallied with the notion of primitive virtue refrained from really testing its explosive qualities . At the same time the inconsistencies of Thomson , Pope , Mallet , and other poets , most of them deistic , at times invested their eulogies of primitive peoples , such as the natives of the Hebrides and America , with a dangerous political significance . Noble primitive man was actually an article of their poetic creed rather than a serious belief ; but it is true that they occasionally betray a leaning towards the radical theory of Rousseau . Fortunately , Berkeley has left a very explicit account of his belief concerning both the " state of nature " and the " social compact , " and it will require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with this sentimental notion . Mr. More was probably misled by the poetic license of two phrases in Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America . Berkeley explained his point fully in  | page deleted  | own age merely because he was a generation behind it ; and to compare him to Rousseau is less logical than it would be to refer him to Hobbes and Filmer . Next we are informed that there is in Berkeley 's descriptions something to " give us pause " ; just what is not quite clear from the article , for it is admitted that " superficially they may not seem to be striking . " One suggestion made is that they intensify the meaning of the simile which represents Nature as an open book , " wherein the Author in symbolic language has written out for our perusal the desires and purposes of his soul . " If so , the contribution of the orthodox bishop has , from an historical point of view , an ironical aspect . Of course , the Christians did not deny natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deity through nature was the soul of deistic teaching . To deists no other manifestation of God was allowed . In an early stage of the rationalistic movement , the orthodox philosophers believed that there was no incompatibility between the doctrine of direct revelation and faith on one hand and that of natural revelation and the supremacy of reason on the other . For example , Culverwel states in the Introduction to An Elegant and Learned Discourse of the Light of Nature ( 1652 ) the very laudable design " to give unto Reason the things that are Reasons , and unto Faith the things that are Faiths , " adding that " there is not such a vast hiatus . . . . between them as some would imagine . . . . they may well salute one another . . . . Reason and Faith may kisse each other . " But later events did not justify his optimism . It gradually became clear that the insistence on natural revelation was undermining the orthodox creed , and eventually the clash between the Christians and the followers of Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's works appeared during the heat of the fight . That he should have made more of deistic theory than the deists did and vitalized their chief figure of speech for them seems strange . After all , it is a figure that will bear only so much meaning . Shaftesbury saw something of its possibilities . Thomson , avowedly a follower of Shaftesbury , employs it repeatedly . In Summer he says ( 11. 192 ff ) :  | To me be Nature 's volume broad-displayed ; hi be to And to peruse its all-instructing page , Or , haply catching inspiration thence , Some easy passage , raptured , to translate , My sole delight ; as through the falling glooms Pensive I stray , or with the rising dawn On Fancy 's eagle-wing excursive soar . Apparently he handed it over to his friend Young , whom he addressed in the following passage ( Autumn , 11. 668 if ) : Here wandering oft , fired with the restless thirst Of thy applause , I solitary court The inspiring breeze ; and meditate the book Of Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to learn the moral song . Young in turn used the figure often and developed it at considerable length in a passage beginning ( Night IX ) : Divine instructor ! thy first volume , this , For man 's perusal ; all in capitals ! Does the following passage from Berkeley exhibit greater imagination or romantic properties ? " As in reading other books a wise man will choose to fix his thought on the sense and apply it to use , rather than lay them out in grammatical rethem marks on the language ; so , in perusing the volume of nature , it seems beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each particular phenomenon to general rules , or showing how it follows from them . We should propose to ourselves nobler views , namely , to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty , order , extent , and variety of natural things : hence , by proper inferences , to enlarge our notions of the grandeur , wisdom , and beneficence of the Creator ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as in us lies , subservient to the ends they were designated for , God 's glory , and the sustentation and comfort of ourselves and fellow creatures . " ( Of the Principles of Human Knowledge , 109 ) . How Berkeley could possibly convert this one figure into a premonition of the coming romanticism , I fail to understand . To me it seems rather that the Bishop was quite satisfied with  | the literary conventions which were the stock in trade of his era . The drift of all these various observations is explained in Mr. More 's general statement that probably " romantic sympathy with nature played an important part in Berkeley 's revolt from the coldness of rationalism . " In substantiation of this view occurs the only specific evidence which he cites as a proof of Berkeley 's literary quality . The quotation , which follows , is from the speech of " a wavering Deist " in Alciphron : " I hold the confused notion of a Deity , or some invisible power , to be of all prejudices the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together over a glass of wine , by a cheerful fire , in a room well lighted , we banish with ease all the spectres of fancy or education , and are very clear in our discussion . But as I was taking a solitary walk before it was broad day-light in yonder grove , methought the point was not quite so clear ; nor could I readily recollect the force of those arguments , which used to appear so conclusive at other times . I had I know not what awe upon my mind , and seemed haunted by a sort of panic , which I can not otherwise account for , than by supposing it the effect of prejudice ; for you must know , that I , like the rest of the world , was once upon a time catechised and tutored into the belief of a God or Spirit . " By way of further comment on this passage , we are told : " To one who can read between the lines such a passage as this ought to convey something more than the rhetorical pantheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect that deep down at the root of Berkeley 's metaphysics lies the pathetic fallacy ' of feeling one 's self into the phenomena of nature , a fallacy , indeed , never far from the heart of man , but in its excess one of the sure marks of romanticism . " Something must be allowed to the required brevity of the critic 's treatment ; but his method is , it seems to me , to build large generalizations upon flimsy authority . He is peculiarly unfortunate in hitting upon Shaftesbury as a foil to bring out what he considers the romantic traits of Berkeley . In the first place , his attempt to draw the line between the fashionable deists and the Bishop of Cloyne is made upon a false assump- tion , which is taken over in good faith from Berkeley himself . Berkeley is here guilty of a subterfuge for which Miss Aiken blames Addison ( Life , II. , 63 ) , and for which Sir James Mackintosh , Professor Fowler , and the Right Honorable Arthur James Balfour criticize Berkeley , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying them with atheists . It was a regular trick of controversy . Berkeley 's deist in the Alciphron is a composite of all the views which offended the orthodox conception . Through the use of this character Berkeley implies that the deists confined their observations to a bottle of wine and a cheerful fire ; the truth is they did more than any other sect of the time to send men abroad in the fields and forests to learn of God . Nature was to them literally the open Bible . He implies further that they did not believe in a personal God or Spirit ; their theology was , in fact , a pure theism . It is ironical , too , that Berkeley 's " wavering Deist " was imitating the habits of one of these confirmed deists ? represented in Shaftesbury 's Moralists , from which Berkeley seems to have taken a leaf . In Shaftesbury 's Dialogue , two friends had arranged in the evening for a morning walk ; but though Philocles awoke while " it was yet deep night , " he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtook the master on the brow of a hill in the dim morning light . Theocles began with a denunciation of philosophy inspired by wine , and then made the following remark to his friend : " Here , Philocles , we shall find our sovereign genius , if we can charm the genius of the place ( more chaste and sober than your Silenus ) to inspire us with a truer song of Nature , teach us some celestial hymn , and make us feel divinity present in these solemn places of retreat . " Then follows the celebrated apostrophe to nature , from which I quote two invocations to illustrate the tenor of a deist 's notion of God and nature : " To thee this solitude , this place , these rural meditations are sacred ; whilst thus inspired with harmony of thought , though unconfined by words , and in loose numbers , I sing of nature 's order in created beings , and celebrate the beauties which resolve in thee , the source and principle of all beauty and perfection " ; " And since nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aught save thee alone inspires me with such thoughts as these , be thou my assistant and guide me in this pursuit , whilst I venture thus to tread the labyrinth of wide nature and endeavour to trace thee in thy works . " A later passage seems to mean that the abused deists had no more shaken off the primitive man 's awe in the presence of nature than had Berkeley 's " wavering Deist " : " The faint and gloomy light looks horrid as the shade itself ; and the profound stillness of these places imposes silence upon men , struck with the hoarse echoings of every sound within the spacious caverns of the wood . Here space astonishes ; silence itself seems pregnant , whilst an unknown force works on the mind , and dubious objects move the wakeful sense . Mysterious voices are either heard or fancied , and various forms of deity seem to present themselves and appear more manifest in these sacred silvan scenes , such as of old gave rise to temples , and favored the religion of the ancient world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinity from so many bright parts of earth , choose rather these obscurer places to spell out that mysterious being , which to our weak eyes appears at best under a veil of cloud . " A nation of readers who had exhausted edition after edition of Shaftesbury had no occasion in 1732 to go to Berkeley 's Alciphron and read between the lines to find what we call " touches of romanticism . " And any critical opinion which regards the " rhetorical pantheism " of Shaftesbury as delaying the triumph of Berkeley 's romantic appreciation of nature is unhistorical . At times Shaftesbury 's rhapsody is an exercise in rhetoric , at times his presentation of nature is mechanical ; the same faults abound also in his poetical imitators , including Thomson . But his enthusiasm for nature , exemplified in his private life as well as his writings , was one of the vital agencies in the destruction of the pastoral classicisms . It is a far cry from Shaftesbury 's nature to that of Wordsworth ; but it is equally far from Dryden 's to Shaftesbury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treatment of nature played a negligible part either as an influence or as a prophecy . Shaftesbury himself comments on the fact that the history of philosophy is the history of a few catch-words ; he might have applied his remark to the history of criticism . We easily  | come to accept a few phrases as summing up the quality of a writer or a period : the Augustan Age is merely " rationalism " and " classicism , " and the literature of the deists is " rhetorical pantheism . " There is , to be sure , some truth in this method . The first half of the eighteenth century is a pat illustration of Shelley 's dictum that the writers of any particular age " can not escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live . " But such generalizations are not the whole truth ; in this particular instance , they go wide of the mark most of all because they prejudice critical opinion by a false association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " rhetorical pantheism " come to be inseparably related ; they are made indiscriminately responsible for what we find in the early eighteenth century and do not find in the early nineteenth . The hardship is greatest on the deists . However shallow their theology may have been , historians of religion have long since done them the justice of attributing to their independent ethics , demanded by their heresy , results which have been very beneficial to Christianity . A similar candor in literary criticism would assign to deistic theology and ethics an active force for the enrichment of literature through a freer play of man 's imagination and his more aesthetic valuation of life . The " common influence " of which Shelley speaks was , in the Augustan Age , rationalism : it is the mark of Tillotson , Clarke , Addison , and Berkeley as well as Toland , Shaftesbury , Collins , and Tindal . None escaped . Now , if it is recalled that learned and popular philosophy were on an intimate footing throughout the century , the question of historical importance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of these individual writers grafted upon this rationalism a philosophic doctrine that encouraged literary imitators to break away from the coldness and restraint of classicism ? If the sentiment , emotion , and imagination of a new school of literature are dimly prefigured by any philosophy of the period , it is not that of the orthodox , least of all the early speculation of Clarke and Berkeley . The line of cleavage is to be found in those " deistic and rationalistic writers " whom Mr. More apparently regards  | as constrictive agents ; it will be found particularly in the Characteristics , the one " literary " representative of the entire deistic movement . By popularizing various tenets of pagan philosophy , already attempted in the writings of the Cambridge Platonists and other Latitudinarians , Shaftesbury domesticated for English readers new forces which helped appreciably to humanize both the neo-classical code of literature and the selfish ethics of Christianity as it was preached by the rationalists . Of his system the peculiar doctrines most active in this evolution were the following : a contempt for speculation divorced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread of " enthusiasm " ; emphasis upon " bright , visible , and outward nature " as an image of the divine beauty ; and the threefold ethical doctrine of the moral sense as an instinct of human nature , the intrinsic beauty of virtue considered apart from all ideas of reward , and the intuitive social affections . Over all these assumptions rests the poetic spell of his " virtuoso " teaching that Truth and Beauty are identical ? a reassertion of the Hellenistic spirit which identifies morality and aesthetics by making virtue the expression of a perfected aesthetic sensibility . Though rooted in the common rationalism of the age , such a system contains elements of sentiment and imagination that gradually imparted a new tone to English speculation . There is abundant evidence that he gave a similar turn to popular literature through the imitation of his poetical followers . That the poetry of Thomson and other members of the school lacks the mystery of Wordsworth and the Hellenism of Keats is true ; but it is the necessary link in the historical sequence . By mentioning Shaftesbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one philosopher of the Augustan Age who exerted an actual influence on the development of literature , an influence which can be established by the most conclusive evidence . Some of it is to be found in the acknowledgement of various poets , some in the detailed imitation of others , and some in the general statements of both English and Contnental writers . By resorting to the ordinary generalization , the critic gives a false impression of the entire situation regarded historically ; and the juxtaposition of Shaftesbury and  | Berkeley serves , unfortunately for Mr. More 's conclusion , to emphasize the limitations of Berkeley as a prophet of better things . Balfour 's estimate will stand the test : " It would be a more natural , but not a less important error , to suppose that Berkeley 's habits of thought anticipated something of the spirit of the nineteenth century . . . Berkeley emphatically belonged to his age . " If there is any ground for protesting against this conclusion , it is probably to be found in Siris ( 17-14 ) ? that odd jumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Mr. More 's allusions seem not to be based on Siris . Truly , " this rude Essay doth , by insensible transitions , draw the reader into remote inquiries and speculations , that were not , perhaps , thought of either by him or by the author at first setting out . " ( 297 . ) Balfour excluded this work from his general remark quoted above ; but later , though calling it anachronistic , observed cautiously that the importance of it had been overestimated . Certainly it is a biographical curiosity and is very different from the early works . One biographer thinks it fortunate that , when Berkeley began his speculations , he knew practically nothing about the history of philosophy . In the Principles of Human Knowledge he seriously considers only Locke , and the same scantiness of historical method is noticeable in his other early productions . Later , however , he read more widely , and we get much of the result here condensed into a few pages of ill-digested historical notes . A candid review of the philosophy current in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these fragments is biographical : they resurrect no systems of ancient philosophy with which the age was not thoroughly familiar , and the author 's own comments are cautious to the point of a safe orthodox conservatism . They are interesting chiefly as showing the Bishop 's mild antiquarian interest in a subject which he had neglected in an early period of his life , but which had been engaging the attention of various philosophers much more seriously affected by the study than Berkeley was . Whatever occult notions we find here , they are those of the ancients and not of Berkeley 's recommendation ; if they constitute an anachronism , it comes merely from the fact that early philosophy  | page deleted  | chiefly on the resulting ethics . By stressing the metaphysical doctrines of paganism , Berkeley was , therefore , reverting to an earlier stage of Neoplatonism . How much of this seventeenthcentury literature he knew does not appear from Siris ; but he does make use of Dr. Cudworth 's True Intellectual System , the one book of the preceding generation which had retained its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berkeley and Cudworth , whom he professes to oppose , brings out clearly the amateurish nature of Siris ; Berkeley follows his predecessor , but with great caution , probably because the True Intellectual System had brought its author 's views under the charge of heresy . The result is that , whereas Cudworth had delved into many obscure doctrines of Greek metaphysics for the purpose of enriching his religious notions , Berkeley adhered closely to the original purpose which nominally actuated both writers ? a reconciliation of early speculation and the orthodox creed . Neither as historian nor as critic does he force new issues of Platonism . His caution would be still further emphasized by a comparison with Henry More 's speculation , embodied in both prose and verse . Berkeley 's style is constantly " thus Hippocrates , " " the Magi likewise said , " " the Stoics held , " " The Pythagoreans and Platonists had a notion " ; but what Berkeley himself believed is another matter . At times he takes pains flatly to reject some system under review ( 289 , 290 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " hoary maxims , scattered in this Essay , are not proposed as principles , but barely as hints to awaken and exercise the inquisitive reader " ( 350 ) ; and he is careful to modify his praise even of Plato ( 360 ) . In the few passages indicating his own conclusions ( 266 , 291 , 303 , 320 , 337 ) there is little or no reason for asserting that the Bishop of Cloyne was breaking away from established speculation . Apparently his most daring assumption is : " Thus much it consists with piety to say ? that a Divine Agent doth by his virtue permeate and govern the elementary fire or light , which serves as animal spirit to enliven and actuate the whole mass , and all the members of this visible world " ( 291 ) . This contains no theory of spiritual synthesis which sounded strange to those who had long been familiar with Cudworth 's treatment of " Plastic Nature , " for example :  | page deleted             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
