txt Evening High School Tests . There Is at present before the Committee on Cities a bill known as the HamiltonFerttg bill , Among the numerous provisions in this bill is one to equalize the Regents ' passing marks required of day high and evening high school students . The evening high school student , under the present rule , is required to attain a mark of 75 per cent . in order to pass , while the day high school student need have only 60 per cent It has always been a mystery to me why this discrimination was made in favor of the day high school student . I have during my wide and varied experience in the evening high schools , found the students to be superior to the students in the day high schools . I urge upon every citizen in this State to lend his co-operation to further the passage of this bill . P. T. WARD , President Associated Evening High School Alumni .                   @ @
