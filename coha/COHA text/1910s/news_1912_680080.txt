txt Baltimore is recovering from the fearful strain to which it was subjected last week , and a part of the last six working days. , and it ought to be said , now that the confusion of the convention has passed and men can look at the case in an unprejudiced way , that Baltimore I " made good . " The distances were great , the crowds were the largest ever known in so small a town ; but the arrangements were all that could have been expected , taking all things into account . The police were the politest ever known . An officer said on the last night of the convention that there had not been a single arrest during the eleven or twelve days of any member of the disputatious body , and that speaks well both for the politeness of the force and for the good conduct of the delegates . It might have been better if some arrests had been made ; but the " Jim Ham " Lewis style of regulating the affairs of the convention was the spirit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland . The weather was hot inetpots , but so it was all over the country ; the temptations were great and spread out like a net everywhere ; the terrapin was overripe , and the hotels insisted on feeding the multitude on breakfast foods instead of the big hominy of the neighborhood . But the " vIttles " were good on the whole , and the prices , except where the delegates were made to sleep four in a bed , were as reasonable as could have been expected , when it was absolutely necessary to get back e100,000 that was subscribed for the purpose of convincing the National Committee that Baltimore was the place of all places for the renaissance of the Democracy . ee ? There are many things that ought to be said about Baltimore , the convention , the queer things that were said and the queer things that were done , the little efforts that were made to play in the limelight , the care with which the demonstrations were prearranged , the young men who are coming up , the old fellows that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions , the booms that were exploded , and the general good humor that filled even the most exciting hours of the long " middle passage , " so to say , the banners that were never floated , the lithographs of dark horses that were never taken out of the pasture . There was that boom for Eugene Foss of Massachusetts , for instance , which died a-horning , and the little play with the banners in an alley when the boys were practicing for the psychological moment when the convention was to make a dash for Plymouth Rock , or thereabout . It was all very human and very interesting to the men ' w'ho were looking through the windows at the Belvedere while the carriers were being taught how to mass the eagles . Then there was the unspoken speech of ' ' Senator Smith of South Carolina ? " fifteen-cent cotton Smith , " as he likes to be called  --  who had sat in the convention from early candle light , as the old-fashioned Presbyterians used to express it . till Ion after the " middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untamet eloquence wherewith he was to Ye , The Ticket Named at Baltimore , and Incidents of Its Making ?

" So reads the first amendment to the Federal Constitution , and it has been faithfully adhered to in all the years since that great instrument was given to the people as a lamp to their feet and a light to their path . Occasionally there have been almost violent attempts by the unthinking to make the laws conform to their own particular religious views , but so far these efforts have failed , with the result that here is a country where every man can worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience . Time was when the Pilgrim Fathers , as the saying went , " fell upon their knees and then upon the aborigines " ; but that Was long ago , and now we have become so generous to the first settlers that we are educating those of their number who survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads one naturally , or , it may be thought by the strictly logical , violently , to the statement that the Democratic ticket nominated at Baltimore , speaking from an orthodox point of view , is all that could be desired . Woodrow Wilson , the candidate for President , is a Presbyterian of the purest blue stocking variety , and so is Thomas Marshall , the candidate for Vice President . They were both brought up " in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , " and they have kept the , faith . Gov . Wilson especially is of the Simon-Pure sort . He could answer to this day , notwithstanding the confusion of poi ' itics and the shouting of the captains and kings at Baltimore , " What is the chief end of man ? " and " What ; s effectual calling ? " and " What is required and what is forbidden in all and singular of the Commandments ? " and , it is assumed , this is true also of Gov . Marshall . All of which is interesting because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would seem from the signs in the skies that it is predestinated to glory and not to shame ; which is to say , that its calling and election are almost sure . age Dr. Wilson comes by his Presbyterianism as a matter of course as well as of principle . His father was perhaps one of the greatest teachers of theology that ever taught in the South , and the Christian name he bears is that of another great teacher and preacher , James Woodrow of South Carolina , who was never too old or " sot in his ways " to learn something new or to speculate as to the original questions submitted to the Faculty . It was he who made so large a stir among the Southern Presbyterians twenty years or so ago when the doctrine of evolution was causing much bitter dissension in the ranks of the orthodox . In one of his addresses he advanced the view , not as a demonstrated fact , but as " a reasonable hypothesis , " that man as he is today was not so in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of creation adopted by the Almighty . The doctors had a lively time with the heretic so long as the question lasted ; but as Dr. Woodrow had not said that man was descended , or ascended , from the monkey , he stood his ground and finally was absolved of all the sin that had been charged against him . He died a few years ago still firm in his belief that man is a reasoning animal and that his head was given to him to think with and not merely for the purpose of conserving and preserving old ideas . It does not matter very much that the evolutionists have never been able to prove their case ; but it does matter that Dr. Woodrow died in the odor of sanctity and that his nephew and namesake is very much like him in the respect that he is not afraid to say new things on old questions and to say them so as to attract the widest attention of thinking people . second the nomination of Woodrow Wilson ; and how the cruel men on the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to say , " Mr. President and gentlemen . " But the Smith speech will keep and will do as well on almost any other occasion . or for any other candidate . Then there was the studiously prepared effort of the Hon. Richard Smith VhaleY , four years Speaker of the South Caroline House of Representatives , about which he had dreamed o ' nights , nominating the Hon. Martin F. Ansel , former Governor of his own State ; for Vice President , as a candidate who could fit any platform , a conservative if a conservative were wanted , or a radical , if a radical should be the best man for the place , and how this effort came to grief because When he went aboard the battleship named for the Palmetto State , where the former Governor was the master of ceremonies , the Governor asked the former Speaker , " What name ? " That was a break from which the Speaker will never recover , and thus the National Democracy lost the chance to nominate another Presbyterian for the second place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratifying things In the situation is the rush of young men to the front in the politics of the Democratic Party . Everybody has heard of McCombs , of course , until yesterday almost unknown to fame . It was thought by many during the preliminary campaign that McCombs was rather " fresh , " that he was trying to run his campaign as a sort of Fraternity affair ; but when the time came at Baltimore for McCombs to do his best and most effective strategic work , he was there with his men . It seemed as if there were thousands of them everywhere and all moving like seasoned veterans against the armies of the allies . It was the most brilliant piece of political work that has been done this many a year , and ought to make McCombs tho leader of the party in the harder work ahead .

" There are hundreds , probably thousands , of young Democrats of the Flood type in the South who are coming up into their rightful places in the affairs of the party . As it is in the South , so it is all over the country . There is A.
