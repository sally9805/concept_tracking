LONGSTREET had half New Jersey blood and probably part Dutch . It shows in him . He is far more the modern , practical nineteenth-century American than most of his fellows . What Southern romance he has sits awkwardly and is mixed with mocking . He reminds you again and again of Grant and Sherman in his bull-dog pugnacity and tenacity , his brusque , sharp fashion of hitting right out at men and measures . Southern easy-going ways and shiftlessness vexed him . Our people have been so accustomed to having things at their hands that they seem at a loss for resources when emergencies arise . " Where there is a will there is a way " of overcoming all human obstacles . It is left for us to find it out . ' He was hard-headed , solid , stolid ; and he looked it . ' A thick-set , determined-looking man , ' says Fremantle . And Pollard describes his appearance as ' not engaging . It was decidedly sombre ; the bluish-gray eye was intelligent , but cold ; a very heavy brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily ; his weather-stained clothes , splashed boots , and heavy black hat gave a certain fierce aspect to the man . ' His health , vigor , power of supporting fatigue , were remarkable . ' The iron endurance of General Longstreet is most extraordinary : he seems to require neither food nor sleep . ' As a fighter he was superb ; the best fighter in the Army of Northern Virginia , the soldiers called him . This , perhaps , refers more to character than brains , as it is admitted that he was no great student at West Point or anywhere else . In Mexico he fought most creditably , side by side with Grant and other contemporaries . From Bull Run to Appomattox he was always where the fighting was hottest . His soldiers believed in him and trusted him . lie spoke straight out to them , as if he meant it . Sometimes it was with a heavy sarcasm , as at Gettysburg , to an officer who complained of not being able to bring up his troops : ' Very well , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are , the enemy ' s going to advance , and will spare you the trouble . ' More often he gave them sound , direct , practical advice of the kind to put heart into a man . Let officers and men , even under the most formidable fire , preserve a quiet demeanor and self-possessed temper . Keep cool , obey orders , and aim low . Remember , while you are doing this , and driving the enemy before you , your comrades may be relied upon to support you on either side , and are in turn relying upon you . ' Such advice , coming from the War Department , might not have amounted to much . Coming from a man who was as cool in battle as in a ball-room , it must have been almost as if he had laid a hand on your shoulder . How imperturbable he was is shown by many witnesses , notably Fremantle . No person could have been more calm or self-possessed than General Longstreet under these trying circumstances after Gettysburg , aggravated as they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show a strong disposition to advance . I could now appreciate the term bulldog which I had heard applied to him by the soldiers . Difficulties seem to make no other impression upon him than to make him a little more savage . ' He may not have felt the dancing ecstasy with which Stuart charged and which Longstreet himself admirably describes in another : He came into battle as gaily as a beau , and seemed to receive orders which threw him into more exposed positions with peculiar delight . ' But he was always ready to face any danger or any exposure , too ready . Every one deplores that Longstreet will expose himself in such a reckless manner . To-day he led a Georgian regiment in a charge against a battery , hat in hand and in front of everybody . ' The same imperturbable coolness that distinguished Longstreet in actual fighting characterized him as a leader . He was never anxious , never flurried . Victory could not over-excite him with triumph , nor defeat with despair . He made every preparation , took every precaution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , however , consummate generalship requires something more than imperturbability . It requires brains and speed . Had Longstreet these ? His work as an independent commander suggests some doubt . Intelligence of a certain order , the solid , firm , Dutch grasp of a situation , and common sense in the handling of it , can never be denied him . But quick insight , long penetration , the sudden conception of what is daring to be done and not too daring , in short , a brain like Jackson 's , I do not think he had . As to speed there will be less question . Even Lee is said to have remarked , Longstreet is the hardest man to move in my army . ' In every case the general was able to give a good reason for not arriving in time . But Jackson arrived in time in spite of good reasons . Both these defects and many of Longstreet 's excellences are intimately bound up with one strongly marked trait , which is often an excellence , but runs into a defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an almost unlimited self-confidence . Self-confidence does nearly all the great things that are done in the world . Trust thyself , ' says Emerson ; every heart vibrates to that iron string . ' Doubt of one 's powers , doubt of one 's nerve , dread of responsibility , ? these weaknesses will paralyze the keenest perception , the finest intelligence . But self-confidence , to achieve the highest , must be tempered with insight and sympathy . A man must trust himself , but he must trust others . Before he decides , resolves , executes , he must listen . His own judgment must prevail with him ; but it must be his own judgment qualified , enriched by the judgment of those wiser , or even less wise . No one can impose his own personality , however solid and sturdy , on the whole world . This is what Longstreet tried to do , with exquisite and naive unconsciousness . And this quality of an immense self-confidence runs through his whole career with a steadiness which is very peculiar , very unfortunate , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an over-sensitive pride . This is not Longstreet 's main trouble ; nor was he largely stirred by wounded ambition . ' I am not prompted by any desire to do , or to attempt to do , great things . I only wish to do what I regard as my duty ? give you the full benefit of my views . ' And again : ' If there is no duty to which I can be assigned on this side of the Mississippi River without displacing an officer , I will cheerfully accept service in the trans-Mississippi Department . ' Note also that it is not a foolish conceit , or pig-headed pride of opinion . Once convince the man that he was wrong and he would have been perfectly ready to say , All my fault , ' and begin over again . But you never could convince him that he was wrong . There was one way to see a question and that was the way he saw it , one way to act and that was the way he acted . Other ways and other views were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single quotation can sum up this attitude , naturally . It will , I think , appear in overwhelming significance , as we go on . Page after page of Longstreet 's book is stamped with it . ' Speaking of the impending struggle spring of 1861 , I was asked as to the length of the war , and said , " At least three years , and if it holds for five you may begin to look for a dictator , " at which Lieutenant Ryan , of the Seventh Infantry , said , " If we have to have a dictator , I hope that you may be the man . " ' No doubt , for the good of the country , Longstreet himself hoped so , too . It is in his relation to Lee that this stolid self-confidence of Longstreet appears most interestingly . The two men loved each other . Lee showed his affection for his second in command more frankly and directly than for almost any one else , even Jackson . My old war-horse , ' he called him , perhaps characterizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Longstreet was quite oblivious of it and refers to the phrase with proud complacency , as he does to another point which most of us are inclined to view a little differently : that is , the fact that ' on his march he Lee usually had his headquarters near mine . ' Lee has other words , however , of a less equivocal nature . Thus he writes to the general in the West , ' I think you can do better than I could . It was with that view I urged your going . ' But he longs to have him back : ' I missed you dreadfully and your brave corps . Your cheerful face and strong arm would have been invaluable . I hope you will soon return to me . ' Longstreet 's love for his great chief was equally fervent . Speaking of him after the war he says , ' The relations existing between us were affectionate , confidential , and even tender , from first to last . There was never a harsh word between us . ' Writing to Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is genuine : ' All that we have to be proud of has been accomplished under your eye and under your orders . Our affections for you are stronger , if it is possible for them to be stronger , than our admiration for you . ' And Fremantle , who had observed both men closely , corroborated these words in the most charming manner : ' It is impossible to please Long-street more than by praising Lee . I believe these two generals to be as little ambitious and as thoroughly unselfish as any men in the world . ' But Longstreet did not propose to allow judgment to be hoodwinked by affection . Not for him was the attitude so passionately expressed by Jackson : General Lee is a phenomenon . I would follow him blindfold . ' On the contrary , the commander of the First Corps was keenly aware of his chief 's defects and has recorded them mercilessly for posterity . ' In the field his characteristic fault was headlong combativeness . In the immediate presence of the enemy General Lee 's mind , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' These defects it was naturally the duty of an affectionate lieutenant to watch for and remedy in every possible way . And Longstreet watched . From the first day Lee took command , we have his subordinate 's delightful accounts of the way in which he advised , suggested , or , as one might almost say , dictated . It was Long- street who conceived the plan by which Jackson was to be called from the Valley that McClellan might be driven from the Peninsula ; and if Jackson had been at all equal to the occasion , a great triumph would have been achieved . It was Longstreet who found Lee hesitating about going into Maryland on account of supplies . But I reminded him of my experiences in Mexico , where sometimes we were obliged to live two or three days on green corn . . . . Finally he determined to go on . ' It was Longstreet who pointed out to his commander the folly of the Harper 's Ferry scheme and supposed it was abandoned . But he could not be on the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absence to impose on a mind always too easily led . Later Longstreet did his best to devise a remedy for a bad state of things . ' Lee listened patiently enough , but did not change his plans , and directed that I should go back the next day and make a stand at the mountain . After lying down , my mind was still on the battle of the next day , and I was so impressed with the thought that it would be impossible for us to do anything at South Mountain . . . that I rose and , striking a light , wrote a note to General Lee , urging him to order Hill away and concentrate at Sharpsburg . To that note I got no answer . ' Do you wonder why ? But Gettysburg is the cream of the whole . And observe , I take no part in the controversy as to what Longstreet actually did , or as to the course he advised . It does not become an outsider and a civilian to do so . The general 's judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have been wise , may have been correct . What interests me solely is Longstreet 's character as displayed in Longstreet 's own words . To begin with , then , he is opposed to the campaign from the start , believing that the main operations should be carried on in the West . However , finding Lee unwilling to agree to this , Longstreet permits his commander to enter upon his project . ' I then accepted his proposal to make a campaign into Pennsylvania , provided it should be offensive in strategy , but defensive in tactics . ' Judge of his disgust when they found themselves at Gettysburg and the commander ventured to overstep the lines which his mentor had laid down for him . I suggested that this course seemed to be at variance with the plan of the campaign that had been agreed on before leaving Fredericksburg . He said , " If the enemy is there to-morrow , we must attack him . " . . . I said that it seemed to me that if , during our council at Fredericksburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the two armies , we could not have expected to get the enemy in a better position for us than he then occupied . .. . He , however , did not seem to abandon the idea of attack on the next day . ' And they attacked and failed all along the line ; because Longstreet 's heart was not in it , say his enemies ; because success was impossible , says Longstreet himself . The scene was renewed the next day , Lee deciding and ordering , Longstreet protesting , with imperturbable confidence in his own judgment , and snubbed in a fashion made tenfold more dramatic by its being Lee who did it and Longstreet who recorded it , apparently without the dimmest perception of what it meant . ' I said , " General , I have been a soldier all my life . I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples , by squads , companies , regiments , divisions , and armies , and should know as well as any one what soldiers can do . It is my opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , " pointing to Cemetery Hill . General Lee in reply to this ordered me to prepare Pickett 's division for the attack . ' 1 When everything was over , Lee declared , with divine humility , that it was all his fault . ' Fine , ' says Long-street , in effect , especially as it was . ' In the autumn of 1863 Longstreet went West . He had long felt that he was needed there and he finally prevailed on Davis and Lee to let him go . It would be impossible to surpass the serene confidence with which he viewed this undertaking . Note also that he disclaims , and no doubt sincerely , all thought of personal ambition in the matter . If my corps can not go west , I think that we might accomplish something by giving me Jenkin 's , Wise 's , and Cooke 's brigades , and putting me in General Bragg 's place , and giving him my corps . . . . We would surely run no risk in such a change 1 and we might gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no personal motive in making this suggestion ; and will most cheerfully give up , when we have a fair prospect of holding our western country . I doubt if General Bragg has great confidence in his troops or himself either . He is not likely to do a great deal for us . ' He was not put in Bragg 's place , however , but under Bragg 's orders , and , therefore , was naturally unable to accomplish all the great things that he had counted on . If he had found it difficult to place much reliance on Lee , how was it to be expected that he should place any on Bragg ? He did not , and said so . Here again I do not think there was any set purpose of malice or mischief-making . Bragg was wrong . Long-street was right . This must be so obvious to every one that outspoken comment could hardly make it any plainer . The effect , however , was not happy , witness Mackall , who was no friend to Bragg : ' I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others put together . You may understand how much influence with his troops a remark from a man of his standing would have to the effect that Bragg was not on the field and Lee would have been . ' This sort of thing seems incredible in a man of Longstreet 's age , training , and soldierly habits ; but the language of his own letters shows abundantly what his attitude was . He writes to Buckner , ' As every other move had been proposed to the general and rejected or put off till time made them more inconvenient , I came to the conclusion that this was to be the fate of our army ? to wait till all good oppor. tunities passed , and then , in desperation , to seize upon the least favorable one . ' And here again , as at Gettysburg , we can ask nothing more characteristic than the little scene that the general paints for us , apparently quite uncon ? scious of its significance , but depicting himself and a dozen men of similar type , that we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The only notice my plan received was a remark that General Hardee was pleased to make : " I do n't think that is a bad idea of Longstreet 's . " . . . I repeated my ideas , but they did not even receive notice . It was not till I had repeated them , however , that General Hardee even noticed me . ' Unconscious self-interpretation like this , as with Pepys , amounts to genius . No one could attack Bragg without attacking Davis , and to Longstreet Davis ? when he was wrong ? was no more than Bragg . Twice , at least , in full and formal military council , the general gave his advice to the presi ? dent ? and was snubbed . The first time was early in the war , before the Peninsular campaign . ' From the hasty interruption I concluded that my opinion had only been asked through polite recognition of my presence , not that it was wanted , and said no more . ' The second time was in connection with the movements of Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Longstreet . As described by the latter , it is a singularly impressive and characteristic incident . He had given his views in regard to the situation at some length , and assumes that Lee agreed with them . The president did not . General Lee wore his beard full , but neatly trimmed . He pulled at it nervously , and more vigorously as time and silence grew , till his nervousness was conquered . The profound quiet of a minute or more seemed an hour . When he spoke , it was of other matters , but the air was troubled by his efforts to surrender hopeful anticipations to the caprice of empirics . He rose to take leave of the august presence , gave his hand to the President , and bowed himself out of the council chamber . His assistant went through the same forms , and no one approached the door to offer parting courtesy . ' Even after this Longstreet could not get the responsibility of the matter off his mind . After returning to the West , ' it occurred to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asperities of the Richmond council . . . . In reply the President sent a rebuke of my delay . ' The most significant element of all in Longstreet 's western campaign is his dealings with his own subordinates , AlcLaws , Law , and Robertson . The dramatic genius of Sophocles could not have devised a finer climax than that situation . At Gettysburg , just before , as second in command to Lee , the general had thoroughly disapproved of his chiefs action , and had not hesitated to say so . Likewise , he had failed to carry out his chief 's wishes , through either obstinacy or inability . Lee , with supreme tolerance , intent on the future , not on the past , had accepted the latter solution and found no word of fault with his lieutenant 's motives in any way whatsoever . Then Longstreet goes West and is placed in charge of the Knoxville expedition . His second in command , Mc-Laws , disapproves of the assault on Fort Loudun , exactly as Longstreet disapproved of the assault at Gettysburg . Hear McLaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being put forward as a blind to draw attention away from the main issue , which is the conduct of the campaign in East Tennessee by General Longstreet . I assert that the enemy could have been brought to an engagement before reaching Knoxville ; that the town , if assaulted at all , should have been on the first day we arrived or on the next at furthest ; that when the assault was made on Fort Loudun it was not called for by any line of policy whatever . ' If he had been endowed with divination , could he have anticipated more perfectly Longstreet 's final attitude with regard to Gettysburg ? But how different was Longstreet 's treatment of his subordinates under these circumstances from Lee 's ! As soon as he suspects disaffection , he writes sharply through his aide , I am directed to say that throughout the campaign on which we are engaged you have exhibited a want of confidence in the efforts and plans which the commanding general has thought proper to adopt , and he is apprehensive that this feeling will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When the assault is imminent , he insists that previous conviction of failure is the surest road to it . Please urge upon your officers the importance of making the assault with a determination to succeed . If the assault is made with that spirit , I shall feel no doubt of its success . ' And again : ' If we go in with the idea that we shall fail , we will be sure to do so . But no men who are determined to succeed can fail . Let me urge you not to entertain such feelings for a moment . Do not let any one fail , or any thing . ' Oh , imagine how Lee would have liked to say just that to Longstreet on the morning of July 3 , and , if he had , what Longstreet would have answered ! When all is over he does , indeed , admit to the War Department that it may have been his fault . ' It is fair to infer that the fault is entirely with me , and I desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This does not mean , however , that he forgets or forgives , so far as his subordinates are concerned . He prefers charges against McLaws , Law , and Robertson . They are tried by a court-martial , which only partially sustains the commander , and even this insufficient verdict is reversed by the Richmond authorities . ' The proceedings , finding , and sentence of the court are disapproved . Major-General McLaws will at once return to duty with his command . ' Long-street rebels and receives an even harsher snub from Davis : ' General Longstreet has seriously offended against good order and military discipline in rearresting an officer who had been released by the War Department , without any new offense having been committed . ' Longstreet has a final word on the matter in his book , whether to his own advantage or disadvantage , I leave to the reader 's judgment . Confidence in the conduct of the war was broken , and with it the tone and spirit for battle further impaired by the efforts of those in authority to damage , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vital interest . ' It might be supposed that , after these varied experiences , the general would have returned to Lee 's supre. macy with a saddened and a chastened spirit . I do not find this indicated . Through the spring of 1864 and later , when he returned to duty after his Wilderness wound , he was always cheerfully ready to patronize his cont. mander and to give abundant advice , when it was asked for , and when it was not . I am pleased at all times to have any suggestions that you may make , and am gratified to find that you in your numerous duties do not lose sight of these small matters , ' is the usual tone . Perhaps the most curious suggestion offered is that the military authorities should impress ' all the gold in the country and use it for the necessities of defense . Unfortunately most of Lee 's replies to his subordinate 's exhortations are lost . We have his comment on this gold matter , however , a gentle reminder that the specie is not accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scattered and hidden all over the Confederacy . Long-street , perfectly unconcerned , insists as before : ' The gold is in the country , and most of it is lying idle . Let us take it at once and use it to save Richmond and end the war . ' Finally , in considering Longstreet 's conduct after the war was over , I think we shall find the best excuse or explanation for it in this same trait of overmastering self-confidence . Here we should turn to Mrs. Longstreet . It is worth observing that the lives of three of the most prominent Southern leaders ? Davis , Jackson , and Longstreet ? have been written by their wives with loving eulogy , and that in each case these ladies furnish ? quite unintentionally ? striking testimony as to their husbands ' weaknesses and defects . It is a notable illustration of the old poet 's remark , Thus , when Mrs. Longstreet insists that her hero , in joining the Republican party and accepting government office , sacrificed personal advantage to a spirit of lofty patriotism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she makes him ridiculous . Her own naive account of the activities and the luxury of his last years proves this , and the swelling phrases of her affectionate enthusiasm require no comment . ' I love best to think of him , not as the warrior leading his legions to victory , but as the grand citizen after the war was ended , nobly dedicating himself to the rehabilitation of his broken people , offering a brave man 's homage to the flag of the established government , and standing steadfast in all the passions , prejudices , and persecutions of that unhappy period . It was the love and honor and soul of the man crystallized into a being of wonderful majesty , immovable as Gibraltar . ' Verily , ' Those have most power to hurt us that we love . ' Yet , as to the substance , I think Mrs. Longstreet is right , and those Southerners who suspect her husband of place-hunting , of adopting the winning side for his own aggrandizement , are totally wrong . He was a practical American . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sooner it was restored , the better . And the more good men that took hold to restore it , the better still . The sentiment of lost causes , of fallen flags , of consecrated graves was ? sentiment . Those who were to make the future had no time for it . That was his view . And , as all his life , he could not imagine that there could be any other . He acted on it at once ? and found himself , among thousands of his old comrades , all alone . And now , surely , we are eager to probe the ' wonderful majesty ' of this ' immovable Gibraltar ' for what was human under it ; to thrust below the stolid , Dutch , phlegmatic surface of grim work and rock-like confidence and find the emotions of mortality . They were there . Let us take the unsightly ones first and be rid of them . They had a grip on the man 's soul that forbids us to pass them by . He was jealous , he was harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , undoubtedly , to bring out these feelings in him . But others have borne as much in a different spirit . To begin with his attitude toward Lee ? or Lee 's admirers . Immediately after Gettysburg , perhaps under the influence of Lee 's example , he wrote the noble letter to his uncle in which he says , ' As we failed , I must take my share of the responsibility . In fact , I would prefer that all the blame should rest upon me . As General Lee is our commander , he should have all the support and influence we can give him . If the blame , if there is any , can be shifted from him to me , I shall help him and our cause by taking it . ' But this mood did not last . On which side the faultfinding began is disputed , but it soon grew into bitter recrimination . Long-street 's course during the battle , justly or unjustly , was condemned far and wide , and he retorted with the utmost acridity , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally in his book . The lofty determination to exonerate Lee at his own expense was gradually transformed into assertions ? before quoted ? that his old chief was not a master of offensive battle , that ' in the field his characteristic fault was headlong combativeness , ' that ' in the immediate presence of the enemy General Lee 's mind , at all other times calm and clear , became excited , ' and that the fighting at Gettysburg had to go on until ' blood enough was shed to appease him . ' But Longstreet 's attitude toward some of his comrades-in-arms shows even more unpleasant features than his attitude toward his beloved commander . And let me repeat that these things must be insisted on because they indicate such a fatal and such an instructive flaw in a nature of unusual depth and power . The proposed duel with Hill early in the war , if it really was proposed , sprang from pride in his troops as much as in himself . No such excuse will avail for his cruel language toward Early . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long-street 's weakness comes out most . Early , in explaining his criticisms later , says , with noble and Christian charity , ' You will observe that in my article there is some causticity of expression , which was provoked by the character of the article I was replying to . I now sincerely regret the necessity which called forth the personal strictures contained in my replies , and would be glad if they could be eliminated . ' Yet Long-street , writing his book much later still , could express himself in this venomous fashion : ' There was a man on the left of the line who did not care to make the battle win . He knew where it was , had viewed it from its earliest formation , had orders for his part in it , but so withheld part of his command from it as to make cooperative concert of action impracticable . He had a pruriency for the honors of the field of Mars , was eloquent , before the fires of the bivouac and his chief , of the glory of war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his grasp , when the heavy field called for bloody work , he found the placid horizon , far and away beyond the cavalry , more lovely and inviting . ' The same spirit is apparent in Long-street 's remarks about Jackson and Virginia . Here again one should read Colonel Allan 's noble expression of Virginia 's opinion about Longstreet . This only emphasizes such remarks as the following , in regard to Harper 's Ferry : ' Jackson was quite satisfied with the campaign , as the Virginia pa. pers made him the head of Harper 's Ferry , although the greater danger was with McLaws , whose service was the severer and more important ' ; or this other , when Jackson declined Long . street 's assistance in the Valley : ' I had been left in command on the Rapidan , but was not authorized to assume command of the Valley district . As the commander of the district did not care to have an officer there of higher rank , the subject was discontinued . ' These things make one recur to Mrs. Long-street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen at the outbreak of the Spanish War : ' If I could recall one hour of my distant but glorious command , I would say , on the eve of battle with a foreign foe , " Little children , love one another . " ' The most characteristic , most important , and most unfortunate of all Longstreet 's writings about his old companions is the deliberate close of his article in the second volume of the Century War Book . I do not think the most ardent admirer of Lincoln can approve either the feeling or the taste with which his name is introduced here . ' I can not close this sketch without reference to the Confederate commander . When he came upon the scene for the first time , General Lee was an unusually handsome man , even in his advanced life . He seemed fresh from West Point , so trim was his figure , and so elastic his step . Out of battle he was as gentle as a woman , but when the clash of arms came , he loved fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual thing he was remarkably well balanced ? always so , except on one or two occasions of severe trial when he failed to maintain his exact equipoise . Lee 's orders were always well considered and well chosen . He depended almost too much on his officers for their execution . Jackson was a very skillful man against such men as Shields , Banks , and Fremont , but when pitted against the best of the Federal commanders , he did not appear so well . Without doubt the greatest man of rebellion times , the one matchless among forty millions for the peculiar difficulties of the period , was Abraham Lincoln . ' But who could leave Longstreet so ? It is incontestable that with all these marked and disastrous defects the man was immensely lovable , and had not only force , but charm . Under the stolid exterior there were kindly emotions as well as sharper ones . Socially he is said to have been quiet and undemonstrative , yet at times he showed a tenderness and affection which were all the more appreciated . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause he served were strong and genuine . ' While we weep with the friends of our gallant dead , we must confess that a soldier 's grave , in so holy and just a cause , is the highest honor that a man can attain . ' For myself , ' he says , after Vicksburg and Gettysburg , I felt that our last hope was gone , and that it was only a question of time with us . ' Yet he fought on as steadily , as bravely , as persistently as ever , and declared , in January , 1865 , we are better able to cope with the enemy now than we have ever been , if we will profit by our experience and exert ourselves properly in improving our organization . ' He was as thoughtful in his sympathy for non-combatants as he was hardy in fighting . Thus after Fredericksburg he directs a subscription to be taken up for the inhabitants of that city , and describes their sufferings and their devotion with the most evident tenderness . I have cited many bitter words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in print , set solid in history , and injure him far more than those he attacked . But we should weigh against them the kindly , charitable things which Mrs. Longstreet describes him as saying . When Gordon , who had uttered harsh words about Gettysburg , was reported ill , Longstreet inquired , with touching concern , about his condition . Judge Speer and the general had had disagreements . When asked how he would receive the judge , Longstreet answered , ' As I would receive any other distinguished American . And as for our past differences , that has been a long time ago , and I have forgotten what it was all about . ' General Hampton felt bitterly as to Longstreet 's politics and would not meet him . Mrs. Longstreet commented on the matter with some harshness . But her husband said , ' There is not a finer , braver , more gallant officer in the Confederate service than Wade Hampton . ' Most touching , also , is Mrs. Longstreet 's picture of her husband 's yearning for the lost esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his eyes slowly filled . While he bore unjust criticism in silence , he was visibly moved by any evidence of affection from the Southern people . ' And he is said to have been stirred most deeply by the enthusiasm shown for him by his old followers at the unveiling of the Lee monument . Indeed , if one wishes to forget the general 's unamiable peculiarities , one must turn to his relation with his soldiers , and one can not fail to appreciate what a really great heart he had . He loved his men , sympathized with them , laughed at and understood their failings , saw their needs and strove with all his might to remedy them . When he found troops altering the works for better security , although the engineers objected , he approved , saying , If you save the finger of a man 's hand , that does some good . ' When the cavalry leaders were inclined to scoff at the infantry , he rebukes them . ' The commanding general regrets that you entertain the impression that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your troops are in the service of the Government , and are battling for a common cause and a common country . The infantry of this army have fought too many battles to be told that their bread is earned by the cavalry . ' And better even than Longstreet 's affection for his men is his men 's affection for him . The large number of testimonial letters printed in Mrs. Long-street 's book goes far beyond mere conventional eulogy . It shows a devotion and a regret which can only have been bred by something great . Concretely , these feelings are best illustrated by the old soldier who brought his gray jacket and his enlistment papers to be buried in his general 's grave . I 've served my time , and the General , he 's served his time , too . And I reckon I wo n't need my uniform and papers again . But I 'd like to leave them with him for always . ' Beside which should be put Stiles 's most striking account , well paralleled by another instance in Fremantle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longstreet 's wound . The members of his staff surrounded the vehicle , some on one side and some on the other , and some behind . One , I remember , stood upon the rear step of the ambulance , seeming to desire to be as near him as possible . I never on any occasion during the four years of the war saw a group of officers and gentlemen so deeply distressed . They were literally bowed down with grief . All of them were in tears . One , by whose side I rode for some distance , was himself severely hurt , but he made no allusion to his wound and I do not think he felt it . It was not alone the general they admired who had been shot down ? it was rather the man they loved . ' To inspire devotion like that a leader must , indeed , have noble qualities ; and , moreover , it confirms one in the belief that a round self-confidence , backed by tried capacity , is a trait men cling to , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his life Long . street joined the Catholic Church . This forms such a remarkable close to his career that it can not be passed over . Mrs. Longstreet , with another of those shrewd blows that come most stingingly from those we love , says that he did it because his former Episcopal associates would not sit in the same pew with him after his political conversion , and he wanted a church that had more charity . I can not suppose that he was a man of naturally religious bent . Such references as he makes to the subject have an excess of unction which I would not for a moment call insincere , but which suggests an excursion into paths not habitually traveled ; and they have a rhetorical turn which appears in almost all his attempts to express unusual emotion . Thus he writes of General Jenkin 's death , In a moment of highest earthly hope he was transported to serenest heavenly joy ; to that life beyond which knows no bugle-call , beat of drum , or clash of steel . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in peace ! Amen ! ' He himself closes his book with a little anecdote which strongly confirms my opinion as to this phase of his character . He visits an old servant long after the war . " Marse Jim , " says the man , " do you belong to any church ? " " Oh , yes , I try to be a good Christian . " He laughed loud and long , and said , " Something must have scared vou mighty bad , to change you so from *what you was when I had to care for you . Yet this man became a Roman Catholic ! This man who had all his life trusted nobody , who had placed his own judgment above that of every other , took the church which sets itself above all judgment , treats kings and commanders and babes and sucklings alike ! It may have been for this very reason . If he was to make the surrender , he may have preferred to make it absolute , and where the Lees and Jacksons would have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular piquancy in the image of him who is said to have jeoparded great battles by his stout self-will , prostrating himself before the Madonna and confessing senile peccadilloes to a black-frocked priest .
