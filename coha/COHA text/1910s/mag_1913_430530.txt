THAT this is the Golden Age of spinsters no one will deny , and that America furnishes the soil in which these hardy plants put forth their finest bloom is equally indisputable . How many years have passed since the " antient maydes " of Boston ? which term included all unmarried women older than twenty-five ? were pronounced by John Dunton to be a " dismal spectacle " ? ' How many years since a few " acute and ingenious gentlewomen " in colonial Virginia had the temerity to remain single and cultivate their own tobacco-plantations , for which unnatural behavior they were subjected to repeated " admonishments " ? Now the " antient mayde " flaunts her freedom in the faces of those who are patiently doing their duty to the world . Now if a woman runs a successful apple-orchard or dairy-farm , her exploits are heralded far and wide , and other women write exultant papers about her , intimating that the day of the male agriculturist is virtually over . I am not sure that the attitude of our great-greatgrandfathers , who jealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering to my sex than this enthusiasm evoked by achievements which in a man would not be found worthy of notice . As for age ? well , who in these years of grace is frankly and confessedly old ? We no longer say , " On a Page de son ccrur , " but " On a rage de sa volonte . " Jane Austen settled down to caps and spinsterhood before she was thirty . Dr. Johnson alluded to Miss Lucy Porter 's " hoary virginity " when that lady was fifty-two . The Ettrick Shepherd stubbornly protested that " to ca ' a woman saxty , and then mainteen that ye didna ca ' her auld , is naething short o ' a sophism . " But now no one gets beyond middle age , or " the prime of life . " I have heard a Boston spinster of eighty-two ( a remarkable woman , I admit ) casually spoken of as middle-aged ; and when , in a desperate resolve to push matters to an issue , I said : " Miss D ? is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old when you are eighty-two , when are you old ? " the remark was taken in ill part . " I should not dream of calling ' bliss D ? old , " said one gallant Bostonian , and all his hearers agreed with him . The French spinster is a negligible factor . The English spinster has conquered her territory and become a force to be reckoned with . But the American spinster is the standard-bearer of the tribe . Her incessant activities and her radiant selfsatisfaction have made her appear more dominant than she is , and have caused her critics much needless apprehension . When Mrs. Van Vorst wrote , in 1903 , " Our factories are full of old maids , our colleges are full of old maids , our ball-rooms in the worldly centers are full of old maids , " Americans read these words with placid unconcern . They had given too many wedding presents in their day to have any doubts anent the permanent popularity of marriage . But English readers , who are ever prone to be literal , appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettre . Mr. Marriott Watson , chilled to the heart ? as well he might be ? by the vision of a ballroom destitute alike of girls and matrons , wrote for the " Nineteenth Century " a severe and agitated protest . He asserted that a woman 's " functions " " alone excuse or explain her existence , " ? which is one way of looking at the matter ; and he pointed out that American women are the most remote the world can show from the primitive and savage type which represents the dynamic force of a race . The mere fact that the American spinster is so often and so sharply censured marks the strength of her position . No one dreams of censuring the French vieille fzlle or the German jungfrau . These victims of fate meet with scorn or sympathy , according to the taste and breeding of commentators . In either case , their lives  | are registered as failures . Nothing can rob the German woman of those vital sensibilities which center in the home and family . " Every- great movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has been rooted in emotion . " If the women of Germany are demanding " rights , " and demanding them with no uncertain voice , it is because they seek to meet their responsibilities with authority . The sphere of home and child-rearing is their sphere , and they purpose to rule in it . It is not possible for the Frenchwoman , who understands the structure of society , to welcome spinsterhood . " All her instincts of expansion , " says that acute observer ' Ir . William Crary Brownell , " are hostile to it . There is no more provision in the French social constitution than in the order of nature itself for the old maid . " Therefore , as the twin passions of the French heart are to be in rational accord with nature and in rational accord with social life , the unmarried woman has no alternative but to feel herself doubly incomplete . She is unstirred by the American woman 's vaulting ambition to be man 's rival , or by an uneasy envy of man 's estate . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France has produced more eminent women than any other nation in the world . Certainly the only man who ever had the courage to say he would like to be a woman ( a beautiful woman , he stipulated ) was that distinguished Frenchman Al . Jules Lemaitre . No one since De Quincey has spoken so generously of the English spinster as has Mr. John B. Atkins in the pages of THE CENTURY . He does not , like so many of his contemporaries , accuse her of gross selfishness . He does not deny her the right to control her own life . He goes so far as to say that she may use it to good purpose , and extract from it some measure of content . He points out the philanthropic paths which it should be her duty and her pleasure to tread . He draws a pleasing picture of the maiden aunt giving to nieces and nephews ? to nephews especially ? her sympathy and comradeship . Sir Leslie Stephen says that " Woman to a boy is simply an incumbrance upon reasonable modes of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ? aunts and otheis ? have the same doubtful regard for boys . But British sentimentality demands of the old maid , if she be a good old maid , that yearning attitude toward other people 's children which marks her as " womanly " and earns for her the tolerance of the world . The American spinster is seldom sentimental , which is in her favor , and she is seldom emotional , which is both gain and loss . Her attenuation of feeling lessens her charm and influence , but serves to keep her in accord with the orderly conventions of society . She is keenly competitive , and eager for new fields of activity ; but she can read Ellen Key 's " Love and Iarriage " with intelligent detachment . She cries occasionally for the moon , but she is in no immediate danger of scorching her fingers by trying to play with the sun . The flexibility of American social life gives to the unmarried woman an assured position which has no counterpart in the older civilizations . She may be an anomaly in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less agreeable surroundings . She has no background to give repute and distinction to her role ; but she infuses into it her own persuasive personality . She stands free from the common obligations of her sex , but she does work which is well worth doing , and she not infrequently adds to the gaiety of life . " Of how many homes , " says 1Ir . Brownell , " is she not the decorously decorative ornament ! She may have courted or have drifted into her position of dignified singleness ; it is in either case equally sure that she has not considered her estate incomplete in itself , or disengaged from the structure of society . " As a matter of fact , she is wont to feel herself ? birth and fortune permitting ? a pillar of society . It is no question with her of wasted force or blighted vitality . It is a question of directing her superabundant energy into those channels where she can accomplish measurable results . She seeks and finds a constructive human existence remote from marriage and maternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fates have so decreed . The English woman occasionally assists fate from sheer love of independence . " The most ordinarie cause of a single life , " says Bacon , " isliberty , especially in certain self-pleas- ing and humorous minds . " But it is surely reserved for the American woman to remain unmarried because she feels herself too good for matrimony , too valuable to be intrusted to a husband 's keeping . Her attitude bears some resemblance to that of Mademoiselle de iIontpensier , who wrote with praiseworthy conviction : " I may say without vanity that just Heaven would not bestow such a woman as myself upon a man who was unworthy of her . " This is not idle jesting . Would it be possible in any country save our own for a lady to write to a periodical , explaining , " Why I am an Old iIaid , " and be paid coin of the realm for the explanation ? Would it be possible in any other country to hear such a question as " Should the Gifted Woman Marry ? ? seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any sane and thoughtful woman who was not an American to consider even the remote possibility of our spinsters becoming a detached class , who shall form " the intellectual and economic elite of the sex , and leave marriage and maternity for the less developed woman " ? What has become of the belief , as old as humanity , that marriage and maternity are highly developing processes , forcing into flower a woman 's latent potentialities ; and that the less developed woman is inevitably the woman who has escaped this keen and powerful stimulus . " Never , " says Edmond de Goncourt , " has a virgin , young or old , produced a work of art . " One makes allowance for the Latin point of view . And it is probable that M. de Goncourt never read " Emma . " Signor Ferrero , contemplating the unmarried women of England , those amazing creatures who " devote themselves to sterility , not from religious motives , but from sheer calculation " ( which is also a Latin point of view ) , has recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , and has expressed his genuine dismay as to the possible results of their activity . He has even confessed to some whimsical misgivings lest Italian and Sicilian women should acquire this Saxon taste for spinsterhood . Yet England is emphatically a man 's country ? which France has never been ? and its attitude toward marriage is a robustly masculine attitude , as unacceptable to the French as to the American woman . There is no attempt anywhere to gloss over this rude fact . The Englishman believes with Mr. Kipling : " He travels the fastest who travels alone . " He echoes the verdict of Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson , " Marriage narrows and damps the spirits of generous men . " " The position of a single man , " says a stouthearted writer in the " Contemporary Review , " " is in itself envied and applauded ; that of a single woman certainly is not . To every woman marriage is still accounted a promotion . There may be counterbalancing circumstances , but to be married is , in itself , an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old days when English spinsters softened the reproach of spinsterhood by borrowing the prefix " Mrs. , " as did those excellent ladies , Mrs. Hannah More and Mrs. Elizabeth Carter , the position of a single man was neither envied nor applauded . He was held to be ( if of decent life , ? much allowance was made for rakes ) only a little less contemptible than a single woman . " The pain and the opprobrium o ' defunckin an auld bachelor , " writes the Ettrick Shepherd , expressing after his hardy fashion the sentiment of his time . Dr. Johnson firmly maintained that marriage was more necessary for a man than for a woman , because a woman could make herself comfortable and a man could not . The responsibility for the more modern and more supercilious masculine attitude must be placed where it belongs , ? on the shoulders of the Englishwoman , who has accepted the creed that for her marriage is a promotion , and that " counterbalancing circumstances " should not be held to weigh too- heavily in the scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated on her daughter 's engagement : " To be sure , Jenny hates the man , but then there ' s always something . " Miss Austen was the most veracious of chroniclers , one who with careful selfcontrol refused to wander beyond the area of her own observation ; but there is nothing in American fiction , and very little , I fancy , in the fiction of any land , which is comparable to the marriage of Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins . 1VIanv novelists have made easy copy of husband- hunting . It is a favorite theme with Trollope , who treats it with ruthless cynicism , and it is a not uncommon element in modern story-telling . But Charlotte Lucas staggers us . Miss Austen calls her " sensible and intelligent . " She is also well-bred , clear-headed , and kind . She is Elizabeth Bennet 's chosen friend . And she marries 1VIr . Collins ! Marries him with alacrity , and with permanent satisfaction . If there be any one episode in life and letters which is calculated to reconcile us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the amazing fact that Jane Austen not only married Charlotte Lucas to Mr. Collins , but plainly considered it a not unnatural thing for her to do . Ten years ago , when a rage for cornpiling useless statistics swept over Europe and the United States , it occurred to some active minds that children should be made to bear their part in the guidance of the human race . Accordingly a series of questions ? some sensible and some foolish ? were put to English , German , and American school children , and their enlightening answers were given to the world . One of these questions read : " Would you rather be a man or a woman , and why ? " Naturally this query was of concern only to little girls . No sane educator would ask it of a boy . Even Jules Lemaitre at twelve must have shared the convictions of his fellows . German pedagogues , be it noted , struck the question off the list . They said that to ask a child , " Would you rather be something you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was both foolish and useless . Interrogations concerning choice were of value only when the will was a determining factor . In this country no such logical inference chilled the examiner 's zeal . The question was asked and was answered , and we discovered as a result that a great many little American girls ( a minority , to be sure , but a respectable minority , ) were well content with their sex ; not because it had its duties and dignities , its pleasures and exemptions ; but because they plainly considered that they were superior to little American boys , and were destined , when grown up , to be superior to American men . One small New Eng land maiden wrote that she would rather be a woman because " Women are alway better than men in morals . " Another , because " Women are more use in the world . " A third , because " Women learn things quicker than men , and have more intelligence . " And so on through varying degrees of self-sufficiency . " Lord , gie us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotchman , who knew the value of assurance . Now certainly these little girls were old maids in the making . They had stamped upon them in their tender infancy the hall-mark of the American spinster . In a few more years they will be writing papers on " The Place of Unmarried Women in the World 's Work , " and reading addresses on " The Woman of Intellect : her Duty to Herself and to the State . " There is a formidable lack of humor in this easy confidence , in the somewhat contemptuous attitude of women whose capacities have not yet been tested , toward men who stand responsible for the failures of the world . It denotes , at home or abroad , a density not far removed from dullness . In that dreary little Irish drama , " Mixed Marriages , " which the Dublin actors played in New York two years ago , an old woman , presumed to be witty and wise , said to her son 's betrothed : " Sure , I believe the Lord made Eve when He saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark , while received with applause , reflected painfully upon the absence of that humorous sense which we used to think was the birthright of Irishmen . The too obvious retort which nobody uttered , but which everybody must have thought , was that if Eve had been designed as a care-taker , she had made a shining failure of her job . It is conceded , theoretically at least , that woman 's sphere is an elastic term , comprising any work she is able to do well . Therefore , it may be that American spinsters , keen , college-bred , ambitious , and , above all , free , are destined to compete vigorously and permanently with men . They are , we are told , the only women who can give themselves unreservedly to work , and from them alone enduring results are to be expected . Yet it is at least worthy of notice that most of the successful business women of France , ? Mme. Clicquot-Ponsardin , Mme. Pornmery , Mme. Dumas , Mme. Bernet , Mme. Boucicault , ? have been either married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows who took upon their capable shoulders the burden of their dead husbands ' cares . They were also mothers who , with the definite aims and practical instincts of their race , projected themselves into the future , and wove out of their own pursuits the fabric of their children 's lives . At present the American spinster is in a transition stage , a stage so replete with advantages that we may be permitted to hope it will last long . She has escaped from the chimney-corner , and is not yet shut up in banks and offices . She does a reasonable amount of work , and embraces every reasonable opportunity of enjoyment . She gratifies her own tastes , and cherishes her natural affinities . She sometimes cultivates her mind , and she never breaks her heart . She is the best of friends , and she has leisure for companionship . She is equally free from 1'esprit gaulois and from " les incaurs de vestales petriflees , " which are the Scylla and Charybdis of the French vieille fille . She is content with a contentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assured with an assurance unknown to the experienced English old maid . She is , as I have said , the standard-bearer of her tribe , and the pibroch to which she marches blithely through life has the ring of the old Covenanting song : " That a ' the world may see There ' s nave in the right but we . " All this is far removed , as Mr. Marriott Watson warns us , from the savage and primitive woman , who represents the dynamic force of a race . But who shall ring the bells backward ? And who shall reconcile the primitive woman to the exigencies and formalities of civilization ? Some years ago in South Carolina I came to know and love an old Negro " mammy , " a wise , fat , kind , mysterious old mammy , whose heart was soft , whose touch was healing , whose voice was like a lullaby , and whose experiences would have colored half a dozen ordinary lives . Her sister , the laundress , was one day under discussion , and I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordelia , is Caroline an old maid ? " Aunt Cordelia turned upon me a look in which contempt for my ignorance blended with a deep acceptance and understanding of life as she had known it , unfiltered , unsheltered , unevasive . " Laws , honey , " she said , " we ' s no ole maids . Some ' s married , and some is n't ; but we ' s no ole maids . "  |
