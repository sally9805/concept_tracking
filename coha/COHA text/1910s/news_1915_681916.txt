txt One German and two British notes were received at the State Department today . The German note dealt with the sinking of the American sailing ship William P. Frye , and was a response to the American note of June 24 , challenging the German contention that the destruction of the Frye was not a violation of the treaty of 1799 , and asking Germany to settle this claim by direct diplomatic negotiations instead of by prize court Proceedings . Germany does not yield to the American contention . The German note probably will be made public Thursday morning . The two British notes were supplemental to the principal reply of the British Government , received last week , to the American note of March 30 , on British interference With neutral commerce . The first of the supplemental communications received today is a resonse to the recent protest of the United States covering principles involved in the detention of the American steamer Neches . The second supplemental note is a reply to the American " caveat " of July 14 , which asserted that the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that was in contravention of international law . The British notes will be given out tomorrow afternoon for publication on Wednesday morning . The complete response of the British Government to the various representations of the United States:with regard to interferences with neutral trade takes the form of three notes . The first was received on July 26 , and the second and third were  --  received today . All deal with the general question  --  though different phases  --  of the rights of neutral commerce under international law , as affected by the enforcement of the British Order in Council of March 15. restricting overseas commerce of Germany . At the request of Sir Edward Grey the publication of the main British reply , received by the State Department on July 26 , was postponed until the receipt of the supplemental Neches and " caveat " replies . ' The Neches Note . The note dealing with the Neches case will be of unusual interest to American importers because it embraces the British claim of right to interfere with trade out of Germany . The British Government maintains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and that if there has been any departure it has not been from accepted principles , but from former ways of applying those principles in the enforcement of a blockade . The United States Government has been challenging England 's right to blocade a neutral country and thus interfere with innocent shipments through neutral ports into and from Germany , in trade with neutrals . The British Government insists that under the doctrine of continuous voyage it has a right to prevent trade with the enemy , but that the peculiarities of the present situation are such that the application of existing rules of international law must be somewhat different from application in the past . It is understood that the British Government takes the position that its interference with German trade . under its construction of international law , may cover trade coming out of Germany as well as goods for that country . Involves Belgian Goods . The Neches note deals with the enforcement of that portion of the Order in Council of March 15 which applies to goods leaving Germany and Austria . The Neches was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port with a cargo of goods of Belgian and German origin . The owners of the ship insisted that goods originating in Belgium were entitled to proceed . The British Government took the position that since Belgium was under German control , goods from there must be considered as of German origin . The Neches was released but the cargo was held and is now before a British prize court . The United States protested asserting that broad principles of international law regarded such goods , as well as innocent goods originating in a belligerent country passing through neutral ports to neutral countries , as exempt from molestation and could only be touched when passing through lines of blockade . The British note in the Neches case goes into the attitude of the British Government toward exportation of goods from Germany to neutral countries , through neutral ports . There are now between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000 worth of alleged American owned goods in Holland and Germany , all of German origin , which have been unable to move to this country on account of the British Government 's attitude . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of JulY t4 deals with the principles of international law under which the British Government insists it has a right to prevent shipments passing from neutral countries ports , when ultimately destined for belligerent consumption , and the attitude of the British Government in cases ' involvin ? American interests being tried in Prize Courts and involving shipments to such eutral ports . I the caveat note the United States informed Great Britain that so far as interests of American citizens were concerned , this Government would insist upon their rights under the principles and rules of international law without limitation or impairment by ordersin-council or other municipal legislation . The United States also held that it would not recognize , the validity of prize court proceedings taken under restraints imposed by municipal law in derogation of rights of American citizens under internatioal law . In the British reply to this note it is asserted that the British Government has endeavored to conform its municipal legislation and prize court proceedings to recognized principles of international law . In a nutshell the British position as outlined in the three notes is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles upon which the British Government has acted are lawful , because the British Government maintains that it is following the recognized rules of international law for which the United States Government has been contending , but whether the new applications of the old principles of international law have in reality involved a departure from those principles . The British position is that differences between the two Governments ovr this point may be submitted to arbitration as a matter . of course , after the close of the war Germany Stands Pat . The new German note dealing with the demand for the indemnity and reparation for the sinking of the sailing ship William P. Frye was handed to Ambassador Gerard at Berlin on Friday and was cabled in sections , the first of which reached the State Department early this morning and the remainder late this afternoon . The note will not be made public before Thursday morning . The cablegram from Ambassador Gerard transmitting the note was silent as to whether an arrangement had been made for simultaneous publication . For this reason Secretary Lansing cabled to the Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its publica Lion on Thursday morning . State Department officials decline to disclose the contents of the new German note , but it is understood that Germany adheres to its previous contentions and does not yield to the request of the United States for the settlement of the claim by direct diplomatic negotiations . The United States has insisted that the destruction of the Frye was a direct violation of the Treaty of 1799 between the United States and Prussia . Germany challenged this contention , although admitting its liability for damages . The German Government 's attitude has been that the German prize court should decide whether the destruction of the ship and cargo was legal , whether the property sunk was liable to confiscation , and to whom and in what amount indemnity should be paid , and that since the decision of the prize court must first be awaited before any further position was taken the simplest way for the interested parties to settle their claims would be to enter them in accordance w , th the German code of prize proceedings . The United States Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a breach of treaty obligations and that it was not a question which fell within the jurisdiction of a prize court , but one which should be handled diplomatically . The United States , therefore , asked Germany to reconsider the matter in the light of these considerations . The German note , it is understood . fails to meet this contention , and will call for a rejoinder . In this rejoinder it is probable that allusion will be made to the case of the American steamer Leelanaw , recently sunk with a cargo of flax. which was declared by the Germans . to he contraband . The owners of the Leelanaw , it is learned , have not presented any claim for damages . The Leelanaw case is regarded by the State Department as being similar to that of the Frye , and the owners of the Leelanaw are regarded as being entitled to day/mg-es. not nntila claim nag been made , no representations can be sent to Germany ' .                  @ @ @
