txt A sweeping advance was made yesterday in burglar insurance rates upon risks in this city and the surrounding territory . The new rates win go into effect to-day and they were decided upon after an all day session of the Burglary Insurance Underwriters ' Association . It was a meeting at which argument at times grew warm and at which Commissioner Waldo would have heard but little to commend to him the vigilance of the Police Department under his command . Those who met were the representatives here of twenty-one of the largest burglary insurance companies in the country . It was felt by those present that the crime conditions in New York had reached a pass where other parts of the country were being called upon to stand the loss occasioned by the increased burglar activity here and that the quicker the remedy was applied the better it would be . Under the head , " Open Policy , " the rate upon private dwellings and apartments where there is hallboy or elevator service is raised from $12.50 to $15 for $1,000 insurance . The rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from $10 to $12 . For $2,000 for burglary and theft , the increase is from $22 50 to $25 , and for burglary alone from $18 to $20 ; $3,000 , from $30 to $32.50 and for burglary alone from $24 to $26 ; $4,000 , from $35 to $37.50 and for burg ' lary alone $28 to $30 ; $5,000 , from $40 to $42.50 and for burglary alone $32 to $34 . For each additional $1,000 , $5 is charged for insurance against *burglary and theft and $4 for burglary alone . Upon flats without hallboys or elevator service the rate for $1,000 insurance from both burglary and theft has gone up from $15 to $18 , and for burglary alone from $12 to $15 ; $2,000 , from $25 to $28 , and for burglary alone , $20 to $23 ; $3,000 , froni $32.50 to $35.50 , and for burglary alone , $2il to $11 ; $4,000 , from $37.50 to $40 50 , and for burglary alone , $30 to $33 ; $5,000 , from $42.50 to $43.50 , and for burglary alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $4 , respectively , is charged . On non-housekeeping apartments the rate has gone up about 25 per cent . For instance , the rate on $1,000 for burglary and theft has gone up from $18.17 to $22.50 , and the rate for other amounts has gone up in proportion . The rate upon apartments where there are hallboys and elevator service is higher than for apartments where there is neither , and this is because experience has taught the underwriters that the risk is always greater where there are greater opportunities to steal . The increase in rate embraces not only New York City , but Long Island and Rockland and Westchester Counties , the towns of Greenwich , New Canaan , Stamford , Darien , Norwalk , and South Norwalk , Conn. , and Bergen , Passaic , Morris , Somerset , Middlesex , Monmouth , Essex , Union , and Hudson Counties , New Jersey . These are all included in the territory affected by the new rates , which will go into effect today . As one of those present at the meeting expressed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By this he meant that the territory is one that can be covered conveniently by automobile , train , or motor boat by the enterprising cracksmen who make their headquarters in this city . In computing the increase in rates the underwriters were guided by a knowledge of conditions here that is not to be obtained by police figures as usually made public . They prepared their own figures , based entirely upon the losses sustained . The action of the underwriters has brought New York 's burglary insurance rates up to those of Chicago , where they are the highest in the country . One of the delegates at the conference explained that burglaries have become so frequent about New York that without an increase in rates here the losses would not only eat up the premiums paid within the territory but a great part of the profits obtained elsewhere . In other words , he said , more orderly communities were paying for the burElzaorniees **28;1058;TOOLONG within the The rise in rates has been contemplated for some time , but there has been some hesitation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police were spurred into activity . There has been no increase in such activities , it was said , and so , notwithstanding the coming of a new city administration . It was decided that the raise must be made at once . This action follows a raise of nearly 50 per cent , on mercantile risks . These were made about a year ago and were necessitated , It was said , by the increase in loft robberies and thefts of all descriptions . The raise on mercantile risks was denied at the time by Commissioner Waldo , but it was subsequently proved by the Aldermanic Investigating Committee .
