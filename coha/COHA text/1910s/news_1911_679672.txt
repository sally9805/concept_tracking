txt From the Graham &; Morton dock , at the foot of Wabash avenue , three men walked into the Chicago river yesterday morning . Four policemen wearily fished thorn out and left them to dry'on the wharf . These three men are daily associates of the following distinguished persons : A brother of President Harrison 's law partner . A son of a millionaire brewer . A brother of a stock exchange operator . A brother of a Chicago police official . Some day one of these four men may decide to take a promenade in the water and perhaps the police will get him out , and perhaps they wo n't . , For the four distinguised persons , as well as the three undistinguished ones , are only " wharf , rats , " and their deaths would probably trouble the city as little as their near-deaths troubled the officers who rescued the throe yesterday morning . There Is a story called " The Port of Missing Men . " 0 . Burke , dock superintendent for Graham &; Morton , thinks he knows where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight llrfany of these , according to Mr. Burke , are laboring now along the docks of the Chicago river , unloading boats for 25 cents an hour , and , like the three who nearly drowned yesterday , occasionally ' dropping , or nearly dropping , out of all existence . Some Notable " Wharf Rats . " Too years ago the Chicago police official 's brother first drifted down to the docks . It was another year before his fellow workers discovered that Tr had relatives in Chicago . In the winter the official 's brother disappeared : It Is said that his brother pays his way out of town . During the summer ho can stay drunk with the assurance that he will not be arrested . Yet it ' was not drink alone that put him on the dock , It was his wife , Mr. Burke says . The brother of the stook exchange man has been on the dock , for ' three years . His brother long ago gave him up , but his slater , the wife of a wealthy real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionaire brewer , is a German , Superintendent Burke identities him . by a long scar on the right side of his jaw . He got It long ago in a German university . Dvery month he receives ' a remittance of $160 . It lasts him a ' night . The man whose brother was a. law partner of Benjamin Harrison seldom labors . He says his name is Farley . He speaks three languages , reads Latin , and can discuss literature and must &; Then there are others  --  disbarred lawkers ? doctors , who have fallen victim to their own drugs , wrecked men of twenty different professions . There is a checker player who once earned large sums for his exhibition , poets , musicians , and murderers , ' Need Men in a Hurry . One of the three was named Johnson , another " Beefsteak , " another " Scratches . " Perhaps they have other names , but they did not tell them . When Mr. Burke makes out their pay checks he calls them , for the sake of convenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsq which happens to strike his mind . It is unimportant , because the pay checks are never for more than 50 or 15 , cents and are soon cashed in the nearest saloon . This casual attitude is the thing which draws the men to the docks . At S o'clock every morning a Graham &; Morton steamer comes in loaded with fruit . The fruit must be moved into warehouses quickly . Two or three hours ' of working time is as much as can be spared . Two hundred men are necessary . The 200 men are always there . They begin drifting down to the dock at nightfall , and 1 ? Y midnight they are spread along its length , sleeping the untroubled sleep of the Irresponsible . When the boat comes in they awake and , forming In long lines , transport the cargo , in the manner of a bucket brigade , to the warehouse . . Whentheboat is uploaded they are ' on , the$ spot ? If they have worked two hours  --  they have 50 cents . Fifty cents , says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days . Then he Comm come back and nktAce another fifty ' .. Disappear , Then . Come Book . Oecasienally one of the workers disappears . After a week or two his fellow workers notice that he is gone . They make no inquiries . Perhaps he has fallen into the river . perhaps he has taken a freight train to . other countries , perhaps . he has quietly resumed his place . In a former life . The subject is Of small interest to the other men . On the deck origin and disposal are alike without significance . That a man is of good family is of Importance only in so far as the family sends him remittances . Under such circumstances he has had a " fall , " May be cultivated as a prolific source of drinks .. There is one man who disappears for a week every two months . He returns rehabilitated with money in his pocket . He has been home . His brother is a millionaire broker . The man says his name is Smith . There are many brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with joy and makes no inquiry as to the initials of the wealthy brother . In fact , if they were asked , the men probably would hazard a guess that the broker 's name was not Smith at all . ? Burke Tolls of Experiences . " I 've seen a good . many men named Smith , " he said . " I should say that about half of the dock laborers use it . They do n't want to be remembered , and the very frequency of the name works to their purpose . A man named Smith may be the son of a millionaire or a hod carrier  --  while he is on the docks he 's only Smith . " They walk into the , river every night . Usually they 're too drunk to know where they 're going  --  sometimes they do know . When I first started to work here I turned my hair ' gray fishing them out of the water -- now I leavelt to the police . Sometimes they drown , but so long as they do n't leave any apparent vacancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's only two things that drive them here  --  drink and women . In about DO per cent of the cases it 's women . Women first , then the booze , then the docks . You 'd he surprised at the education and culture that are aired on these piles every day . " Occasionally the " rats " ' become too thick and the police make a wholesale raid . Last , week eighty-eight men were taken from the Wabash avenue docks to the Harrison street station . Most of them are out again now , have h they changed their leafing places . brit In the winter , Mr. Burke says , they live on odd jobs and general labor . Everyone knows their activity in ward politics at election time , they notoriously belong body and and soul to Unity Dink Henna , It Is an eventless life and an inconspicuous one .
