txt SALOONS ON SUNDAY . Bill to Close Them During Church Hours Criticised as Irreligious . In discussing the Duhamel bill , Which proposes to close the Saloons of New York City " during church hours on Sunday , " it does not seem to have occurred to you . and your correspondent . Francis Grey , that this proposed legislation is so plainly religious that it has no place among civil laws . Why should the saloons be closed during " the hours of public worship " and allowed to be open the remaining portion of the day ? Is not such legislation directly in the interest of the church , and only indirectly and very remotely in the interests of temperance , and ' is the church willing to legalize - the sale of liquor the remainder of the day , provided saloons shall be closed " during the hours of church services " ? This bill establishes a dangerous precedent , and opens the way for an indefinite amount of legislation to protect Sunday and the churches . It will be much better for all concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere . W. W. PIFESCOTT , Secretary Religious Liberty Association .
