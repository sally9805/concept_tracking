txt The appearance of Secretary Daniels before the House Naval Committee was concluded today with the most significant and startling passage in the present deliberations of the committee . It was disclosed . in consequence of questions put to Capt . Winterhalter , Aid for Material in the Navy Department . who is ex-offido a member of the General Board , that the United States Navy has no battleship afloat which has modern protection from torpedo attack from submarines below the water line armor belt . This statement caused a commotion among members of the committee , and there were protests from ' Chairman Padgett and others against prosecuting the inquiry further . " I object , " said Representative Hobson , " to making public this information . We do not want to let the world know what ships or how many have or have not protection against torpedo attack . " ( rapt Winterhalter , although not giving a direct answer when asked by Representative Roberts how many of our dreadnoughts had protection against submarine torpedoes . indicated that there were no ships afloat in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it was determined that the submarine torpedo was the greatest clanger to the modern battleship steps had been taken to meet that danger . The Russian-Japanese war , he said , had not made it clear that submarines could be so formidable and it was not until the present war had demonstrated the power of the submarine that its full effidency was known . Several years ago , however , work had been begun to protect the hulls of our battleships . Objection was made to telling what ships had this protection . Capt . Winterhalter said that the special form of protection was " armor inside of the hull ? armored compartments : * He said that it would not matter if the outer 51:1D of the ship were penetrated ; the inner armor would save the ship . Pressed for some idea as to how many dreadnoughts bad this inside armor protection . the witness limited it to ships of the Mississippi , Idaho , and Pennsylvania class . German Ships Extra-Armored . This seemed to give the members of the committee a distinct shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named  --  the Pennsylvania , Arizona , California , Mississippi , and Idaho . All are now under construction . On Dec. 10. when a. report on naval construction was made . the Pennsylvania was 611.7 per cent . finished ; the Arizona . 43.6 ; the Mississippi . 2 per cent. , while the Idaho and the California had not been begun . This was startling information to a committee that had been told last week that the Unit-al States Navy- ' - was ship for ship the equal of the German Navy . " It was known to members of the committee that there were twenty dreadnoughts in the German Navy with double bottoms . with strong armor protection from torpedo attack , and five dreadnoughts with triple bottoms . The double bottoms were built after thorough tests with torpedoes , and were designed to withstand the explosion of 200 pounds of guncotton or picric acid . The triple hulls were the result of still further tests , and were made to withstand the detonation of : 100 pounds of guncotton or a like amount of picrate of ammonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as the strongest now in use . There was a strong disposition to go forward with the examination . but Chairman Padgett teremptorily declared that the line of inquiry was not a proper one , and that the examination must come to a- end at once . Manned Corregidor Guns . When Capt . Winterhalter said he was unable to see certain international dangers ahead pictured by Mr. Hobson the Congressman told the committee of a " scare " last year that put the American garrison in the Philippines in a state of siege . " In May and for some months of last year , MR , " said Mr. Hobson. " our gunners at Corregidor Island stood at their guns night and day with plans for a two years ' siege . The harbors were mined . Troops from all over the islands were brought into Corregidor , and everything prepared for a siege . except that there was no transfer of the Government from Manila . It did not take any vision to see that . " Mr. Hobson did not go into details as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not inclined to discuss the subject . Secreta : -y Daniels urged the establishment of a Government factory for projectiles either at Philadelphia cr Indian Head . Md He said that the ships in reserve wei e not supplied with shells . but that every dreadnought and the rest of the battleships were so supplied . They did not have the necessary number of aheils in reserve , he said , but that would he taken care of as soon as practicable . To provide projectiles , he suggested that the committee ask for an appropriation of $500.000 for a shell factory . The private manufacturers charge an they can for projectiles , and the quest tion of cost does not enter.into the matter , according to the Secretary 's views . An English firm had offered the use of its process for a royalty of $10,000 , and the department had taken an option on the process . The torpedo factory at Newport gave assurance , he thought . that the Government could make shells to advantage . The factory was making torpedoes at very much below the prices bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low bids for destroyers , Mr. Daniels recommended that the committee authorize more than the six destroyers asked for in this year 's programme . Taking up the matter of administration of the navy yards , the Secretary told the committee that he had decided on a policy which called for industrial managers at all the yards . These managers he desired to have independent of the military command of the yard . A general discussion followed as to the advisability of placing competent civilian managers at the head of the navy shops , and , if necessary , to pay such managers the large salaries that private concerns pay their managers . The Secretary said that this would not be necessary , as navy or/leers as competent as these civilians were devoted to the service and had no wish to leave the Government and go into private employ . Capt . Winterhalter gave the committee an idea of the high-power , sea-going submarine that was now desired . This vessel is called the fleet submarine and the aim is to have a vessel that can make 20 knots an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out with the lira line of dreadnoughts in case of a fight at sea , and would be employed with a battleship as base . Capt . Winterhalter said that he hoped to know tomorrow , when bids would be opened for submarines of this type , whether there was any company able to give a guarantee that it had developed an engine capable of making the speed required and keeping such large boats as were now being planned with the fleet on a cruise . in response to questions be gave a very spirited reply to the optimistic views of the General Board and declared that no safe and sane man could take the position that any guarantee had been given that there was an engine that could do the work required . Thus far there had been only a hope that it could be done , and no one , he said , had the right to call expectations assurances . He said the K boats had fallen down on their trials , and they were the beat type that had thus far been devised . To say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a guarantee was , he thought , wide of the mark . I do n't know what the General Board bases its statements on , " said Capt . Winterhalter . " I had a letter only recently from W. Spear . President of the Electric Boat Company , saying he ' hoped ' their engine would meet the requirements . Hope is not assurance . " Preparedness for War . Representative Lee referred to Representative Gardner 's efforts to discover if the United States was " totally unprepared for war . " " I do n't profess to know , " replied Capt . Winterhalter . " That is a very devastating statement " " But is it true ? " demanded Mr. Witherspoon . Well , I was not born with illusions , " responded Capt . Winterhalter . " In the navy we are not all the time seeing things , and we do not get scared at many things that seem so terrible to others . I do not know whether the American people take the view that we are unprepared or not . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say they should have what they want " Representative Hobson wanted to know if he thought that , with all our exposed coast , the Philippines . Hawaii . Panama , Cuba , Porto Rico . the Monroe Doctrine and the open door in China to protect , we ought to stand third or fourth in naval strength . " With all that , " he asked , " is it wise to allow any military power to control the seas ? " Capt . Winterhalter took his stand on the navy as at present constituted ; declaring that it was equal to the work demanded of it . Alaska Coal a Naval Success . Secretary Daniels said tests completed ten days ago on coal from the Matanuska fields in Alaska had proved practically perfect . This information was sprung as a surprise by the Secretary , who was elated particularly because of plans going forward for the Alaska railway to open up the coat fields . It Was the more gratifying , he said , in view of the fact that last year teats indicated that Bering River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official report of the tests . " said the Secretary , " states that the firemen pronounced the forced draught trial the easiest twenty knot run the armored cruiser Maryland had ever made . On the other trials also there was absence of those difficulties usually met when poor coal is used . The firing was easy and steam pressure was easily maintained . The coal is said to have burned like pine knots . These testa point the way to an adequate supply of coal on the Pacific Coast for the navy as soon as reasonable transportation facilities are available . " The Matanuska coal , he said , was as good as any to be found anywhere . These recommendations were made by Secretary Daniels : Appointment of all Second Lieutenants in the navy hereafter as " Acting Second Lieutenants , " so that those who do not measure up to requirements after appointment may be dropped . Graduated system retired pay of naval officers on the basis of their length of naval service and the extent of their disabilities . Authority for using part of a $40. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its property on its oil land reserves . Declaring that the navy had too many officers ashore , the Secretary said " should abolish the office of Captain of every yard . Every office we can spare should be abolished . "
