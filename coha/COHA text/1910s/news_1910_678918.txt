txt We are exporting gold and importing diamonds on a large scale . Before the operation is over we are likely to lose more gold than we import of gems . It would be an unequal exchange even if the values involved were nominally equal , but they have a relation closer than the . exchange of one for the other . We are taking diamonds because we place a fictitious value upon them , making them worth more here than in any other country . And we are losing gold because we artificially undervalue it , providing a substitute . Other nations value gold as the basis of banking credit , and they are able to draw it from us because we have partially deprived it of value for that use . Our lawmakers think ft to our advantage to make a market for our bonds by requiring them to be used as the basis of banknotes , and accordingly we are at a disadvantage with other nations who place a higher value upon gold for what some consider the most civilized of uses . England frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becatilse we prefer to put the premium on Government bonds and banknotes . Consequently our gold circulation last month decreased $14,000,000 and our National banknote circulation increased $16,000,000 . Why should we regret this ? England has to bid up for the gold she wants , and it is coming high to her . We know a trick worth two of that . We are building the Panama Canal at a cost of several hundred millions of dollars , and until that is finished we can never run short of money . The more it costs to build the canal the more bonds we must issue , with the incidental advantage that we shall provide ourselves with the capacity of enlarging our money supply in proportion to the cost of the canal . Is it not obvious that the more the canal costs the better off we shall be in money supply ? The Secretary of the Treasury is especially urgent that we shall not deprive ourselves of this boon , which is more beneficent and more appreciated as we lose gold . Cheap Aods are an abhorrence in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be in excessive supply . The larger the National debt the larger the supply of banknotes and the greater the supply of cheap money . Why regret losing gold for which others are willing to bid a premium when we can supply the loss of it by making the Panama Canal expensive and issuing bonds accordingly ? There should not be the least jealousy of foreigners placing a pitiful premium on gold . We prefer to place a premium on bonds , and our 2 per cents are now at a premium of say 20 per cent. , selling above par instead of at the discount on consols or . rentes . When our Secretary of the Treasury is confronted with the alternative of seeing our National bonds sell down to the yield of the money market , or of seeing the sustaining power which saves them from a discount like that upon other National securities extended to some hundreds of millions of more bonds , he does not hesitate . And he is not alone in his benevolence in " making a price for our bonds , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme is supported by the most august authority upon the ground that it would make a market for our 2 per cents and relieve the National banks of them at the expense of the depositors in the Goverment savings bank . The National banks , being relieved of the hundreds of millions of 2 per cents which they hold at a loss of some score or more millions of premiums , would have their books cleared to replace- them with other millions to be expended on the Panama Canal , of course with an adjustment of the circulation tax . This may seem a trifle artificial and involved to those who are taking away our gold at a premium . Our bond premium is much larger than the foreign premium on gold . There are points of view from which a premium looks like a discount , but those who do not like that.point of view do not have to take it . We would call the attention of our foreign friends to the fact that we make a viri ue of necessity , and look pleasant when we part with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . When we take their gold they send it to us with a lecture as to what use we shall make of it . We just send it along with no lectures upon the use we hope they will make of it . We say nothing about our moral disapproval of the British rubber gamble , nor make any objections to the fact that England and France have agreed that this is the best market in which to seek gold , and that Paris Trzefers that New York should finance London . Hence the Bank of France =spends shipments to London . Whatever we may fittrat , tine suppress em thoughts about the sheeking state of disorder to which 13ritish partisanship has allowed noliticiatia to reduce the national finances . We reserve for ourown consideration the consoling thought that if our friends take gold enough , cotton and foodstuffs are likely to be cheapened enough to be sent to them instead of gold , or perhaps even to be eaten and worn by ourselves .                @ @ @ @ @
