It IS always interesting to know what our passing guests think of us . Undoubtedly Americans have made t of reading with keen interest a point of ? if only for the sake of disputing them ? the observations which M. Paul Bourget published in Outre-Mer a his return from the United States . 1. mong the distinguished Americans whom France has had the honor of receiving within the past few years , two have formulated their opinions , one in poetic form , the other in a book of travel . Both were particularly well qualified as observers : having come in an official capacity to lecture at the Siirdnne , they had spent considerable time in France , and had penetrated ' within the French society so charmed to welcome them . They were Dr. Henry van Dyke and Professor Barrett Wendell . Dr. van Dyke , professor at Princeton University and minister at The Hague , turned poet once more on the boat which took him back to his native lad . He paid homage to old Europe , thanking her for her hospitality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charms , and her artistic treasures ; but at the same time his tone was critical , if the air which he breathed there had been a lit tle close ; France seemed in him too much attached to the past , too dependent upon it . According to his notion , life demands that one look ahead , not behind . And he added , with glowing eloquence , ' The glory of the present is to make the future free , ' ? a bold formula which contradicts absolutely the famous declaration of Auguste Comte , ' Humanity is composed more of the dead than of the living , ' and which slurs at one and the same time historical tradition , racial continuity , and the interdependence of the generations of man . Professor Barrett Wendell , less lyrical , spent his sojourn in France in listening , watching , studying ; and , after having stored up facts and faces and conversations , and having mentally photographed the life of the time , he gave us the result of his observations in a pleasantly readable book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him most in this France of to-day , whose general characteristics he describes , is the firm foundation of the family . He confides to us his surprise , his amazement even , when he saw what united and permanent little societies the families are ; he expresses his gratitude for the courtesy with which they welcomed him as a friend , and sets clown the reflections , the comparisons , even the social lessons which he deduced from them . The Englishman and the American , he says , have their home , of course ; but the Frenchman has his foyer , which strangers do not know as they should . It is the chimney , the hearthstone , ? the core of domestic life , where the family gathers , complete in itself , distinct from any other group in this confused and hustling world , at one with 174 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL each other , free for a while from all the , rest of humanity . ' The foyer is the symbol of all the vigorous , profound , complex power of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual and national emotions . Putting together little significant facts , Professor Wendell shows that in France the family spirit is the most spontaneous of all instincts . Elsewhere the strongest tie is the bond between husband and wife ; here it is that which unites parents and children . This assured fact gives him the key to many social customs for which he used to have no explanation . The insistence upon the dot , for instance , no longer implies to him a vulgar and despicable selfishness , but rather an affectionate prudence which makes careful provision for the new home to be established . The French marriage , which used to strike him as an exceedingly complicated affair , with its rites , its ceremonies , its authorizations , he looks at no longer as a purely individual question , but as one which affects the entire family . For the same reason , a man 's choice of career is a matter of concern to the family , since its effect will be either to consolidate or to weaken the family . The domestic duties ? those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position in the household ? are considered to be at least as important as the duties of husband and wife . An inheritance is guaranteed to the children . All these facts are the mark of an advanced civilization which has bowed to natural exigencies and has laid emphasis on the family rather than on the individual . And to cap this chapter upon the French family , Professor Wendell concludes : ' In brief , as one grows familiar with the French , one realizes with growing amazement how their whole conception of the family , with all the con secrated emotional sanction of the fey. er , makes them look upon themselves primarily , not as individuals , but rather as members each of his own little society . The family is a partnership , if you will , ? a corporation , or a clan . It is something more than the sum of the individuals whom it comprises in all their human and fallible complexity ; it has a dominant , supreme claim to de . votion for its own sake . The human beings who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may compose a nation , must pass into oblivion ; but the family itself can outlive them perenni. ally . The first of human duties thus becomes not individual but rather 84 abnegating and social . To this ideal of duty the French are deeply loyal . If they had not followed it throughout the generations with eager , unselfish , persistent fidelity , their society could not exist in the form which it has inherited from their past and is transmitting to their future . ' In the last analysis , Professor Wendell , like Dr. van Dyke , emphasizes the force of the past in the construction of French society . But instead of denouncing it in the name of liberty , Professor Wendell justly recognizes it as the fruit of the experience of the ages , ? experience which has tried various forms of society and has retained but one , as that at once most likely to endure and best qualified for the development of the nation . Nevertheless , neither of the two distinguished travelers has seen ? or could see during his attentive and judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inspiration from the Revolution , have manifested themselves during the past thirty years in this compact French family . Both gentlemen spent most of their time in middle-class circles in which respect for family life has been longer maintained ; whereas , among the rich hour- // geoisie and laboring classes , it has already vastly diminished . The truth is that , since the Revolution , a veritable battle has been going on in France between the old form of society , wherein the family occupied the foreground , and the new , where the individual claims precedence . This battle is what I want my American readers to understand . By its results they shall judge of the importance of its cause , and perhaps these results will invite them to sonic personal reflections , II speaking of marriage , M. Demolombe , the well-known jurist , has said : ' This contract , the most ancient and t universal of all , was not invented by human legislators . Its origin goes back to God himself .. . . Among all peoples , marriage has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Marriage is not created by law , like other contracts . The law , finding it already in existence , recognizes it , establishes it , strengthens it . In all the ancient forms of society , this sacred origin of marriage was so clearly understood that it was placed under the protection of religion . Such was its position in the social systems of Egypt , Greece , and Rome , as Fustel de Coulanges shows in his admirable Cit ? antique . Christianity , which in its turn inherited the institution of marriage , made it a sacrament , so as to put upon it clearly the stamp of religion ; this sacrament the husband and wife administered to each other as they exchanged their eternal promises in the presence of the priest , God 's witness and representative . Its sacramental character made it clearly indissoluble . Its aim was not the happiness of the contracting parties , but the creation of a new family from which the union of heart and of flesh , of will and of deed , would allow no turning back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy , with its responsible chief and its obligations . Somebody had to be the leader of the group ; this direction was entrusted to the husband and father . His marital and paternal power arose to complete the order established by the marriage . This order established in the family was about to have its effect on the early national life of France . In the dark ages , when the barbarian tempest swept down from the north and the Saracens came from the south , the family was the only institution already organized and prepared to come to the rescue . To save themselves from extermination , these little societies ? the families ? sought out one another and united together . The first combination , the mdsnie , was merely the family enlarged . The mdsnie became the fief . And from the authority exercised by the father of the family , grew , like a flower blossoming upon its stem , the white lily of royal authority . ' The king , ' said Hugues de Fleuri in the eleventh century , ' represents in the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sixteenth century , when the legists wished to define the State , the jurisconsult , Jean Bodin , contented himself with this comparison : ' All the households taken together form what we call the people . It is only by the succession of families that the people is rendered immortal . . . . The republic can not possibly stand fast if the families which are its pillars have weak foundations . ' The family is thus considered as the foundation of society and the symbol of government itself . And this is not merely a theory for philosophers to wag their heads over , but a fact proved by experience in the course of those many perilous and glorious centuries through- 176 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL out which the might of France was revealed . How did the economic development of the family come about ? The family settled permanently in one place , taking root there through inheritance . Its wealth consisted only of real estate . The land conquered by the labor of one generation was transmitted to the next , the father appointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces and their customs : sometimes the eldest son was chosen , this being the prevailing plan ; sometimes the head of the family was allowed to select his heir from among his sons ; sometimes , as in the Basque province , even the eldest daughter was made heir . In certain districts the written law allowed a partition of the estate , but then the brothers and sisters agreed to keep it intact . Thus the property was handed down with the name , and became the visible image of the family 's continuity , sometimes even to the point of becoming confused with it . A whole series of circumstances , economic and social , were favorable to this condition of things : custom , law , the peace and quiet of life on the farms , and the difficulty of communication . The right of inheritance brought with it heavy burdens , too . It implied the subordination of the individual 's life to the existence and continuance of the family ; and it imposed upon the heir the maintenance of the parents , of the unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the continuation of the works of mercy and charity ( for a congeries of duties clusters about every family of any importance ) ; and the administration of the property , ? not merely to enjoy it , but , at the very least , to maintain it , and , if possible , to increase it . Under this system , the brothers who were , so to speak , disinherited , had the advantage of liberty and could embark upon any careers they pleased ? in the army , the navy , the colonies , or what not L. with the certainty of being succored in case of need . The family of ancient France has . left the written evidence of its vitalit ; in the livres de raison . These livres de raison were originally simple account books wherein were enumerated the details of the division of the property . Little by little , the habit grew of writing in them the dates which were of importance to the family , ? dates of marriages , of births , of deaths . Later these dates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these commentaries alone , it has been possible to reconstruct the past existence of the family . Moreover , we find in them evidence of a double creed , ? which perhaps can be considered as but a sin . gle one , ? faith in God and faith in life , The fathers , bowed down though they be with burdens , invariably hail with joy the arrival of a new-born child , even if they already have nine or ten or more . A birth is always regarded as a blessing . They thank God , who will know how to help them feed this full nest of children . They exert every energy for the future of the house and of their race , for its name and honor . There are shadows in this picture of the French family . Indeed , the history of nations , as of individuals , offers very few examples of powers whirls , if put to the test , have not been abused . The husband and father , with the double authority , marital and paternal , has not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the wife and children were reduced to slavery , and where their most legitimate aspirations were throttled . Although the family is not composed of a series of individual happinesses , still it can not , without danger to itself , rob its members of those rights which the human conscience holds most sacred ; and the right to the pursuit of happiness is one of these . Compulsory vocations and forced marriages are the result of a wrong attitude toward the individual . The church came to the rescue of the victims . Not that she ranged herself against the family ? she was herself a hierarchy standing for authority . But she condemned the encroachments which destroyed human liberty in its intangible foundations . The family retained this established form practically without change until the Revolution . Retif de la Bretonne , in his Life of my Father , draws a picture of it which would have been as true in the eleventh or twelfth century as it was in the eighteenth . He calls his father his visible God , ' and no one could underline more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paternal power . This dieu visible himself obeys a preceding god ( his own father ) . And Ii tif 's narrative takes us to the wedding of his father , who was coerced by hi , Y father into a marriage repugnant to every natural inclination of his heart . For these founders of dynasties , these responsible leaders , love does not count or individual happiness , ? nothing counts but their race . This is where they make their mistake ; for intimate happiness and legitimate affection play their part in sustaining the family . And to reduce marriage to a mere social form , and do without the consent of the contracting parties , is to alter its character . In those days , children did not oppose their father 's commands ; hence Edme obeyed , and married a good housewife instead of the woman of his choice . At the end of his life , we see him like a patriarch , surrounded by his fourteen children and all the servants of his household ; after they hare taken supper together , he reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . It takes VOL. no-NO. 2 one back to Biblical times , except that this family , instead of being nomadic , is bound to the soil . III The Revolution did not come like a bolt from the blue , but like a bolt from a sky gradually overcast by clouds . The first cloud on the family horizon was caused by the Reformation , which opened the door of the home to individualism . Wiping out the eternal promises , it substituted the possibility of divorce for the principle of indissoluble union . Here was the first alteration of marriage . Until the Reformation there was no doubt of its permanence ; now there came a new doctrine , which struck at marriage in its essential principle as a definitive engagement entered into in the presence of God . It is true that after a stubborn struggle , the Reformation was rejected in France and Catholicism triumphed . But the very foundations of the family had become a subject of argument ; and the idea of impermanence was destined to gain ground . It gained ground throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more general doctrine , that of the rights of the individual . According to the theories of Jean-Jacques Rousseau , the individual was to be unshackled . Then how could he bear the burdens of the family , which were the oldest and heaviest burdens ? He was to be born with rights , not with duties . He was to be dependent on neither his father nor his mother ; the State was there to receive him . It was to the State that the famous theorist assigned the paternal power . As for marriage , how could two persons pledge themselves for the future when they were not sure of their own hearts ? Feelings may change ; liberty alone does not change . Meanwhile , Voltaire and the Encyclopmdists placed the so- 178 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL cial problems on a secular basis , claiming to set them apart from all thought of religion . Economic conditions and customs were beginning to accelerate the march of ideas . The family lived on its estate and set the neighborhood the example of its character and its continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more it provoked imitation . But now , in the seventeenth century , the great landed families began their exodus to present their petitions at Versailles . As the lords of the soil became courtiers , their local influence diminished . The close bond between the family and the soil was broken . Another blow was dealt at the hitherto sacred rights of the family , on the day when Louis XIV compelled Parliament to legitimize his bastards . Lastly , from the time of the Regency , high society made fashionable the estrangement of husband and wife . ' For heaven 's sake , leave me alone ! ' said a wife to her husband , when he asked her to descend to the familiar thee and thou . Another , who claimed a separation because her husband had given her a box on the ear , en fete-a-tete , and who was not able to obtain her divorce , went back to the brute in his study , and slapping him in turn , exclaimed by way of explanation , ' There , monsieur ! there ' s your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use to me ! ' What had become of the respect for the head of the family ? Marriage was no longer a constraining force ; it was nothing but a worldly association of selfishness and caprice . Thus the anarchy of manners played its part in spreading an anarchy of ideas . Economic conditions , freedom of manners , and new ideas coming in this order ? paved the way , then , for the Revolution , which is to be consid- ered here only as it altered the consti , tution of the family . Neither these new ideas , nor these manners , nor these economic conditions touched the majority of the French people , those vast masses which are the reservoir of the national strength and life . This is the reason why the Revolution , in making family institutions over from top to bottom , did not really reach beyond the cities . The country districts escaped it ; and after the storm was over , life began again , hardly different from the life of former days . The overthrow of the family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples of Jean-Jacques and of the Encyclopmdists , who were persuaded that they were unshackling the individual . This overthrow did not produce its complete results until many years later . Hitherto , marriage , since it was a sacrament , had been bound up with religion . That bond was snapped by the Revolution . The law of September 20 , 1792 , made of marriage a purely civil contract , which the institution of divorce terminated . This law established three kinds of divorce : divorce by mutual consent , divorce pronounced at the demand of one of the conjoined , ? merely on account of incompatibility of temper or of character , ? and divorce for fixed causes . The effects made themselves felt immediately , but only in Paris and in some large cities . , In the first three months of 1794 , the number of divorces in Paris matched the number of marriages . The pro ? mation equalizing the rights in inheritance of the legitimate child and the natural child , and the suppression of marital authority and paternal power , completed this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year IX , ' said the tribune , Carion-Nisas , a short time afterwards , there were about four thousand marriages and seven // hundred divorces ; in the year X , there were only about three thousand marriages , but nine hundred divorces . Both the decrease in marriages and the increase in divorces are terrifying ; and they prove that divorce , far from being a remedy , is but one evil the more , and that instead of calling citizens to marriage , as has been pretended , it causes them to detest and shun it . People thought to facilitate marriage by ridding it of its indissolubility , imagining that they were strengthening it ; and they destroyed it . ' IV The authors of the Civil Code did not entirely forget this experience . In the preliminary discussion , indeed , one finds this earliest opinion of the First Consul upon divorce : ' What shall we say of a family broken up by divorce ? What sort of husbands and wives are those who , after having been bound together by the closest ties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once strangers to one another , without being able to forget one another ? What sort of children are those who have no longer a father , who can no longer mingle in the same embrace the disunited authors of their days ; who , in duty bound to cherish and respect them equally , are , so to say , forced to take sides against them ; who dare not recall in their presence the deplorable marriage of which they are the fruit ? Oh , take care how you encourage divorce ! It would be a great misfortune if it became customary with us ! ' He himself belonged to a closely united , elanlike family , and he remembered it . And if , as general and head of the State , in his rugged campaigns and his rapid reorganization of a broken-down social system , he had found about him as many people as he needed who were ready and fitted to help him , he could not have attributed that abundance of power and talent , sprung from the land , to anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vigor , if not from the constitution of the family , which had stood by the kingdom in all its vicissitudes throughout the centuries ? One might have feared lest the constraint imposed by the authority of the head of the family , and the subjection of the other members , might keep youthful energies from developing , might crush those children who had been too strictly brought up , might sap their youthful wills . But discipline revealed once more that it is an incomparable school for developing the sort of character which gives itself to a cause even to the limit of self-sacrifice . The Civil Code , then , was a compromise between the ancient constitution of the family and revolutionary authority . In appearance , it sustained the traditional family founded upon marriage , the marital power , the paternal power , ' and inheritance . But it altered those essential principles . From the very first , it secularized marriage , which ceased to be a religious act and became a civil contract . The husband and wife might appear before a priest , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And inasmuch as religion immediately regained its popularity after the Concordat , and couples preferred to be married in church rather than in the town hall , a law was enacted that forbade the celebration of the religious ceremony before the civil marriage . Ancient custom gave way to this law ; but the practice survived of introducing all the ceremonial into the religious marriage and of treating the civil marriage as it itself insisted upon being treated ? that is to say , as at 1 Louis Delzons , La Fanzine frangaise et son Evolution . 180 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL contract which needed neither dress , nor flowers , nor music , nor solemnity , nor emotion , nor holy witness , ? a contract , moreover , which had no fixed duration , and which might cancel itself like a lease . For divorce was sustained in the new laws , notwithstanding the eloquent words of the First Consul , who promptly changed his mind , ? thinking already , perhaps , of the personal use which he could some day make of it . Divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means allowed ? this form being equivalent to repudiation in Roman law ; but divorce for fixed causes , and even that by mutual consent , ? with certain limitations , ? was sustained . Some years later , the law of May 8 , 1816 , abolished divorce , it is true , no strong objections being raised . The Napoleonic wars had left many ruins to repair ; the work of restoration demanded that the constitution of the family be strong . Finally , in the Civil Code , the marital power and the paternal power were indeed sustained , but both of them changed their nature . The first belonged to the husband only by right of marriage , ceasing to be his perquisite in his capacity as head and director of the community ; the second was established in the interest of the child , ceasing to be a sort of divine right accompanying paternity . Both , in fine , became dependent on law , instead of being simply recognized-'and protected by it . This fact shows how the new spirit was making itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the succession by title , wherein the principle of equality prevailed decidedly over that of liberty . Under this dispensation parents were allowed to transmit to any single heir only an inconsiderable fragment of their patrimony . Thus the estate , broken up , pulverized , systematically submitted to division , ? which meant that it was bound sooner or later to fall into strangers ' hands , ? could no longer serve as the fame . ily 's hereditary prop . During the three quarters of a century which followed the promulgation of the Civil Code , ' justly observes Louis Delzons , in his treatise on The French Family and its Evolution , ' there were , practically speaking , no changes , ' French society continued to exist ? to use the words of Professor Barrett Wendell ? in the form which it had inherited from the past . Divorce having disappeared from the Civil Code , marriage had its full effect . The father and husband used their paternal and marital power with a moderation which - although they did not realize the fact ? was the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Altogether one might believe , judging from appearances , that family life had not been altered by the turmoil of the Revolution , and that the experiment of individualism had completely failed in France ; either because individualism was not workable , or else ? supposint , that the social life of the nation could take other forms than that form of collectivit ? familiale put to the proof by so many centuries ? because it was simply premature . There remained , to be sure , the ruinous method of succession by title . This method , as it made partition obligatory , little by little cut up the estates ; in addition , it divided the family against itself by constantly introducing questions of interest in the property , and it destroyed the symbol of the continuity , union , and permanence of the family . But this very partition of the property , in days when the land was not particularly crowded and was often badly exploited , permitted a more intensive cultivation of the soil ; so the Code // night be considered as causing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people began to see at last how dangerous this legislation was to the love of the land , to the feeling for the past , and to patriotism , its unlucky results were destined to be forgotten in the economic revolution which , caused by the application of new methods of transportation , soon began to spread throughout the country a feeling of restlessness and a desire for travel , and which finally precipitated the country upon the town . Apparently- it was still possible to believe that family life had undergone no change . But only apparently ; for the battle continued , and the campaign for individualism set in again as early as the end of the Restoration . It was directed from the first by the literature of the romantic movement , which had arcely any ideal other than to champion the rights of the individual and to deify passion . And indissoluble marriage hampered the rights of the individual , and set duty over against passion . ' ' ' ) body expressed the romanticist hatred of all social barriers better than George Sand . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , Jacques , writes to Fernande , his fiancee , on the eve of their marriage , Society is going to dictate to you the formula of an oath ; you are going to swear to be faithful to me and to submit to me , ? in other words , never to love any one but me , and to obey only use in all things . One of these vows is an absurdity ; the other is a villainy . You can not answer for your heart , even though I should be the greatest and most perfect of men ; you ought not to promise to obey me , for that would be to debase us both . ' Thus warned , George Sand 's heroine hastens to prove that the husband so well informed concerning the conduct of life is right . She takes a lover , or rather , she ' fulfills her destiny . ' Jacques , in this novel and somewhat delicate situation , remains logical ; he neither complains nor is astonished . Classic literature had depicted a morally and socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic literature had recognized that this preference was wrong , and had not sacrificed reason , or religion , or society to it . Romantic literature represented a man of defective brain as well as defective heart and senses , ? a man enslaved by his passions , who , by a new sophistry , called this servitude liberty ! But what happens to our Jacques , the indulgent and comprehending husband ? To save everybody from embarrassment , he goes on a walking-tour in the Tyrolese mountains , and falls , as if by accident , into a crevasse . Thus must a thoughtful husband prove that he has sense enough to renounce his wife in favor of her lover , since the door of marriage is closed to any escape ! There was an effort to break down this door at any cost . George Sand 's successor , Alexandre Dumas As , tried to burst it open in his plays appealing for divorce . But the conflict was not confined to literature . It extended to the political and social fields ; and one can follow the phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side were the followers of Jean-Jacques Rousseau , who continued to work for the enfranchisement of the people and of the individual , and who shook the world in the name of liberty : Victor Hugo , Michelet , Edgar Quinet . On the other side were the followers of the tradition which maintained that the forms of society are eternal and not subject to fluctuations of ideas , of sentiments , or of economic conditions ; and that without authority and the hierarchical form of the family and of religion , there can be nothing but riot 182 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL and anarchy . These men were Joseph de Maistre , Bonaid , Balzac , Le Play , ? who , after having toured the world and written a monograph about the workingmen of Europe , undertook the restoration of the family , and Auguste Comte , the founder of the philosophy of positivism . Building upon ' a rational study of facts , Comte reached this conclusion about marriage : that any society , if it would endure , must strengthen the order which Catholicism so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . The obligation to conform one 's life to an insurmountable law , ' he wrote in his Cours de Philosophic Positive , ' far from being a source of unhappiness , is one of the most indispensable conditions of life , since it steadies our wavering ideas and our half-hearted intentions . ' And explicitly condemning divorce , he added , ' One needs only to understand the chief purpose of the conjugal tie to see its necessary conditions . This fundamental union can not gain its essential end except by being both exclusive and indissoluble . These two characteristics are so indispensable to any union that even illegal liaisons tend to manifest them . We can not , without assuming an entire lack of all moral and social principles , understand how anybody can dogmatically set up inconstancy and frivolity of affection as essential guaranties of human happiness . No love can be profound if it is not undivided and perpetual ; for the mere idea of change disturbs its course . Is our short life longer than two people need ? two beings so different as man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and love each other worthily ? And yet , hearts are usually so fickle that society has to intervene in order to do away with irresolution and inconstancy , which if given free scope would tend to reduce human existence to a deplorable succession of experiments without issue and without dignity . ' Positivism , then , agreed with Catholicism that indissoluble marriage is the safeguard of individual dignity and of social life . The partisans of individualism finally triumphed . On the twenty-seventh of July , 1884 , divorce was put back into the body of French law , at the instigation of M. Naquet . True , they call . ed it a necessary evil , and they did not allow divorce by mutual consent or at the wish of one of the parties . They allowed it only for fixed causes : adultery ; the condemnation of one or the other to undergo degrading punishment ; and , finally , ill-treatment , cruelty , and serious abuse . But it began at once to produce its disintegrating effect upon the family . VI An eminent professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental rule : wherever divorce exists , it tends to increase . Statistics show us its rapid progress . In 1885 , immediately after the promulgation of the law , there were in France 4227 divorces . These are the unhappy households accepting their freedom , ' proclaimed the partisans of divorce ; ' wait and you will soon see a halt . ' But the halt has not yet made itself manifest . The number of divorces has steadily increased : 5427 in 1890 : 6750 in 1895 ; 7157 in 1900 ; 10,017 in 1905 ; nearly 13,000 in 1911 . In the first months of marriage , even when the deepest love is present , patience is often necessary . People used to be patient in the days of indissoluble marriage . To-day they will not tolerate the slightest provocation . At the least quarrel they appeal for divorce The prospect of remarriage plays too THE FAMILY AND real a part in these ruptures . Divorce , then , insinuates itself as a corrupting element in married life , and even in life before marriage . People think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impo rtance to a union which can be broken . Statistics tell us , again , that the households of not even a year 's existence are those among which divorce makes proportionately the most progress . The young people will not submit to even a year of patience and of mutual concessions before declaring their common life impossible . But a social system can not be sustained on pity for such unfortunate individuals . Marriage is the keystone of the family arch . That is why its character is of so much importance in any social system . We now find its character in France modified for the second time . The first time was in 1792 , and see have seen what were the consequences . These consequences were already comparable with the results obtained by centuries of the traditional family which had built up the power of France . Between 1816 and 1884 the country bound up its wounds and recovered its strength . One could see the national vigor in the way it endured a disaster like that of 1870 , and in the rapidity With which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 , thirty years have passed . A second test , longer and more decisive , is being added to the first . Once more the adversaries of the family are trying to drive home their victory . They incessantly demand the facilitation of divorce : they want divorce for mental derangement of one of the parties , divorce for absence , divorce for infirmities , divorce for religious disagreements . They have not yet succeeded in putting these things into the law of the land ; but in equity they have succeeded by means of a legal fiction in introducing divorce by mutual consent , // which the tribunals constantly grant . They pretend that human beings are their own masters , and that this is a principle inscribed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man . But to say that human beings are their own masters is really to say nothing at all ; or else it means the suppression of every form of agreement . There is no agreement in which future liberty is not renounced by present liberty . Every contract is an agreement which encroaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immoral ? If an agreement is immoral it certainly does not become so on account of its duration . The character of a lease remains the same whether it lasts one year or twenty years . It is the object of an agreement which may make it immoral , and make it just as immoral if it is for a year as if it is perpetual . If , then , an engagement for a season is moral , it will remain so forever . ' It is the doctrine of individualism which inspires the partisans of divorce . They consider only the happiness of the husband and wife , and substitute the pleasure-marriage for the duty-marriage . One of them , Novicow , has expressed it frankly : The sexual bond is contracted only for the direct happiness of the contracting parties . ' If the parties do not find this happiness , they separate ; or if one of them fails to find it , he leaves the other , to look for it elsewhere . Under these simple conditions , marriage is entirely set apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , as if it had nothing to do with the family , which TaMe has called the only remedy man has found for death . A state is composed of an enduring race ; that is to say , it is composed of families ; that is to say , of marriages producing children . To consider marriage without the child , and merely as the George Fonsegrive , Le Mariage et l'union litre . 14 THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL satisfaction of the desires of the husband and wife , is to take away from it all social character ; and if this is done , why should society bother with it ? Now , how many years are required to complete the child 's education ? Is a boy or girl of ten years ready to be taken from its parents ? Or even of fifteen years ? So long as the child 's education continues , it will demand their effective cooperation . After fifteen or twenty years , then , the father and mother , grown old and weary , are going to take up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work for which the husband and wife associate themselves , ' says M. Fonsegrive again , ' can not come to anything unless their union is for their whole life . So they make their vows for life . He who wishes to reach the goal must make up his mind to take the only road to that goal . Indissoluble marriage is necessary for a normal upbringing of the child ; it is the only kind of marriage which allows the child complete moral development . The law of indissolubility , far from being contrary to nature , is demanded by nature . ' That is what the positivist Comte meant when he said that without indissoluble marriage human existence amounts in most cases only to ' a deplorable succession of experiments without issue and without dignity . ' Still another objection is made : that the situation of the children is less cruel in divorce than in legal separation . This is not true . Legal separation , through its very sadness , will never be anything but an exception ; while clivorce , giving as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of becoming customary . Legal separation relaxes but does not break the family tie . Even when disunited , the father and mother can not look into the future without thinking of what it holds for their children . These child ren remain an ideal ; while in divorce , which authorizes new ties , they will never be anything but a curse . But what is the use of starting here a debate upon the philosophy of divorce ; I have shown that the motive idea of marriage has altered since the day when it lost its religious character to become a simple civil contract . The consequences of this alteration have been fatal . The divorce law is the most striking sign of the changes which , from that time on , have taken place in the French family . It is not the only sign . We must add other less important laws providing for the diminution of paternal power and for the reconciliation of legitimate and illegitimate children in the succession to property . A parallel might even be drawn he . tween some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient common law , which it considered too rigid in its affirmation of paternal and marital power and too antagonistic to the rights of the individual , ? unless one somehow twists the meaning of the word rights . Here , then , we have a whole group of phenomena which testify to a voluntary overthrow of traditions . The intention is to pass systematically from a form of society based on the family to a form of society based on the individual . The individual takes the place of the family , which is thus thrust into the background . If Professor Barrett Wendell has not seen the change , it is because a social order which has lasted for centuries leaves its impress for a long time upon people 's minds and hearts , and continues for a long time to struggle against the order which is to succeed it ; it is also because his acquaintance lay chiefly among that middle-clues society in which the family ideals are still honored ; and finally , because the now order finds itself face to face with forces lit tie // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , of Catholicism , of a whole hidebound literature , and of a new sectionalism which has lately come into fashion again . The distinguished traveler should , however , have noticed several things which would have revealed to him , under the old surface of French life , the thrust of a new world : a high society which lives as it pleases , believing implicitly that it has not a single tie with the land or the people ; a bourgeoisie which , active and well-established and honorable as it is , is nevertheless not so thrifty as it used to be , and regulates its expenses and its future to its present profit ; a rural population which , in too many cases , tires of the fields and descends upon the cities ; and a working class crowded into insufficient lodgings , ? a class for which the day-labor of the women has been the death of the home . I admit that the dark picture is brightened by the survival of the old French traits . Energy , gayety , courage in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents toward their children continue to fill our houses with an atmosphere of comfort and hope which reassures us for the future . Nevertheless , when one sees individualism trying to acclimatize itself in France , after the French family has for centuries borne such beautiful fruit , one has an uneasy fear for the population of the country . United , strengthened , defended by laws , the family guaranteed long life to the nation . Reduced to a precarious condition , it gives no more children . Voluntary sterility increases . It is sufficient to consult the statistics . The total number of births fell from 937,544 in 1883 to 774,000 in 1907 , and in 1911 the total number of deaths exceeded it by 34,889 . The nation , ' said Joseph de Maistre , is an association of the living with the dead and those still unborn . ' That is to say , the nation is a collection of families . The family alone honors its dead and sustains life . In the Latin countries there is no doubt that the fortunes of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if experience in other countries points less decisively to this conclusion , it is still to be feared that the search for individual life leads sooner or later to that disparagement of the nation 's life which manifests itself in the decreasing birth-rate and the refusal to undergo sacrifices and struggles .
