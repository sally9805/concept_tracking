SCENE : The Bishop 's library in Washington Square . At right are two windows , with heavy curtains drawn . At left is a large fireplace , with a white marble mantel . At back is the door leading to the rest of the house . There are high bookcases , running up to the ceiling , set in both walls wherever there is any space . In a corner at back stands a Victrola , of sober mahogany . Before the fireplace , half facing the audience , is the Bishop 's big armchair . At right , is a big mahogany table-desk , arranged in an orderly way with electric lamp , telephone , desk-furniture , books , memoranda , files , etc . The chair is behind it , between the windows . The whole room is one of quiet dignity ,  --  slightly old-fashioned in effect , and very comfortable . It is night . The lamp on the desk is turned on and there is a cheerful wood fire burning . In his armchair before the fire sits Bishop Armstrong . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy . Suzette ,  --  a decided young woman of seventeen ,  --  is sitting at the desk , reading aloud from the evening paper . SUZETTE Skimming over the headlines . " Regulation of Skyscrapers  --  Drastic Measures  --  " She yawns . " Borough President Gives to Board of Estimates the Report on Improvement . " Looking up. p. 3 Sounds dull , does n't it ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG No  --  but if you think so , try the next . SUZETTE Reading . " President in the West  --  Yesterday 's Speech at Cheyenne "  --  Is that the way you pronounce it ?  --  " Crops , Race Suicide , and Tariff Reform . " As the noise of horns drifts in from the street . Oh , I do wish those boys would stop ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Philosophically . It 's New Year 's Eve . SUZETTE I know , but they need n't make such a fuss about it . Returning to her paper . The President talked two and a half columns and he looks dreadfully dull . Do you want me to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't you much rather have me start the Victrola ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Well , my dear , perhaps I would . Where 's Harry ? He said he wanted to speak to me after dinner about something important . SUZETTE Busy with the Victrola . Oh , he just went out . He 'll be back soon . The song begins . There , grandpa ! Is n't that a splendid record ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Singing . Ta-ta-ta-ta ! Yes  --  a very fine voice . Who is it ? SUZETTE Tetrazzini . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Ah , you should have heard Patti sing this at the Academy in ' 72  --  ! SUZETTE Now , grandpa , I ca n't help being young , and anyway I 'm sure that Garden and Fremstad and Farrar are every bit as good as your Grisis and Pattis and Cavallinis . And as for Caruso  --  ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Softly. p. 4 I have heard Mario ! Humming again . Ta-ta-ta-ta ! Now for the cadenza  --  He listens . Fair  --  quite fair ! With a sigh . After all , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMSTRONG Yes , dear ? SUZETTE Beguilingly . Which do you think would be more apt to melt you into a perfectly angelic , Bavarian-cream sort of mood  --  O Parigi from Traviata or the Sextette from Lucia ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG I 'm melted already . I 'm just running over the side of the dish . SUZETTE Really ? No , I think you need one more . I want you very , very soft . Picking out a fresh record . Oh , here 's a brand-new Destinn ! That 'll do it ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG What 's the opera ? SUZETTE Adjusting the record . Wait and see . The voice is heard . Do you remember it ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Looking away . Yes  --  yes , I remember  --  He rouses himself suddenly . Do n't play that , Suzette . I know I 'm foolish , but it makes me rather sad . SUZETTE Stopping the record. p. 5 I thought you 'd like it . It 's from Mignon . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Yes , I know  --  but  --  In a different tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SUZETTE Adjusting the record . Grandpa , your taste in music is low . That 's the only word . And I 've tried so hard to uplift it . Just think of those wonderful Boston Symphony concerts I dragged you to last winter ! And now I think you 'd rather hear I Love a Lassie than Beethoven ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Tranquilly . I would indeed . SUZETTE And you a Bishop of the Episcopal Church ! She starts the machine . There ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Leaning back in his chair and singing under his breath . " I love a lassie , A bonny Highland lassie  --  She 's the  --  " SUZETTE Coming and perching on the arm of his chair . Oh , grandpa , you are such a dear old  --  baby ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Yes , ma'am ? SUZETTE And I know I bully you an awful lot . Do n't I ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Well , I 'm used to it ! SUZETTE How horrid of you ! Why , I do n't bully you at all ! Of course there are times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 So your grandmother used to tell me . SUZETTE And you have n't anyone to do it except me . BISHOP ARMSTRONG I know . SUZETTE Softening . But I do n't want you to think I 'm a tyrant  --  especially to-night ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG To what am I indebted for this holiday ? SUZETTE Well , I 've got something to tell you . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Yes ? SUZETTE And I do n't know whether or not you 'll like it . BISHOP ARMSTRONG I like everything . It 's my greatest fault ! SUZETTE Suddenly smiling . Oh ! oh ! What about Wagner ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Firmly . Except Wagner . Yes , that 's true  --  I ca n't stand Wagner ! SUZETTE Well , I doubt if you can stand this , either . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Suppose you give me a try ! SUZETTE All right . She stops the record . It 's Harry . BISHOP ARMSTRONG I thought so . SUZETTE He 's gone and done it . BISHOP ARMSTRONG What ? SUZETTE All in a rush. p. 7 I mean he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally ca n't do anything without her and she says she wo n't do a thing until she 's met you and you 've said it 's all right , so that 's why Harry wanted to speak to you to-night and you must n't breathe one word about my telling you  --  you see , he 's planning to do it all himself , but when he said he thought the shock would kill you and he 'd be held up for " episcocide "  --  yes , that 's what he called it !  --  I thought I 'd better break it to you gently . Slight pause . Do n't you think I 've been wise , grandpa , to break it to you gently ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG You have n't broken it at all , my dear . I do n't know that you 're talking about . SUZETTE Why , grandpa , I 've just told you ! Harry 's engaged to a girl named Lucile Anderson ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Oh ! I must be getting deaf . Dear me ! And who is Lucile Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an  --  an artist . BISHOP ARMSTRONG You mean she paints ? SUZETTE No , she does n't exactly paint . You know , there 're all kinds of artists , grandpa , and Lucile  --  well , Lucile 's art is  --  er  --  a very beautiful art , it 's the art of  --  er  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Well ? SUZETTE The art of  --  er  --  impersonation on the stage . Slight pause. p. 8 BISHOP ARMSTRONG In short , the young lady is an actress . SUZETTE Yes . Nervously . Well , it does n't make any difference . Lots of nice girls are nowadays . BISHOP ARMSTRONG To himself . An actress  --  ! SUZETTE Bursting out . But she 's a perfect dear and her father was a well-known lawyer in Toronto , Canada , but he died and left her without a cent and her influence over Harry is very , very good and I 'm sure you 'll love her when you get to know her  --  I do , anyway , and I 've only seen her four times  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ! Remember  --  it 's our own Harry ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Drily . That 's just what I am remembering , dear . He always did have very little sense ! SUZETTE Reproachfully . Why , grandpa , he played quarter on the ' varsity ! And you said yourself that took a lot of brains ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Smiling . Did I ? Well , this proves I was mistaken . SUZETTE Oh , dear ! I  --  Suddenly. p. 9 Wait ! I heard the front-door ! That 's Harry  --  ! She slips off the arm of his chair . Now remember ! Do n't you get me into trouble ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG I wo n't ! SUZETTE Promise ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Cross my heart and hope to die ! Enter Harry . He is an attractive young man of about twenty-two or three  --  restless , young and impetuous . He wears a dinner-coat . Well ! We 'd almost given you up ! HARRY Ill at ease . I had to make a call . Did n't Suzie tell you ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Tranquilly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what about our little chat ? HARRY Nervously . Your  --  your rheumatism is n't bothering you too much , is it , sir ? To-morrow would  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Oh no ! Suzie 's played all my aches away with Rigoletto and Trovatore . I 'm fit as a fiddle , my boy , so put another log on the fire and go ahead . HARRY All right , sir . He puts on the log , motioning the while for Suzette to leave . SUZETTE To the Bishop. p. 10 I 'll come in later and finish the Post to you before you go to bed . To Harry , in a lower voice . Do n't worry ! I 've got him going ! HARRY Thanks , old girl . She goes out . HARRY Turning resolutely to the Bishop . Grandfather , I have something I want to  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Gently . If you go to my desk , Harry , and open the second drawer from the top on the left-hand side , I think you 'll see a box of cigars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? Harry returns with the box . Wo n't you have one ? Harry shakes his head . I know they 're not as good as yours , but I ca n't afford the very best brands . HARRY I do n't feel like smoking now . Grandfather , I 've come to you in order to  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Gently interrupting . Er  --  just one moment . I have n't any match . HARRY Oh Lord ! Excuse me ! He lights the Bishop 's cigar . There ! Now I want to tell you what 's on my mind , grandfather . It 's been there for some time and I  --  I  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Yes ? HARRY Embarrassed. p. 11 I think I ought to  --  to get it off . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Well ? HARRY You see  --  it 's this way . Pause . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Mildly . What way ? HARRY Hang it , I do n't know how to put the thing , but  --  but  --  Looking up and seeing the Bishop smiling at him . Well , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the time ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Your intuition is overwhelming , Harry ,  --  but it 's correct . As you say ,  --  I 'm on . Pause . HARRY Wrathfully looking at door . I might have known no girl could keep a secret ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Hastily . It 's my fault ! I wrung it out of her ! I kicked her shins ! I squeezed her neck ! I  --  twisted her arm ! HARRY Disgusted . And now you 're making fun of me ! Well  --  ! He straightens up defiantly . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Suddenly tender . I 'm not making fun of you , Harry . HARRY Uncomfortably. p. 12 I meant to tell you myself about Lucile . I did n't want anybody else butting in . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Of course  --  I know . You must love her a great deal ! HARRY Still a little sulkily . Well , I do . BISHOP ARMSTRONG And she 's very pretty , is n't she ? HARRY Brightening . Did Suzie tell you ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG No  --  I just guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's awfully clever , too  --  acts like a streak  --  and she has just bunches of character ! Why , when it comes down to it , she 's ten times too good for me ! She 's just too wonderful for anything ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG With a little smile . Of course she is  --  of course  --  of course . HARRY I met her at the Randalls '  --  you know , that painter fellow  --  and now she 's all alone in a rotten boarding-house on Tenth Street and she has no work and her family are all dead  --  and so I really think I ought to marry her right off . Now do n't you agree with me ? Pause . Well ? Do n't you ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Rousing himself with an effort. p. 13 I do n't know , Harry . You see , you 're so young  --  you 're just beginning life , and you may change , and grow , my dear boy , there may come a time when you 'll need more than any little actress can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right now , you love her  --  I know that ! But are you quite sure , Harry , that you 'll always love her just the way you love her now and nothing hidden in the future  --  or in the past  --  can ever shake your faith and beat you down and break your heart ? HARRY I do n't know what you mean . BISHOP ARMSTRONG You must be very , very sure , my boy  --  or else you 're not fair to yourself  --  and what 's worse  --  I 'm afraid you 're not fair to her . HARRY Bursting out . Oh , what 's the good of talking ! I just knew it would be this way ! There 's absolutely no use trying to do things with my family  --  they 're all alike  --  look at Uncle Thomas and Aunt Sarah and Cousin Ralph and the whole crowd of them  --  narrow , conventional , dry-as-dust ! Turning away suddenly . If only dad and mummy were alive , they 'd understand ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Hurt . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done my best for Suzette and you . HARRY Penitent. p. 14 I know you have . I did n't mean that , grandpa . But you see , it 's a long time now since you 've been young and I think it 's sort of hard for you to remember back and realize what it 's like and  --  sympathize with a fellow ! Going on quickly . Oh , I know you 're awfully wise and you can see clear through people and understand ' em that way , but this is different  --  I do n't believe you ever felt the way I 'm feeling now  --  and so  --  Gulping . Oh , well , there 's no use going on . Thanks for trying , grandpa  --  I wo n't keep you up any longer . He is at the door ready to leave . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Where are you going ? HARRY A trifle defiantly . I 'm going to get married . BISHOP ARMSTRONG To-night ? HARRY Yes , we got the license this afternoon . Slight pause . BISHOP ARMSTRONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY Doing so . What do you want ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG You said I could n't remember back and realize how one felt when one was young  --  and life was just a glorious chaos of passion and beauty and despair . Well , I do remember . Because no matter how old one grows , Harry , there are always some things that keep a little youth still burning in one 's heart . HARRY I did n't mean to hurt you , grandpa . BISHOP ARMSTRONG You did n't , my dear boy . But you 've made me think of something that I 'd supposed I 'd forgotten  --  it 's so long ago since it came up in my mind . It 's something I never told to anyone before  --  I used to think I never would . Oh , well  --  times change , and I did n't realize then I was to have a grandson just like you . I wonder , Harry , if you 'll have time to wait and hear about it ? HARRY Distrustfully. p. 15 If you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucile , you might as well stop right here . As the Bishop rises with difficulty and goes slowly over to the desk . What is it , grandpa ? Ca n't I get it ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Suddenly , with a sharp intake of breath . A-ah ! HARRY Sympathetically . Your rheumatism , sir ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG With a smile . Do n't mention rheumatism now , my boy ! He stands for a moment above the desk and shuts his eyes . I 'm only twenty-eight years old ! Taking a bunch of keys from his pocket , he unlocks a lower drawer and , after some fumbling , comes up with a small mahogany box which he lays on the desk before him . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Do you know what 's in this little box ? HARRY No , sir . What ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG With a radiant smile . Romance , my boy  --  the perfume of romance ! HARRY How  --  how do you mean , sir ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Look ! He opens the box and takes out a little wisp of lace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A handkerchief ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Nodding . A little handkerchief . He undoes it and discloses a few old flowers . White violets  --  He sniffs them , then smiles and shakes his head . They 're dried and yellow now . Their sweetness is all gone . I 'm an old man , Harry , but somehow  --  why , it seems like yesterday  --  HARRY Wonderingly . What , sir ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Turning out the desk-lamp , and crossing to his chair again , holding the flowers and handkerchief very carefully in his hands . Ah , that 's what I 'm going to tell you now ! Sit down , my boy  --  As Harry obeys . Are you comfortable there ? That 's right !  --  Well , it was over forty years ago  --  forty years  --  dear me , how the time flies !  --  and I was the young Rector of St. Giles , you know . That was before I married your grandmother  --  God bless her !  --  although I 'd known her nearly all my life . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I went to an evening party at old Cornelius Van Tuyl 's house and there in that kaleidoscope of jewels and flowers and crinolines the great adventure of my life began  --  And , as he speaks , from far away comes the sound of a quaint old polka , and Harry and the Bishop and the whole room melt into the dark . The music swells and the lights , blooming again from crystal chandeliers , reveal the living vision of the past . p. 17 @x SCENE : Evening reception at MR . CORNELIUS VAN TUYL 'S house , about 1867 . It is a small upstairs drawing-room . In the center is the stairway leading to the rooms below . At left is the door to the library . In foreground , at right , there is a couch , turned slightly to face the audience . At its head stands a small , marble-topped table . At left of foreground is a tete -- tete chair . A seat runs along the balustrade which encircles the staircase well . Lamps in the foreground shed a mellow light which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lights go up upon an animated scene . The little room is filled with people . At back , leaning on the balustrade which surrounds the well , stand two men-about-town , looking out over the rooms below . Near them are a young man and a girl , talking , laughing , and flirting . Another young man and a girl  --  she on his arm  --  cross the stage , chatting gaily . They turn , descend the staircase , and disappear . MRS . RUTHERFORD ,  --  a rather pretty , affected woman ,  --  is sitting on the couch at right . Beside her is MISS SUSAN VAN TUYL , a sensible , attractive young woman of about twenty-five , dressed simply and charmingly in white . They are listening to MR . HARRY PUTNAM , an elderly beau of the period , who stands twirling his moustaches , his feet crossed , ogling and talking to them . MRS . FROTHINGHAM ,  --  a buxom , florid dowager , very richly and fussily dressed ,  --  sits on the tte -- tte at left with her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN To the young girl on his arm , as they cross the stage . A very brilliant party , do n't you think ? p. 19 THE GIRL Oh , quite the most elegant affair of the winter ! They turn to the stairs . THE YOUNG MAN To another young man just coming up . Oh , Frank , is the dancing saloon crowded ? THE SECOND YOUNG MAN Not just now . They 're beginning to serve supper . THE YOUNG MAN To the girl . Splendid ! They go downstairs . THE SECOND YOUNG MAN To MRS . FROTHINGHAM , with a bow . Mrs. Frothingham , may I have the honor of this polka ? MRS . FROTHINGHAM You droll wretch , do n't you know my dancing days are over ? THE YOUNG MAN To the girl . Miss Frothingham , then , may be persuaded to atone for  --  MISS FROTHINGHAM Rising . Of course I may ! I love to polk ! They turn towards the stairs . MRS . FROTHINGHAM Rising . My dearest Susan  --  Agatha  --  forgive me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at couch  --  right . Meanwhile the two men-about-town are heard to speak from the balustrade , where they are looking at crowd below . p. 20 THE YOUNG MAN Who 's that woman with the diamonds  --  down there by the door ? I thought at first it might be Cavallini . THE SECOND YOUNG MAN Turning away . No , Cavallini 's singing that new opera  --  what 's its name ? THE YOUNG MAN Mignon ? THE SECOND YOUNG MAN Mignon  --  of course ! She 's still at the Academy  --  she wo n't be here till twelve . THE YOUNG MAN Shall we have supper now or shall we wait ? THE SECOND YOUNG MAN Now , my dear chap , now ! This is one of the few houses where Blue Seal Johannis-berger flows like water . THE YOUNG MAN At the stairs . And the ' 48 claret ! I 'd forgotten that  --  They disappear below , talking . A burst of laughter from the girl who is flirting with the young man at the back of the scene . THE GIRL You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now give me your arm and take me downstairs to mamma  --  HER PARTNER Do you know you have exactly the same effect on me as a glass of champagne ! THE GIRL At the top of the stairs . Of course , I do n't know anything about that ! p. 21 HER PARTNER No , of course not . It does n't last long  --  still  --  while it lasts  --  They descend , talking and laughing . MRS . FROTHINGHAM Sitting on the couch , at right . You can say what you please , Miss Van Tuyl , the Rector 's nose is not Grecian ! SUSAN Very politely . Dear Mrs. Frothingham , are noses your only standard ? MRS . RUTHERFORD Shaking her head . Ah , well  --  his grandfather on his mother 's side came of very doubtful stock ! An Irish peasant , I believe  --  he landed sometime about 1805 . SUSAN Surely , Mrs. Rutherford , your memory does n't take you quite as far back as all that ? PUTNAM And to think we are condemned to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time to catch the young puppy making scurrilous allusions to me  --  ! MRS . FROTHINGHAM To you , Mr. Putnam ? Dear me , I regret exceedingly that my neuralgia kept me from attending church ! What did he  --  ? SUSAN He said he did n't doubt that several of our elderly beaux would soon be making Heaven fashionable and organizing society among the more exclusive angels ! TOM is seen leisurely coming upstairs . He is about twenty-eight , healthy , positive , and determined . He is dressed very simply and a little shabbily . He has a very hearty , genial quality , but no humor. p. 22 MRS . FROTHINGHAM Abominable ! MRS . RUTHERFORD Blasphemous , I call it ! PUTNAM Hardly the remark of a gentleman ! MRS . FROTHINGHAM But he 's not a gentleman ! PUTNAM He dresses like a pen-wiper ! MRS . RUTHERFORD He spends all his spare time with working men ! PUTNAM To SUSAN . My dear young lady , why your excellent uncle ever gave him the church is more than I shall ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  that 's why ! Look what he 's done here in just these two years ! Has n't he built up the congregation from nothing at all to the third biggest in New York ? Has n't he started the athletic club for the young men and the cooking classes for the girls ? Has n't he founded our parish school for poor children , and got people to donate a playground , and a circulating library , and a big hall for free lectures and musical entertainments ? Is n't he just as much at home and just as much loved down in a Bowery saloon as he is here in a Fifth Avenue drawing-room ? Is n't he  --  PUTNAM My dear Miss Van Tuyl ! MRS . FROTHINGHAM He 's impossible ! p. 23 MRS . RUTHERFORD Outrageous ! PUTNAM A blot on the parish ! MRS . FROTHINGHAM A disgrace to the church  --  PUTNAM Suddenly seeing TOM . Er  --  what wonderful weather we 're having ! MRS . RUTHERFORD To MRS . FROTHINGHAM . Rather cold for November , do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very warm indeed  --  SUSAN Bewildered . But  --  She turns and sees TOM . Oh , I see ! Smiling . We 're talking about you , Tom . ARMSTRONG Briefly . I heard . Thank you , Susan . MRS . RUTHERFORD Rising . We were all saying the most flattering things  --  MRS . FROTHINGHAM Rising . Dear Dr. Armstrong , I  --  I wonder your ears were n't burning  --  PUTNAM Laughing nervously . By Jove , yes  --  so do I ! p. 24 ARMSTRONG Do n't let me drive you away . MRS . FROTHINGHAM Er  --  I must look after Mabel . I must n't let the dear child dance too much ! PUTNAM And I was on the point of offering Mrs. Rutherford some supper . MRS . RUTHERFORD How very kind ! To SUSAN . Au revoir , my dear  --  good-night , Dr. Armstrong . MRS . FROTHINGHAM Good-night  --  good-night . PUTNAM Bowing . Your servant . The three go downstairs . SUSAN After them . Do n't go before Madame Cavallini comes  --  she 's promised to sing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  au revoir ! Turning to TOM . Cats ! Two tabbies and one old tom ! Did you hear what they were saying ? ARMSTRONG Just a little . Loftily . What does it matter ? They 're not the people I care about  --  they 're not the people that really count ! SUSAN I know . But I just ca n't bear their criticizing you ! Looking at him . Oh , Tom ! You 've got on your oldest clothes ! Why could n't you have stopped to dress ? p. 25 ARMSTRONG Well , I was going to , honestly I was . But this is my night at the athletic club and about ten o'clock , just as I 'd taken on the heavyweight of the ward , little Jimmy Baxter came running in and said young Sullivan was drunk and killing his wife so would I please step over ? Noticing her glance . What are you looking at ? SUSAN Your hair ! ARMSTRONG Feeling it . Is it sticking up behind ? SUSAN Just one lock  --  on the left . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she smooths it down , as he goes on talking . ARMSTRONG Going on all the time . And I found Sullivan in a fighting mood and rather difficult to manage and in the middle of it all , if Mrs. Sullivan did n't go and have another baby ! SUSAN Trying to take out a spot from his lapel with her handkerchief . How terrible ! ARMSTRONG That 's what I told her . I said it was bad enough to have married Sullivan , but to bring a child of his into the world was almost worse than murder ! SUSAN Always busying herself with him . But , Tom  --  she was longing for another baby ! p. 26 ARMSTRONG I ca n't help that . However , now it 's come , will you go round to-morrow and make a note of how she 's doing ? SUSAN Turning him round and looking at him critically . Of course , Does she need any baby clothes ? ARMSTRONG She had a few . Mrs. Baxter 's given her the rest . SUSAN Very well  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A MAN 'S VOICE Coming upstairs . I say ! SUSAN Looking over the balustrade . Oh , it 's Mr. Livingstone !

You owe that dab of mayonnaise to no less a person than the Golden Nightingale ! To TOM . Hello , Tom  --  how goes it ? SUSAN Why , Mr. Livingstone ? LIVINGSTONE It 's a fact . I never would have got it if it had n't been for her . Why , all the literary and artistic talent in New York was fighting like a band of demons round the supper-table , when , thank the Lord ! the band struck up and someone said that Cavallini had arrived ! p. 27 SUSAN Smiling .

Do n't you know who 's making a tour of the rooms on his arm , as the guest of honor ?

I always knew you were advanced , Tom , but I 'll swear I never thought you 'd go as far as this ! ARMSTRONG What on earth  --  LIVINGSTONE Interrupting . It 's bad enough to come and find the house all full of dirty painter chaps and female novelists ! It 's vile enough to see your wife rub elbows with those garlic-eating , gutter-born Italian Opera scoundrels  --  well , I wo n't talk about the others , they 're old and fat and ugly , and I do n't know anything against ' em  --  but Cavalini  --  p. 29 ARMSTRONG Well ?

He is a man of about fifty , deep-voiced and strong  --  a powerful personality . His manner is gentle and full of a wise , quiet humor . He is dressed soberly , but beautifully and with great care . CORNELIUS Smiling . Well , my young friends ! What 's the matter ? LIVINGSTONE Politely . Oh , nothing ! Tom and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . Good gracious  --  twelve o'clock !

Oh , why ? LIVINGSTONE Simply . I 'd rather my wife heard Mme. Cavallini across the footlights  --  a touch of prejudice , I suppose  --  do n't let it bother you  --  good-night ! He bows , smiles , and goes downstairs . ARMSTRONG Simply and a little shyly . I 'd have come downstairs to find you , sir , but I 'm not dressed  --  as you see  --  and I thought you might n't like it . CORNELIUS Heartily . Nonsense , my boy ! Why , you 've no time to prink up for our foolish parties . I think you 're very good to come at all .

He puts back the vase with a sigh . But I think you care more for pictures than for terra-cottas , do n't you ? Come and look at the new Millet .

CORNELIUS In that case , pray go on . He sits . Wo n't you sit down ? He lights a cigar . ARMSTRONG No , thanks . Ingenuously . Mr. Van Tuyl , I suppose some people would say that after all you 'd done for St. Giles and me , it was n't in my place to suggest anything  --  CORNELIUS Nonsense , Tom . Do you know you 're getting to look more like your dear mother every day ? ARMSTRONG No , am I ? Resuming .

Oh , I know how broad-minded you are and how interested in art and music and all that sort of thing , and it 's splendid ! It 's so splendid , sir , that I could n't bear to think anyone was imposing on your liberality. p. 35 CORNELIUS Calmly . Whom do you mean ? ARMSTRONG This Madame Cavallini  --  is n't it ? I know she 's very distinguished , and I quite understand your public spirit in recognizing her genius by making her the center of one of your elegant entertainments . But after all , sir , are you quite sure she 's the sort of lady  --  the kind of person  --  er  --  the type  --  With a gesture.  --  I say the type  --  CORNELIUS Mildly . It is n't Sunday , Tom . ARMSTRONG Paternally . You know , sir , you 're so generous and high-minded that anybody could take you in  --  oh , yes they could ! With a shake of the head . And , personally speaking , I have always found that foreigners  --  particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning towards immorality . CORNELIUS How old are you , Tom ? ARMSTRONG Lamely . Er  --  twenty-eight . CORNELIUS With a wistful smile . I wish I were twenty-eight . Life 's a simple thing when you 're twenty-eight . ARMSTRONG Loftily . If one has standards  --  yes . p. 36 CORNELIUS Standards ? ARMSTRONG Of right and wrong , I mean . CORNELIUS Oh , yes  --  I had those standards once . ARMSTRONG Shocked . Once , sir ? CORNELIUS Confidentially . And then one day I got ' em all mixed up  --  and the right seemed wrong and the wrong seemed right and I just did n't know where I was at . ARMSTRONG Oh , come , sir ! CORNELIUS That was a long time ago , my boy , but  --  With a chuckle . Well , I 'm dashed if I ever got ' em straight again ! ARMSTRONG Distressed . Oh , sir , do n't talk that way ! CORNELIUS Soberly . I 've learnt a few things , though  --  stray spars I 've clung to in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow they 've managed to hold me up . One 's how to value people that are good  --  that 's why you 're Rector of St. Giles , Tom  --  and another 's how to pity people that are  --  ARMSTRONG Bad . CORNELIUS No , not bad , my boy  --  there are no people that are bad . But there 're some poor devils who find it harder to be good than you  --  that 's all . p. 37 ARMSTRONG Hesitatingly . And Madame Cavallini ? CORNELIUS If Madame Cavallini were n't fit to meet my friends , you never would have seen her here to-night . Slight pause . ARMSTRONG Impulsively . Oh , what a fool I 've been ! I might have known there was n't a word of truth in what that puppy said . CORNELIUS What puppy ? ARMSTRONG A young he-gossip , sir , who reeled off lies about this woman . And I was ass enough to believe him , and come to you and talk like a  --  like a  --  like a confounded prig ! I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORNELIUS With a twinkle . You 're my Rector , Tom . ARMSTRONG Do you think you can forgive me , sir ? Just here the band downstairs begins a beguiling Strauss waltz . CORNELIUS Rising . There 's nothing to forgive , my boy . And now go down and ask Susan for some supper . ARMSTRONG But I 'm not dressed  --  CORNELIUS Oh , nonsense ! But if you 'd rather go into the library , I 'll tell her to bring it to you there . Meanwhile , there is heard down the staircase the sound of men 's voices , high and eager , and over and above them , a woman 's laughter . This comes nearer and nearer . p. 38 ARMSTRONG But I 'm not  --  CORNELIUS Clapping him on the shoulder . Do n't tell me you 're not hungry ! You 're twenty-eight years old , and when a young man 's twenty-eight  --  hello ! who 's this ? He turns and glances at back , as the sound of the voices and laughter grows nearer . A WOMAN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' vay  --  go ' vay  --  you mus ' not come vit ' me  --  no  --  no  --  you are naughty  --  you are de mos ' ' orrible naughty men I ever see  --  She sweeps up with the group of young dandies who have accompanied her and stands for a moment at the top of the stairway , laughing and talking , always facing in the direction whence she came , away from TOM and VAN TUYL . She is a bewitching , brilliant little foreign creature  --  beautiful in a dark , Italian way . She is marvellously dressed in voluminous gauze and her dress is trimmed with tiny roses . Her black hair hangs in curls on either side of her face and three long soft curls hang down her low-cut back . On her head is a wreath of little roses . She wears long diamond earrings , a rivire of diamonds is about her neck , diamonds gleam on her corsage , her wrists and hands . She carries a fan and bouquet in a silver filigree holder .

There is an instant 's pause , then , quite suddenly , he seizes her hands and kisses them again and again . p. 68 CAVALLINI Trying to rise . No  --  stop  --  what you do  --  ? She manages to tear herself away from him just as VAN TUYL appears on the stairs . He pauses at the top and looks at them . A brief pause . CAVALLINI With complete self-command . Ah , ' ow nize you are to come ! CORNELIUS Politely . You 're ready , madame ? CAVALLINI Gvite , qvite ready . To TOM . T'ank you , m'sieur , for your kin ' politeness . Good-bye .

I 'm awfully sorry , but I  --  you know you have n't told me what your name is  --  CAVALLINI Oh , of course  --  I ' ave forget  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuyl ? She gives them each the most correct of smiles and bows , unconsciously dropping her handkerchief as she does so , then goes downstairs . As she goes , there is a murmur swelling up into loud applause which comes from below . She is smiling and kissing her hand to this unseen crowd as she disappears . A pause . VAN TUYL lights a cigar . TOM , staring after her , comes slowly to the top of the stairs , sees the handkerchief and picks it up . He is fingering it aimlessly when he sees the initials at one corner . He looks at them more carefully  --  and then turns dumbly to VAN TUYL . The orchestra begins below . p. 70 CORNELIUS Gently . Do you mean to say you really did n't know who she was ? ARMSTRONG Shaking his head and speaking almost inarticulately . No  --  I had n't the least idea  --  A WOMAN 'S VOICE Singing below . " Non conosci il bel suolChe di porpora ha il , ciel ? Il bel suol de ' raiSon pi tersi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOM walks slowly to the balustrade and stands there , looking down at the singer in the room below . VAN TUYL watches him rather sadly as SCENE : New Year 's afternoon . The study of St. Giles Rectory , a charmingly old-fashioned , spacious New York house , looking out upon a quiet street . The study is a square room . At the left are two windows , with heavy , rather faded curtains . In them hang holly wreaths , tied with scarlet bows . At the back is the double-doorway leading into the hall . At one side of it hangs the bell-rope . Over it is a long oar , and , above this a mounted stag 's head . At the right is the white marble mantel and fireplace , in which a fire is burning . On the mantel are several silver cups , medals in their open cases , little old-fashioned photographs of young men , a big old clock , and two handsome candelabra . Over the mantel is a large steel engraving of Del Sarto 's St. John . Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pair of boxing-gloves hangs here , too . There are bookcases at the back , filled with sober , pious , dusty volumes . On top these bookcases are a few more engravings of old Masters  --  a Last Supper , etc . In one corner stands an old-fashioned cabinet , with glass-covered shelves and drawers below . In front of the window is a very large , heavy tabledesk ; on it are a lamp , a water-pitcher and glass , desk-fittings , several books , a daguerreotype in a velvet case , a large , well-used Bible , a smaller Testament , etc . A big leather chair faces this desk . There are one or two other chairs near it . Across the room and placed so that the keyboard is not seen is a small , but exquisite old-fashioned square piano . There are candles on each side of the keyboard and several rather worn volumes of bound music , neatly ranged . Near the fireplace is a hair-cloth settee . All the furniture is old-fashioned black walnut , upholstered in black . An old-fashioned red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter 's afternoon comes through the windows . Outdoors the glitter of snow is seen . As the act goes on the sunlight changes to the ruddy glow of a winter 's sunset , and then the twilight fills the room with shadows . As the curtain rises MISS ARMSTRONG , wearing a little black silk apron , is discovered arranging some roses in a bowl on the desk . The clock on the mantel strikes four . The door opens and GILES , the old butler , appears . GILES Miss Van Tuyl . SUSAN enters , dressed in bonnet and mantle . p. 72 SUSAN Coming in . Tom , I  --  Seeing MISS ARMSTRONG . Oh , Happy New Year , Miss Armstrong ! MISS ARMSTRONG Do n't be premature , my dear  --  it 's only New Year 's Eve . Kissing her . What nice cold cheeks you have ! SUSAN Laughing . I ought to  --  I 've been walking . Tom asked me to come in at four , and hear about the final arrangements for to-night . MISS ARMSTRONG To-night  --  ?

He went out after luncheon  --  er  --  to pay a call . SUSAN Meaningly . At the Brevoort House ? MISS ARMSTRONG Flustered . Oh , I 'm sure he 'll be here if you wait a moment ! He has a Deaconesses ' Meeting at a quarter to five and I know he never would miss that ! p. 73 SUSAN Would n't he ? Well , we 'll see  --  Noticing the flowers . What lovely roses ! MISS ARMSTRONG They 're mine  --  they came just a moment ago . Without any card , too ! SUSAN Chaffing her . Aha ! An anonymous admirer  --  ! MISS ARMSTRONG Embarrassed and pleased .

He 's driving his new team ! MISS ARMSTRONG Is he getting out ? SUSAN Yes . He 's come to call for me on his way uptown . Glancing at clock . I wonder if Tom  --  MISS ARMSTRONG My dear , there 's no telling when he 'll be back . And as there 's something I want to discuss with your uncle , I think you may as well go home . SUSAN Miss Armstrong , promise me not to tell him I came  --  unless he speaks of it himself , I mean . I do n't want to be a drag on him . Oh , Miss Armstrong , promise  --  please ! p. 74 MISS ARMSTRONG Very well , my dear  --  if you insist , and  --  GILES enters . GILES Announcing . Mr. Van Tuyl .

She puts on her wraps . CORNELIUS Yes  --  good idea . I do n't like to keep the horses standing . To MISS ARMSTRONG . Have you seen my new team , Miss Armstrong ? The prettiest sight in New York  --  At the window . Look at that off mare there ! Is n't she a little witch ? The highest stepper on the Avenue and a mouth like a French kid glove ! MISS ARMSTRONG She looks very wild indeed ! To SUSAN . Good-bye , my dear . Tell Ralph to be careful . p. 75 SUSAN Kissing MISS ARMSTRONG . Do n't forget your promise . In a lower voice .

MISS ARMSTRONG You 're Tom 's oldest friend  --  and his father 's and mother 's before him  --  and you 're his leading parishioner , too  --  and the chairman of the vestry  --  She sniffs . CORNELIUS Comfortingly . I know  --  I know  --  MISS ARMSTRONG Breaking down . Oh , save him , Mr. Van Tuyl  --  save him from that d-d-dreadful woman ! She sobs . p. 76 CORNELIUS I 've done my best . He came to see me Saturday about the new gymnasium and I talked to him as I would have to my own son . MISS ARMSTRONG What did he say ? CORNELIUS He was very sweet , but somehow he was n't there  --  the real Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was speaking to . MISS ARMSTRONG I know ! I 've seen it ! He 's with her !

What 's the matter ? CORNELIUS Why , her carriage is just stopping at your door ! MISS ARMSTRONG In amazed horror . Not Madame Cavallini  --  ? CORNELIUS I rather think she 's out to pay some calls . As MISS ARMSTRONG goes and pulls the bell-rope . What are you going to do ? MISS ARMSTRONG Tell Giles I 'm out . CORNELIUS Frankly . Let her come in . Perhaps I could say a word or two  --  p. 77 MISS ARMSTRONG Earnestly . You 'll make her promise not to write to him ? CORNELIUS I 'll do my best . MISS ARMSTRONG Vehemently . There ought to be a law against such women ! Why , I 'd sooner have a hungry tigress walk into this room than  --  GILES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to let her pass . She comes in quickly . She wears a wonderful black velvet dress , an ermine coat , and a little ermine hat . Around her neck is a long rope of pearls ; at the end hangs a cross . In her arms , as if it were a baby , she carries a great ermine muff . From one end of this peeps a monkey 's head , adorned with a scarlet satin turban , a long green cigarette and a diamond clasp .

Well ? CORNELIUS After a slight pause . There 's one thing I 'm not going to deny , and that is my very deep and very true affection for Madame Cavallini . Looking at her . It is a sentiment none the less deep and true because it has lived for years with no response from her , and I am proud of my hope and my belief that it will continue so long as I 'm alive to cherish it . Turning to TOM . As for the rest of your question , Tom , when you 're yourself again you 'll agree with me that it deserves no answer .

At the right are two long windows , with a tall old-fashioned gilt mirror and low consol table between . At the back  --  towards right  --  is an arch leading to the bedroom , covered with drawn portieres . At left , a smaller door . Opposite the windows are the fireplace and mantel . A fire is burning . A grand piano is covered with a confusion of music , hats , clothes , etc . Towards the centre are a couch and a table . The couch is strewn with various clothes , wigs , costumes , etc . Between the two windows is a perch on which sit , side by side , two stately scarlet macaws . Near the fire is the monkey 's cradle  --  a charming cloud of lace and pale blue satin . There are several open trunks lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all descriptions , are strewn about in the greatest disorder everywhere . The whole effect of the room is luxurious , yet filled with confusion and a sense of Bohemian life . When the curtain goes up , it is night . The gas is lit . Before the fire squats SIGNORA VANNUCCI  --  a fat , untidy old Italian woman with a moustache and long earrings , dressed very gaily , her skirts pinned up , a pair of old soiled pink satin slippers on her feet . She is telling her fortune with a pack of greasy cards , stopping every now and then to turn and stir two saucepans which are cooking over the fire . SIGNORA VANNUCCI To herself . O Dio mio ! Non imparta  --  riproviamo  --  ! She gives the saucepan a stir , shuffles , and deals . Picche ! Il nove di fiori ! Cosa ci hanno queste bestie di carte !  --  Ah ! Il fante di cuori !

She rushes at him with hand upraised . THE BELLBOY Rag-bag ! He escapes . She hastily attempts to tidy the room , closes a couple of trunks , etc . Then , singing an incredible cadenza , she puts on a scarf , sticks an ostrich feather in her hair and is admiring the result in the long mirror , when there is a knock at the door to the hall .

SIGNORA VANNUCCI Winding a great coil of spaghetti around the end of a fork and holding it in front of RITA 'S mouth . Questo pochino  --  presto ! presto ! Apri la bocca ! As RITA draws her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santo Dio ! A pause of discouragement . She and VAN TUYL look at each other and shrug their shoulders . Then a happy idea comes to the signora . Behind RITA 'S back , she gestures towards VAN TUYL , then to the spaghetti , pantomime of his sitting at table opposite RITA , and eating and drinking . He smiles and nods . CORNELIUS To RITA .

Then , seeing she has not followed his example . What 's the matter ? Do n't they tempt you ? p. 176 CAVALLINI Holding her glass .

Of Patti ? Me  --  ? Very scornfully . My Lord ! CORNELIUS Caressing her hair . Then why bother ? Think of Millefleurs and how we loved it on those nights in May !

CORNELIUS Yes , and I 'll tell you what it is . You 've got to pull yourself together , to raise your head and say , " I 've been foolish in my time  --  but that 's all over . From now on I 'm going to be strong . I 'm going to turn the rest of my life into a splendid noble thing . I wo n't stop till I 'm the sort of woman Tom would be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORNELIUS With sudden tenderness . I know it 's hard , my darling , but that 's no reason why you should give up . Why , it 's your prize , your chance  --  the power to turn this dreadful business into something radiant and true  --  the final gift Tom 's put into your hands ! CAVALLINI Clasping her hands . Ah , Dio mio  --  CORNELIUS Going on . Be brave ! live gloriously ! And if responsibility 's the price of love , love 's worth it . Is n't it , my dear ? A pause. p. 179 CAVALLINI You are right . But oh , my frien '  --  my frien '  --  what ' ave I done  --  what ' ave I done dat all dis come to me  --  ? She bursts into agonized tears and throws herself on the couch , sobbing bitterly . CORNELIUS Putting his hand on her shaking shoulder . My dear , I 'm proud of you . There is a knock at the door to the hall . They both turn . A moment 's silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  ? CORNELIUS Go and open it . CAVALLINI Going to door . Who is dere ? THE BELLBOY Outside . It 's me , ma'am . There 's a gent downstairs t ' see ye . CAVALLINI Vhat  --  ? She opens the door a crack . THE BELLBOY They told him it was awful late an ' you was tired , but he would n't go an ' made ' em send up this . He sticks in his arm with a tray , on which is a note . RITA takes it , looks at it , then opens it quickly and takes out a card , which she reads p. 180 CORNELIUS Watching her face . It 's Tom ? CAVALLINI Nodding . Yes . CORNELIUS In a low voice . What does he want ? CAVALLINI Reading . " I mus ' see you . It is life or death . " Looking up . Dat 's all . CORNELIUS What are you going to do ? CAVALLINI I will say " no . " She turns towards the door . CORNELIUS Wait ! CAVALLINI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never look into ' is eyes again . CORNELIUS Perhaps this is the last time you two will ever meet . Be merciful . Do n't leave the poor boy with the memory of this afternoon . Give him the chance of seeing you as you are . Give him the joy of knowing what he 's done for you . CAVALLINI Nervously . Please don ' ask me  --  no  --  I do not dare  --  CORNELIUS Be a brave child ! Let me send for him ! CAVALLINI No  --  not to-night  --  p. 181 CORNELIUS This very minute . Going to the door . Ask the gentleman to come upstairs . THE BELLBOY All right , sir . He closes the door . VAN TUYL turns to find his coat , hat and stick . CAVALLINI Terrified . You are not going ! CORNELIUS He must n't find me here . CAVALLINI Trembling and clinging to him . Ah , don ' leave me  --  please  --  I am afraid  --  CORNELIUS Afraid  --  when you can help him ? I thought you loved him , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her his hand . Good-bye . CAVALLINI Taking his hand . Good-bye . CORNELIUS Still holding hers . Do you forgive me , Rita ? CAVALLINI For what ? CORNELIUS Wistfully . For everything . With a little gasp she lifts his hand and touches it to her lips . CORNELIUS Deeply moved as he suddenly gathers her in his arms . My darling  --  ! Beautiful  --  ! Joy of men  --  ! p. 182 CAVALLINI Brokenly . Oh , my good frien '  --  She buries her face on his shoulder . CORNELIUS With infinite tenderness . Little bird  --  ! I shall hear your singing in my heart forever , and I thank you from the bottom of my soul ! He bends over and softly kisses her hair . Then , quickly and sharply , turns and goes out the other door . RITA is left alone . She looks after him for a moment , then runs to the window and opens it . Outside the gleam and swirl of falling snow can be seen . She stands there , one hand to her throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hall . She closes the window and turns . The knock is repeated , more loudly . She tries to speak , but can not . The knock is heard a third time . She controls herself with a great effort . CAVALLINI Come ! The door opens and TOM appears . He closes the door and stands with his back against it , looking at her . He is quite white , his hair dishevelled , his eyes wild . He is without overcoat or gloves  --  the snow is still on his shoulders , his hands are red with cold . His voice is strange . He moves and talks as though devoured by some inward flame . During the entire scene he rarely , if ever , takes his eyes away from her . p. 183 CAVALLINI With difficulty . You  --  you vant to  --  see me ? ARMSTRONG Yes . They look at each other , breathing deeply . CAVALLINI Unsteadily . Vell ? ARMSTRONG Just wait . I  --  I 'm sort of cold . CAVALLINI Her manner changing at once .

CAVALLINI Vhat for you come out on a night so bad ? An ' , if you mus ' , vit'out dat beeg t'ick coat ? ARMSTRONG Looking down at himself . My coat ? I suppose I  --  I forgot to put it on . CAVALLINI Forget  --  ! With an exclamation . Madonna ! p. 184 ARMSTRONG Again staring at her . I was thinking about something else . About you . I was praying for you in the twilight  --  in the evening  --  in the black and dark night  --  CAVALLINI Oh , Meestair Tom ! ARMSTRONG Continuing . I walked and prayed . And in my prayers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost one offering herself , I thought . But when I looked down at the red mouth under the veil and the tawdry bonnet , my head swam . It was you ! CAVALLINI Amazed . Me  --  ? ARMSTRONG I heard you crying as I ran away . And I ran and ran  --  I do n't know where  --  till I saw some lights and people . And then a little beggar , playing on the curb , held up her hand . And when I gave her a penny , she thanked me  --  with your voice . CAVALLINI No  --  no  --  you vere meestake  --  ARMSTRONG Of course ! And then I saw you walking by me in the streets and looking at me out of windows  --  hundreds of different women , but every one was you . I could n't move  --  you were so thick and close . And it began snowing , and I thanked God , because that would blot you from my sight . But no ! Each snowflake was a tiny face . Your face . Some crowned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible , some sad and young . Some with your sweet lips parted and your cheeks all wet with tears . And you came and came and kept on coming . Thousands and millions of you , driving and swirling in your devil 's dance by the glare of the gas-light on the corner . And not one spoke . You all just looked at me as if you wanted something  --  imploring  --  longing with your beautiful dumb eyes . And suddenly I knew ! You were begging me to bring your soul to God before it was too late ! And I called to you  --  I cried out that I would ! And then you smiled and vanished , and I came here though the storm . p. 185 CAVALLINI Clasping her hands . You poor , poor boy  --  ARMSTRONG It 's different now . Of course you understand . With emphasis . As man and woman , we 've done with one another . Everything like that is over and forgotten  --  seared away . But I am still a minister of God 's word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAVALLINI Tenderly . Ah , don ' talk dat vay ! But come  --  seet ' ere ! You are all shaking  --  see ! you vill catch col ' ! She tries to make him sit by fire . ARMSTRONG Paying no attention . Do you know you 're standing on the brink of life or death ? You must choose between them . CAVALLINI Trying to calm him . Yes , yes  --  anodder time . ARMSTRONG No , not another time ! Tonight ! This very minute ! Now ! CAVALLINI In deep distress . Oh , vhy you come ? ARMSTRONG To save you , dear . Now listen ! At midnight I must lead my clergy through the streets . You know , my plan to gather in the vagrants for my New Year Service . And tomorrow you go away . So this is my hour  --  my hour of hours ! And I 'll never leave you till you 've given me your soul ! p. 186 CAVALLINI Ah , if you only knew ' ow  --  ARMSTRONG Interrupting and holding up his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  above us  --  in this very room ?

A pause . CAVALLINI I ear de vind blow , an my eart ' beat . Dat is all . ARMSTRONG It 's here ! I feel it ! Ecstatically . Oh , dear God ! Dear God ! You 're giving me the strength to conquer her ! CAVALLINI Anxiously . Conquair  --  ? Suddenly . You vant to ' urt me ! ah , do n't ' urt me  --  please ! ARMSTRONG Turning to her and speaking with sudden tenderness . My dear , I would n't hurt you for the world . It 's love I 'm offering you  --  As she makes a quick movement.  --  no , wait , my poor child . Not the sick passion of those luxurious beasts . Not even the great pity I once knew . Not theirs , not mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ! p. 187 CAVALLINI God 's love  --  ? ARMSTRONG Yes , darling , His . The mighty tenderness that moves the stars , and understands when little children pray . It 's ours forever ! In sudden anxiety . Do you realize the meaning of that word ? CAVALLINI Sadly . Your keess ' ave teach me . ARMSTRONG Always staring at her . Little lost soul , I am ready to carry you home ! Little tired heart , eager for joy ! Follow me and find it in His arms ! CAVALLINI Vhat you mean ? ARMSTRONG Though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be white as snow . For you come out of great tribulation and have washed your robes in the blood of the Lamb  --  CAVALLINI Vhat is it  --  what you say ? ARMSTRONG More and more moved .

No  --  no  --  dat is imposs'ble  --  ARMSTRONG His eyes gleaming . Do n't you hear the midnight cry  --  " Behold ! the Bridegroom cometh ! Go ye out to meet him ! " Do n't you see Him , coming from the wilderness like a pillar of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense ? His eyes are as a flame of fire , on his head are many crowns . He wears a garment dipped in blood and on it a name is written  --  Lord of Lords and King of Kings ! Hark ! He is outside , knocking at your door ! O Rose of Sharon  --  Lily of the Valley !

So that 's it , is it ? So you 're proud ! You think you can close your soul against the Lamb !

It 's you who 've taught me !

His face is buried in his hands . There is a pause . Then , in the distance , sounds the first note of the midnight bell . As it continues , a choir of men 's voices  --  sturdy and sweet  --  strikes up far away . It gradually comes nearer . They are singing the old Lutheran hymn " Ein Feste Berg . " As TOM hears them he rises unsteadily to his feet . He passes his hand over his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMSTRONG In his natural voice , very formal and polite , but a little constrained . I beg your pardon  --  I must take my leave  --  As he looks about for his hat . My church  --  the choir  --  procession  --  join them as they reach the Avenue  --  my apologies  --  disturbing you at such an hour  --  CAVALLINI Her eyes closed , crossing herself and murmuring almost inaudibly . Ave Maria gratia plena  --  Sancta Maria Mater Dei  --  ARMSTRONG At the door . I beg you to accept  --  very best wishes  --  coming year  --  my  --  my  --  good  --  night  --  good-bye  --  CAVALLINI As before.  --  ora pro nobis peccatoribus nunc et in hora mortis  --  He is gone . Only her praying figure remains . The hymn swells to triumph as the lights fade . The scene is in darkness . For a moment the noise of the chimes and bells continues . Then it gradually dies away . The singing voices are no longer heard . A little band is playing the hymn . It is almost grotesque  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this music and the fading sound of the bells , the lights gradually appear . They reveal the scene set for the Epilogue. @x SCENE : The BISHOP 'S library again . The BISHOP is sitting in the red glow of the dying fire , finishing his story . His grandson is at his feet . Outside are heard the last echoes of the bells and whistles . The little street band is still playing " Ein Feste Berg "  --  a lamentable performance . BISHOP ARMSTRONG . And that 's how I remember her  --  standing there with her hair loosened and her eyes shut . She crossed herself . I think now she was praying . And the next thing I knew I was on the sidewalk and my choir  --  God bless ' em !  --  were swinging round the corner of Tenth Street , marching like soldiers to the same tune those wretched Germans are murdering outside there now  --  As they strike a particularly distressing dissonance . Ah  --  ! Really , that 's too much ! Give them a quarter , Harry , and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes to the window . " Ein Feste Berg "  --  ! How well we used to sing it at St. Giles '  --  ! He smiles and shakes his head . HARRY Throwing up the window and calling . Hi  --  you ! That 'll be enough for to-night ! Catch ! He throws out a coin . The music stops . There is silence , save for a few far-off horns . p. 206 BISHOP ARMSTRONG Rousing himself as HARRY returns and putting the dead violets and the handkerchief in his pocket . So that 's what I wanted to tell you , my boy ! I came home that night a different  --  and I think a better man . It was the following June that your dear grandmother and I were married . Mr. Van Tuyl came all the way from Madrid just to be there and to give his niece away . They 're fine people  --  the Van Tuyls . But your grandmother was the finest of them all . She understood the world and loved it , too . She made my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY Boyishly . And  --  Madame Cavallini ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Still looking in the fire and smiling . She became even more famous before her retirement . But , of course , you know . HARRY Where is she now ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Now ? I 'm not sure , but I believe she 's in Italy somewhere  --  living rather quietly . Wistfully . She and Patti are the only ones left . A wonderful career , my boy . A very great artist . I never saw her again . HARRY Patting his arm awkwardly . I think you 're just a corker ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Smiling. p. 207 Nonsense ! But now I hope you understand I have n't quite forgotten what it feels like to be young . And although it 's true I always read the Evening Post , I still can sympathize  --  and even presume to offer some occasional advice ! HARRY I know , and I appreciate it . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Very solemnly . My dear , dear boy , unless your love is big enough to forget the whole world and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl your wife . A pause . HARRY Rising abruptly . Grandfather , I 've been an ass ! He puts his hands in his pockets and walks away . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Whimsically , as he wipes his glasses . I suppose you have , Harry  --  I suppose you have . HARRY Turning back again . I 've been an ass to hesitate one single minute ! However , it 's all right now . Your story 's settled it . Lucille and I are going to get married as soon as ever we can . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Thoroughly startled . God bless my soul ! But that is n't why I told it to you ! I wanted to get this nonsense out of your silly young head ! HARRY Laughing affectionately as he stands behind the BISHOP 'S chair and pats his shoulders. p. 208 Never mind ! You did something quite different and it 's too late now to change  --  Suddenly . By the way , have you any engagement for to-morrow afternoon ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Still flustered . I  --  I ca n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mind if we make one now ? I want you to marry Lucille and me . How about four-thirty to-morrow ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Gasping . Four-thirty  --  ? HARRY At the door , shyly . I do n't know how to say it , grandpa , but  --  but Lucille and I  --  well , we 'll be grateful all our lives for what you 've done for us to-night . He goes out quickly , his head bent . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Well ! Well ! I declare ! He takes out his spotless handkerchief and passes it nervously over his brow . The door opens and SUZETTE appears , smiling brightly . SUZETTE Standing at the door . Happy New Year , grandpa ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Happy New Year , my dear ! SUZETTE Coming to his chair. p. 209 Well  --  ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Suzette , I want you to order some white flowers and some black wedding-cake  --  SUZETTE With a wriggle of delight . Oh  --  ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Finishing . For to-morrow afternoon  --  four-thirty , I believe . SUZETTE Flinging her arms around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't kiss me in the ear ! SUZETTE Triumphantly . I just knew Harry could get around you ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Drily . Oh , did you ? Well , then , now that you two have arranged everything to suit yourselves , would you please finish reading me my paper and then go to bed ? He leans back comfortably and closes his eyes . SUZETTE Going to the desk . Where is it ? Oh , yes ! Wait till I turn on the lamp  --  She does so , sits down , sighs , and unfolds the " Post . " BISHOP ARMSTRONG Is there any foreign news ? SUZETTE Carelessly. p. 210 Oh , just some uprising in Portugal  --  a new Chinese loan  --  Turning the page . Why , Cavallini 's dead ! I thought she died a long time ago , did n't you ? She reads to herself . A slight pause . BISHOP ARMSTRONG What does  --  it say ? SUZETTE Oh , it 's just a cable . Reading . " Milan  --  December 30 . Mme. Margherita Cavallini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Como . " BISHOP ARMSTRONG Is that  --  all ? SUZETTE That 's all the dispatch . There 's a whole column of biography stuck on underneath . Shall I read it ? Suddenly . Oh , of course ! I forgot ! She and Patti were your two great operatic crushes , were n't they ? Well , she was born at Venice in 1841 . That makes her  --  Looking up thoughtfully . Let me see  --  BISHOP ARMSTRONG Do n't tell me how old she was ! SUZETTE Smiling . All right . Running her eyes down the column . Dbut at Milan in 1859  --  Forze della Destine . I never heard of it , did you ? Sang prima donna rles at the Italian Opera in Paris under the direction of Rossini  --  brilliant figure during the last years of the Empire  --  success in London  --  hm !  --  brought to this country first by Strakosch  --  appeared as Mignon at the Academy of Music  --  Looking up. p. 211 Everyone went mad over her , did n't they ?

" Anglican Con- gress at Detroit  --  City Chosen for June Conference  --  Federation of Churches  --  Further Plans . " Bored . Oh dear ! There 's the old Conference again ! She yawns and looking up , notices that the BISHOP 'S head has fallen . Sleepy , grandpa ? BISHOP ARMSTRONG Rousing himself . I  --  ? No , my dear , I was just thinking  --  that 's all . SUZETTE With affectionate impudence . I do n't believe it ! Yawning . Well , I am , anyway . May I go to bed now ? There 's so much to do to-morrow  --  and I think I 've finished everything in this . She puts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , of course . SUZETTE As she alights like a bird on the arm of his chair and kisses the top of his head. p. 212 Oh , grandpa , you are such an old darling ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Thank you , my dear . SUZETTE At door . And please do n't sit up too late , will you ? And do n't forget to turn off all the lights before you come upstairs ! BISHOP ARMSTRONG Meekly . I 'll do my best . SUZETTE Grandpa  --  ! He turns in his chair . She smiles and blows him a kiss . I love you ! She runs out . BISHOP ARMSTRONG Calling after . The same to you , my dear . Good-night . He sits alone for a moment in silence , then , rising slowly , he closes the door and listens . There is no sound . Almost stealthily he goes over to the case where the phonograph records are kept , puts on his glasses , and looks over those lying on the top . Finally he selects one with much care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it going . Then , switching off the lights , he returns to his armchair by the fire . The red glow from the coals lights up his face . He carefully takes from his inside pocket the dead violets and the woman 's handkerchief . Looking at them , he smiles a tender little ghost of a smile and slowly sits down . The rich voice thrills through the darkness . p. 213
