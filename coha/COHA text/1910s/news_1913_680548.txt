txt There has been considerable disappointment over the failure of the shares of the Anaconda Copper Co. and Amalgamated Copper Co. to respond to the good Copper Producers ' statement . Anaconda Copper directors meet some time next month to take action on the dividend and no change in the rate is expected . As a matter of fact Anatonda Copper since the first of the year has not reported earnings large enough to warrant an increase in the $3 annual rate . Since January 1 the company has been producing at the rate of about 260,000,000 pounds of copper a year comparing with 294,000,000 pounds hi /912 . Due to lower prices of topper and curtailed production the net profits of Anaconda for the first six months of this year are not expected to show anything to speak of in excess of dividend payments . As Amalgamated Copper Co. receives practically all of its income from Anaconda no change in the former 's dividend rate is looked for at the next meeting .               @ @ @ @ @ @
