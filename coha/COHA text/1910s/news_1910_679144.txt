txt THE TARIFF BOARD . Roosevelt 's Idea Shows Weak Point In Campaign Literature . I was glad to see , in your editorial article of to-day " At Ozawatomie " that you had noted the difference between Mr. Roosevelt 's idea of a tariff commission and the so-called Tariff Board organized under Section 2 of the Administrative act of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff . The latter body has no real power , and was deliberately reduced by the Senate to " persons " to be employed by the President to assist him in the administration of the " maximum and minimum " clause of the bill , and the officers of the Customs in the administration of the law . The " persons " have no power to send for books or subpoena persons or to report to Congress .. Mr. Roosevelt clearly recognizes the situation by saying : " To this end there must be an expert tariff commission , " entirely ignoring the so-called board , as not covering the requirements of such an investigation as proposed . Yet this board ( not so-called in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a genuine commission through which a " scientific revision " of the PayneAldrich bill may be attained , . A real commission would have power only to recommend to Congress ; this board has not even that authority . Congress alone can reduce National taxes , and a failure to do so should be followed 1 by a retirement of the offending members and the rn election of others pledged to a speedy and genuine reform .
