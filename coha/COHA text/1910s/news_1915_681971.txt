txt No one would accuse the New York World of jingoand the follov ing extract from its editorial columns is the more striking : " President Wilson has given to the German government since its submarine decree last February every upssible opportunity to adjust its methods of warfare to American rights and to the elementary laws of humanity . He has been considerate , he has been courteous , he has been patient . he has been broad-minded. he has been just and he has been generous ; but to what purpose ? Germany has pursued toward the United States the same devious and crooked course that has always given Prussian diplomacy its evil reputation , and unless we are contented to feed on lies we must go unsatisfied . " These are strong words . and the World is a strong newspaper . in the best sense of the term . But it misses the weakness of the President 's position . and the reason why German diplomacy has been encouraged to play fast and loose with pledges . When the submarine policy was announced in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country would hold Germany to " strict accountability " for the consequences . As Frank H. Simonds pertinently points out in the Tribune of September 14. this .. as saying the last thing first . It not only conveyed a distinct pledge to regent by action an infringement of the rights of our citizens on the high seas . It made us by implication defenders of the rights of all neutrals . Three months afterwards , following a series of minor incidents challenging the sincerity of the State Depart ? merit , the Lusitania was sunk . There had been nothing tentative about the State Department 's note in February . German diplomacy naturally assumed that it was a bluff , that words would not be supported by action , and that the exchange of meaningless notes and half pledges , only made to be broken or repudiated , might continue indefinitely .
