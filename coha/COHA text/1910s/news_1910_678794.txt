txt Through a statement issued yesterday by Edgar L , Marsten , banker , as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church , which John D. Rockefeller attends , it became known that there has been some contention over the plans for the new $350,000 edifice which the congregation is to erect . Although the architectural firm of Butler &; Rodman drew plans , which were approved by the Building Committee , as provided in the contract , and were indorsed by the expert engaged to pass upon them , the Trustees rejected the plans and gave the award to William Welles Bosworth , a competing architect . Butler &; Rodman contended , in taking the matter up with the Trustees recently , that they were entitled to the Contract , and indicated that , if they desired , they might sue the Trustees to recover the amount which would be due them if the church were erected under their design . The architects decided not to sue , how . ever , and the whole matter was patched up when Mr. Marsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give out his statement explaining the reasons why the contract was awarded to the rival bidder . Mr. Marsten 's statement was : The archithect expert , Mr. IL V. Magonigle. who was selected by a vote of- the competitors to judge the drawings in the competition for the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church . recommended the design No. 3 ( submitted by Messrs . Butler &; Rodman ) to the Building Committee , who , in turn , recommended It unanimously to the Board of Trustees . They , however , moved by the suggestions and criticisms of Dr. Frederick A. Aked , the pastor , as to the requirements of the church , felt a preference for Design No. 4 , ( submitted by William Welles Bosworth. ) and after consulting Mr. Thomas Hastings , the professional adviser , appointed the author of plan No. 4 as architect of the building . An effort made yesterday to learn in what particular Dr. Aked objected to the design of Butler &; Rodman elicited the infarmation that the architects had not provided for a pastor 's study in the church and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared , did take in the study . In the original programme issued by the church Trustees indicating what kind of edifice they wanted there was no mention of a study and Messrs . Butler &; Rodman , in talking yesterday about the action of the Trustees . declared that , had they been informed of , any desire to haver study , It could have been- . -asily -- -arPaziged in their. plans , for a very slight alteration would have been necessary . The church Trustees , in announcing last Fall their idea to have a new Church , called for designs from six firms of architects . They stipulated that the cost of the church was not to exceed $350,000 and that the competing architects were to receive $400 each whether or not their designs were accepted . The successful architect was to receive 6 per cent . of the total contract price . As Butler &; Rodman had made plans for a church costing 1 the entire $350,000 , they gave up a claim , upon $:21,000 when they decided not to sue 1 the church . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause under which Butler &; Rodman say they could hold the church , if they desired , to accept their design . This clause read : The competition is being conducted under the professional advice of Mr. Thomas Hastings . who will assist the Building Committee in selecting the design . This design will be recommended by the Building Committee to the church trustees , with the understanding that the author thereof will be employed to execute the work , and his compensation to be fixed in accordance with the schedule of the minimum professional charges of the American Institute of Architects . The Trustees ' programme called for a church which should be " distinctively characteristic of its purpose and so designed that it will be easily recognized from Fifth Avenue . and should not be set back and partially concealed , as is the case with the present building . " When the design of Butler &; Rodman was submitted six weeks ago , it at once met with the approval of Mr. Magonigle , who had succeeded Mr. Hastings as the expert to act With the Trustees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected that they would soon be ordered to go ahead with the construction . Instead they were surprised to find objection coming from Dr. Aked , followed shortly afterward by word that the design of Mr. Bosworth had been accepted . The architects Insisted on an explanation by the Trustees that would clearly set forth the reasons why that action had been , taken . It was as a result of this that Mr. Marsten 's statement was issued yesterday . MRS . SOL . SMITH HURT . Aged Member of New Theatre Staff In an Auto Crash . Mrs. Sol Smith , a member of the New Theatre company , was seriously hurt in a taxicab collision at Broadway and Sixty-first Street at midnight last night , after leaving The New Theatre , at Sixtythird Street and Central Park West , for her home , 250 West Eighty-fourth Street . A chauffeur , according to the police , was responsible for the accident . Mrs. Smith , who will be 80 years old next March , attended the premiere of " Twelfth Night " at The New Theatre with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women 's League . She occupied a place in the " company box , " and in the evening held an informal recewtion for her professional friends . She left the theatre at 12:45 o'clock with her daughter and a friend , James S. Goodman . of 157 East Seventythird Street . all three entering a taxicab ' driven by John Dunn of 2,249 Seventh Avenue . Dunn started to drive south instead of north , and had reached Columbus Circle before the party - was aware of it . He was then told he was going in the wrong direction , and immediately swung his machine . around into Broadway and started uptown on the wrong side of the street , at a high rate of speed . At Sixty-first Street he crashed head-on into a southbound automobile owned by Roger Moore of 104 West 101st Street . The crash brought both machines upstanding ; well jammed into each other . All of the party were thrown from their seats . Mrs. Smith was thrown forward with such violance that her scalp was gashed and she received several contusions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . With the aid of onlookers Mrs. Smith , unconscious , was carried back to The New Theatre and put on a couch in the office of Director Winthrop Ames where she was attended by a physician . On account of Mrs. Smith 's advanced age the shock of the accident is considered likely to prove serious , although her wounds would not be severe in a younger person . At her home at an early hour today it was said she was resting easily .
