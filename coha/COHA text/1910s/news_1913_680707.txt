txt There were indications here last night that Harry Thaw might turn up at his mother 's Summer home , Elmhurst , near Cresson , Penn . Whether Thaw had received assurances that he would be safe from arrest in Pennsylvania could not be ascertained , but in a letter which his mother received from him Yesterday morning he said he intended to take a rest before going to Elmhurst , " and dispatches from Pittsburgh quoted Roger O'Mara , the detective who looks after Thaw 's interests , as saying that he would not be surprised to see That ' in Pittsburgh any day . Mrs. Mary Copley Thaw intends to return to Elmhurst to-day and will be joined in a few days by Mr. and Mrs. George Lander Carnegie , her son-in-law and daughter . The letter which Mrs. Thaw received from her s'On yesterday was as follows : Night letter , 50 words , 25 cents . Mrs. William Thaw , Hotel Gotham , New York , N. Y. All.1% ? ell . Shall take a rest before coming to Elmhurst , as I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet do not care to make any statements . Hope M. and G. arrived safe and you will go home together . Have sent a short note to Journal . H. K. T. The fact that the letter was postmarked New York City , Station 0 , which is at 112 West Eighteenth Street , indicated that Thaw intrusted it to some one who came to this city after his escape . From the superscription , " Night letter , fifty words , twenty-five , cents , " it Is presumed that Thaw at ! first had intended to communicate with his mother by telegraph , but decided afterward that it would be wiser to have the note mailed , for fear of affording some clue as to his whereabouts . Dr. Evans May Have Seen Thaw . It Is believed that since his escape Thaw hate communicated with Dr. Britton D. Evans , Superintendent of the Morris Plains ( N , J. ) Insane Asylum , who was Thaw 's principal alienist in the two murder trials , and that Dr. Evans not only knows where Thaw is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conference with Mrs. Thaw for two hours last night at the Hotel Gotham . Dr. Evans , it was learned , had not Keen sent for by Mrs. Thaw , but had sought the interview , having talked to her by telephone at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon . After leaving Mrs. Thaw last night he said , in answer to questions put to him by a reporter : know several things that I know you want to know , too , but I am not going to tell you . " When asked whether he had been in communication with Thaw since the escape , Dr. Evans hesitated a moment and then replied that he thought that was a personal matter which really did not concern the public . When pressed for a more speciifc answer , he said that he neither would affirm nor deny having had word from Thaw , but his manner conveyed the impression that he had . Again , Dr. Evans neither would affirm nor deny that he knew of Thaw 's present whereabouts , nor did he , Dr. Evans dodged by saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect to find him there when I get back . But Harry Thaw would be a Perfectly welcome guest at my home . I have a spacious apartment , and he would be . welcome to share it with my family and commune with us , in perfect safety to them , I know . Insists Thaw . is Sane . The question is not whether Thaw was insane when he shot Stanford White , but whether he is insane now . Hary Thaw has not paranoia now , and he never did have paranoia . Personally , -I believe that he was insane at the moment when he shot Stanford White , but he did not have paranoia , and I am convinced that he is perfectly sane now . " The alienist would not deny that he had advised Mrs. Thaw to have her son seek refuge in some particular Stale . He did say that he would not accompany Mrs. Thaw to Elmhurst ; he also was certain that he did not expect to become an attendant to Harry Thaw . " Thaw does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Dr. Evans . " I think the boy will take care of himself , and get along all right . I 've discharged ( 100 ' persons like him in my time , and all of them are useful citizens now , some of them making more money than I am . " Dr. Evans admitted that he had told Mrs. Thaw it was his opinion that Thaw was perfectly safe from extradition , if he had succeeded in slipping out of New York State . And I am confident that he has , " he added . " As for . this extradition business , I have tried to extradite hundreds of cases , and always unsuccessfully . In any other State , Thaw is perfectly safe ; he would be as safe in New Jersey as in New Zealand . 1 am confident that he is not in New York State , anT that would be the only thing to worry about . To be sure , he might be taken into custody in some other State . but only if his actions were such as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proved too be insane . In order to be placed in an asylum in that State . His status in New York would have no bearing on the ease . " It was suggested to Dr. Evans that Thaw , in view of his close relations with the alienist , might go to New Jersey and have a friendly suit brought to establish his sanity , and the doctor was asked what tribunal would pass upon the case in such an event . " There is a.DePartment of Charities over there , and in my district my word would go a long way , " said Dr. Evans with a smile . Earlier in the evening Mrs. Thaw . accompanied by another woman , left the hotel in an automobile and visited her family physician , Dr. Valdemar Sillo of 353 West Fifty-seventh Street . She then went to the Hotel Plaza , where she remained only a few minutes , finally returning to the Gothatn. " - Dr .. said Mrs ; . Thaw 's visit had nothing to do with Harry Thaw , but Purely concerned her own health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's escape , was certain that the letter had been written by Thaw , and was inclined to believe that he had scribbled it in the course of his wild dash In an automobile . Thaw : Cot in This City . " I do n't believe that Harry is in New York City , " Mrs. Thaw said before ' showing the note . " But he says he Is well . You know I am happy and glad that Harry is away from the asylum . It was a. neat job and a complete job . " The letter , written in pencil , was inclosed in an envelope which did not match the paper , and was addressed in a sprawling hand , which did not resemble the handwriting of the letter . From the jerky nature of the handwriting Mrs. Thaw assumed that her son , while speeding from Matteawan , discovered the sheet of paper in his pocket , and that tile idea occurre0-to him of using it to r ( assure his mother that all ; was well . She seemed to derive much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled as she pointed to them . " It means that Harry is all right , " she said . " The ' M.

It was mailed in New York City last night . I got it this morning at breakfast time . It says what it says . " I was going to visit Harry to-day . That is why I am here in New York . Apparently I wo n't have to make the trip . My ! but it 's hot here . I shall be mighty glad to get back to Elmhurst to-morrow , when I leave here . . Mrs. Thaw announced her intention of consulting an attorney regarding the Practicability and advisability of her son visiting Elmhurst , adding : " Elmhurst is in Pennsylvania , and have been informed that Harry can not be touched outside this State , that is. unless the authorities of that State take a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all doubt , however , I will consult with men in the legal Professidn .

The train is due to arrive at Cresson at 5:22 o'clock In the afternoon . The brief letter was believed to have been the only communication which Mrs. Thaw had received from her son up to a late hour last night . All questons regarding her conjectures as to Thaw 's future plans she parried with a gesture of the hands which indicated complete ignorance . John B.
