The Filipinos may be a bad lot . They may have no sense of gratitude , no political decency ; and may be without fairness or honor in controversy . But we are bound to say that the worst of them shine by comparison with the American public men and the mob of our Republican newspapers that have seized upon the seditious incident at Manila to make a railing attack upon the whole Filipino people . Aha ! the cry is , now you see that we were right when we said that they were a set of savages , no more fit to rule themselves than so many Apaches . And as for our ineffably silly President , notice what he has brought about by his idiotic Jones bill promising the Filipinos independence . Precipitated a revolutionary outbreak , that 's what he has done . Anyhow , the nonsense has ended now , and we 'll hold the islands under stern military rule long after all these incompetent and unpatriotic Democrats are dead . The infinite meanness of all this is deepened by its cool disregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinos and score a point against the Administration , these Republican assailants are like a Moro jurado running amuck . They simply lower their heads and strike out right and left , not stopping to ask whether they are hitting friend or foe . Their one great assertion is that this petty insurrectionary disturbance , which was put down by the police alone , is the direct result of the pushing of the Jones bill in Congress . Except for that , this man Ricarte , aspiring to be a second Rizal or Aguinaldo , would never have plucked up courage to undertake his machinations . A little thing like the historic fact does not bother them or restrain them in the least . Governor-General Harrison , in reporting the affair , which he describes as trifling , declares that Ricarte has been carrying on his revolutionary propaganda in Hongkong " for several years . " It seems , then , that he did n't wait for Jones to give the signal ! And if it be said that Governor Harrison is prejudiced , or compelled to do a little official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter , of Dean Worcester . This former Secretary of the Interior in the Philippines , under a Republican Administration , has an interview in the New York Tribune which could scarcely have been read by the writer of the ramping editorial about the " Sedition-Coddling Jones Bill " in the same paper . Dean Worcester quietly explains that it is absurd to attribute any serious importance to the methods or manoeuvres of Ricarte . He himself was long ago familiar with them . Ricarte " has tried repeatedly to cause trouble in the country , but never was successful . " And Mr. Worcester is emphatic in his opinion that none of Ricarte 's dupes or tools can give any real anxiety to the authorities . The whole thinghas been for years thoroughly understood , and is regarded in Manila as farcical . Dean Worcester adds , with a great good sense , that all such stories ought to be " scrutinized with special care " at a time when the Jones bill is pending . Turning the argument neatly against the editor of the Tribune and his fellow-flagellants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill who might start them such stories to influence public opinion . " It is not necessary to say that this sudden outcry against the Filipinos , upon so flimsy a basis , and against the Philippine policy of the Administration , is political in its motive . The trail of that serpent is conspicuously over it all . To so partisan an attack , no one would object provided it were made in a way not to degrade its authors and lower the country in the eyes of the world . Go ahead , gentlemen , in your mere party assaults upon President Wilson , to your heart 's content . Make him out an imbecile . Reduce his policies to pulp . But do give a thought to the effect upon the outside world of all your abuse of the Filipinos , and your apparent willingness to have this country treat them in the roughest spirit of the military conqueror and aggressor . You ca n't help being partisan , but ca n't you throw a veil of decency over your partisanship ? Your object is to discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way not to discredit the American people , by making it appear that they are ready , with you , to be meaner than the meanest Filipino ? It is not worth while to dwell upon the reasoning of this new outburst against the Filipinos . The Ricarte fiasco is said to prove them incapable of self-government . Even if the affair had been formidable , instead of a fizzle , it would not have proved that . The doings of the Clan-na-Gael were not a demonstration that the Irish were not fit for Home Rule  --  though there have been many Tory Englishmen , like these Tory Americans of ours , to affirm that they were . Home Rule for Ireland came on nevertheless . But it is the wretched spirit and the grossly ill-timed character of this new denial of the rights of the Filipinos to aspire to possess and govern their own land , which most affront . Here we are at a time when the feel ings of the world are peculiarly sensitive on the subject of small nations , and their brutal treatment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and predicting that the end of the war will bring a great change in the attitude of the bigger Powers towards dependent peoples ; and this is the juncture chosen by American Imperialists of the baser sort to make a new assertion of their high and mighty intentions regarding the Philippines . That this writes them down for what they are Is their own affair , and does not matter . But that they are in the act defiling , so far as they are able , the good name of the United States , is really the disgraceful and repulsive thing . We devoutly hope they will quit it . " THINKING , " GERMAN AND OTHER . Maximilian Harden , in his Berlin newspaper , the Zukunft , has had the courage to tell his countrymen the real reason why the opinion of neutral nations bears so strongly against Germany . It is not , he says , that " they are not told the truth . " In admitting this , Harden abandons as hopeless the whole German propaganda abroad , especially in the United States . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon lies , and that as soon as Germany should be able to get her case before them , they would at once change their mind . This was the theory of campaign of the German professors , of the individuals and the associations in Germany that began to flood the American mail with letters and publications , and of the various Germans who , officially or otherwise , have undertaken the defence of the . German cause in this country . That the whole effort has come to nothing is obvious . American opinion remains what it was . Nor was it built upon falsehood . All this mighty attempt to set us right has not produced a single fact , a single document , a single argument which was not known in the United States from the beginning . The trouble was , as Maximilian Harden now states , not that we did not have the truth , but that we were " unable to think as Germans do . " This is both frank and philosophic . It goes near to the root of the difficulty . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England dinner last week when he said that the ideals of Germany were different from those of the United States . We Americans can not bring ourselves to think , in all this matter of war , in the terms which are native to the German mind . What happens to an American when he tries to do it , is rather pathetically shown in a little pamphlet which has just reached us from Munich . It is from the pen of George Stuart Fullerton , well known as a professor of philosophy in Columbia University . He writes as " An American to Americans , " and entitles his pamphlet , " Why the German Nation has Gone to War . " Now , will it be believed that in the entire production not a solitary explanation is offered of Germany 's reasons for going to war ? All that Professor Fullerton has done is to give a sympathetic interpretation of German militarism . He knows and loves the Germans , and seeks to make it clear how it was that a peaceable , scientific , music-loving People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to become a Volk in Waffen . All this is done intelligently and interestingly , but the war itself is described merely as " inevitable . " Professor Fullerton says in so many words : I make no reference to the neutrality of Belgium , nor do I think it worth while to touch upon the question who first formally declared war on this side or on that In the light of what the world now knows , these have become wholly trivial matters . But what is all this except a demonstration of the fact that when an American sets himself to thinking about the war as the Germans do , he instantly makes negligible what to the American mind has all along been and to-day continues central and vital ? Far be it from us to set up American thinking as a model of all that is clear and straight Only , if anybody is going to tackle the job of inducing Americans to think differently about the war , he ought to start out by getting an adequate notion of what they do think , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the responsibilities for beginning it , public opinion in this country early came to a very decided verdict , and there is no evidence that it has changed or will change . The great differences of view among Americans , relating to the war , have now to do only with its conduct and with the possibility of bringing it soon to an end . On the latter point there is a great deal of thinking  --  or , at least , of talk and writing  --  which falls lamentably short of letting the mind pursue the subject to the end . It is so easy to confuse what we wish with what we have the power to do ! Of course , all Americans wish that the war might stop to-morrow . All of them would be proud and happy if there were any way in which the United States could effectively and peacefully intervene to put an end to the frightful loss of life and wrecking of civilization . But the hard facts being as they are , what is the use of raising the cry thatour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thought , it is pure emotionalism . Until a man can present a worked-through project , at once feasible and demonstrably efficacious , for protests by neutrals against the continuance of the war , he ought not to urge such a thing . It may show that his heart is full , but it will go far towards proving that his head is empty The United States Government proffered its good offices from the beginning of the war . The President assured the warring Powers that they might avail themselves of the proffer at any tune . Publicly and officially , we can at present do no more . We can not , that is , unless we desire to get into a position from which we should have to retreat ingloriously , or which would lead us to go to war ourselves . The alternative is , we do not deny , terrible to contemplate . What it is was shadowed forth last week in the statement of the French Prime Minister to Parliament . It had previously been made plain by the responsible rulers of Great Britain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to brute force , there is nothing for it but to wait till one side or the other is bled white and asks for terms . It is awful to think of this , but thinking of the other sort should have been done before the war . Not in vain did Sir Edward Grey warn the Kaiser that a refusal to seek peace by means of a European Congress would be followed by " immeasurable consequences . " What they are , we now see in all their terror . Out of them all , we may yet hope that the wrath of man will turn to the glory of God . Translated into modern thought , this means that the very denial of civilization and humanity may work out into a higher civilization and a purer humanity . If that results , we may yet come to feel of this awful war , as Lowell did of our Civil War , that it was , despite itself , a " great corrector of enormous times " ECONOMIC THOUGHT AND THE WAR . Prof. Henry C. Emery contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of which , " German Economics and the War , " does less than justice to the wide range and the significant character of his discussion of what may be called the intellectual basis of Germany 's attitude towards the world , and towards the general problem of war and peace . It is not only German economics-2 .. e , German economic doctrine  --  but German views , German habits of thought , in the domain of history andu  --  snl Lc .. cnce , that he subjects to illuminating comment . He brings out the natural operation of these intellectual causes , in connection with certain fundamental traits of the German character , in creating that state of mind which has played an essential part in paving the way to the stupendous conflict which the world is now witnessing . In the judgment of those who believe that " tout comprendre est tout pardonner , " Professor Emery 's article will go far towards absolving Germany of her guilt in bringing on . the war ; while those who consider that maxim false in theory and pernicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the considerations he brings forward . We shall not attempt to convey any idea of the content of the article as a whole ; but there is one passage in it , easy for the wayfaring man to appreciate , to which we should like to draw special attention . " For the historian or economist , " says Professor Emery , " one of the most fascinating features of the present struggle is the problem as to how far the war is the result directly of economic conditions and how far it is the result of economic teaching that holds struggle to be a necessary part of economic life . I have at times gone so far as to suggest that the war might properly be called ' the war of the economic interpretation of history . ' This means that it has been brought about as much by ideas regarding economic pressure as by any direct economic pressure itself . " As regards the deeper intellectual prepossessions , those that are more distinctly of an abstract or doctrinaire nature , the peculiar traits of the German mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the people . But in the matter of the influence of " ideas regarding economic pressure , " rather than the economic pressure itself , being the cause of national policies and national antagonisms , Germany is just like other nations . In such a country as our own , or as England , quite as much as in any other , it is constantly necessary to fight against delusions of the " manifest destiny " type in the economic field . In the early weeks of the present struggle , at the close of an editorial on the part played by protectionism in fostering the spirit that leads to war , we said ' Those who talk so glibly about economic causes being at the bottom of all the developments of history would do well to give their attention to the part which , even in the economic field , is played not by the economic causes themselves , but by the ideas which men entertain in regard to those causes If the South had known that slavery was not essential to her economic prosperity , there would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbold supposition that , if the nations of the world had been emancipated from the delusions of protectionism , the passions and prejudices which have had their part in bringing on the unspeakable horrors of the world war of to-day might never have attained the intensity that made such a calamity possible . What Professor Emery has in mind is something broader and more essential than the question of protection or free trade ; but , while German doctrinaires harp on survival , struggle for existence , and so on , the generality of Germans , when they talk about economic pressure , are thinking of matters much more nearly related to their immediate bread and butter . And it is delusions concerning international trade , incomparably more than the actual facts concerning that trade , which are with them , as with other peoples , the source of dangerous jealousies and fears . How prone even men of intellectual power are to such delusions , and how possible it is for them to get a footing even in a nation long habituated to freedom from them , was strikingly shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than a decade ago . What is most distinctive in the operation of intellectual dogmas or prepossessions upon Germans is not , however , so much the susceptibility of their minds to the influence of abstract ideas as the unqualified dominance which they - permit these ideas to have upon the actual conduct of life . Something like that kind of dominion was ultimately acquired in the South by the abstract doctrines which were gradually built up in justification of slavery ; but it would be difficult to name any other instance even distantly approaching it , in any modern people except the German . In their unbending acceptance of the supposed dictates of abstract thought there is something unquestionably admirable ; it is of a piece with that German thoroughness which has been an example to all the world , and in so many ways an example of inestimable value . But there are limits beyond which loyalty to the commands of abstract reasoning becomes disloyalty to instincts deeper and more abiding , and principles more vital to the soul 's integrity , than the teachings of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , on the moral side , become ; ruthless inhumanity ; on the intellectual side it may become sheer madness . WAR 'S REACTION ON LITERATURE . We are now in the second stage of the literary production caused by the war . The first rush of writers to the colors was inevitably hurried and confused . The poets could not keep their verses even nine days far polishing , much less could they follow the Horatian rule , and the result was necessarily crude . There was much shouting and exhorting and posturing , but very little poetry . Nor were the prose-makers much more successful . In the first weeks of the war there were great efforts to make some large utterance that might measure up somewhere near the tremendous event , and the public was eagerly on the watch for a literary genius who could express something of the might and horror of the conflict , but there was little but disappointment to record . Now , however , the poets and dramatists and masters of prose have had time to get their second wind . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war ? No one will pretend that a literary masterpiece has accompanied the roar of the cannon . We still get writing that is more curious than compelling . Some of it is highly interesting . None of it is of the sort that Clough had in mind when he summoned poets to come to make clear to the world the " inner meaning " of its experiences . In-default of this , we are left to study , rather , the strange and unexpected ways in which different writers are affected , in their thought and style of composition , by the war . Who could have predicted that it would make Barrie heavy-footed ? - Yet in his ineffective little war-play , " The Day , " he moves with " all the playful grace of a hippopotamus . " This is one more horror of war , that under its influence the whimsical , the fantastic , the lightly imaginative Barrie should have become stodgy ! On the contrary , we find that Kipling , who might have been counted upon to outdo himself in his own battle-axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story in the Century , of a delicately conceived and deftly executed bit of work . Without once mentioning the word Belgium , and paying his readers the compliment of supposing that they will know what he means without a nudge in the ribs , he gives -a very penetrating , because very restrained , impression of the pitiful misery of- bereft Belgian childhood , as reflected in the consciousness cf a kind German woman . Alongside this admirable bit by Kipling may be placed the condensed drama by Leonid Andreyev , translated by Mr. Bernstein and published in the New York Sun . Here , too , is literary art which , if war could not stimulate , it could at least not silence . All such minor and chance exceptions , however , serve ha to confirm the general conviction that the reaction of this war upon literature has not been to the latter 's benefit . Maurice Hewlett was speaking about the matter in London a few days ago , and sought to work out the principle that good writing can not , in the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an overpOwering and all-engulfing war as the piesent . He insisted upon the element of calm as essential to the poet 's endeavor to reflect life . It is " emotion remembered in tranquillity " that enters into all great poetry . And when every mind is engrossed by a pressing world-disturbance , the brOoding leisure and the attitude of soul requisite to high literary production are necessarily wanting . It is not reasonable , therefore , Mr. Hewlett argued , to look for any great poem about the war , or really masterful writing about it , until the war has long been over . Not even then will it surely come . Prof. Gilbert Murray has girded against the notion that a stirring war makes stirring literature . He has pointed out that there has never been in England a really great poem about the Armada . And the literary expression of the long Napoleonic struggle wa nothing , on the whole , for Englishmen to look back upon with pride . They had to wait almost until our own day for Thomas Hardy , in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of upheaval and striving . Our own Civil War was as far as possible from producing a literary flowering , at the time or later . Turn over the pages of an anthology of American war ballads , and with two or three exceptions , they are a pretty sorry lot , artistically . No , among the fallacies about war , none is more patent than that it directly quickens literary talent . Far in the past , after the graves are grass-grown , it may lend itself to imaginative treatment ; but at the moment it bears down too depressingly upon the writers , as upon the rest of us . Mr. Hewlett gave the poets and the dramatists who are tempted to write about the war one good piece of advice . They should not try to do too big a thing . And they should be afraid of their own facility in producing the obvious What they should seek is simplicity , a quiet sensing of one or another aspect of human suffering , a not too vainglorious rendering of national aspiration , and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children ; a " faculty of tears . " THE SCHOLAR BOOK-COLLECTOR . The death in London of Bertram Dobell , book-collector , book-seller , poet , and discoverer of rare manuscripts , recalls the liveliest passage of Dibdin 's " BibRomania . " " ' I will frankly confess , ' rejoined Lysander , ' that I am an ardent bibliomaniac  --  that I love books dearly  --  that the very sight , touch , and mere perusal ? " Hold , my friend , ' again exclaimed Philemon , ' you have - renounced your profession  --  you talk of reading books  --  do biblionianiacs ever read books ? ' " The sneer has lacked justification in the case of others than Dobell , though his is perhaps the brightest instance of the scholar-bibliomaniac . He read five hours a day ; he was the patron of the author of " The City of Dreadful Night , " who badly needed encouragement ; he identified Thomas Traherne 's works , and published them in 1906 and 1908 , interrupting the labor to bring out the poetry of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of Lamb . It may once have been true that the bibliophile who read a book was regarded as was the fox-hunter who shot a fox . We hear of men like Sir Thomas Phillips , who bought largely and seldom opened the cases his books came in ; and in general he who purchases a Shakespeare for $3,000 because it is rare gets less benefit from its pages than he who invests little with the intention to read . But the death of Dobell is a reminder of what a long line of deeply cultivated book-hunters preceded him . We speak not of those to whom collecting has been an avocation  --  and among these are queens , popes , financiers like Colbert , writers like Scott and Southey , and warriors like Prince Eugene  --  but of those to whom it was a vocation or little less . One of the list , for example , is the mighty book-hunter , Archdeacon Meadow , who went up to London in the last century to be examined by a Parliamentary committee , and returned penniless , followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a scholar in that field ripe and full . Another is John Payne Collier , long as well known in London bookshops as was his " History of English Dramatic Poetry . " HalliwellPhillips , of Shakespearean fame , was an inveterate rambler in Booksellers ' Row . We know in our own day the work done by Dowden and by Grosart , the former noted for strokes of luck , the latter as sturdily pedestrian a collector as he was a scholar . But for the great mid-century names in the list we must go to the " Confessions " of W. C. Hazlitt , descendant of the essayist and chief of cataloguers . For years he worked in connection with Richard Heber , who had been largely instrumental in saving the library of George III from sale to the Czar , and whose " Biblioth'eca Heberiana , " published in thirteen parts , held notes on Dekker , Gas-coigne , Marlowe , and others . Huth and the library he filled from a full pocket are made famous by the reprints of that name . Both were scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German father and a Spanish mother , studied on a cosmopolitan scale . LockerLampson was collector , poet , and investigator in one . Finally , we have Lang 's " The Library , " and Augustine Birrell 's essay lamenting the day that Oxford 's sons actually at times walk past a book-stall without stopping " just to see what the fellow has , you know . " Book-collecting - on some scale , in some limited period , is naturally a sine qua non of real research ; but these men have covered a catholic field , have acquired duplicates  --  the sign of departure from book-getting for literary and professional purposes  --  and have been , in fine , virtuosos . The tendency to put book-collecting to the fullest possible literary and scholarly use has beyond all doubt grown , stimulated alike by the character of modern scholarship and the character of the book trade . Few pedants like Gissing 's " Christopherson , " collecting books aimlessly till they crowd the wife from her last room , can longer exist . In the change , commercialism has played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through ignorant intermediaries offering unknown bargains is past ; now the merchant himself tries to bring all transactions into the full light of exact knowledge , with resulting impetus to scholarship . Hazlitt and others have placed the blame for high prices on the American invasion ; and it is said that one State university is held in just abhorrence throughout Europe for its boosting of prices after -a sudden appropriation for library purposes . But there are other reasons for the passing of the time when Hazlitt could buy a box of seventeenth-century pamphlets for ? 15 , and sell them to Huth for ? 150 ; when a Paris collector could pick up the Elzevir " Patisserie Frangaise " at 6 sous , worth ? 600 ; when Thomas Corser could accumulate for ? 9,000 a library that sold cheap for ? 20,000 . Few of the booksellers who in London offer their wares in the dirty network of streets between the British Museum and the Strand have been men of high attainments ; but since T. Green issued the first catalogue in 1729 , their average of book-knowledge @ @ @ @
