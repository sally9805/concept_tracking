txt It was not pleasant in Flanders this morning . went up there after yesterday on the Somme to get details of the French and British fighting around Kemmel , and am bound ? to Bali that though I have see a FlOders in. every kind of foul weather , I had never seen it more sinister looking , more utterly evil in atmosphere and spiritual effect than it was today . A thick , wet fog enveloped all the flat fields like a London " particular " at its worst , and French and British columns with transport and guns moved through it like ghosts in a shadow world . Mont des Cats , that high hill on the Allies ' side of Kemmel , upon which and around which by Boeschepe and Dickebusch and Goedesverwelde and Westoutre the enemy had been scattering heavy shells and flinging a harassing fire , was ' wreathed around with clouds of fog , through which the great old monastery where the Trappist monks used to live in silence before the tumult of the war surrounded them in the Autumn of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mediaeval castle . The roads down . which we used to go with an admirable sense of safety , even when the Ypres salient was full of menace  --  alas , the menace has come again  --  bore signs today of recent and horrid happenings . The little wooden houses built by refugees from Ypres after days of terror there April , 1915 , and filled with stores which the British troops used to buy on their way past , had been knocked to matchwood by shellfire , and all about them were deep , shellholes newly made , with that beastly freshness which warns one that others may come . All the fields for miles around were punctured by pits made by German shells . An Orgy of Promiscuous Shelling . It was ' yesterday that the enemy 's gunners flung ? most of these shells . They had a kind of devil 's orgy of shelling , and scattered high explosives any old where without aim or object , except that of harassing the whole region . They turned long-range guns on to villages behind the lines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infants ' school . They fired off the map at poor old Poperinghe again , Pop , as we call it by long familiarity with its tall spired church and Grand Place and narrow Streets , and they put high explosives into Westoutre , and made targets of Boo Sheep and Gerty Wears Velvet , which by those who cane pronounce them are called Boeschepe and Goedesversvelde . All this was just the gentle embroidery of the decorative scheme of death which had been placed for a central plan around Kemmel Hill . Kemmel Hill was held by the French , as I previously have told  --  those gallant men who came up so quickly to the relief of the British when they needed them and took their places in the line without ? delay after long marches . On the left of them yesterday were Scottish and English battalionzt . After several attempts against Kemmel had been frustrated , as I recorded at the time , the enemy all went out yesterday , to capture this position . Four , divisions at least , Including tha Alpine Corps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107th , were moved against Kemmel in the early morning fog after a tremendous bombardment of the Franco-British positions . It vas a bombardment that began before the first glimmer of dawn , like one of those which the British used to arrange in the days of their ? great Flanders battles last year . It cam ? , clown swamping Kemmel Hill so that it was like a volcano , and stretched away on to the British lines on the left of the French by Maedelsted. : : Farm and Grand Bois down to Vierstraat . Then the German infantry attacked in depth , battalion behind battalion , division benind division , and their mountain troops of Alpine corps and Jaegers and Bavarians came on first in the assault of Kemmel Hill , which eras not much more than a hillock , though it looms large in Flanders , and in this war . The French had suffered a terrible ordeal of fire , and the main thrust of the German strength was against them . Fee Strikes in Two Directions . The enemy struck in two - directions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Dranoutre and the other at the point of junction between-the French and British Korth ward . In ' eattil ? ease they Were favored by fog and the effect of their gunfire . They were able to drive in a wedge Which they pushed forward until they had caused gaps . The French on Kemmel Hill became isolated and there was a gulf between the British and French and between the French left and right . On the hill the French garrison fought with splendid , heroism . These men , when quite surrounded , would not yield , but served their machine guns and rifles for many hours ; determined to hold their positions at all costs , and to the death . Small parties of them on the west of the hill held out until midday or beyond , according to the reports of the airmen , who flew low over them , but by 0 o'clock this morning , owing to the gaps made by the enemy , the French main line was compelled to draw back from Kernmel . They inflicted severe . losses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break their line on the new defensive positions . Meanwhile a body of Scottish troops were seriously involved . Some of their officers whom I saw today tell me the fog was so thick , as on March 21 , that after a terrific bombardment the first thing known at some points a little way behind the line was when the Germans were all around them . One officer ' I know was sleeping after an all-night vigil when he heard German voices and rifle shots , and jumped out of his dugout to see Germans on the side of a little stream only a few yards away . He was on the same side of this brook , and they could have grabbed him by one pounce , but he leaped across the stream , and by some wonderful luck escaped their sniping shots and got away . The Royal Scots and the Black Watch fought hard and did not yield ground until .. a price had been paid for it . The enemy seems to have paid his uSual price , which was not cheap . A machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds at massed bodies of . Germans who were checked against the wire defenses , and they fell in heaps . This officer himself had a fearful experience yesterday after many heroic days before , but hiss great grief is that his horse , which he has had out in this war since 1914 , was killed by a shell . Cameroun Fight Hard . The Camerons fought like tigers yesterday . For some little time they had not come into actual touch with ' the enemy , but yesterday they had this chance and made the most of it . They we 're heavily attacked in the morning in the neighborhood of Damstrasse , that street of concrete shelters which I described last year when the British captured it in the battles of Flanders , From 11 o'clock in the morning until 5:30 in the evening they kept this position , killing the enemy in waves every time they tried to advance . It was decided to withdraw ouriline to Vierstraat , and the orders were sent . up to the Camerons to conform to this , // Philip Gibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not reach them for some time , and they still went on fighting for three hours , more , or at least until after 8 o'clock at night . when they fell back to join up with the rest of the line . All afternoon and evening the enemy endeavored to smash through the line established by Vierstraat to Beaver Corner , but the Scots and English repelled him with heavy losses and the Black Watch made ? a , fierce counterattack in which it took fifty-six prisoners . Prisoners from picked Regiments . The combined counterattack of the French and British troops was made this morning when the English battalions advanced from the north and after gallant efforts gained an entry into Kemmel village and sent back a considerable number of prisoners , whom I met this . morning on their way back . They were a good-looking body of troops , some of them very tall men belonging to picked regiments of Alpine and Bavarian divisions , but they had a worn , haggard look . Many of them marched as though dazed by their day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village came under a wicked machine gun fire and could not maintain their hold on the recaptured ground , though they have not lost all of it and I believe they are still further than their original line tonight ... The French on our right were unable to make substantial progress . The situation in Flanders is still serious , and the enemy may endeavor to exploit his advance at Kemmel by a great concentration of strength and more violent attacks , but the French Army , as well as the British , is now barring his way , and all the British have intense confidence in the superb regiments of . ? France , who are now fighting with them . I saw thousands of them today in the fields and farms and villages , and the spirit of these sturdy men seemed to disperse some of the gloomy fog around them , and uplift one 's heart , for they have the look of great soldiers hardened by these years ' of war , and they are inspired by most grim resolve . The people of Northern France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , greet them with cries of " Bonne chance ! " and wave their hands to them from cottage doors and all along the roads . ' These blue . fellows , perched on their blue wagons , or riding behind black old cookers which jolt on with a trail of smoke , or marching with eteady tramp behind their colors , receive an ovation of love from old French mothers and young girls or grownups and of peasants , who have been shelled out of their homes further up the line . Foe Slaughtered at Villers . And now I must add a few words about the situation down south at Villers-Bretonneux , which I described yesterday at some length . I told how ? pockets of German machine gunners were still fighting in that village fast night . These were all routed out and all the village is now in the hands of the British , and the Australian troops joined up the gap which existed for a time between them . There is no doubt that I underestimated the losses of the enemy yesterday . The Australians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Polygone Wood , where there was a massacre of the enemy . Light tanks which got among two battalions near Cachy slaughtered whole companies as though they were juggernauts , sweeping the enemy with fire before they could attempt to disperse and trampling them down . It was ghastly business , and these tanks when they came back had to be cleansed of their blood . The tanks employed by the enemy yesterday were heavier than those of ' , the British , and according to the Australians , seem about 86 feet long , 12 feet high , . and 12 feet broad , with a central turret . Their caterpillar tracks pass . around several pairs of wheels and look like enormous turtles or inverted basins , but they are very slow . One of them bore on its , steel shield an emblem . of skull and crossbones , and another carried the name of Cyclops . They are armed with a. small gun of about two-inch calibre and some six machine guns . They seem to have been handled by scratch crews , who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy with which then. , tanks were enveloped no German infantry had seen one of them before ? and were untrained in fighting with them . Two of them fled at once when encountered by British tanks , but the troops were unable to ' get possession of them . Many of the prisoners speak wii:h disgust of their command in ordering the attack on Villers-Bretonneux without sufficient artillery support , and sa ythey suffered hideously from gas , with which the British soaked the village after their capture of it . Th ay were utterly surprised by the counterattack , and some of them were got in cellars while still ignorant of their change of fortune . The most intelligent , of these prisoners all show signs of uneasiness about the future of the German offensive and do not disguise that in spite of the gain of ground they are not certain of ultimate victory , and speak like men who see some dark omens ahead . They are puzzled by the failure of the U boat wax to stop the American transports , and when asked why that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we want to know . " There are other things they want to know , and because they do not know they have black forebodings .
