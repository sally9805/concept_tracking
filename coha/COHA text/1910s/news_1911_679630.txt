txt Attorney General WICKERSHAM candidly admitted that on principle and authority general legislative regulation of prices was difficult to justify . Ile might have added that the practice under the theory at the very time he was speaking justifies the objections which he seems willing to ignore . One example is afforded this current week by the methods which Chicago heed in regulating the price of gas . The experts eta- ' ployed by the Council reported that the proposed rate of 70 Cents . ' would probably be regarded as . unreasonable . ' by the courts . The Council nevertheless ordered a reduction on a sliding r scale down to Vo cents in the fifth year , and declined a proposal to submit the difference to arbitration . Naturally , the case is now before the courts , and it is to the credit of one of the experts that he left the city's. service , saying- that he did not propose to be a football for the politicians . The case serves to illustrate that to the politicians and the consumers ' " regulation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect perhaps that regulation would be wanted if it meant revision upward . But regulation which , works only one way is a poor rule . Another case contains this moral and several others of contemporary tion . The City of Wichita resolved to regulate telephone rates and secured " . advice of accountants whom the company admitted ' to its books . The accountants reported that the . company . was losing money , and that at the proposed rate would be able to earn ' only $7,000 on an investment of one million . The city , being dissatisfied , hired other experts , one of them an employ of Senator FOLLETTE 'S Utilities Com .. mission in Wisconsin . The second set . of experts ? repeited that , the ' - Ought to be allowed to raise its rates . And the city ordered a reduction from rates entailing an estimated loss annually of $37,000 according to its own experts whose advice it rejected . It is hardly surprising that the , company took the case into the courts , and it is natural . that the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It . had - obtained and declined to act upon . The ordinance provided penalties of $000,000 and 2,250 years in jail , but there is ' no chance of anybody suffering until the. , injunction is vacated . The Judge in allowing the injunction declared that the city 's course was " confiscation , " and added , " If I had money to invest , I certainly would not invest it in telephone property or . any other public The explanation of the actioU'Of the Mayor and . Council is simple . They knew better , but were afraid of the " recall . " The people wanted the rates " regulated " downward , and would have it so , regardless of the merits , or they would change . their city officials . Lest we proceed further on this road to mob - rule it is Well to place on the record another case , showing the result of intrusting legislative and judicial Powers- to .. the ' people , who so , . - many think can do ** ? In . ' . Oregon net long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquitted of Murder . This so enraged the friends of the slain man . that they circulated a petition for the recall of the Judge in the trial on the ground that his instructions to the jury caused the acquittal . It would seem sufficiently shocking that the Judge should be placed on trial before the entire electorate , without the benefit of any of the safeguards of a court trial , but worse follows : In the campaign now proceeding , following the recall , the Judge is Opposed by the Republicans because he is a Democrat , and by the Bryanites because he is a gold Democrat . So the Judge is on trial for a double crime . Regulation of prices and regulation of conduct by votes would seem- to be open to criticism of the same sort . The beautiful theory of regulation by majorities is impaired by the fact that majorities have selfish interests as well as the individuals of whom they are composed , and prejudice besides . They are free from the precedents by which Judges are controlled , and they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our systems place our Judges . A mob is the worst sort of a monarch , and we should beware how we adopt lynch methods of regulating our prices and our judiciary .
