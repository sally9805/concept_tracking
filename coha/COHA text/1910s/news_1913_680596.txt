txt The average yield on the recent sale of New York City bonds was 4.49 per cent . The average yield on the State 's sale of its notes is 430 per cent . The difference would indicate that the State 's credit is inferior by 0.37 per cent , if the comparison were between like things . The comparison is alike only in the absence of moral hazard , and the difference in the yields indicates nothing regarding that . The money placed at the service of the city is money that is satisfied with the yield , taking one year with another , and under any imaginable condition of difficulty of- paying that yield and ultimately repaying the principal . The money placed at the service of . the State is not the sort of money put into long investments . It is money that is awaiting investment , or which would be used in the processes of production of goods , or of distribution of goods , or which will be shortly wanted to meet maturing obligations . It is distinctly money with a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uses of fixed investment The , State is forced to the device adopted by the railways when first they found borrowing difficult , and which now is causing them embarrassment . The difference between the cost of money to the railways and the State is not as great as might be wished by those who would like to regard the State 's credit higher , and the State 's extrication from the necessity evidenced by the placing of the motes , for , the first time - in its history lies ' in ' the . future : Elie adventure would be unwise if it were avoidable , but the State is under &sort; of coiiipulsion . Therein lies the reason why the bids were not enough higher to send the I yield to a more creditable basis . Nobody feels any doubt that there will be enough to go around of all sorts of paper . The necessity to borrow by billions confronts the world , and confronts American borrowers by hundreds of millions . Not only are necessities pressing .

It is public issues for the most part which are under compulsory sale with no provision regarding terms , except the limitations of law that are rather a hindrance to borrowing on good terms . This affects all borrowing rather than Ithe ? public borrowing alone . Loans I like the State 's and the city 's can not be considered apart from the general situation , as though they were pebbles cast into a vessel of water . It is more as though a dye or salt were thrown Into the liquid , and affected every atom . When hundreds of millions of the highest credit are under compulsory issue it is more than a feast for lenders . It is a warning to all borrowers that the competition is a hardship , even if not unfair . There is no borrowing so regardless of cost as that to make war or to repair its ravages .

The borrowers here whose wants are thus without ordinary means of satisfaction are thrown into competition with public borrowers whose needs within the past five years have absorbed $750,000,000 more than the previous maximum annual demand . Borrowers have now to reckon with competition of this sort in the short market as well as the long , since the State 's adventure . It is an undesirable condition when short credits are put to long uses . It is more than notice that higher interest must be paid . It is a sign that either money must be found by sacri-ficing long investments or that the activities of daily trade must be checked for lack of the necessary tool of good trade , plenty of sure credit at fair rates . The class of investors who took the State 's notes is one which knows how to make more than simple interest when times are either very good or very bad .
