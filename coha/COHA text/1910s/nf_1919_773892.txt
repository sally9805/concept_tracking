txt // In all of these analyses it must be remembered that the chemist , handicapped as he is when working in the organic field , has not determined the form under which , in their highly organised states , the various minerals found in the laboratory previously existed in the internal secretions of the living animal . In reducing the organic mineral salts and colloids to " ash " their form is completely changed so that all the chemist can say for the result of his analysis is that the minerals are really there , and that they are always there , regardless of the proportions in which they are found by this or that investigator . We must not assume because the chemist has calculated the iron of the red corpuscles as " iron oxide " that it would be a good thing , therefore , to go to the drug store and purchase a dose of iron oxide . The iron in the blood does not exist in such form . The chemist has to reduce it to such form before he can recover it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Herein lies the error made by the patent medicine manufacturer who tries to make the people believe that because certain salts are found in the human body therefore medicines containing them are good for the human body . To assume that because " calcium oxide " appears in an analysis of blood serum it must therefore appear in the blood serum itself as calcium oxide is a childish error . The calcium , iron and other mineral salts as they appear in the blood and internal secretions are present in such wonderfully complex forms that they can not be reproduced in the drug store or laboratory . The dumb grasses of the field possess the power to organise these salts of the earth into forms in which they can be assimilated by the animal . Man with all his intelligence and all his laboratory apparatus can not do this , yet man is presumptuous enough to offer excuse , even justification , for his work of juggling , manipulating , refining and destroying them before he sells his finished product to his neighbour . // ? 18 ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human body are not present through the operation of blind accident . Selective action picks and chooses , accepts and rejects , absorbs and discards them in a manner so astonishingly intricate and so exquisite in its rhythmical waves that those who study the very majesty of these phenomena are compelled to see in them a Supreme Intelligence regulating all their orderly activities . In the clearly disclosed evidences of that intelligence we behold the workmanship of God . Water forms about three-fourths of the weight of the adult body , and is the medium in which its biochemic activities are carried on . Even the child knows that without water no plant life could exist . Plants that have but a single cell , which are not actually immersed in water , are generally found in more or less moist situations where they continually get their supply of water : from dew or rain . In times of drought they are seriously injures . The young cell which is enclosed with a cell membrane speedily shows a tendency to accumulate water in its interior . Gradually traces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of liquid , is formed . In the plant which consists of a number of cells such a vacuole is found in every adult cell as long as it is living . In other words , healthy protoplasm must always be in direct contact with water . It is only while saturated with water that the active life of protoplasm can continue . A few " scientists , " taken off their guard in public debate , have asserted that the removal of minerals from man 's food through refining processes can do no particular harm because the body contains a store of minerals which do not require to be replenished . The same preposterous argument would indicate that because man 's body contains an enormous store of water ( three-fourths // his weight ) it is not necessary for him to replenish that store daily . More of this later . We now know that with very rare exceptions if a cell is once completely dried , even at a low temperature , its life is gone , and restoration of water fails to enable it to recover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal of the water which its cells contain . Fresh liquid must be con-stantly taken in , just as a new supply of mineral salts must be taken in . The water which is already there must , to a certain extent , be removed . The plant depends in fact upon a certain circulation of water , and this becomes the more imperative as its growth increases . It has been proved that protoplasm , which , as we have seen , is the active substance found in every living cell of plant or animal , draws its nutriment eventually from the salt solutions which come to it . It has also been established that protoplasm in plant and ani-mal must return to these solutions such waste products as it gives off . It must obtain its oxygen for instance from water , for this element can only pass into the interior of a cell through the liquid which enters that cell . Thus we see that water is a wonderful medium through which the forces of life are conveyed . It is not difficult to believe , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than too pounds of water , not as the result of accident , but as the result of a fixed law . Of the solid matter found in the human body about one-fifth is made up of the minerals ? iron , calcium , phosphorus , potassium , magnesium , manganese , sodium , sulphur , silicon , fluorine , iodine and chlorine . Chlorides and phosphates with carbonates and sulphates form the chief of these mineral salts as far as weight is concerned , but some of the salts which appear in mere traces , such as fluorine and iodine , have essential functions to perform , and without them we now know that human life as it now exists would not be possible . One of humanity 's most conspicuous sins of omission has been its failure to consider reverently the dignity and the com-plexity of the human body , which , considered apart from the // human soul , is the most majestic work of creation . Let us ex amine a single detail of its marvellous composition . I f we place a trace of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . Hundreds of little corpuscles are seen floating about in the blood serum ; most of them are red , but a considerable number are white . A single drop of blood contains so many millions of corpuscles , far more than all the visible stars in the sky , that less than a hundreth part of a drop , the merest trace , must be used on the field under the lens in order that the eye may see anything at all . These red and white corpuscles are in themselves alone sufficient to confound all the wisdom of the universities , but they are not the only substances discoverable in that fragment of a drop of blood . Moving about with them as part of their structure , or in the fluid in which they circulate , we find , as we have seen , the salts of iron , calcium , phosphorus , sodium , potassium , magnesium , manganese , sulphur , chlorine and many other compounds which we shall not consider here . These substances are always found when pure and normal blood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some definite channel , and in obedience to some well-defined law . It has been established on many occasions that the red and white corpuscles each have certain well-defined work to do . It has also been established that any foreign agency that interferes with their work or keeps them from getting into the blood is an enemy of life . In order to compound that marvellously complex solution which we call blood , Mother Nature obtains her building materials from food , just as she obtains food from earth . Let us emphasise this impalpable and imponderable truth over and over again . We can never attach to it too great or too sublime an importance . The whole character of the blood depends upon the character of the food supplied to the digestive organs . What kind of blood is supplied to the 400,000 children under ten years of age who die every year in the United States ? TWO KINDS OF FOOD r What kind of blood was supplied to the " rejects " of the army of 1918 ? What kind of food is supplied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT DOWN The food-minerals and vitamines upon which life depends must be in the food man eats , that his body may take them from that food . All food contains them until man removes them . Consumed for a few months , food deficient in some of these building materials gradually affects health . If we are partial to a particular food from which a considerable portion of nature 's building materials has been abstracted , disorder is bound to develop . Nature , handicapped by the deficiency , will set up warning before fatal damage has been done , but if we do not understand her warning , or if we disregard it , we head straight for destruction , unless in the meantime an accidental change of diet provides the offsetting substances essential to life . Accident and chance are the elusive forces that temporarily bar the doors against destruction . With the army of the dead , augmented in the United States every year by 400,000 children under ten years of age , no happy accident ever interfered . Surely man should make an effort to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each drop of blood is but an expression of that law . Anything that interferes with the purity of blood is hostile to life . " The blood is the life . " Because man leaves so much to chance he sends a call into darkness , summoning hundreds of diseases to assist him in mismanaging the world in its sad sum total of misery and pain . The removal of one substance essential to life marks the beginning of disorder in the body . If two substances are removed the body may make use of the others until the handicap asserts itself . Then confusion must ensue . // If three , four or five substances are removed the inevitable collapse will take place a little sooner . If seven or eight substances are removed destruction gallops to the end . When all sixteen substances and their compounds are removed starvation itself begins . If we believe that God has elaborated these substances for our benefit it is little short of sacrilege to disregard them , or to trifle with them , because by doing so we assert our independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme of the universe the extraordinary phenomena which spring from food , nutrition , health and life must sooner or later overpower the spirit . In the presence of miracles of life , too profound to be comprehended by the human intellect , the knee must bend . But whether man be a fervent believer or a scoffing atheist , he must see that breakfast , dinner and supper are not matters to be left to accident or the designs of a food factory concerned chiefly in the profit of its products . If he is pale or anemic , if his energy is quickly exhausted , if he feels " all run down " and little like undertaking the commonplace duties of the day , if his children have lustreless eyes , pallid complexions , undeveloped bodies or manifest abnormal tendencies , let him look to his food . If they are bright , sturdy and resist illness , which he wrongfully and cruelly assumes must come to all children , let him congratulate himself that an accident has brought them immunity . In congratulating himself let him not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obedience to a fixed law . If his chi ; lren are in health to-day as the result of another fixed law , concerning which he knows nothing , let him know that they may be protected to-morrow . Our sixteen food minerals and the vitamines associated with them are no part of chance . They are the law . The body derives them , and the resistance they bestow , from food and from no other source . To take them from his food man must find them there . He can not find them in food from which they have been removed . With their loss he loses his resistance . If God had not endowed mar , with this extraordinary resisTWO // tance , the human family would have to keep itself hermetically sealed in tin cans or glass jars . The salmon is canned because dead flesh offers no resistance to germs . A tin shell acts as a substitute in keeping the germs off . Open the can and let them in for twelve hours . The results will speak even in that short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will retreat . Keep them out and the salmon will stay sweet for a century . There is nothing quite so marvellous as the power of healthy living tissue to hold germ life in contempt . It is quite as effective as a hermetically sealed can . Death and putrefaction are synonymous . Putrefaction simply means the splitting up of tissue compounds into their simple elements . Bacteria are the instruments employed by nature to get rid of the dead . Without germs nothing would rot . When a body is embalmed the germs are simply held back a little while . Bacteria convert dead flesh into gases and dust . On healthy living flesh they have no effect . On living flesh that has lost its resistance they feed even in life , but they do not convert such flesh into gas and dust . They convert it into poison . One kind of germ poison produces typhoid , another diphtheria , a third syphilis , a fourth pneumonia , a fifth tuberculosis . Some germs , invited deliberately into the living temple , are not included in God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , even when healthy , offers feeble re ? ? sistance to them . The result is disease , loathsome and unnatural , involving not only the bones , nerves , blood and brain , but even the soul . The flesh disintegrates and reason itself totters as the germ of syphilis cavorts across the human highway in its dance of death . But ? with respect to the many germs that have their own proper functions to perform outside the body , and which therefore in their wide distribution through nature are taken into the system almost hourly through food , drink and air , the living flesh in health laughs at them all . They may approach in battalions only to be overcome as rapidly as they advance , whereas a solitary organism entering life through the channels of vice becomes venomous , malignant , ' // powerful . After taking up its residence in the blood it begins a blighting reign so imperious and dominating that its evil influence passes on to innocent children yet unborn as if to emphasise the truth of the prophecy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children even unto the fourth generation . " Potent poisons such as arsenic , mercury and the iodides may retard for a while the catastrophic activity of these avenging organisms , but there is no evidence to prove that even when these " curatives " are most skilfully administered the forces of degeneration are not passed on in some measure from generation to generation in accordance with the formula laid down in the scriptures . Man , surrounded by the artificial protection of modern medicine , defies , or thinks he defies , the inexorable laws of nature , but ever is he confronted by disclosures that above him and beyond him in unseen realms which only the microscope may feebly penetrate , are powers so small the naked eye has never beheld them , but which in irresistible energy are mightier in the number of their victims than earthquake , fire and flood . Contemplating this Nemesis of evil , man is consoled by the knowledge that it is within his lot to regulate his conduct in the flesh so that without the aid of art or science he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are beautiful . Because he is a free agent he may choose for himself between good and evil , knowing that even germs are divided into good and bad and that most of them are good . Well may he doubt the conclusions of his own arrogance in dismissing the ancient doctrine concerning good and evil spirits . The folly of rejecting what he can not see or understand is nowhere more visible than in his attitude toward those purely material forces of life and death which , prior to fifty years ago , were neither seen nor understood by mortal , but which now exhibit themselves to reverent eyes in grandure that moves to awe . What the ubiquitous tin can , hermetically sealed under the laws of sterilisation , is to salmon , natural resistance , safeguarded by well-disposed intelligence , under the natural law , is to man and his children . // Why does he persist in his refusal to see the beauty , the benevolence and the consolation of this parallel ? ? 20 ? SUBTLE ACTIVITY OF MINERAL SALTS This little experiment can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us grasp an idea of the remarkable conduct of the minerals in the human body . First eat a tablet of citrate of lithium . Then take a clean platinum wire . Hold the wire in a blue Bunsen flame . It will give no colouration to the flame . Now pass the platinum wire along the skin of the forehead or across the palm ; return it to the flame and note the beautiful yellow fire of sodium , showing this mineral at work in the elimination processes of the body . Without sodium to take up the carbonic acid , evolved through the digestion of sugars and starches , as a poisonous waste product that must be removed from the body , this acid , better known as carbon dioxide , would accumulate in the tissues and destroy them . This is why the excessive use of denatured sugars , table syrups , and starches in the diet of America is followed by many serious diseases . Sodium is one of the food minerals indispensable to health . The little platinum wire and the Bunsen flame reveal it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a blue glass , which will filter out some of the light rays that interfere with vision . Look through it at the platinum wire in the flame . Note the beautiful lilac flame of potassium , showing this mineral also in the elimination processes of the body . The sodium and potassium have been taken up from the human skin . Potassium helps to keep the tissues flexible and active while assisting the sodium to carry off the carbonic acid manufactured as one of the end-products of combustion in the furnaces of life . We shall assume now that a half hour has elapsed since the tablet of citrate of lithium was consumed . // Again clean the platinum wire thoroughly . Pass it over the forehead or across the palm of the hand . Place it in the flame . It is coloured a vivid red . This is the flame of lithium . In one short half hour the lithium , taken through the mouth , has circulated through all the avenues , highways , and by-ways of the human body and has appeared after its marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple experiment we obtain a crude idea of some of the hidden forces at work in our bodies . There is much evidence that potassium gives life to the nervous system and assists the heart to beat by influencing the relaxability of the heart muscles . If the heart did not send the blood into the lungs the body could not and would not obtain the oxygen necessary to its life , nor could it , through those delicate tissues , made up of millions of little valves or filters , dispose of the waste gases which would otherwise poison all its organs and glands . Many discoveries of science justify the conclusion that potassium interferes with the hardening influences that menace muscle , joint , and artery , making the tissues soft and pliable . It has been noted that linen , made from flax grown on granite soil , rich in potassium , is noted for its suppleness and softness , whereas linen produced from flax grown on calcareous soil is hard , brittle , and of little strength . In the month of October , 1915 , potassium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from alunite by the United States Smelting Company of Utah . At this price the Armour Fertiliser Company purchased its entire year 's potash production . In spite of the value of potassium salts and the necessity of their presence in fertiliser , rob tons of potassium salts were wasted daily in 1915 by the twenty-five distilleries in the United States that subjected molasses to fermentation . The farmer has been taught , through various federal and state bulletins , to appreciate the necessity of potassium to the health and vigour of his plants , yet school children have never been taught that when the body can not secure the quantity necessary to carry on its wonderfully complex duties the heart ceases to serve its master and the body dies . // 21 ? CONSTRUCTION WITHIN ; DESTRUCTION WITHOUT Those little soldiers of life called corpuscles are never out of the presence of iron . Containing no iron themselves , they nevertheless swim about in a fluid which does contain iron . If that iron were not present the little soldiers would die . Iron combines with oxygen in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blade of a pocketknife , the hinge of a barn door , the barrel of a rifle , the spring of a farm wagon , become " rusty . " Rust is simply a combination of iron and oxygen . The chemist calls it " ferrous oxide . " The wonderful affinity of oxygen for iron is an expression of the law under whose operation oxygen finds its way into the body . Without the iron in the red colouring matter of the blood the body could not appropriate the oxygen from the surrounding air and in a few minutes it would perish . We need only choke a human creature two minutes to be guilty of murder . To choke means to shut off oxygen . The carburetor of an automobile engine is equipped with a " choker . " To stall the engine it is only necessary to resort to this choker , which , by cutting off the oxygen , makes combustion in the cylinders impossible . In exactly the same way combustion , supported by oxygen , is necessary to the fires of life . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the body the oxygen it requires it will grow pale and sicken . Iron is indispensable . It is part of the law . The waste matter accumulating in the human tissues during every second of existence would destroy life in twenty-four hours if not rendered harmless and carried off . When these waste products are only partially removed the result is autointoxication , self-poisoning . The iron in the blood , uniting in the lungs with the oxygen of the air , carries its life-supporting freight to the tissues , where it oxidises or burns up the waste substances so dangerous to life . // If the iron is not present in sufficient quantity to keep up with the demand of the body the oxygen that ought to be inside performing its work remains outside ready and willing but unable to enter . When fire , through the influence of oxygen , attacks a piece of wood it produces smoke and ashes . Just as the smoke of the fire has to be carried off through the chimney and the ashes raked through the bars of the grate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be eliminated . This oxidising process going on in the human tissues produces the carbonic gas which we have seen taken up by the sodium in the blood and discharged through the lungs as carbon dioxide . The sodium , having work of its own to perform , has to help the oxygen and the oxygen in turn has to be helped by the iron . Thus we obtain a vague idea of how these food minerals and the other elements necessary to the support of life operate , not singly and alone , but in beautiful harmony with each other , in unswerving obedience to a fixed law . Calcium , commonly known as lime , combines with phosphorus , magnesium , silicon , and fluorine in the development of the bones and teeth . 1 f the quantity of calcium required by the body in the construction of its bones and teeth is reduced the bones and teeth suffer . We have seen that millions of children in the United States are suffering with defective teeth . These defective teeth are the direct result of the inability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their proper combination , the calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , and fluorine necessary to the construction of normal teeth , either because these mineral substances have been removed from the food of the children or because they have been consumed with other foods that destroy them and remove them from the body . Chickens obtain the fluorine required for the production of their eggs , if they have a chance to pick up a few specks of granite . When confined in a wooden henhouse and fed on food containing no fluorine they easily develop chicken cholera and chicken diphtheria . The yolk of the egg requires fluorine . The protective enamel // ( if the teeth requires fluorine . The bones of the spine require fluorine . The pupils of the eye require fluorine . Silicon possesses powerful antiseptic properties . There is ( rood reason to believe that in the establishment of normal resistance to disease it assists the body to defend itself against the invasion of many of the organisms which cause disease . Silicon influences the nervous system to perform its functions normally . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the hair and nails . Dears , bison , foxes , sheep , have luxuriant hair , fur , or wool . There are no bald or thin-haired squirrels . They consume all the silicon nature provides for them . Their hair food and nail food are normal . Animals fed upon food from which any of the food minerals are artificially removed perish . Experiments on animals in captivity have proved this . White mice , rabbits , guineapigs , hogs , and poultry develop the same diseases as those which kill 400,000 children under ten years of age in the United States every year , when these animals are fed on the same foods so freely consumed by children . Food minerals not only themselves engage in the construction processes going on constantly within the body but they also exercise a controlling influence over the destructive forces that threaten the body from without . We are now beginning to appreciate the fact that food minerals are precious substances . Yet not a single one of the states prevents the adulteration of food through the abstraction or removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIFE The smallest boy in the laboratory can be made to understand the wonderful oxidising property of sulphuric acid . When this acid is generated in the human body , as it is generated every day , it is immediately neutralised by the alkaline bases which nature , under normal conditions , never fails to provide for that purpose . R1 ' I'II ! i F.tAPISIIING WORLD Phosphoric acid is also generated in the body and neutralised in the same manner . Calcium , magnesium , and potassium are : among the alkaline bases provided by natural foods . If they are not present to do their work within a short time the destructive action of the sulphuric and phosphoric acids can end only in disaster . A few drops of sulphuric acid taken into the body from a bottle will produce death , by attacking the tissues , oxidising and destroying them . When food from which the minerals have been removed by commercial processes or by foolish methods of cookery is introduced into the body , it results in the formation of free sulphuric acid from the albumenoid sulphur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds found normally in meat , cheese , eggs and other articles of diet . These acids , in the absence of the alkaline bases that ought to be present , and which in normal , natural foods always are present , must he neutralised as rapidly as they are evolved . It is because they are neutralised that we find them in the urine as discarded waste products in the form of sulphates and phosphates . When the neutralising bases have been removed from food before it is consumed these acids abstract basic elements from the living tissues , thereby impairing or destroying them . Meat which is minced and immersed for a few hours in distilled water loses its potassium , magnesium , and calcium salts . It also loses its colour . If cooked in this condition it will be found to be tasteless . If fed to dogs and cats or other animals these animals will eat a little , then refuse to take more , and if fed on nothing else will actually die more quickly than animals not fed at all . This can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phosphoric acids in the bodies of the animals but also by another fact . The animals fed on the demineralised meat , in addition to being deprived of the food minerals indispensable to life 's processes , are also obliged to dissipate their reserve vitality at a rapid rate through the efforts of their organs to throw off the useless and dangerous food elements imposed upon them ; whereas the // animal starved outright is not called upon to expend its strength faster than the laws of starvation demand . One feature of the laws of nutrition we are endeavouring to emphasize , is that these food minerals are so essential to the life and health of he body that when the body is deprived of them disease must follow . Certain experts have gone so far as to declare that all human food contains an excess of mineral salts . Where natural foods are considered the statement made by these experts is never true . On the contrary , it has been conclusively proved in many instances , particularly where refined foods are consumed , mineral salts are carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are taken in . This is notably the case in tuberculosis and wasting diseases , in which the calcium content of the feces invariably exceeds the calcium content of the food consumed . It was the case among thousands of the children who , under the age of ten years , died last year in the United States . Nature , does provide a reserve from which , in emergencies , for a short time , the body may find the elements it requires . But if the diet is of such a refined character that it exhausts nature 's storehouse , destructive consequences inevitably follow . This fact must be remembered in the feeding of children , because when the food of the infant is changed from a purely milk diet to a mixed diet great injury may result from a deficiency of lime and other salts . This injury manifests itself on the surface in the form of defective teeth , but defective teeth constitute only a symptom of much deeper ravages within . An exclusive flesh diet is poor in lime and many foods on which children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lime natural to them removed before they are put upon the table . This is one of the reasons why the excessive consumption of meat is a curse . Meat is deficient in the mineral salts required by the body unless consumed as the tiger and the leopard consume it , lapping up the blood and gnawing the bones . In consequence , the excessive meat-eater is plagued with rheumatism , asthma , and many other diseases in the alleviation of which he is sent to the mineral springs to drink water containing calcium , magnesium , and sodium sulphate . H ( i ' I'IIIS FAMISHING WORLD These waters , however large the quantity in which they may he consumed , are useless unless the offending diet is first corrected , the peg removed . In its proper place , baby 's diet , based on the importance of its mineral contents , will be carefully outlined and of even greater importance and significance the diet of baby 's mother before baby is born will receive the same attention . ? 23 ? THE THYROID GLAND , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtle relationship between the food minerals and the health of the body . There are glands in the neck called the thyroids , the importance of which , in the economy of life 's processes , was never suspected until Breisacher , Plum , Kishi , and Bryce made it clear that the thyroids , like every other organ or gland of the human body , were really created by God for a special purpose . Sometimes when the thyroid becomes diseased it attains an abnormal size , swelling out in the form of a great lump ( goitre ) . At other times when even more seriously diseased its enlargement may be almost unnoticeable , except to the touch . It has been conclusively established that in its proper functioning the thyroid depends upon the compounds of food iodine . We have seen how the food minerals help to build up the body . We have also seen how they help to tear down the tissues . In the processes of assimilation and elimination they are equally important . In this work of elimination the food mineral iodine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively engaged , thus helping to rid the body of many of its enemies and defending it against the assault of disease . Alexander Bryce proved that the intestinal decomposition of meat produces poisonous products of putrefaction which are absorbed by the walls of the bowel and which , having thus entered the system , become powerful irritants . They thus produce an increase in the connective tissues of the organs and blood // vessels , hardening of the arteries , senile decay , tumours , and cancers . Metchnikoff suggested that to aid the body in its effort to protect itself against these poisonous products nature has provided poison-destroying organs , among which is the thyroid gland . Breisacher proved the poisonous products of meat digestion will quickly kill a dog if the thyroid gland is removed , although after its removal the life of the animal can be indefinitely prolonged if fed on bread and milk . His experiment established the function of the thyroid as a poison destroyer . Both Plum and Kishi were brought to the conviction after a series of experiments that the function of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putrefaction of albumen in the intestines . An exclusive diet of eggs causes a condition among children which their parents term " biliousness . " This so-called " biliousness " is simply the result of self-poisoning through the imperfect elimination of the protein poison . In children some glands do not develop until their twelfth , thirteenth , or fourteenth year . The thyroid gland does not begin to develop until the third or fourth year of life . Hence the child lacks its assistance in taking care of these poisons and eliminating them from the system . For this reason beef extracts , which contain alkaloids that no infant or invalid should be permitted to swallow , become dangerous food . People in feeble health , put on a beef tea diet , are frequently made worse because of the imperfect functioning of the thyroid and other glands . These alkaloids stimulate and bring about a state of functional excitement . Functional excitement does not mean invigouration . Neither beef nor beef extract contains the merest trace of iodine , yet the thyroid depends for its activity upon the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further established that animals , during the period when they feed on fresh grasses and the seeds of grasses , in ' 1 ' 111S FAMISHING WORLD accordance with the dictates of the Book of Genesis , have much more active thyroid glands . The ( ' hicago packers have taken advantage of this phenomenon to ncunifacture the thyroid extracts advertised in the medical journals . The investigations of Seidell and Fenger on animals shipped to the Union Stockyards , in Chicago , from all parts of the United States led to a surprising discovery . It was shown by these experimenters that the percentage of iodine found in the healthy thyroid glands of sheep and hogs was about three times as much between June and November , when the animals were allowed to feed naturally on green pasture , as that found between December and May , when they were fed on impoverished commercial byproduct foods . It was also curiously noted that the thyroid glands became Iarger during the months in which their low iodine content was observed , indicating some relationship between the iodine and the swelling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodine from the food of the 1,5oo,000 children under ten years of age who have died in the United States during the last four years upon the health of those children prior to their deaths ? ? 24 ? COMMERCIALISM DISARMS NATURE Babies and small children are handicapped if their parents or nurses . ignore the meaning of the thyroid gland . Animals can not live without the thyroid under certain conditions , yet one of the elements necessary to the normal , healthy thyroid is deliberately removed from the diet every clay . The grains of the field , barley , rice , wheat , corn and rye , contain normal traces of iodine before they are refined , but there is not a chemist in the country who can discover a trace of this indispensable food mineral in a ton of refined white bread , biscuits , crackers , cakes , table syrups , cornstarch , tapioca , glucose , or sugar candy or in any of the other denatured foods upon // which man is now striving to sustain a normal body under dreadful handicaps . The thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The young child eating food unnatural to its requirements possesses no such police protection . It lives in a state of physiological anarchy . Excess meat in the diet affects not only the thyroid but the liver as well . In the ingenious experiment conducted by Eck a ligature was applied to the portal vein close to the liver , thus cutting out the liver from the portal circuit of a dog . It was found that a dog thus treated died in three days when fed upon meat , whereas another when fed upon bread and milk lived in excellent health for an indefinite length of time , notwithstanding the cutting off of its liver functions . Pavlov showed that the liver has three times as much work to do on a meat diet as on a meatless diet . According to Bryce , flesh foods , at the time they are consumed , contain on an average of 2oo,000,000 putrefactive bacteria in every gram . But he shows that nature has not left us to the tender mercies of these poison-producers . This is proved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of whose organs and glands , including the thyroid , either by good fortune or by the exercise of intelligent discretion are normally nourished , thereby enabling them to carry on their functioning . The people of America are consuming more meat than any other nation of the world and whether they know it or not they are consuming meat and meat products that have entered into advanced stages of putrefaction . Frequently they attribute cases of ptomaine poisoning to canned tomatoes , condensed milk , huckleberry pie , cheese sandwiches , and other foods . The real truth is never suspected . In twenty-six months I was able to obtain forty-seven convictions in the courts against meat packers , sausage manufacturers , and wholesale provision merchants for selling deodorised rotten meats and meat products , chemically treated , so as to disguise from the unsuspecting purchaser their true condition . I have also obtained the removal from office of veterinarians and inspectors in the employ of health departments and of the // Iture:iii of Animal Industry for the assistance given by them to influential but conscienceless food panderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of dollars . The details of these convictions are a matter of court record . in the meantime , even when meat is honest , fresh , wholesome , and cut from carcasses of animals free from infectious and contagious diseases at the time of slaughter , it requires normal organs to dispose of it properly . These normal organs require the elements found in natural food to keep them normal . Modern commercialism helps to put putrefactive products into the human body and then by refining food takes away many of the tools with which nature fights these putrefactions . The thyroid gland , through the many serious diseases which follow a disturbance of its functions , helps to emphasise the necessity in the diet of every individual , adult or child , of the food minerals which are squandered by modern civilisation with reckless abandon . Spring time is the season of high spirits in nature . Man alone in the spring complains of lassitude . All around him under the action of nature 's unmolested law he witnesses the miracle of rising sap , the quickening strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spear of grass to lift itself upward through the lately frozen clod . Man contrasts his weariness with the power and mastery , the sparkle and glow , the warmth and buoyancy of spring , yet just as the earth has the green grass in its depths so has he the freshness of nature in his heart . He is just as much a part of nature ; nature 's law grips him just as tightly in its grasp . IIe needs his " tonic , " or thinks he does , because he does not follow the laws of life , but closes his eyes upon them and sets up standards of his own . Unhappily his standards are at war with heaven , and so he pays his price in death . The time has come when we must teach the child that if he wishes to live and grow strong and be useful he must eat the food God has made necessary to the growth of his body . We shall soon learn how to select that food . // ? 25 ? WONDERS OF PLANT AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve food minerals are built up into many highly complex combinations , and as they are being built up they are also being broken clown . In disease they break down faster than in health . As the tissue is destroyed by daily wear and tear it is transformed into simpler chemical compounds and passed out of the body . In order that the living body may replace its broken down cells it must find a constant new supply of the elements from which those cells are evolved . These elements , as we find them in the soil , can be called nonliving matter . The chemical processes which transform this nonliving matter into living tissues are the same in plant and animal with this one difference : Plants are capable of taking the non-living matter from the earth , compounding or organizing it into the wonderfully complex substances which form their structure . Animals do not possess this power . Animals depend for their existence upon foodstuffs prepared from the non-living matter of earth by the plants that have the power to prepare them . Otherwise man could eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements necessary to his existence . We have seen why he can not do this . Plants obtain the energy which enables them to perform their mysterious work of organising the non-living matter of earth from the sun . Only in the presence of sunlight can they carry on the upbuilding processes which give them their tissues . Green grass will not grow in the dark . We know under the influence of sunlight plants are capable of combining the carbonic gas and nitrogen of the air with water and the mineral salts of the soil into such substances as starch , fat , and albumen . They always do this in the presence of the food minerals . Their ability to bring about these changes depends upon the presence of a chemical substance found in their green part which is called chlorophyl . We know that chlorophyl requires exposure J , ' ' 1 ' 111S FAMISHING 1VORLD to the sun 's rays in order that it may be able to perform its serious work , but of the processes by which it does that work we know little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs of the body contain substances that can be extracted . These substances are called enzymes or ferments or vitamins . Some of them are pepsin , trypsin , ptyalin . There are many others which need not be mentioned here . These ferments and vitarnines are found in the germ and bran of grains , in the marrow of bones , in egg yolk , in leaves , fruit juices , whole milk and greens , and are just as indispensable to the health of the body as the food minerals . We now know positively that in the human body they serve the purpose of changing the various foodstuffs which are furnished to the animal by the plant into substances that can be absorbed and built up into animal tissues . Ordinary bakers ' yeast is a ferment having the power to transform starch and sugar into alcohol and carbonic gas . It possesses the power to rearrange the molecular composition of sugar and starch . It is a strange but interesting fact that formaldehyde and wood alcohol , which are deadly poisons , contain exactly the same elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and acetic acid , whiskey , and vinegar . Starch , cane sugar , glucose , lactic acid , and carbolic acid also contain the same elements exactly ? carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen . The only difference among them is in proportion and arrangement . It is this arrangement which makes some of them beneficial foods and some of them deadly poisons . Ordinary starch can be converted into sugar by the action of ferments . Sugar can then be converted by the action of other ferments into lactic acid , alcohol , and acetic acid , depending entirely upon the character of the ferment employed . In other words , there are good and had ferments . That we sometimes allow the bad ferments to develop and kill off the good ones with so-called " harmless " preservatives will be shown as we proceed . It was thought at one time that the ferments found in the // digestive glands were the only ferments to be found in the animal body . Accordingly our knowledge of their conduct in the processes of digestion was limited and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reason that the cause was never suspected . It has been determined in recent years that ferments are of many kinds , are present in every cell and are intimately concerned in all the manifestations of life . As many as a dozen different ferments have been found , for example , in the liver cells . it has also been demonstrated that for the maintenance of life in the case of the higher plants the organised ferments are of profound importance . Through them the higher plants obtain their nitrogen from the air in a form which they can utilise . So it is seen that even in the presence of all the necessary food minerals , if the ferments be absent or destroyed or decomposed , vegetable or animal life can not be normal . Each of these ferments has a special function to perform . In the animal body , for instance , some of them , such as pepsin , can act to advantage only tinder acid condition . Others , such as ptyalin , require an alkaline condition . Still others can act under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control them . Certain ferments will act only upon certain definite substances and under the proper conditions . Fat-splitting ferments , for instance , act only upon lard , butter , cream , oil ; diastase ferments act only upon starch and sugar ; proteolytic ferments act only upon albumen . Of their chemical composition little is known that is definite and just as little is known of the equally important vitamines . We do know , however , that food of the wrong kind , food badly prepared , food which has suffered an unnatural loss of some of its elements , can set up conditions hostile to the action of these ferments , and that in setting up these conditions we invite physiological discord , disease . ) 1 THIS F:111ISIIING WORLD 26 ? THE " ASH " OF FOOD We know that human gastric juice is acid in action , that it contains sodium , calcium , potassium , magnesium , phosphorus , iron , and chlorine , and depends upon these elements for its physiological activities . We know if we remove any of these elements or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them , by removing them from our food , we thereby establish unnatural conditions in the gastric juice and inevitably bring about disorder . We know that pancreatic juice , unlike gastric juice , is alkaline in action and contains sodium , potassium , phosphorus , magnesium , and lime . From this fact we learn that one part of the digestion is carried on in an acid medium while another part is carried on in an alkaline medium , and our conception of the intricacies of the human laboratory increases in admiration and amazement . In our continued contemplation of these mysteries it becomes more and more evident that man has no right to ignore the wonderfully complicated structure of the human body when he decides to go into business and manufacture for profit the hundred foodless foods which have become so popular on the breakfast , dinner , and supper tables of unsuspecting Americans . The enzymes , ferments , and vitamines exert such a profound influence upon digestion and assimilation that we receive a shock when we learn that in the preparation of many of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nature that the functions which they are expected to perform are so modified as to make them useless . The mineral salts that we have described ; the ferments , enzymes , and vitamines ? let us put it bluntly ? are removed from our daily food by commercial practices that pander to false taste standards . The industries that remove them have succeeded , to some extent at least , in establishing high-sounding justification for their work and up to this stage of the world 's enlightenment have been equal to the task of fogging the atmoTWO // sphere sufficiently to cloud any attempted work of reform under the darkness of controversy . Chemists and pathologists are found willing to go on record with some such statements as these : " Of the metabolism of foods , of chemical change , of the exact action of enzymes and bacteria , we are profoundly ignorant , therefore we should not give consideration to the mineral contents of our diet . " We derive so many minerals from so many articles of food that we can afford to remove most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little is known about the conduct of these minerals when ingested with food that the subject is at least not important enough to occasion grave alarm . " There are so many offsetting foods which completely replace the mineral salts and vitamines lost through commercial methods of food refinement that we need not worry about the presence of these substances in our food supply . " Signed statements and magazine articles appearing regularly in the magazines of uplift , the purpose of which is everlastingly to quiet natural anxieties concerning commercial foodstuffs , in spite of the death of 400,000 children under ten years of age in the United States every year , constitute the defence of those whose food industries would suffer if the people enacted state and national laws that would forbid them to denature their food supply . For reasons of their own these men tell us we have sufficient carbohydrates , proteins , and fats ( bread , meat , and butter ) , so we need not bother about the minerals or ferments of our food . Yet they admit they know nothing about the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of in connection with a description of food was the academic division made by dietitians . This division consisted of three groups- ,  --  carbohydrates , proteins , and fats . There was another division to which some of them , on rare occasions , slurringly referred . They called this fourth division " ash . " The division of ash was always exasperatingly ignored and apparently had little if any meanin , for dietitians and was not considered by them as significant or important . As it began to dawn upon various investigators working at different places in Europe and America that a diet of pure carbohy9 ( i THIS FAMISIIING WORLD dratcs , pure proteins , and pure fats would not support life , the subject of " ash " grew more formidable and more fascinating . Physicians and chemists everywhere admitted that personally they knew nothing about ash in relationship to food and did not know where to obtain information . It is the ash of food that contains the mineral salts of that food . When the mineral salts are removed they take the vitamines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demineralised food , debased , impoverished , foodless food , were consumed along with good and adequate food by the 400,000 children under ten years of age who died in the United States last year . How many of them would be alive and well to-day if none of their foods had been denatured , if all of it had been good and adequate ? That is the question we must answer here . ? 27 ? CALCIUM IN THE LIVING BODY The history of life on this earth , including the history of microorganisms , or germs , as they are popularly called , is the history of food . As the bodies of men are built from the building materials found in food , so the bodies of bacteria are also built from the building materials found in their food . Bacteria may become violently active , or feeble to the point of exhaustion , in accordance with the kind of food offered them . Man is affected by his food in the same way . The blushing maiden of sixteen and the trained athlete of thirty are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man , normally approaching the hour of dissolution , represents all that is left of the processes of assimilation and elimination which , even prior to birth , were carried on only by virtue of the food energies presented to the embryo from which he came . The new-born babe , in all the pink freshness of its little sleepy // life , represents only that fragment of the food appropriated by its bones and tissues during its embryonic existence . The bacteria that convert milk , eggs , meat , fish , and other foods into poisons , represent , according to their activity , the ease with which they are able to find the kind of food necessary to their rapid growth or the difficulty placed in the way of their normal nutrition and reproduction . Bacteria , with a significance worthy of noting here , depend upon the mineral salts and colloids precisely in the same manner as that in which the bodies of men depend upon them . As we go along we shall encounter many interesting , not to say fascinating , proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a certain combination of some twelve mineral elements is surrendered by our food for the building processes of our bodies . All foods contain some of these building materials ; other foods contain all of them . Many foods , for instance , contain calcium in the highly organised combinations which are acceptable to the needs of the human body . Commercial methods of manufacture remove this calcium from their products . Absurd methods of home-cooking also remove them . That such calcium loss should not be tolerated is disclosed by a study of the functions performed in the body by calcium . Calcium assists the digestive ferments to perform their duties . When food is robbed of its calcium normal digestion does not progress . This influence on ferments is not confined to the digestive tract . In the laboratory and the food factory also we see it at work . Rennet , for instance , is a ferment . It is used to make curd from milk . Curd is the first step in the manufacture of cheese . That the rennet may perform its duties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium natural to all normal milk be perfectly soluble . To make sure of this solubility the cheese-maker adds hydrochloric acid to the milk . He knows that if the calcium is thrown out of solution the curd will never become cheese . Oxalic acid would throw the calcium out of solution . So would sterilisation at the boiling point . In any mixture of milk so // treated the ferment rennet , thus deprived of the influence of calcium , refuses to operate and the cheese maker makes no cheese . 1 f , while in a state of health , you should cut your finger , the soluble calcium in your blood would cause it to coagulate at the surface of the wound and you would not bleed to death , as you would if it were not for the interference of the calcium at the disposal of nature . In certain diseases where the normal content of calcium is no longer present in the blood the wound refuses to heal . One of the commonest symptoms of anxmia , acidosis , nervous prostration , etc. , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeons , realising the importance of this function performed by calcium , frequently attempt to introduce it into the blood before serious operations in the form of calcium lactate . They do this in order to prevent hemorrhage following the use of the knife . No hint of the function performed by calcium is ever found on a bill of fare in a restaurant or hotel . No placard hangs on the wall in the office of the food factory cautioning the factory manager against the toleration of any process of refinement through which calcium or any of the other mineral elements of prepared food are removed and lost to the human family . Yet when we diminish the proper quantity of calcium in our blood we correspondingly lower our vitality and reduce our resistance to disease . 28 ? CHILDREN SUFFER , PROSPECTIVE MOTHERS DECLINE In every kitchen , restaurant , hotel , boarding house , hospital , orphan asylum and commissary food , through ignorant methods of cookery , is not only robbed of its calcium but it is also robbed of many of its other mineral salts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it of a large percentage of these priceless mineral elements . 1 ) r . James R. Mitchell , while lecturer of chemistry at Fort Worth University Medical College , supplemented the work of other investigators by a study which showed 86 per cent . of the // school children of Louisville were suffering from defective teeth , in spite of the fact that they live in the " limestone " state . It has been said that Kentucky is a veritable quarry of calcium . Yet , in the presence of millions of tons of bone and toothbuilding material the children of this calcium kingdom had so much difficulty in finding sufficient calcium for their needs that 86 per cent . of them , in the calcium capital itself , manifested the most conspicuous symptoms of calcium starvation . With a zeal born of indignation , and therefore , because of its ardor , considered in high places unethical , Mitchell pointed out how dentists prescribe tooth washes and tooth-pastes ; how they advocate oral hygiene ; how they fill cavities and fit bridges , while all the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a deficiency of calcium salts in the food the body will actually tear down its own structure in order to obtain the calcium necessary to maintain the integrity of its internal secretions . In the case of a calcium deficiency in the food the body goes to the only available source of calcium supply , the lime of the teeth and bones . That lime is gradually consumed until , weakening the structure of the teeth , it finally leaves but a shell of fluoride enamel over a honey-combed structure . In Ireland , where calcium deficiency is conspicuous , there is an old saying among the peasantry . " With every child goes a tooth , " runs this adage . The fact that maternity is so frequently followed by tooth troubles , a result of the demand of the unborn upon the mother 's tissue for bone-building calcium , has been noted by many observers and probably accounts for the quotation credited to Irish women . Where calcium is abstracted from the tooth under-structure , the thin enamel , made thinner by fluorine starvation , sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenue for the entrance of putrefactive bacteria , which begin the work of true decay . The ruin is really accomplished long before any evidence of decay is disclosed . Sugar and fruit acids have no effect on the enamel of normal teeth . Sound teeth can be immersed in a solution of sugar or // fruit acids for mouths and suffer no erosion . The experiments of F. Howard Tunison and others have proved this . Sugar does not act directly on the teeth at all , and the dentist treats the symptom , not the cause , of bone destruction when he plugs up cavities and fits bridges . This observation is not intended to minimise in any manner the importance of skilful dental treatment , keen appreciation of which is not wanting by the writer . Sugar and calcium possess a remarkable affinity for each other . When refined sugar or glucose , both of which are mineralfree and , therefore , like distilled water mineral-hungry , are consumed in generous quantities they attack the soluble calcium of the tissues . The tissues retaliate in turn by sapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands a minimum calcium content , with never relaxing energy steals calcium from the teeth and bones . The experiments of Voit and others prove this . Druggists know how wonderfully calcium combines with sugar . Accordingly they manufacture what is known as syrup of lime . One thousand parts of water will take up approximately one part of calcium . When sugar is added the water will take up approximately thirty-five times as much calcium . Children will suffer and prospective mothers decline as long as they consume an excess of refined or denatured , mineral-free sugar , glucose and starch in their diet or as long as food industries continue to remove the soluble mineral elements from the chief sources of their food supply . As we advance step by step in our study of the indispensable food minerals we shall approach one of the prolific causes of infant mortality ; one of the prolific causes of pallor and anaemia among women and , as shall be conclusively proved in its proper place , one of the greatest single causes behind the difficulties of maternity as well as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack child and adult alike . Butcher shops grind the bones of the ox , sheep , and hog into what they call " chicken bone . " It has been noted by poultry and egg producers that if hens are not fed a plentiful supply of calcium in the form of such " chicken bones " or in the form of cracked oyster shells or other similar calcium food , they will lay // soft-shelled eggs for a while , then cease to lay eggs of any kind . The dog which on a meat diet is not also fed bone will , like the human , suffer tooth decay . His skin will be tettered ; his hair will fall out , his disposition will be mean . The lioness of the circus cage fed with meat alone brings forth cubs with cleft palates . Meat does not provide the calcium necessary to the formation of the bones of her cubs . Caged mice fed with distilled water and processed corn meal , such as is purchasable in every grocery store in the United States , develop " nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also develop " nerves . " As the calcium-free diet is continued the mice are stricken with convulsions , passing in the meantime through all the symptoms of pellagra , beri-beri , acidosis , and general prostration . What are the effects of the removal of the calcium from the food consumed by the large army of adults afflicted at the age of forty and beyond with hardening of the arteries , heart disease , Bright 's disease , diabetes , cancer , etc. ? ? 29 ? ADD ARTIFICE AND SUBTRACT NATURE In the laboratory when pneumonia germs are studied it is found that a little sprinkle of calcium will revive a culture in a stationary state . Calcium is necessary for the strength of the bones , for the hardness of the teeth , for the firmness of the muscles , for the tone of the nerves , for the coagulation of the blood on demand , for every pulsation of the heart , for the digestion of the food , for the functioning of the kidneys and other vital organs , for the health of the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones are softened . The muscle deprived of its calcium quivers and twitches . The nerves under such deprivation act in similar manner . We know how oxalic acid acts on the body when introduced with food . We do not know how other chemicals act upon tissue calcium , yet the food manufacturer who employs other chemicals gives no thought to the manner in which his germicidal agents may interfere with the integrity of life 's processes . Food manufacturers declare their chemical preservatives are " harmless . " Scientists are found to agree with them . Thus they set up arguments of such plausible and convincing character that the government has been prevailed upon to permit them to employ chemicals in the manufacture of a hundred food products . One thing is certain . There is premature and untimely death everywhere . Men and women suffer out fifty years of more or less misery instead of living the same fifty years in a state of bounding , buoyant energy and health . Yet eminent professors declare it is unscientific to connect untimely death and preventable ills with the follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress whether it is unscientific to establish such a connection between food folly and disease or whether it is the refusal to admit such connection which is unscientific . This we know . Some dozen drugs can now be legally put into food intended for interstate commerce and another dozen are permitted by various state governments in the manufacture of foods not intended for interstate commerce . At least twelve necessary mineral elements can be legally taken out of foods intended for interstate commerce . Thus the manufacturer is permitted to add to nature 's formula or subtract from it at will , depending entirely upon what he considers necessary in attaining the commercial results desired . The 400,000 children under ten years of age who died last year loved their " innocent " cakes , cookies , crackers and biscuits ; their " innocent " white bread smeared with syrup and factory jam ; their " innocent " gorgeously coloured candies . We smile at the very thought of the farmer mixing with his carefully and scientifically prepared food the red , blue , green , yellow , brown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law permits the manufacturer of foods intended for human consumption to use . We smile at the thought of his adding to his cattle food borax , sulphurous acid , saccharine , sodium benzoate , copper sulphate , aluminum sulphate , anhydrous sodium sulphite , butyric ether , amyl ether , cenanthic ether , ethel ether , valarienate ether , formic ether , benzoic ether , acetic ether , esters , aldehydes , coumarin , // vanillin , pyrolygneus acid , soap bark , furniture glue , lamp black , shellac , gum benzoin , paraffins , stearic acid , hydrogenated fats , hydrolised starch and other foodless substances so frequently mixed with the food of the growing child and the nursing mother . All these substances at this hour are now in use in the United States . With the exception of borax and copper sulphate they are all legal . Little pigs are tenderly cared for ; the young colt , the baby calf , the wee chicks , are watched with a solicitous eye . Caution , vigilance , common-sense , scientific knowledge , are exercised to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when money is invested in animals they are fed on a diet carefully arranged and their young do not die untimely deaths when their food is of a proper kind . But human beings ! That is another matter . The law says , " You shall not consume carbolic acid , arsenic , opium , cocaine , morphine or heroin , nor shall you purchase them under any circumstances whatsoever unless the law 's restrictions are removed by trained and licensed physicians . " The law also says in substance : " The food of your children may be whatsoever the food manufacturer sees fit to sell you . " You are now prepared for the long neglected truths concerning that great human destroyer ? the white bread of America . You will now learn exactly how your daily bread is robbed of its vitalising mineral elements , not its calcium alone but its iron , potassium , magnesium , silicon , phosphorus , iodine , its ferments , enzymes and vitamines . You will now learn how to go about the work of getting your share of straightforward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children to consume . ? 30 ? WI'ALKING WITH A BROKEN STAFF Three times each day for three hundred and sixty-five days each year a table is spread in each of twenty million households in the United States . This means that sixty million meals , however sim111E ' rIIIS 1.1.11ll IIING WORLD I , ! c , are served for the pleasure and nutrition of the family between the rising and setting of every sun . At each of these annual billions of occasions ? the exceptions are too few to count ? 21,900,000,000 , to be exact , the housewife places one article of food on the table . Whether that table be set in a mansion or in a hovel , whether it be loaded with an abundance of the luxuries of life or whether its contents be confined to one or two simple articles of food , there is one food always present . Is it to be wondered at , therefore , that bread is called the " staff of life " ? What then if the staff on which humanity leans so trustingly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded tell us peculiar and wonderful things about flour . Millions of dollars are spent annually to inform us that our flour is washed , brushed , scoured , screened , and sifted through grits gauze and silk bolting cloth until nothing leaves the mill but utterly perfect flottr ! As late as August , 1918 , The Saturday Evening Post published an advertisement of the Quaker Oats Company , frankly telling the public that " Quaker Best Corn Meal " contains none of the fibrous outer coat , none of the oily germ , nothing but the flinty starchy part . Millions of dollars are spent annually to exploit the virtues of anemic crackers , denatured biscuits , and foodless cakes . Devoted mothers , believing the statements made to them through the highly coloured printed page and the gaudily decorated bill-board , rely with a profound faith upon the demineralised nutriment which advertising art extols . Their babes , from the very beginning , are taught with a broken staff to walk . Thus is reared a race of such vigour that it sends in one year nearly 400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starchy biscuits are no longer needed . Nature never made a white grain of wheat and man never knew the meaning of white flour until he conceived the fetching idea of startling his guests with bread as white and lifeless as the aristocratic napery on which it is served . The unrefined grain of wheat as it comes from the field contains in organic form the twelve mineral substances needed for the health , growth and life of the animal body . Chickens , guinea // pigs , white mice , or monkeys fed on bread made from the unre-fined wheat thrive indefinitely , but chickens , guinea pigs , white mice , or monkeys fed on an exclusive white bread diet perish in from five to seven weeks . Wherefore the whiteness of white bread ? IIow is this white-ness obtained ? These are questions which we have set out to answer . White bread becomes white because from the ground grain of wheat three-fourths of the mineral salts and colloids , including the salts of calcium , phosphorus , iron , potassium , chlorine , fluo-rine , sulphur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mineral substances are contained in the brown outer skin , the cells underneath this skin and the germ of the wheat berry . They are sifted and bolted out of the ground meal leaving behind the white starchy cells and the refined gluten of the interior part of the berry . Nature , in her most benevolent efforts to teach man that he can not trespass with impunity against the laws of life , through thousands of years of agricultural experience , has failed to im-press him with the priceless value of these subtle substances in the assembling of which for his needs she travels through so many subtle and divers paths . In the whitening of flour not only are the mineral salts and col-loids removed from the wheat , but its ferments or vitamines , one of which was discovered by M. Mege Mouries in the inner cortical part of the wheat , are rejected . The millers who make our flour and our corn meal assure us that they are conferring a great blessing upon humanity in pre-paring a refined white product . To obtain a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an electro-chemical process the demineralised flour which passes through their silk bolting cloths . To confront them with 400,000 children under ten years of age who died in the United States last year , notwithstanding the daily familiarity with white breadstuffs which these children suffered without resistance , is but to provoke a smile fortified by " proofs " of the benevolence of their conduct . These " proofs " usually bear the signature of scientists . What scientists ' signatures can open up those little graves and deliver back to the fond and empty arms of grieving parents the 1O ( ' I ' 111S FAMISHING WORLD niill ; n five hundred thousand children that have died in this country during the past four years ? hat will scientists ' signatures do for the enfeebled soldiers whu survive the European war or for their half-fed widows and orphans during the reconstruction period that faces them ? I n the many public controversies which I have had with the millers they have frankly admitted that they do not give the people white flour or white bread products through their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want white flour and white bread they are obliged to cater to such wants . These admissions are nevertheless usually accompanied by a statement that white bread as contrasted with bread made from the whole grain possesses " superior digestibility . " Nothing is said of the alarming increase of cancer , diabetes , Bright 's disease , heart disease and hardening of the arteries now causing so much concern among life insurance companies on account of the fact that their chief victims are found in middle age . Nothing is said about the fact that at the age of forty , when man should be at his best , and continuing until his fiftieth year the increase in these diseases is at its height . There is much evidence to indicate that middle-age mortality is directly associated with denatured food . All of such evidence will be submitted here in its proper place . Of course there are other causes also at work in the production of some of these increasingly prevalent middle-age diseases but the facts which will be treated with sufficient detail , indicate conclusively that demineralised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " DIGESTIBILITY " AND " INDIGESTIBILITY " There are many prejudices to overcome before whole wheat bread , whole wheat cakes , whole wheat biscuits , whole wheat muffins , whole wheat waffles and other whole wheat breadstuffs , with all their wealth of vitality , can be restored to the people . Some of the millers declare the bran of wheat is a powerful irritant and , therefore , people not in normal health can not use it without injury . // They say whereas bran in whole wheat might be advantageous in special cases ? an admission suggested by the recent appearance on the market of numerous brands of bran ? it is an undesirable element in bread because it is " indigestible . " Pepper is " indigestible , " so is nutmeg , cinnamon , ginger , mustard , mace , allspice , cloves . The fibre of orange , pineapple , celery , string beans , asparagus , canteloupe , is " indigestible . " The seeds of strawberries , raspberries , figs , grapes , are " indigestible , " just as the bran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , if the word " indigestible " is assumed to mean that in their journey through the body none of these substances is taken up by the body and transformed into tissue . None of such substances is actually indigestible . In its course through the body the bran surrenders its soluble extractives which are taken up by the tissues and the residue which remains behind is a water absorber . As such it performs a most important and necessary function in the intestines . Every time we eat a roasted or boiled ear of corn we eat the bran . Every time we eat Boston baked beans or fresh peas we eat the bran of these legumes . It is well that we eat these things because , while they are not digested in themselves in the sense of being taken up and oxidised in the production of heat or energy , they nevertheless contribute to the body the soluble salts and colloids which they contain and without which energy-producing foods are useless to the living body . Let us take an animal membrane such as a bladder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals and hang it on a nail against the wall . It will hang there for days , weeks , or months , and there will be no leakage of its contents through the skin . Not a drop will ooze through the membrane to appear on the outside . We see that it guards its contents as faithfully as would a glass bottle properly corked . If we now take the filled bladder and immerse it in a tub containing another solution of different density a remarkable phenomenon will be observed . The contents of the bladder will begin to pass out through the membrane into the solution on the outside , and the solution on the outside will begin to pass through the membrane to the inside , so that eventually the solution on the // outside and the solution on the inside will be identical in character .

As long as life continues osmosis does not cease . Protoplasm derives its nutriment through this process of osmosis . In fevers or wasting diseases accompanied by extreme exhaustion as the result of inability to consume food , or in cases of starvation , the fluids inside the cells gradually become identical in specific gravity with the fluids in which they are bathed so that osmosis becomes very feeble . When it ceases altogether death ensues . The minerals nature has put into wheat and the other grains and man so deliberately removes from his diet are lost to all his needs and the vitalising mission they are designed to perform are not performed . Just as chopped meat surrenders its mineral salts to the water in which it is immersed so also does the bran of the grain surrender its minerals to the internal secretions of the body . But bran not only furnishes indispensable mineral salts to the body . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alimentary tract by which the contents of the intestines are kept moving onward and downward . One of the curses white bread and refined grain foods impose upon humanity is constipation . A thousand ills are traceable to this disorder . Patent medicines by the hundreds have been marketed in order to help pill-consumers bridge over the misery their white bread inflicts upon them . Constipation is the malevolent origin of the woes of many American women who , through the congestion set up by inhibited peristalsis , are afflicted with uterine and ovarian disease that make their lives miserable . Constipation is not the trifling disorder the public foolishly believes it to be . We are about to see how grave it really is and to // what extent it undermines the health and vitality of America . A proper understanding of the significance of constipation will destroy the white bread superstition . 32 ? coNsTIvATJoN The world little suspects the gravity of constipation , or the readiness with which it submits to correction . : veil the physician needs to be reminded of the serious nature of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John IT . Musser and George Morris Piersol of the University of Pennsylvania have to say to their brother physicians throughout the United States if you would appreciate the folly of looking upon constipation as a trifling disease . Here are their words : " No clinical symptom is more frequently encountered in the practice of medicine than constipation . The commonplace and obstinate character of the affection is perhaps responsible for the prevalence of the idea that constipation is a necessary evil rarely capable of permanent cure . " As a result of this false and dangerous attitude the people are prone to look upon the condition with indifference , which allows them to be content with a certain degree of temporary relief , too often brought about by the easiest means at their disposal , namely , the use of purgative drugs . " This attitude is not only erroneous , it is harmful . Constipation is but a symptomatic expression of some underlying disorder , and any treatment to be efficient must be directed , not to the temporary removal of the symptom , but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general causes of constipation . These consist in food which is deficient in residue ( bran ) by reason of which the bowel is deprived of the mechanical and chemical stimuli necessary to promote proper intestinal activity . " A diet suitable for constipation must be one which will furnish adequate stimuli to the intestinal mucosa by means of undeposited // residue and the various chemical substances elaborated during its digestion . " Do these words of Drs . Musser and Piersol , directed in such serious manner to the medical profession , clash with the philosophy of ridicule preached by the millers ? To the victims of constipation who are so easily influenced by plausible assertions I leave the answer . " Be careful , " say the millers , " on your journey , John , not to eat any white bread . If you do your teeth will fall out . Be sure somewhere to get a spoonful of bran in your grub or you will become a victim of the Philippine itch . Keep a sharp lookout for that brown , brindled , spotted rough stuff known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the face of this sort of attack , aimed at the weakness of human nature to withstand the assaults of ridicule , however farfetched , great truths are content to be smothered and old evils abide with us unmolested . Drs . Musser and Piersol are explicit in their art , - to their fellow-physicians . Here are their plain statements : " Whole wheat bread , whole rye bread , or pumpernickel should be used in preference to white bread . " Whole oatmeal and the coarser cereals , such as whole cornmeal , are important adjuncts . " The scoffers must surely experience difficulty in dismissing such statements when they emanate from recognised authorities . What we want , however , are not statements , but proofs . This is why we began at the beginning , why we are content to make progress step by step , why we are dealing only in established facts . The references of Musser and Piersol to whole oatmeal , whole corn meal , and the coarser cereals will , in their proper places , release a volley of proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke a panic among the commercial beneficiaries of denatured breakfast-foods and breadstuffs . It has been conclusively established that bread made of the whole wheat , just as it comes through the cleaning machines from the field , together with the other unrefined foods to which these words are dedicated , will save our daughters and our daughters ' // children from the hundred evils which food follies have imposed upon them . Dr. Albert Westlake , in his paper on " Babies ' Teeth to the Twelfth Year , " says : Babies ' teeth should receive consideration at least six months before the child is born . Necessary elements in their building are furnished at this period by the mother 's blood . " Teeth require more organic phosphates , particularly the phosphates of calcium , and more calcium carbonate than other parts of the body ; therefore , bone food is necessary for the mother ( cows ' milk , eggs , especially yolks , peas , beans , lentils , whole wheat , outer grains , etc . ) . Dietetic treatment for the mother is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intestines of the child are also undergoing vital changes at this period and earlier . This includes , as has been established by Dr. Herbert D. Pease , the primary fixation of the child 's intestine in the left hypochondriac region . " It is therefore vital to the off-spring to establish perfect peristalsis of the mother 's intestines . Elimination and evacuation should he regular without drugs . Constipation is the enemy of both mother and child . " ? 33 ? SUSPECTED CAUSES OF CANCER Because constipation in the United States causes more human misery than drunkenness we shall not dismiss the subject until it is considered in connection with the prevalence of acidosis and cancer , now on the rapid increase from coast to coast . The demand for laxative pills , cathartics and heart depressors for the relief of constipation and the headaches due to the absorption of retained toxines from congested intestines overloaded with decay , is greater than the demand of the " morning after " for bracers . It is needless to reassert this truth , for all of us know that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveted by the human race we shall be told that " constipation pills " sit 11 ' 2 TI HS F , AMISHING WORLD on tlu mountain top of popular clamour for relief from distress . The average creature , who lives largely on food deficient in cellulose , fibre , and mineral salts , needs no description of the misery constipation begets , but there is another warning for such creatures which should not be ignored . Diagnosticians are agreed that many of the ills that plague human nature are preceded by a history of constipation . They also agree that freedom from constipation averts many ills . They are not agreed upon the cause of cancer . Some of them believe cancer is a premature aging and breaking down of the cells . They hold that certain cells become aged while the tissues around them are still in a state of comparative youth . The aging cells they say express their senility by returning to a more embryonic form and as they do so increase in number , thus resulting in the morbid growth they call cancer . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the manifestations of degenerating cells . Other cancer specialists hold that cancer is the direct result of irritation , either mechanical or chemical , and that it may be produced by the absorption of an unidentified poison . Still others believe that it is produced by the invasion of a parasite yet unrecognised and too small to be discovered by the most powerful microscope . While they are all in doubt about the origin of cancer , they all know it is increasing at the rate of 2.4 per cent . a year in the United States . Dr. Horace Packard of Boston University , discussing the cancer question before the Surgical and Gynecological Society of the American Institute of Homoeopathy at Chicago , June 28 , 1915 , declared that demineralised foods form a factor in the development of cancer . " The human family is underfed in mineral food salts , " he said . " A momentous fact is that the flour mills of the civilised world are busy eliminating every particle of iron , phosphorus , sodium , potassium , silicon , calcium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our staple food supply and sending out food material rich in heat units but pitifully meagre in energising and immunising material . " Since a critical examination of the habits of life of civilised // cancer-plagued people in comparison with the habits of primitive cancer-free people shows that the main difference between them is in a dietary poor in mineral salts among the cancerplagued people and a dietary rich in mineral salts among the cancer-free people , the most logical and rational course is to adopt this as a keynote to cancer treatment . " All forms of malignant disease are possible only because of absence of or loss of immunity . All animal life in normal state of environment and supplied with nutriment hearing all the organic ingredients necessary for the maintenance of disease-resisting vitality possesses in itself a protective immunity to cancer . " In view of the well established fact that in the vegetable world an adequate supply of the earth 's salts , phosphorus , potassium , iron , magnesium , silicon , calcium , etc. , acts as a distinctive deterrent of parasitic life and makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the animal world ? " There is indeed a direct relationship between the known causes of constipation and the suggested causes of cancer . This relationship is based upon the loss of cellulose , mineral salts , colloids , and vitamines in our breakfast foods and breadstuffs . Take , for instance , the bran of wheat , one of the food elements lost to modern cancer-plagued civilisation . Wheat bran consists of three layers , all of which contain larger proportions of cellulose or fibre than the interior of the grain . The two outer layers contain more of the phosphorus , calcium , and iron compounds than the other parts of the grain ; while the innermost layer contains a special kind of protein , which is the seat of the indispensable vitamines lost in the milling of wheat . As we have seen , bran is not so " digestible " as first-patent flour for the reason that all of first-patent flour is absorbed whereas all of the bran is not absorbed . The mistake of estimating the food value of any food by its ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities and it is to be hoped the medical profession will soon give to the non-absorbable food elements the importance that belongs to them . THREE : WHY MODERN REFINING PROCESSES ARE MORE DEADLY THAN WAR ? 34 ? CORN MEAL OR CORNLESS MEAL The folly of comparing the " digestibility " of white patent flour with the " indigestibility " of bran is self-revealed through the very nature of the arguments employed by the millers . " Complete absorption " means constipation . Deficiency of mineral salts means constipation . Absence of cellulose or fibre means constipation . Bran takes up moisture and holds it in the intestines , thereby making the intestinal mass more elastic , stimulating peristalsis and increasing the rhythmic waves of contraction and relaxation so necessary to the process of elimination . Bran surrenders to the body the solubles it contains . These solubles , physiologically active , are absorbed to perform the metabolic task assigned them . Had God not meant them to be present He would not have called them from the void . Bran is but one of the discarded particles of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overemphasised at the expense of the other discarded particles . Bran in itself is not a food ; it is merely a natural constituent of wheat , corn , rice , peas , beans , etc . White patent flour contains approximately 11 per cent , protein ; bran contains 15 per cent . Flour contains 1 per cent . fat ; bran contains 4 per cent . The lecithins or phosphorised fats are found in the bran and in the germ of the grain . In the milling of patent flour and relined corn meal the lecithins are discarded . Patent flour , like refined corn meal , contains less than onehalf of 1 per cent , mineral salts . The bran and germ of the grain contain nearly ten times as much . Of phosphorised compounds alone bran contains twelve times as much as patent flour . This does not mean that bran is a substitute for whole meal . It is not . Bran lacks many of the elements found in the cells 117 // of the thin miter skin of the wheat . It is the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added and nothing removed , that is ground into honest , adequate , God-given meal . Such meal is rich in all the food minerals and vitamines essential to animal life , containing just that quantity of bran necessary to make constipation impossible . Where constipation is avoided the absorption of the irritating and poisonous end-products or toxines of intestinal putrefaction is rendered quite impossible . Thus one of the suspected causes of cancer and of many other diseases , including hardening of the arteries , is also avoided . Involuntary suicide and auto-intoxication are synonymous . The proposition that bran or any other food adjunct will cure cancer is not advanced here . Foolish would be the cancer victim who resorted to bran as a cancer cure , but there can no longer be any doubt that the absence of these essential food substances from the diet are responsible for the development of many diseases . Our government in 1917 , to extend the supply of wheat and to improve the nutrition of the masses , contemplated the wisdom of restricting the consumption of wheat to whole wheat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their industry , succeeded in thwarting the movement . Our government then urged us to eat wheat substitutes , emphasising corn in particular . Certainly our boys " over there " wanted us to follow our government 's suggestion . They wanted us to eat corn . We can say this positively , because we know they wanted us to do everything necessary to win the war . We knew that without the sacrifice of life on the battlefield and without the sacrifice of pet ideas and cherished habits at home , speedy and decisive victory could not be achieved , yet we did not consume corn as we should . We did not make a soldier 's honest effort to secure the kind of corn we should have had . Our indifference to corn can be explained by the fact that the kind of corn now served to us is not only flavourless , due to the milling system that robs it of its flavour , but like white wheat flour , it lacks the indispensable substances of an adequate diet . In asking us to eat corn our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn . We can get the right kind of corn by going after it . God grows no other kind . We know that corn will produce the finest poultry ever grown , but we have doubted its value as a human food , not knowing that the kind of corn fed to poultry is not the kind fed to the human . We know that corn will produce an abundance of eggs , but we are sceptical of its ability to nourish human tissues , not realising that the kind of corn ' fed to human beings will not produce eggs . We know that corn will produce the heaviest and meatiest beef which only the great corn belt of the Middle-West is capable of producing , but we assume that it will not put on the backs of men the flesh it will put on the backs of cattle . Yes , it is true that the kind of corn fed to man will starve cattle . The near-corn for which man tries with little success to develop an appetite will kill poultry , hogs and cows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Children fed on it to the exclusion of other offsetting foods will speedily develop pellagra . Children fed on it with an insufficiency of milk and fruit so lose vitality and resistance to disease that they become easy victims of any infection that passes along . What then is the difference between corn that will nourish animals and near corn that will kill animals ? between corn that will nourish men and near corn that will not nourish them ? Why do farmers recognise this difference , providing only the right kind of corn as food for the animals in which their money is invested ? Why do fathers and mothers of children ignore facts that farmers apply to the development of their live stock ? Would our boys in the trenches , fighting for the betterment of the human race , ask us to answer these questions if they knew the answer , honestly applied to our own home needs , would increase our health , strength , stamina and endurance , and by releasing other necessary foods to our soldiers and our allies contribute heavily to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What then are the facts ? The whole kernel of corn contains ro per cent . protein . Re ' 12 0 ' I ' 1IIS FA ! ' IISHING WORLD fined corn meal contains less than 8 per cent . This protein difference is of little moment , but it represents a deficiency which becomes progressively worse as we go down the line of nutritive substances withdrawn from refined corn meal . Cod puts these substances in the grain ; man takes them out . The whole grain contains 4.3 per cent . fat derived chiefly from the germ . This fat is not like lard . It is a highly complex substance containing the " fat soluble A " without which no young animal or child can grow , and without which no adult can maintain health . In refined corn meal only one-fourth of the original fat of the kernel is preserved . In whole corn meal we find the vitalising mineral salts , all of them , to the extent of fifteen parts to the thousand , whereas in the refined corn meal only four parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . Like whole wheat , the kernel of corn has a fibrous outer skin beneath which is a layer rich in protein and phosphorus compounds of complex character . This layer is called the gluten layer . Within it lies the germ . All these layers and the germ itself with their rich mineral compounds and vitamines are discarded in feeding man , although carefully preserved in feeding animals . Yet the laws of nutrition apply to man and beast in the same manner . Not only do these substances , discarded in our effort to " improve " on God 's handiwork , contain the vitality of the corn , they also contain its flavour , both of which are lost in the refining process . This loss makes man instinctively turn his back on corn . Certainly in war and in the reconstruction that follows war we ought to be just as much concerned in putting beef on the backs of our soldiers and workers as upon our corn-fed animals . Thousands of our doctors and nurses went to the other side in 1918 . Surely when medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more resistance than ever . Why do we tolerate any dietetic condition that menaces the health of prospective mothers , of nursing mothers , of growing children , of workers in shipyards , munition plants , factories or shops ? // It is our duty to aim for efficiency and productivity , free from the handicap of preventable afflictions . Even in peace when we succumb to deficiency diseases caused by a one-sided diet our doctors can not help us unless they restore the missing nutritives of which we have been deprived . The archives of the United States Public Health Service at Washington are filled with records that prove this assertion . What , then , shall we do about it if we fail to insist that all our millers of corn meal shall give us the whole grain , freshly ground ? Of course , our mills should be nearby . Corn will keep for years unground . Only when tempered with water and ground long before it is needed does corn spoil . Spoiled corn is unfit for food , but it need not spoil . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demineralised , degerminated and impoverished meal he wants none of it to return a thousand miles to him " out of condition .

He is interested in the profit per package . Such ideals do not win wars , nor do they conserve the health of the nation , nor do they inspire men who understand them to lay down their lives in their perpetuation . Fortunately , at an expenditure of five or six dollars we can obtain little grinding machines for use at home . With them we can make our own whole corn meal as well as our own whole wheat meal if our grocers refuse to provide the unrefined product . Once the millers witness an invasion of their field by a sufficient number of hand mills to make them pause in their present system , they will begin to vie with each other in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TUBERCULOSIS , HEART DISEASE Constipation is the enemy of mother and child . It is widespread among adults of both sexes . It gives rise to many physi. 12 12 ' I'IIIS I ' ' : 1i11ISHING WORLD cal ilk which originate in congestion , inflammation , irritation , and absorbed toxines. ' there are many reasons why the prospective mother and her unborn babe should not be robbed of the salts of food . The millers will never know how many babies they have handicapped from birth . See section 99 . Be it remembered that no chemist can tell us in terms of grams anything about the exact quantity of phosphorus , iron , potassium , lime , silicon , sodium , magnesium , manganese , sulphur , chlorine , fluorine , or iodine which we should take into our bodies every day . Nature has fixed that mysterious and hidden formula for us , yet , confounded in our wisdom , we turn our backs upon the truth and seek destroying novelties in the paths of darkness . The chemist admits he can never tell us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health of the human creature . Three chemists at Columbia University devoted months to a study of but three of the twelve food minerals , determining nothing as to the quantity of them required , but determining everything as to their necessity . Humanity seems unwilling to trust the Creator in this respect . Eminent scientists seem unable to believe that all natural unrefined foods , whether they be fruits , grains or grasses , contain all the elements necessary to see them safely on their journey through the body . By assuming the right to manipulate , modify , or destroy the presence and proportion of these food minerals in commercial breadstuffs , they refuse to see the wreckage they have left in the wake of their mineral contempt . They do not know how they have burrowed into the vitality of human life while it is still in the mother 's womb . They do not suspect to what extent they have been responsible for anemia , tuberculosis , heart disease , and the other ills , such as pneumonia , diphtheria , scrofula , measles , appendicitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that follow lowered resistance and the destruction of immunity . We can not go into a theatre , church , public building , trolley car , or walk along the dusty city streets without inhaling the // living micro-organisms which cause tuberculosis , yet , if our resistance is normal , we need have no fear of the disease because the germs are destroyed as fast as they enter our bodies . If this were not so , because everybody is exposed to tuberculosis , all the nations of the earth would perish from this disease . In typhoid epidemics all do not develop the disease . Nor , mal vitality provides in some the resistance necessary to combat the assault , however violent . Through the facts to follow we may obtain some hint of the relationship our denatured foods now bear to the constant increase in those diseases of adult life , cancer , diabetes , Bright 's disease , appendicitis , hardening of the arteries , and organic heart disease , which are destroying so much of the best among men and women . ? 36 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate conception of the gigantic scale on which the nation is now undermining its vitality we must examine a few extraordinary figures as large and significant as the tabulations of disease and death with which they are related . In 1915 the United States produced the largest yield of wheat ever grown in any country of the world ? 1,002,029,000 bushels . This wheat was worth $932,888,999 . Of corn in 1915 the United States produced 3,090,509,000 bushels , worth $1,913,025,071 , the most valuable corn crop ever grown . The barley , rye , and rice crops of 1915 in point of production established records . The barley was worth $118,577,682 , the rye $37,861,403 , the rice $22,313,350 . In addition there was a record buckwheat crop worth $12 , - S54,750 . At the 1918 war values these grains were worth three times as much in cash but just as little in food value . Here surely , according to the statistics announced Nov. 8 , 1915 , by the Department of Agriculture , was reason for the 1:4 THIS 1.1IIN1ING WORLD celebration of a joyous Thanksgiving throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corn , barley , rye , rice , and buckwheat , from all of these hundreds of thousands of tons of the breadstuffs of the nation , the phosphorus was removed , the potassium was removed , the iron was removed , the manganese was removed , the magnesium was removed , three-quarters of all the mineral salts and colloids , all of the ferments , enzymes , and vitamines were removed . Two per cent . of the total weight of wheat consists of mineral salts . Rice contains less , oats more , corn nearly the same . What a tragedy has been enacted through the washing , screening , sifting , and bleaching of our wheat , through the brushing , scouring , and polishing of our rice , through the degerminating of our corn , through the pearling of our barley , through the thinning and extending of our buckwheat ; through the refining of our rye ! Take wheat alone as an index of the extent of the losses sustained by humanity through the denaturing processes through which all these grains are prepared for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57.9 pounds , a total of more than 580,000,000,000 pounds , of which 2 per cent. , or more than 5,000,000 tons , consisted of food minerals . Of these five million tons three-fourths were completely lost in the refining process . Here , with wheat alone , we witness the wanton destruction of nearly four million tons of the food elements most indispensable to the health of man , woman , and child . We see the deliberate rejection of the keystone of the arch , yet when we add to this the rejected food minerals of our corn , barley , rye , rice and buckwheat we build up a mountain of folly so colossal in its menace to the human race that well , indeed , may statesmen tremble when they behold its dimensions . Other nations have taken alarm as proof after proof of the ravages for which foodless foods are responsible have been disclosed . In May , 1912 , I received from the honourable secretary of the Bread and Food Reform League of England a record of the experiments conducted by Dr. Frederick Gowland Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chemical physiology of the University of Cambridge . Hopkins experimented with an 8o per cent . whole wheat meal which , though not containing all of the wheat , yet retained a much larger proportion of the bran and germ than white flour . Even with such semi-impoverished material the results of his investigations were so remarkable that they inspired a belated agitation in behalf of whole meal loaf or , as it was called by the London Daily Mail , " household bread . " At the same time Dr. E. S. Eddie and I ) r . G. C. Simpson , members of the research staff of the School of Tropical Medicine , University of Liverpool , carried on investigations in which the effects of refined flour and white bread upon children and adults were carefully studied in contrast with the effects of whole meal or whole wheat bread . An extended research was also conducted by Dr. Benjamin Moore of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , in which groups of pigeons were fed on bread made from fine white flour , while other groups of pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further irrefutable evidence of the essential health-giving qualities of those parts of grain and cereal foods which are discarded in the milling of flour , polishing of rice , pearling of barley , refining of rye , and the degerminating of corn . One thing we know : the mountain of rejected food minerals is balanced , alas , how inadequately , by a lake of patent medicines . ? 37-OUTER PARTS OF THE GRAINS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Dr. Frederick Gowland Hopkins , department of chemical physiology , University of Cambridge , will prove a stumbling block to all millers of " patent " flour . He says : " The superior value of whole wheat meal lies in the fact that it retains certain food substances whose presence allows our systems to make full use of the tissue-building elements of the grain . These substances are removed from the fine white flour in the milling . 1 ' ! ( i THIS FAMISHING VOII I.I ) " II my work to date confirms my belief in the superior food Vi ! of standard whole wheat bread . After definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on brown flour than on white flour , I have been able to improve the tissue building rate of the white flour subjects by adding to their white flour an extract made from the brown flour . " 1'o make the best use of any food material , such as the proteins for instance , certain other food substances and possibly a variety of them must also be present in definite proportions . " If one essential food constituent which ought to ma ' -e up at least i per cent . of the total food is present in only half its normal amount , then when it is a case of building up the tissues the system will only be able to make use of half of the other food elements even if these other food elements make up the main bulk of the food . " This principle has long been recognised as regards plant life and growth . A plant in order to attain perfect growth must find in the soil a certain minimum of each of many elements . " Consider , for example , the element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present , then , no matter how abundant may be all the other soil and air constituents , their normal utilisation is limited to one-half . The rate of growth and the ultimate development of the plant are consequently depressed . " The absolute amount of potassium employed in growth is very small compared with the carbon or nitrogen ; but any deficiency in it limits growth as surely as a deficiency in the more important elements . " The substances of unknown nature may need to be present in very small amount , but if the necessary minimum is not available the utilisation of other constituents in tissue growth or repair is infallibly deficient . " In the process of converting the wheat grain to fine white flour these elements are lost or destroyed . It follows that no matter how much nourishment they might otherwise contain our systems can not make the best use of such nourishment , owing to the absence of those elements necessary to their assimilation . " The conclusions of Eddie and Simpson of the research staff of the School of Tropical Medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiments of Hopkins . They say : " It has been proved by Braddon and other workers in the East that exclusive use of polished rice as a diet leads to a form of acidosis or peripheral neuritis . This disease does not occur in those native races who use whole rice or unpolished rice as a diet . " Our own experiments have been extended to similar work in relation to the stripping of the outer case from the wheat berry so as to produce a white bread instead of a brown bread and we find that parallel results are obtained when the outer layers are excluded from the diet with both wheat and rice . " These experiments clearly demonstrate that the outer part of the grain contains the essential constituents for the nutrition of the nervous system both in growing animals and in adults . " Benjamin Moore , chief of the biochemical department of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , as the result of his laboratory research , was forced to the following conclusions : " Groups of pigeons have been fed on fine white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadulterated , while similar groups of pigeons have been given an ordinary quality of whole wheat bread . " The white bread pigeons have all speedily developed marked symptoms of malnutrition and serious nerve derangements . Besides losing weight they sit listless and shivering , lose power in their legs , suggesting nerve paralysis , while many develop convulsions . " The whole wheat bread pigeons , on the other hand , continue healthy and up to normal weight . " In another series of experiments pigeons which had developed grave nervous symptoms on a white bread diet recovered completely when , after a week of special nursing , they were placed on an exclusive whole wheat bread diet ( luring their convalescence. " 38 ? STUNTING THE GROWTH OF THE YOUNG " All the recent work done in the biochemical laboratories of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine proves beyond 1 ' 21.4 THIS FAMISHING 1VORLI ) iluestioni that in all cereals , such as wheat , barley , oats and rice , there are series of important substances incorporated in the inner layer of the husk which are essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the words of Dr. Benjamin Moore , chief of the biochemical department of that institution . " I f these elements are eliminated in the milling or preparation of the grain , a diet largely composed of cereals or bread thus denatured will not only fail adequately to nourish the body , but will tend to set up active disease . " Certain of the diseases of malnutrition among children , notably rickets , scurvy-rickets , tetany and convulsions , present symptoms very similar to those we note in our white bread pigeons . So striking is this similarity that physicians who have followed up our work are already treating certain of their malnutrition patients with a diet of whole wheat bread . " Our nerves as a nation are much less stable than in the days prior to a white bread diet . All our work suggests that the growing tendency of the age to neurasthenia , ' nerves , ' etc. , is not unlikely due to removing from our diet those very elements of cereal food which nature has hid in the husk of the grain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A special meeting of the British Association and the Health Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health was called at Portsmouth to consider the results of the work done by Hopkins , Eddie , Simpson , and Moore . Little has come of this work for the reasons that such discussions usually take the form of ponderous scientific data and the people learn nothing of them . Prior to the investigations of these British scientists an extensive research into the same subject had been conducted in France . Armand Gautier , internationally eminent , had explored the entire field of nutrition , inspiring numerous other French scientists to undertake work of similar nature . All of them have arrived at the same conclusion . Man has lost the instinct of nourishing himself . The lower animals , when left to themselves , have an innate knowledge of proper food , but it is necessary that mankind be instructed in a certain amount of scientific knowledge in order that a health-sustaining and disease-resisting diet may be selected . // Just one week before the grim day in which France became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in 1914 , a little group of French scientists , with no thought of the calamity so shortly to overtake the world , gave to humanity the results of their experimental research into the dangers of feeding with refined cereals . Their conclusions were published in a French medical journal , July 25th , 1914 . Dorn as they were in the agonies of a reign of destruction and death they possess peculiar significance to the people of the United States , who , a few weeks later , were advised by various commercial-scientific committees , seeking to solve the problem of war prices , to turn away from wheat and wheat flour and consume rice , rye , barley , corn , and oats instead . E. Weill and G. Mouriquand were two of the investigators who carried on numerous experiments with a refined and demineralised diet for the purpose of determining its effect upon the artifcial production of anemia , nervous prostration , interference with the growth of the young , and the breaking up of the natural forces which , in the healthy , well-fed animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated from the French , are as follows : " To determine whether the effect of feeding pigeons with pearled barley would bring about the same loss of health as that which follows feeding with white flour we fed groups of birds with such barley , which , like refined wheat , is deprived of its germ and outer layers containing the mineral salts and vitamines of the seed . " The pigeons thus fed showed similar waste and paresis of the limbs and wings as has been frequently noted on a white bread diet . These symptoms were followed by ataxic cerebellar or labyrinthine phenomenon ? the animals falling backward or laterally with hyperextension of the limbs and head , ending in death . A cataleptoid condition sometimes preceded death where there had been no previous symptoms . " Again see section 99.
