txt A Long Island manufactWe Side urer of matches is endeavwith oring to retain the legal . rust T right to use white phos-the phorus in his business by telling the House Committee on Ways and Means that the bill now before Congress , compelling the substitution of red or amorphous phosphorus for the white , is a device of the Match Trust to destroy its independent rivals . What the trust 's motive may be for favoring this bill  --  if it is doing so  --  we do not know , but whether the motive be good or bad , the bill is an excellent one , and to pass it at once is the only way for Congress to silence deserved criticism for nob having taken the proposed action long ago . Had it done so the United States might have been among the first , instead of being among the last , of civilized and enlightened countries to prevent the wholly unnecessary use of a substance which has long rendered match-making one of the most deadly of all the deadly trades . Few deaths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that are caused by the necrosis of the jaw that comes upon a considerable majority of the workers exposed for any length of time to the fumes of white phosphorus . While it is theoretically possible , by the taking of elaborate precautions by both employers and employes , to eliminate most of the danger , in practice little ever is done by the employers or can be done by the employes , and the deadly trade always remains deadly till the equally good and perfectly safe form of phosphorus is used . If the trust has done this in all Its factories ' it is to be congratulated ; if the Long Island man can not afford to reform his plant its closing will be no cause for public sorrow . TOPICS CIF THE TIMES . While the present disTextbooks cussion , of the public May Be schools and the unsatisResponsible. factory educational results attained in them is going on , it might be well if the quality of the textbooks used should receive some consideration as possibly having something to do with the failure of so many children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone does not , give promotion from grade to grade . It is true that the teacher counts for more than does the book on which his or her teaching is based and by which it is always somewhat restricted , but the book counts for something , and even a good teacher is seriously hampered by compulsion to use a book written in an obscure or uninteresting style , or otherwise ill adapted to the needs and capacities of the children in whose hands it is placed . Now it has been charged more than once that the selection of school textbooks is sometimes determined rather by the influence which the writer or the publisher can bring to bear upon the individuals or boards Intrusted with the power of choosing than by the intrinsic merit of the competing works . It is rare for those by whom the actual work of teaching is done to have a deciding voice in making this selection , and in their confidential moments teachers themselves are not infrequently severe critics of books which they have to accept with seeming respect  --  of books which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority on the subjects treated . The newer textbooks are , indeed , very different from those of the last generation , but it is not quite certain that they are all as much better as they are different , and it would be easy enough to prove that some of them impart information to which no higher praise can be given than that it would be important if true . Objection to school textbooks , however , is less often based on inaccuracy of statement than on an inadequacy or ineptitude of presentation that produces incomprehensibility and dullness . The latter defects are in some ways more harmful than departure from truth , since it is easier to correct errors than to conquer well-justified weariness and repulsion that have extended to all study . A New Jersey " statesman , Tipping who shares to a really paand Its thetic extent the general . emedyconfidence in the efficacy Remedy . of legislation to remedy human ills and to change human nature , bias prepared for the consideration of the Wise Ones in Trenton a bill limiting the size of tits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prohibit tipping altogether , but , lacking the courage of his desires  --  or retaining a remnant of the power to distinguish between the practicable and the impracticable  --  he has contented himself with establishing a legal scale of tips and threatening , with fine or imprisonment anybody who dares-to go beyoiic it . . t For a meal , ' no matter how Complex ; or , expensive , the highest permitted gratuity 1 : to the waiter is 20 cents . The barber may not he rewarded with more than 10 cents above his regular fee for a haircut or with more than 7 , cents for a shiive. ? rive cents , too , is all the proposed law permits one to give a messenger or bellboy , and for no service whatever may the tip exceed a quarter . The motive behind this absurd bill ? absurd because unenforceable  --  is good enough , for the tipping system is a tile one , demoralizing alike to him who takes and to him who gives , in so far as it is a substitute for faxed wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who holds this opinion wait for a law to menace him with fine or imprisonment if he tips at all or extravagantly ? By the exercise of a little moral courage In ignoring the scorn of those whom he has the best of right to consider his inferiors he can instantly and forever free himself from the tip hunter 's tyranny , and though he would have some inconveniences to suffer as a result of his ' revolt , these would disappear as soon as all , or even a majority , of those who share his dislike for tipping acquired the courage to imitate his example . No laws are required for working the reform and no laws would hasten it a single day , Lecause these are matters la which every man is and should be a law to himself . It should ever be remembered , as an incentive to action , that at least ninety-nine out of every hundred tips go , not to the servile or insolent menial who takes them from the giver , but to the menial 's haughty or dignified employer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much .
