BEING not so young as you were is not all loss . If maturity of years is an ailment , . then youth is another . To be fifty years old is to have made a fairly complete recovery from the ailment of youth , and that is no small achievement . It is not everybody that does it . The person who remembers statistics will tell you what proportion of us struggling people succumb to youth and its mischances and hardships . It is a large proportion . The rapids of the river of life , the rockiest places , the swiftest descents , are apt to be up-stream . To have passed them all and got down into the calmer levels of the fifties is a feat that justifies a good many comfortable thoughts . Yes , it is ; especially if one is not too much stove in by arduous preliminaries and has been able perhaps to bring down some cargo with him . It is , or used to be , a fashion to sigh for lost youth , and there are people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have had full measure of youthful beauty , part with it , usually , with sighs and reluctance . Gray hair seldom pleases them ; they do n't like wigs ; the " ravages of time " are real and sad to them , and they repair them with diligence and what skill they may command . Beauty in a woman is a power . To be noticed and admired and courted for it is , no - doubt , a very considerable stimulation and entertainment , not to be indifferently parted with , and not in all cases offset by gains in authority , or the tribute of deference that is paid to character , or the tribute of love that comes to unselfishness and gentleness and power of sympathy . What a woman loses by the years in freshness of physical beauty she ought more than to make up in wisdom that comes from living , in the fuller understanding of people and of life , in all the kinds of knowledge , in MARTIN self-possession and increased skill in the arrangement and discharge of the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a chance to develop and who have lived good lives . They are vastly more interesting at fifty than at twenty-two , and many of them are lovelier to look at . But beauty comes ready-made , and these maturer attractions have to be earned , and not all women earn them . As for men , to lose the beauty of youth seldom troubles them . Their part in the visible embellishment of life is of minor importance . A moderate degree of self-discipline is apt to bring them to fifty years better-looking than they were at twenty . Gray hairs or shining pates are no more to them than scars to a soldier . What comeliness they have is hardier than women 's beauty . The habits of thirty years tell , and good habits leave their mark as well as bad ones . A man at twenty-two is still clay to be shaped . The general design is in it , but the finish is still to come . It comes to him from the thoughts he thinks , the burdens he carries ; from effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-indulgence and self-seeking . By the time he is fifty he will look what he is , and time will have improved or marred him accordingly . But he will not care very much how he looks . Beauty never won him anything of value so far as he knows . That he has come so far and brought along what he has brought , he will attribute , if he is modest , to good fortune ; and if he is self-appreciative , to merit and diligence . He will credit nothing to beauty , will mourn never a day over lost looks , if he has lost any , but be thankful he is not more disfigured . And if he has formed the habit of keeping clean and presentable he will maintain that habit to the end because he is more comfortable so . To be fifty is to have come fairly to maturity . The fifties may be a man 's best years , but we do well not to be too exact about best years . They vary in different people and according to circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them came their great opportunity and they shot their bolt once for all . Or for a like reason , the thirties or forties may be best years . And though the fifties may fairly be called years of maturity , it is not safe to impute decay to the years that follow them . There are people who go on ripening and sweetening to the very end of long life , whose best years are the sixties and seventies and the years later still ; whom fourscore finds not only serene in wisdom , but valiant and bold in spirit , penetrated more than ever with ideals that have shaped their lives , and clearer than ever , out of experience and reflection , as to the means to be employed to realize them . There is no declared age of ripeness . Ripeness comes when it comes and lasts as long as it lasts . It is mostly spiritual , and whatever is spiritual defies tune . Even energy is not all physical . That , too , may be spiritual , and ordinarily it is largely mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body it is geared to , making it more capable and enduring as the years go on . Just as we see robust young people come by unwise management to early infirmities , so we see others , fragile in youth , come by discipline and development to hardiness and high endurance . To be sure , we all in time pass the top point of physical strength , but most useful people , by the time that their physical decline hegins , have become specialists in their department of life , and in their own line can outdo younger and stronger persons . When strength has been duly spent in learning it does not take so much to apply what one has learned . That is one reason why the mature people who have learned something and are still good earn the most money and have the most power . They have reached a time of life when success is thought to be safer than it is in earlier years ; when they are supposed to have increased in wisdom enough to be trusted , and when money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them can not be fur very long . They are valued not only for what they do , but for what they know enough not to do ; for judgment , dexterity , avoidance of the hazardous and inexpedient . Another reason is that they have succeeded to the command of affairs ; that their hands are on the throttle of the engine and can not conveniently be dislodged until they finally relax . They come to that place by effort or succession , or both ; and while they last and the machine contrives to go , it is usually theirs . The authority that comes with years is hardly appreciated in these times . Liberty and independence are much esteemed for all ages ; it is claimed that the commandment has been amended and now reads , " Parents , obey your children , " and it is supposed that authority has pretty well gone by the board . But in spite of all carping there is still a great deal of authority left in age , where age has earned it . Deference to one 's elders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The younger generation still looks to the older generation to define its duties and settle its disputes . Twenty-five will not necessarily obey sixty because sixty is sixty , but twenty-five is often perplexed , and feels that it can more safely assist its conscience by heeding the counsels of sixty than those of its own generation . In France , says Chesterton , the young woman is protected like a nun while she is unmarried ; but when she is a mother she is really a holy woman , and when she is a grandmother she is a holy terror . Deference to age does not often go to that extreme in this bumptious country , but it does persist , and it is a power , and it is stronger at thirty than it is at twenty . Boy or girl at twenty is possessed by the crude individuality which is the core of life and must develop . Parental interposition that collides with that development is jarred . But by thirty , or sooner , the necessary self-assertion has so far accomplished its end that the filial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . Then the parental counsel , no longer feared as a distraction from an individual course , may be valued as an aid to holding the course selected . Moreover , the advice of persons on their way out of this life is apt to seem more disinterested to persons still on their way into this life than the advice of their coevals . To thirty , sixty looks like a player for whom the whistle is just about to blow , and whose interest in the game must have come to be chiefly benevolent . So thirty will take details of coaching from sixty that he would by no means take from thirty-one , and that , especially , if sixty in his day has been rated a good player . In spite of all that is said of the decay of the family and the loss by the young of all sense of obligation to their elders , the young continue to rely with an impressive confidence on their elders ' benevolence . Sometimes this confidence is a little too positive , and goes the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-interest in the elders , or a disposition in them still to retain for their own uses some share of life and its blessings while they still have them . In such cases it is sometimes necessary for this confidence of youth to be checked , but usually it realizes that something for nothing is not the rule in this world , and that from whom much is received and much hoped for , to them is due something fairly substantial in return . It is true that the main debt of life has to be paid to our successors rather than to our progenitors , and that it is a sign that we are fairly faithful to our obligations to our progenitors if our successors feel that they can approve and commend us . Nevertheless progenitors , too , require some direct consideration , and deserve it if their descendants are any worth . Maturity in its dealings with youth has it in its favor that it has arrived and means to keep its place . Youth in its dealings with maturity has the advantage that it is maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; that , if it comes to a pinch , maturity would rather die for it than survive it . Lear and Pere Goriot were not sensible people , but they were fairly natural parents , and are not at all our of date , either of them . They are warnings to us all , but only against excess . The power to give to youth , is very valuable to maturity . It ought to last until the mourners get back from the funeral , andelders who exhaust it prematurely by reckless generosity ought to expect what they usually get . Kind people who have come to the time of life when it agrees best with them to take life easy are too much disposed to think that what is good for them is good also for the young . They want to make life easy for every one they love , and , if possible , for the rest of mankind ; no one to be pinched , no one to have to struggle ; steeplechases all to be run on level ground without obstacles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you . " They ca n't fix over the world that way , because there are not enough of them , and they have n't the means ; but for those nearest them they are apt to try to do it , with the result sometimes that the young get too little of the discipline of life in the stages when it is salutary , and the mature get rather too much in the period when ease would do them more good . In maturity we get to be part of the going world , merged enough in it to be no longer intolerably self-concentrated . That is a gain and makes for comfort , and even for popularity . To lose all interest in oneself does not do . It implies that one is not interesting , and to be alive and not interesting is a condition imputable , gently , to some one else , but incredible of oneself . But it is more tolerable to be interested in oneself as a factor in life than as life 's great centerpiece , and to that we come easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in self-interest , or change in its quality , is one of the steps mercifully contrived to get us out of this world without too great a jolt . There is a time of life when to want to be the hero of the piece is necessary to due development . The more there is in you , the stronger is this impulse to be important . It shows in little boys in the resolve to be a pirate , or at least a really great detective , with guns in his clothing ; it carries them a little later through the arduous exercises of baseball and even football ; it fills police-forces and fire-departments , mans battle-ships and crowds recruiting-offices when there is a prospect of war . The girls have it too , in different manifestations , though not so different as they used to be . It is the back-bone of romance and helps young people to get married . They never would , unless they were vitally interested in themselves . When a young person is " just crazy " about some one , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due tinge of craziness about oneself . In that timely insanity there is the will to be ; the life principle defined in the current vernacular as " pep . " All that makes us look with a kind of reverence on the self-interest of the young . It is necessary to inspire and sustain them in the difficult and hazardous stage of life that they are passing through . But gradually to emerge from that stage into the condition when one sees himself more as he sees other people , is no small relief . We think of other people as cogs in a great machine , and when we have found our place in the world and turned in it long enough we come increasingly to think of ourselves more as we think of others . We , too , arc cogs , and we know that it is important that we should keep turning so that we may not rust , and our young may he fed , and our obligations discharged . If we turn effectively , so that our usefulness is noticed and our opportunities increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noticed , and the sentiment in favor of enlarged opportunities ? which usually means more money ? is doubtless well founded . But still it is as factors in life rather than as objects of supreme interest that most elders think of themselves , and find satisfaction in that attitude . To twenty-five , aspiring to be a bank-president , a bank-president is a magnificent figure of a man , sitting in the hank 's back parlor , letting humble borrowers have money , and deriving a large salary from dignified labors . But to sixty , who is a bank-president , or something equally impressive , a bank-president is just a cog in the financial machine , who tries to feed out other people 's money so that it will earn more and come back ; and charges what interest the market warrants , and takes such thought as he can , and often anxiously , not to he caught in bad loans . It is not true that all jobs look alike to sixty , but it is true enough that as we grow older we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had time to persuade us , ifwe can learn at ail , that high places do not necessarily make tall men . Accordingly we get to look more at people and not so much at their pedestals , and to consider more closely whom it is profitable to love or to admire , and come perhaps to bestow affection more on servants and people of the less-coveted vocations , and not so much on dinner company . Not that by mere increase of years we win release from servitude to mammon , and cease to admire merely because we are old enough to know better . A release of that sort is more an achievement of grace than of mere time ; but time may help , especially by modifying our aspirations for prosperity and glory , and making us content with what we can get for ourselves . To reach the point in our dealings with our fellows where we need no longer consider what material benefits they may confer , is to get to a place worth reaching ; and if timely thrift helps to bring us there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagantly progressive and fast-changing world some observers think they notice that life belongs more and more to youth , and that maturity is losing the place it used to hold in human esteem . The average term of life continues to be extended , but one remarks this growing uncertainty whether the extension is worth while . Men over fifty when thrown out of work find it hard to get new jobs ! Churches looking for ministers are apt to prefer young men . When any business collapses , the older men who have had the best positions find it harder to place themselves on any terms . To be sure ; but all that comes to is that in beginners ' places it is handier to have beginners . They are more man-ageable and cheaper . If a congregation is obliged to undertake the task of training a new minister it would rather have one not too fixed in habits . Unless an employer needs an experienced person upon whom he can put responsibilities that he would be rid of he prefers one who does not yet know as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of machines , and in that particular it is a very young age that has hardly found itself . The older human values have been disarranged , likely enough , by the immense inrush of machinery . Just as theology has changed enormously in a generation , and a young minister whose training is modern may justly be more acceptable than an older one whose training is out of date , so in mechanical and clerical employments the young to whom telephones , type-writers , and motor-cars are second nature have a special and artificial advantage over persons whose mastery of all these new means came late in life . The young are handier with the new tools and also with the new thoughts than their elders ; but that is not because youth is necessarily handier than maturity , but because the new tools and the new thoughts had not yet been distributed when contemporary maturity was in its pupilage . A craftsman 's skill should be surer at fifty than at thirty , but when a machine furnishes the skill and the office of the human factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty may be more valuable to an employer than what fifty may have learned . Though progress is not steady but alternates with reaction , and an old man may have imbibed in his youth and retain ideas much more progressive than his grandson 's , it usually happens that twenty-five is somewhat ahead of fifty because of being born into a more fully developed world . More happens usually out of the ideas you begin with than out of those you end with . The mind works on the facts that are presented to it , and sometimes the assortment of presentable facts changes enormously in twenty-five years . We assure ourselves that in all the world 's history it never changed more than in the twenty-five-year period that began in 1890 and has not yet quite ended . The distance from twenty-five to fifty in this contemporary time is enormous . Our visible world has come to he a lightening-change artist . All its fixtures have been moving about , most of its conclusions have been challenged , and just now , especially , we are standing by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . In a world so deranged , and tumbling so rapidly out of one fit into another , little is predictable and no one knows quite where he will arrive . Old age is fairly confident that existenceapproximating to life as it has known it will last out its time ; but fifty , with twenty years or more , possibly , ahead of him , is mighty uncertain where he will come out . The world that is about to be may be so new that some young person may think it necessary to take charge of it altogether -- a thing that has sometimes happened . But at present it is still being managed or mismanaged by the mature , and the chances are that even if it changes mightily they will be able to keep their hands on it and to preserve something , if not all , of its tradition . But it does seem true that maturity is up harder against youth than usual , and it may continue to be true after this special season of demolition and readjustment passes . And perhaps that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but only a field for exercises , it may be better for middle-age to feel itself in a livelier competition with youth than it likes , and obliged to keep young if it would succeed in it . Fifty is more abstemious than it used to be ; more abstemious often than twenty-five . Twenty-five has strength to spare , but fifty , if it would continue in the ring , must keep in training and husband its energies . In a recent play of Shaw 's there is a youth full of intolerant and intolerable impetuosities , whose father says of him that the problem is to endure him and keep him along in the expectation that he will be good for something at fifty . One sees such youths , in whose heads the problems and paradoxes of our newborn life are all whirling unassimilated and unadjusted and who are groping their way , impatient and perplexed , to some definite resultant of opinions and conduct . Be patient with such young people , whether they are girls or boys . In any kind of a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more important than to be valuable at twenty-five . There are those who are valuable at both ages , and the rule is , no doubt , that usefulness at twenty-five is an earnest of still greater usefulness at fifty . But that rule does not always hold , and there are characters whose scope includes so many warring thoughts and impulses that they are fractious and difficult in their earlier years , and need an extra lung apprenticeship to fetch their contradictions into line . Authority strengthens the will , which gains in power by the exercise of power , but it does not necessarily improve the intelligence . Intelligence develops out of what is inside , and there should be time to store before heavy demands are made on our accumulations . What are they , these accumulations which ought to make fifty fitter to exercise authority than twenty-five ? Book-knowledge partly ; but for the most part , thoughts . By the time he is fifty a man who is to amount to anything should have come to a few large , seasoned convictions that arc part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort are not blithely obtained out of hooks . Books may have to do with them , but they are acquisitions of the spirit , and though the rudiments of them may be come by in youth , they need to be tempered , tried out and adjusted to practice by years of thought , talk , observation , effort , and experiment with life ! Washington at twenty-five had in him the rudiments of the Washington that was to be , but he had nearly twenty years of training before he took command of the continental armies , and he was first President at ' fifty-seven . Lincoln in early manhoodgroped his way through grievous distresses and perplexities , but by the time he married , when he was thirty-three , he had come , it would seem , to a clear sense of the fundamental convictions that made him . Eighteen years more he thought and read and talked in courts and taverns , and pleaded on the stump the faith that was in him , and travailed variously , and then , at fifty-one he was elected President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-handed and could n't wait for him to get his growth , broke down in the middle of his job and died at forty-seven . Napoleon was first consul at thirty , had completed his activities at forty-six , and died at fifty-two . Alexander at thirty-three had done everything that seemed to him desirable to do in the world at that time , and departed out of it . Youth makes a greater figure in war than in anything else , but war is a comparatively simple business and can be learned young . In most matters men are lucky if they can take their time to learn and escape the prices and the heavy responsibilities of leadership until their thoughts are matured , their skill is fully practised , and their characters have been shaped and hardened in the forge of life .
