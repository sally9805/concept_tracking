txt The Medical Reserve Corps . On your editorial page of May 1 appears a short article under the caption " Civilians as Surgeons for Soldiers . " Whatever may be the shortcomings of the Medical Reserve Corps , it is only fair that you should inform yourself with regard to its present status , the confidence reposed in it by the Surgeon General , and the fact that it does have regular practical training at its own expense , and has been recruited up to 2,000 with young and active men pledged to active service whenevery called to duty . The " angry protest " against legislation that proposed to eliminate this corps , in the original Hay-Garrison bill , was entirely justifiable . The eminence of the surgeons who are members of the Medical Reserve Corps has nothing to do with military training . but the fact that they have not been able to obtain such training Is due not to their own lack of enthusiasm and willingness , but to the short-sighted policy of a parsimonious Government . We do not pretend to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire a practical as well as " a theoretical knowledge of the army surgeon 's rank and conditions. - HENRY C. COE , Medical Reserve Corps , U. S.
