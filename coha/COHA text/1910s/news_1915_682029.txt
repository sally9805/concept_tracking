txt A national defense program that probably means an expenditure on the army and navy of upward of a billion dollars in the next six years will be laid before the people by President Wilson on Nov. 4 , when he goes to New York to make his first public address since the scope of the policy upon which his Administration has embarked became known . He will Speak before the Manhattan Club of New York on national defense and the reasons which have impelled him to approve plans to almost double the navy end quadruple the trained fighting forces ashore within a few years . With the estimates of the War and Navy Departments , submitted for the coming year , the breadth of the Administration 's policy as to ' preparedness is being realized . It shapes up in totals es follows : Navy  --  For new ships and Increased personnel in five years , ** Army  --  For reserve material ( arms and ammunition ) within four years . $10.5,000.000 . For new coast defenses and modernization of old forts within four years , ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the proposed increase in the regular army , ** This amount probably will be continuing , and , if anything , increasing appropriations through the first six-year period , which would make the total expenditure at that time $1 ? 6,0nu , nnO . The grand total expenditure thus actually planned would be $b42.000,000 . An Impregnable Defense . According to plans laid out by experts of the Navy and War Departments , these expenditures would produce by 1925 a first line of dreadnoughts and battle cruisers numbering 43 ; a fleet of coast defense submarines that would fringe the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts with an almost solid line of interior defense against attack : a fleet of nearly 175 destroyers , and squadrons of huge sea-going fleet submarines to operate with the battle squadrons at great distance from shore . For the army there would be at the end of six years a trained force of 1,200,000 men , including a regular army of 140,000 , and the proposed continental army and reserves , a ring of fully manned coast defenses , equipped with the largest and most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , machine guns , howitzers , and big-gun ammunition . In addition , the enormously increased capacity of private munition plants would give assurances of ample supplies of small arms and field gun ammunition . Neither the War nor Navy Department estimate for the coming year has been made public as yet in detail . It was learned today , however , that of the $72,000.000 increase over last year 's bill to be asked by the War Department , $46,000,000 would go toward reserve material and coast defense works , the remaining 826,000.000 to be used in building up the new armies , regular and Continental . Part of this S46,000,000 would be used for building and arming the new forts to guard the entrance to Chesapeake Bay . More Forts for New York . It is proposed to spend more of the money in building new forts to guard New York . San Francisco , and other great harbors from attack . Gigantic 16-inch rifles will be mounted in all these defenses of the first class , where enemy craft with modern guns would be dangerous from great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 and 14 inch rifles with carriages that will give them greater range . Much already has been accomplished in that way , and the work will be carried on until every fort modernized . No 16-inch rifles will be installed in places of smaller guns , however , it is said , because to make all the changes in magazinee , hoists , machinery , and the like would be more expensive and less satisfactory than to build new emplacements for these huge weapons . Aside from the awards made today , the navy has still to award contracts for the major portion of the building program authorized by the last Congress . Contracts will be let next month for four fleet submarines bigger , faster , and more powerful than any submarine craft ever designed . The Schley , now building , will displace a thousand tons and make twenty knots on the surface . The new boats will displace 1,200 tons and make twenty-five knots . Next month also contracts will be let for two 32.000-ton superdreadnoughts , ships which will carry a round dozen 14-inch rifles each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of which is being closely guarded . Four Big Ships Next Year . Of the $68,000,000 increase to be asked for the navy next year , the bulk will go into four big ships , two superdreadnoughts and two superbattie cruisers . They would be the first of the sixteen capital ships to be laid down within five // DEFENSE SYSTEM TO COST A BILLION // years , under the Administration program , the last of which would not be in commission until 1925 . The building of these four ships would tax the capacity of American private yards . There are only five companies now equipped to construct such vessels , four on the Atlantic and one on the Pacific . The Government itself has only one yard , the Brooklyn Navy Yard , where battleships can be constructed , although it is planned to equip the Philadelphia yard also , and possibly the Bremerton plant for this work . Development of the new building program Must follow these restrictions . The present program of not more thanl four big ships a year also gives opportunity to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one reason why it is proposed to build only two battle cruisers the first year and none the second . Naval architecture is making such rapid strides with the great navies of the world engaged in actual hostilities , that American designers hesitate to recommend the construction of a large number of ships at one time . Each year sees radical alterations in battleships design even in peace times . Through its Secretary , H. Findlay French , the Maryland League for National Defense has presented to the President a petition urging that he carry out the constitutional injunction to the Executive to " provide for the defense . " This is a non-partisan organization . Among those signing the petition are Senator John Walter Smith , Democrat , and Governor Phillips L. Goldsborough , Republican . The petition Is an argument for preparedness against " actS of aggression or opposition by any foreign power . " The defense conditions at New York and Washington are referred to in this Way : And while the necessary training was going on , what ? New York , with its accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamite and fire or levied upon for a ransom which would fairly stagger the imagination . Scarcely less an objective I would be the beautiful Capital City , Washington , and for a second time would its magnificent buildings and luxurious homes fall prey to flames at the hands of the invader . Baltimore and Maryland would be equally in damger . Shall Maryland be made a second Belgium , to be laid waste and depopulated by fire and sword because ; forsooth , some one of limited vision raises a bogey cry of militarism ? All along the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards important cities and towns would be wrecked . and these include 90 per cent . of the plants capable of supplying munitions of war , which would be needed for national defense .
