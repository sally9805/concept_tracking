txt " SHAM " DECORATIONS . Public Library 's Candle Chandeliers Condemned as Bad Taste . Has any one seriously considered the imposing chandeliers of the Public Library ? They are intended to give an impression of candle chandeliers , and are characteristic of the insincerity of the age . What a pity it Is that the decorators of so important an institution should affect such shams in the weak endeavor to borrow a little surface gloss and glamour from a romantic past with its historic and aesthetic association . That no such association surrounds the electric light is no reason that It should meanly borrow the aspect of a. candle in a candlestick . It should proudly glory in its distinctive character , its royal splendor as the queen of illuminants . The weak vanity displayed in those electric candle chandeliers is comparable to that shown in a house which was designed to be heated entirely by electricity , but because chimneys were always associated with houses from all ages , the inane architect thought It showed his aesthetic taste to Include chimneys in his design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimneys had no flues would not feel like knocking the sham things off in disgust ? HONEST MAN .
