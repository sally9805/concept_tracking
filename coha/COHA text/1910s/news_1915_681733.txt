txt " The subsidiary companies of the United States Steel Corporation who manufacture rails have decided to maintain the present prices until May 1 , 1916 , as to rails sold for delivery up to Mav 1 , 1917 , but will make no commitments beyond that date . " The above statement , made late yesterday by'Elbert H. Gary , chairman of the United States Steel Corporation , can only be taken as an indication of the corporation 's intention to advance the price of steel rails after the dates named . In view of the sharp advance in steel products generally the independent rail producers have for some time been in favor of moving rails upward to a price level more on a parity with other lines of steel , but they have been restrained from taking definite action by the attitude of the Steel Corporation . The price of Bessemer standard rails has been held at $29 a ton since 1901 and open hearth rails , since their manufacture began , have been quoted at $30 , for standard section . This level , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , and manufacturers have urged that under present conditions the devotion to rails of roiling space which might be used for other and more profitable products was hardly good business . Railroads have already placed a considerable quantity of rail tonnage for delivery in the early months of 1917 , the total of such tonage being in the neighborhood of 1,000.000 tons . The expectation of an advance will , in all probability , induce many roads that have not yet engaged rolling space for next year 's rails to get their orders in quickly .
