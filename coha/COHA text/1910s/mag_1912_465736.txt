FOLK were sitting about the tables in the patio of the Ihitel de Jardine , sipping their afternoon coffee and turning the pages of the latest extras , ink-smeared with hectic headlines . Two children pushed a tin train of ears over one of the graveled paths beneath the patio oaks . Waiters drowsed by the kitchen corner , and the porter at the high doors giving on to the street had his head on his breast . Then the Voice came . A. murmur , far removed , muffled and indefinite ? a murmur hardly to be distinguished above the plashing of the fountain ; a minute and the timbre of it had strengthened and deepened ; another minute and a crackling syncopation broke the monotony of sound . From afar the Voice spoke stronger and in a strange , animal note . Folk dropped their papers and started , heads cocked , to catch the meaning of the unwonted sound . Waiters moved away from the kitchen door out into the patio so that they could hear better . The two children piloted their train safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with questioning eyes on the elders about them . Nearer and louder , louder , louder , sounded the Voice . A nurse stepped out on the balcony above the patio and screamed as she ran down the stairs to the children . She gathered them into her arms and stumbled blindly back up the stairs , along the balcony , and into one of the suites opening thereon . Her scream , the agitation of her flying skirts , awoke the porter at the gate . For just an instant he sat still , his face puckered in puzzlement , then he jumped to the two high wooden gates giving on to the street , and slammed them shut . He slipped an oak beam through the hasps and double-braced the doors by other beams upended against the cobbles of the court-yard . The maitre d'h ? tel had rushed out of his little glass office meanwhile , and was calling excitedly to the waiters ; theysped through passageways , and their disappearances were followed by the banging of wooden shutters over windows , the slamming of doors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the clatter and the pounding the Voice snarled ? a vicious , bestial snarl that was ear-filling and terrible . The Voice was of the mob . On an afternoon in late May of 1911 Mexico City was rising against its master . Out of the kennels of mean streets , whose meanness marble palaces and flowering gardens screen , the canaille of the capital had come pouring , had whirled into mob coalescence , and now were baying and coursing the streets to seek the life of that master . Don Porfirio , the once beloved ? Don Porfirio Diaz , dictator and builder of Mexico for more than thirty years ? was the master . All rules of psychology fall before the manifestations of the Latin-American temperament ; so an attempt at analysis ? of the events of one hour in that May afternoon would be as bewildering to the Anglo-Saxon mind as the deciphering of Norse runes to a sign-painter . At four o'clock the capital of the republic was a city in order ( though the north was in rebellion ) , President Diaz was supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a populace still cowed through memory of the weight of that hand . At five o'clock Mexico City was in rebellion , savoring of the Terror , its streets were choked with the mob ; and Diaz , the feared , was a fugitive from his people , besieged in his own house , with no barrier between himself and death but four slender lines of soldiery . One hour had served to pull down the whole fabric of a dictator 's building . In one hour the people of the capital , who had cheered themselves hoarse just a year before when the head of the nation rode through the streets in the triumph of the Centennial , were whirled away in a blood-lust that drove them in solid masses of thousands against the barriers of the Calle Cadenas , where their President lay sick in his bed . Custom of years , instilled always through fear , and latterly , also , through an hysterical sort of affection for the strength of a strong man , had been dropped like a garment , and the mob , seeing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porfirio Diaz in his age had been lulled out of his eternal vigilance by the flattery of sycophants , who cut his power from under him even while they glorified him with the tinsel and band-music of the Centennial celebration . The revolution of Madero , petty at first , grew to grave proportions . Too late the master of Mexico found that the strength that had stayed him for thirty-two years had gone . Five thousand revolutionaries had pressed to within two days ' march of his capital , his army was unavailing , his one-time advisers had fled the city He had announced in his extremity that before the end of May he would resign the Presidency . As the end of May approached , through some devious semiofficial channel , information had been carried to the press that on the 24th Diaz would send his message of resignation to the Chamber of Deputies . An orderly crowd of several thousand cluttered the streets leading to the marble Chamber that afternoon , waiting word . from within the bronze gates that the dictator had abdicated . As the thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakening cause of the old warrior , wormed their way through the crowd , distributing dodgers , which urged that the Chamber of Deputies would seal the fate of Mexico if it accepted the resignation of Diaz . The temper of the crowd was not in sympathy with the call of the pamphlets ; the distributors were hustled and their sheets trampled ; an angry , muttering undertone sounded through the babble of voices . Then , a few minutes after four o'clock , just as the keeper of the Chamber doors swung open the bronze gates , one of the journalists from the press gallery , glorying in the opportunity to pose before the crowd , jumped out of the door , leaped to the top of the steps , and held up his hand for silence . " A trick ! A trick ! " he exclaimed . " Diaz has not resigned . The old fox has fooled us again ! " That instant order disappeared and the flux of anarchy began . There is something devilish in a mob 's birth . Out of ten thousand conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , a sinister unity of purpose , which knows not the individual brain that conceived it , nor the logic of its action . Ten thousand clods , jumbled in confusion , are instantly turned into a single straight furrow Looking from a window of the Chamber of . Deputies that afternoon , one saw the waving arms of the journalist messenger conjure a sprouting stubble of brandished arms over the field of hats up and down the Calle de Factor . For a minute there was a confused weaving of conflicting currents over all the crowd . Faces were seen to be disfigured by an infectious paroxysm of madness . Alen stooped and clawed at the cobbles under their feet at the primal dictates of mob madness . Other men went racing from the fringes of the crowd into the side streets , eager to carry the flame to new tinder . Then came unity . Two barefooted women of the slums , their nakedness only half concealed by ragged coffee-sacks , and their Indian faces alight with savagery , held between them aloft on two sticks a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Madero bad been pasted . Slowly the two women began to pace through the swirling tides of humanity , rhythmically waving back and forth their banner of sedition . Men crowded for places behind them . Now the nascent procession was of three ranks , now of five , now it filled the street from curb to curb . The two women walked ahead and alone , screaming and singing in an intoxication of the mob call ; behind them , the mob . The mob found voice , end it was a bestial , unhuman voica . Quick as ever the thousands in front of the Chamber of Deputies found a singleness of purpose , recruits came by other thousands . Bricklayers clambered down from their scaffolds , carrying with them heavy staves and scantlings . Teamsters loft their wagons in the middle of the streets , but brought their goods and whips . Even the beggars jumped from their nestling-places before the cathedrals and kept pace on bandaged feet . Catching the roar of the mob , storekeepers worked feverishly to pull down iron shutters before their plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing the vicious temper of the mob , whipped up their nags and skittered around corners in advanee of the vanguard . Before the first of the marching thousands had turned into the broad Cinco de Mayo , lined with clubs and fashionable restaurants , the avenue was like a street in a besieged city . Yet still recruits came , smaPer bodies of the riotous merged themselves with the greater band , and the course of the march was toward the Calle Cadenas , where in his bed lay the President who would not resign . The early darkness of spring settled just as the parading thousands began to close in on the Oalle Cadenas. lipon both flanks of the short street , where stood the marble house of the President , the assault was made . The first of the rabble to arrive found that a double line of the mounted gendarmes of the Federal District blocked entrance into the street at both ends ; the uniformed cavalrymen sat their horses , knee to knee , with carbine-butts resting on their hips . The vanguard of the slow-moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was hurled by pressure from behind once more upon the double line of soldiers . There were shouts of individuals trampled , the flickering movement of men dodging hoofs , the quick snaffling of mounts made to close holes in the dike of resistance , and then the snub came to a halt . Just those double lines of armed horsemen at either end of a dark alleyway between walls ? within the guarded space the marble house where Diaz lay ? and stretching far at either end of the blocked thoroughfare the solid masses of humanity , inflexible , unreasoning , and mad with the lust for killing . Then , finding itself temporarily checked , the mob bayed at the guarded President . Out of the roaring bass of the multitude treble shrieks were distinguishable . " Death to the tyrant ! " " Death ? death to Diaz ! " Other voices taunted with rims for Francisco Madero , vivas for the revolution . The jackals of the city , confident of security in the anonymity of the mob , bravely baited and insulted the old lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for longer than a generation . Minute by minute the temper of the mob grew more dangerous . When , after it had been held in check for half an hour or more , a troop of the Ninth Cavalry swung down through the Avenida San Juan Lateran and began to cleave a passage through the press to reinforce the gendarmes at the Calle Cadenas , savage snarl of rage swept from block to block . A pistol-shot cracked over the solid pavement of heads , then another and another . Once more a concerted rush was made upon the guards , and they would have been swept back had not the troopers of the Ninth speared their way to the crumbling line of defense , and with flat sabers and gun-butts blunted the crest of the oncoming wave ' before its strength was irresistible . Porfirio Diaz , in the darkened house , heard the terrible mouthing of his people baffled . Then the mob , cheated in its initial purpose , began to divert its energies into channels dictated only by sheer spur of lawlessness . In segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , side streets became choked with slow-moving masses , and flying squadrons of roughs sped ahead of each band to do pillage wherever the menace of the advancing roar should drive shopkeepers to hasty refuge . Staves and beams nailed across store windows were wrenched off to serve as weapons . Where brick piles offered ammunition , there the gangs paused , and when they moved on again the piles had vanished . Occasionally came the tinkling of shattered glass , and at the crash the pack yelped and screamed . One band of several hundred marched to the office of freparcial , the government 's organ . A volley of stones smashed every window facing the street ; the crowd hooted . One of the black spaces representing a window spit a thin pencil of fire , and a peon in the mob clawed wildly at his neck for an inqtant and dropped . Then frenzy . Barrels and kindling from a building under construction near by were piled against the high doors giving to the court-yard , THE PASSING OF A DICTATOR ? 765 gasoline plundered from a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a company of Botriheres came with its engine to the call of the flame 's light , the engine was tipped over and the mob jeered . But suddenly the far circle of the flame clipped sparks from steel , rising and falling . Down from the end of the street rode a squadron of gendarmes ; sabers chopped on scattering heads viciously . The mob dissolved . The city slipped closer to the Terror with the passing of the night hours . The failure of Diaz to send in his message had been the inciting cause of the rioting , but the mob that had seized upon that pretext for its inception , finding itself unopposed in the main , now asserted its will through promptings of insolence and the instinct for destruction . Street after street , upon which darkness had settled with the stoning of the arc lights , echoed with the clamor of marching thousands . The " Viva Madero ! " came more and more insistently , and with the throaty hoarseness of a battle-cry . Wherever a company of the mounted gendarmes tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from one of the public buildings , it was met with jeers and was dared to draw guns and shoot . No strong band of command was behind the gendarmerie ; the mob knew that the strong hand of old was now palsied , and that there was none to give the accustomed merciless orders to day . It was ten o'clock , and the Plaza Zocalo , which lies before the great Cathedral of Mexico , was black with thousands . From every converging avenue more marching bands came to choke the plaza spaces . A single line of cavalry was drawn up before the fa ? ade of the new National Palace , opposite the Cathedral front . The horsemen sat immovable , by their presence denying the crowd only the right to rush the palace building . But that single denial was a defiance in the eyes of license . As the pack grew denser it moved closer upon the cavalry line . Insults and taunts failed to bring even a quiver to the arms that held rifles , butts down , on saddle-pommels . Tension grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpcrash of splintered glass , and the clatter of stones against the marble front of the Palace ; half of the hundred windows on the plaza side were broken . The vicious roar of the crowd drowned an order that the commander of the cavalry troop gave , but rifles came down . to bear on the black masses , and the quick recoiling of the mob 's front sent a backward wave through the press . Yet those behind , who could not see the sudden menace , yelled again and sent another shower of stones against the white fa ? ade . Then came the stab and bark of shots all down the line of the cavalry . One standing on the Cathedral steps at the mob 's back saw the sudden , fiery lightning spurt forth , saw the great block of humanity waver , split in a dozen lines of cleavage like a plate of glass punctured , and then disintegrate . No longer the roar of insolent mastery ; instead , shrill individual cries of terror and shrieks of pain sounded over the pounding of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid line , moving like the cutting blade of a reaper . In five minutes the Plaza &redo; was emptied . Only ten or a dozen sprawling blots on the pavements showed where the dead lay . The city awoke to dread next morning . Still lawless bands paraded the streets . More men were shot ? in front of the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and at the foot of the statue of Carlos IV . Up and down , past the flowering Alameda and in the Cinco de Mayo , tireless cohorts of the riff-Taff from the slums made ceaseless pilgrimages behind improvised drum corps of nil-can beaters . Still Porfirio Diaz was President , and three hundred soldiers guarded his house . At two o'clock in the afternoon , senators and deputies met in the Chamber of Deputies . All of the approaches to the Chamber were blocked by detachments of infantry and cavalry , which had been hurried into the city from the battle-ground of Morelos overnight . Back of the hedge of steel ten thousand rioters massed themselves in a circle about the meeting-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siege . Each senator and deputy as he came through the lanes of soldiery was admitted to the Chamber through a little postern gate , and crossed bayonets barred his passage until his identity was established . Within the shadowed congress-hall men walked on tiptoe and spoke in whispers ; the heavy silence was punctuated by the rattle of gun-butts on the cobbles outside , and occasionally the dull diapason of the voice of the popu-lace sounded , muffled by the walls . The speaker of the deputies ascended the rostrum and rapped with his gavel ; the tapping of the little mallet was as startling as a pistol-shot . " Senores , a message from the President of the Republic , " the speaker announced . The clerk stood in his place and began to read : " Senores , ? The Mexican people , who generously have covered me with honors , who proclaimed me as their leader during the international war , who patriotically assisted me in all works undertaken to develop industry and commerce of the Republic , establish its credit , gain for it the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nations ; that same people has revolted in armed military bands , stating that my presence in the exercise of the supreme executive power was the cause of this in-surrection , " A sick man in his bed , and with the roar of sedition in his ears , had reviewed the years of his building in his hurt  --  " 3 " do not know of any facts imputable to me which could have caused this social phenomenon ; but permitting , though not admitting , that I may be unwittingly culpable , such a possibility makes me the least able to reason out and decide my own culpability . " Therefore , the message continued , the President of the Republic had decided that to prevent the spilling of more blood he would lay his resignation before the representatives of the people . And in these final words Porfirio Diaz claimed the justice of a dispassionate judgment upon his dictatorship : " I hope , Senores , that when the passions which are inherent to all revolutions have calmed , a more conscientious and justified study will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow me to die carrying en graved in my soul a just impression of the estimation of my life , which throughout I have devoted and will devote to my con trymen . " There was silence then . Some shadow of the power that had been seemed to press upon the consciences of the people 's delegates . A deputy moved the acceptance of the President 's resignation , and the vote was . polled . There were only two to dissent from the will of the majority ? old men who had fought with Diaz against Maximilian , and had seen his triumph at Puebla . There was silence in the great ball even when the speaker announced that Porfirio Diaz was no longer President of Mexico . Suddenly a deputy jumped to his feet , and with a dramatic lifting of his hand he shouted : " President Porfirio Diaz is dead ! Long live Citizen Porfirio Diaz ! " Just at that instant a deep-throated shout sounded from the streets , where the news lied carried , and the spell in the Chamber was broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced one another in quick Latin impulsiveness , eddied down the aisles to the street doors , singing the national anthem . Only two old men remained seated , heads bowed and tears dropping upon their beards ; they were the two dissenters who remembered the glory of Puebla and the might of Puebla 's victor . Where blood had stained the pavements of the city twelve hours before , delirious throngs now danced . The thousands marched again , but it was not to destroy . The - circa did not rasp with the menace of anarchy , but were roared in an abandon of joy . Even at four o'clock the next morning , the morning of the 27th , the streets had not been deserted by the roisterers , but if any of them saw three closed automobiles without lamps speeding through the darkened streets in the direction of the San Lazaro station they paid no heed . The automobiles drew up within the station yard . and gates were closed . Out of one of them stepped an old man , whose neck was swathed in shawls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican army as he walked to a train in waiting . The American conductor saluted the old man before he took his arm to help him up the steps into the Pullman . Then four sleepy children , a nurse with a week-old infant in her arms , three heavily veiled women , and several men who carried sword-cases under their arms , were piloted to the train . An engine with three baggage-cars behind it , each filled with soldiers of the machine-gun detachments of the Eleventh Infantry , moved out of the yards first ; behind it came the train of the refugees , and in the rear another short train , carrying a battalion of the Zapadores . So in the dark the deposed master of Mexico began his flight from his capital to the sea . The fate that directs the destinies of the average Mexican peon seems always to move with a certain perverse malignancy . Does he want political liberty or only an extra drink of aguardiente , he dies getting it . His fate leads him blindfolded , ever on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it was nothing but their presiding evil genius which dictated that daily for a week before the abdication of Diaz a band of two-hundred-odd revoltosos in the state of Puebla had made it a practice to stop the train out of Mexico City running over the narrow-gauge line to Vera Cruz . In theory they stopped it to see that no soldiers of Diaz should be sent out to reinforce the feeble garrisons on the Gulf coast , but probably the perfect joy in doing a simple , lawless act was the sole inspiring cause of their vigilance . They did not rob , did not molest the few passengers who dared a railroad journey during those troublous days ; the petty excitement of stopping the train , firing a few shots in the air , and voicing a few vivas for the revolution was their sole reward . No word of the coming of Diaz 's train had been sent along the railroad line . The American manager of the railroad in Mexico City feared to trust local telegraphers with train orders , so the light engine running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the slopes of the high plateau toward the sea unheralded and without a schedule . Before the sun was high the band of rebels camped near the railroad track in a barren maguey desert near the town of Oriental heard an engine whistle and saw smoke lifting beyond the spur Vot . CXXI V ? No. 749.  - -  98of the nearest bald knob . They mounted and ranged themselves on both sides of the track ; one rode toward the advancing engine with the customary red flag . The pilot engine swung around a curve , the American engineer at the throttle saw the red flag , saw the double line of armed horsemen stretched along the track ahead , then shut off his steam , and , with his fireman , went and lay down behind the parapets of the tender . Behind was the first guard train . It slowed down to a halt just as the careless rebels cantered up to demand the opening of the baggage - car doors . But the doors opened unbidden , and from the space within each the slender barrel of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infliction of death by level sprays of bullets . Before the riderless horses had plunged a hundred yards into the thicket of the maguey plants , Diaz 's car had stopped behind tho guard train . The ex-President commanded the women and children in the Pullman to lie flat between the seats , as the conductor afterward told the story in Vera Cruz , and then with his son , Col. Porfirio Diaz , the General stepped down and walked along the track to where his soldiers were kneeling by the side of the baggage - cars ahead , answering the shots that came from the clumps of the bayonet plants . He stood at command with his back to the door , where the machine - guns crackled . Tinder cover of the machine-guns ' fire he ordered the infantry battalion of the Zapadores regiment to advance into the thicket and complete the work that the first hail of lead had begun . The soldiers heard the voice of their old commander , went into the thicket , and killed . The brush was over in half an hour . Diaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled down from far heights to settle among the spikes of the desert plants . On the sand-dunes back of the city of Vera Cruz , where unsightly gas - tanks are clustered and the railroad tracks criss-cross the filled ground , Gen. Victor Nuerta , Governor of Vera Cruz , picked temporary lodgings for Diaz and his family against the sailing of the German steamer Ypiranga for Santandar . Because the old , weather - beaten house stood alone on the sands and could be surrounded on all sides by troops , it was the only safe refuge for the fleeing dictator . From the rickety gallery Diaz could look out over the blue bay to the ancient gold-and-white fortress of Santiago at the harbor mouth ; past that fortress , and through the shark-infested waters of the bay , he , a revolutionary and a fugitive from a government he was attempting to overthrow , had swum to safety from the side of an American steamer thirty-seven years before . Against the walls of that fortress other revolutionaries had stood with bandaged eyes in more recent time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator ? that had loosed the volleys against them . Diaz 's last day in Mexico began with a tragedy . Two hours after midnight on May 31st one of the soldiers of the Eleventh Regiment on outpost guard near the beach caught sight of a dodging shadow that skittered in and out among the freight - cars on the railroad spur . The soldier waited until the shadow ran boldly out on the sands , and then he challenged . The shout was unheeded . The guard fired , and the shadow dropped to the beach . It was only a prisoner escaping from Santiago ; a poor wight of the army , who had been in the dungeons for murder of a comrade , and who on that night had won his way through the bay , only to plump into the guard of a fugitive President . General Huerta narrated the incident of the killing of the convict to Diaz in the morning . The old warrior heard the story through , and then shook his head with a gesture of compassion . " Poor devil , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more happy than mine . " At ten o'clock Diaz expressed the wish to say farewell to the remnant of his army , and orders were given for mustering the battalions of the guards that had come down from the capital with the ex-President 's train , and of the sailors from the gunboats Zaragoza and San Juan do Ulloa , who had reinforced the infantrymen in the protection of the bleak house on the dunes . In the hot sunshine the soldiers of the Eleventh and the Zapadores were drawn up in double rank before the lower gallery of the house , the sailors flankedthem , and directly in front of the steps the machine - guns that had dealt death in the maguey desert two days before were trundled to position , their slender , shining barrels pointing down toward the gold and red roofs of the city . The soldiers stood at rest ; those of the Eleventh were all Oaxaca Indians , natives of Diaz 's own state , and believers in him as in the power of the saints . They stood there in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely alight as if with a religious exaltation . A sign from Heaven ? a miracle worked by the saints to show that Don Porfirio would still triumph over his enemies , as of old ! That was the cry in the eyes of those Indians ; discipline caused mouths to pucker with restraint of words that would be voiced . On the gallery a hundred officers of the Palace Guard , who had hurried away from Mexico Oity to bid their old commander godspeed even at the risk of punishment , had ranged themselves in two lines . Minutes passed and the waiting burdened the nerves of the loyal ones . Then Don Porfirio stepped out from the dark doorway into the morning radiance , and he stood , bareheaded , before them . The sun searched every lineameuf of the bronzed face , but found no line of weakness and no stamp of age save its dignity . Steady eyes , strong mouth , heavy jaw of the fighter and broad forehead of the thinker : all the mien of that old Porfirio Diaz , conqueror and inflexible ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to speak , and his voice was at first powerful and unshaken ; there was a surprising note of virility in it . He said that this was to he the last time that ever he would address his soldiers ? his soldiers , much beloved . For that day his exile from Mexico would begin ; he was going to Europe , never to return to his home land unless some danger from foreign source should threaten . " I give you my word of honor , " the strong voice continued , " that if ever sudden danger from without threatens my country T will return , and under that flag for which I have fought much , I , with you at my back , will learn again to conquer . " A sudden choking blotted Diaz 's speech , and his eyes showed tears . " And now , my soldiers ? last of the army of Porfirio Diaz ? I say farewell . You have guarded me to the ultimate moment ? you have been loyal . My soldiers , blessing ? take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not ? say ! " He stopped , and a sibilant intaking of the breath passed down the line of brown faces where stood the Oaxaca Indians . Then , one by one , the officers of the troops sheathed their swords , advanced to the steps , and there embraced their old commander-in-chief . Their grief was frank ; tears fell upon Diaz 's hands ' as he said farewell to each . The lasf officer had returned to his position , and still Diaz stood , his eyes passing in slow review the faces of his soldiers . Abruptly one of them near the steps dropped his gun , and before interference could check him he had thrown himself on the steps at Diaz 's feet . With his head on the old warrior 's boots he called hysterically in a speech not Spanish , and caressed the knees of his master . Diaz looked down at the soldier for an instant , patted his black head , and then spoke a low word of command . The Indian stepped quickly back to the ranks , picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few hours later the fallen dictator , with his family , passed in a hedge of his soldiers ' bayonets through the streets of Vera Cruz to the steamer . Vera Cruz was kind at the last . lts women filled the refugee 's cabin with flowers , and its men crowded the pier end , and with roaring vivas sped Porfirio Diaz to his exile .
