The kitchen in the now abandoned farmhouse of JOHN WRIGHT , a gloomy kitchen , and left without having been put in order  --  unwashed pans under the sink , a loaf of bread outside the bread-box , a dish-towel on the table  --  other signs of incompleted work . At the rear the outer door opens and the SHERIFF comes in followed by the COUNTY ATTORNEY and HALE . The SHERIFF and HALE are men in middle life , the COUNTY ATTORNEY is a young man ; all are much bundled up and go at once to the stove . They are followed by the two women  --  the SHERIFF 'S wife first ; she is a slight wiry woman , a thin nervous face . MRS . HALE is larger and would ordinarily be called more comfortable looking , but she is disturbed now and looks fearfully about as she enters . The women have come in stowly , and stand close together near the door . COUNTY ATTORNEY Rubbing his hands . This feels good . Come up to the fire , ladies . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  cold . SHERIFF Unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away from the stove as if to mark the beginning of official business . Now , Mr. Hale , before we move things about , you explain to Mr. Henderson just what you saw when you came here yesterday morning . p. 3 COUNTY ATTORNEY By the way , has anything been moved ? Are things just as you left them yesterday ? SHERIFF Looking about . It 's just the same . When it dropped below zero last night I thought I 'd better send Frank out this morning to make a fire for us  --  no use getting pneumonia with a big case on , but I told him not to touch anything except the stove  --  and you know Frank . COUNTY ATTORNEY Somebody should have been left here yesterday . SHERIFF Oh  --  yesterday . When I had to send Frank to Morris Center for that man who went crazy  --  I want you to know I had my hands full yesterday . I knew you could get back from Omaha by today and as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hale , tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning . HALE Harry and I had started to town with a load of potatoes . We came along the road from my place and as I got here I said , " I 'm going to see if I ca n't get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone . " I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put me off , saying folks talked too much anyway , and all he asked was peace and quiet  --  I guess you know about how much he talked himself ; but I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before his wife , though I said to Harry that I did n't know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John  --  p. 4 COUNTY ATTORNEY Let 's talk about that later , Mr. Hale . I do want to talk about that , but tell now just what happened when you got to the house . HALE I did n't hear or see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all quiet inside . I knew they must be up , it was past eight o'clock . So I knocked again , and I thought I heard somebody say , " Come in . " I was n't sure , I 'm not sure yet , but I opened the door  --  this door indicating the door by which the two women are still standingand there in that rocker  --  pointing to itsat MRS . Wright . They all look at the rocker . COUNTY ATTORNEY What  --  was she doing ? HALE She was rockin ' back and forth . She had her apron in her hand and was kind of  --  pleating it . COUNTY ATTORNEY And how did she  --  look ? HALE Well , she looked queer . COUNTY ATTORNEY How do you mean  --  queer ? HALE Well , as if she did n't know what she was going to do next . And kind of done up . COUNTY ATTORNEY How did she seem to feel about your coming ? p. 5 HALE Why , I do n't think she minded  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " How do , MRS . Wright , it 's cold , ai n't it ? " And she said , " Is it ? "  --  and went on kind of pleating at her apron . Well , I was surprised ; she did n't ask me to come up to the stove , or to set down , but just sat there , not even looking at me , so I said , " I want to see John . " And then she  --  laughed . I guess you would call it a laugh . I thought of Harry and the team outside , so I said a little sharp : " Ca n't I see John ? " " No , " she says , kind o ' dull like . " Ai n't he home ? " says I. " Yes , " says she , " he 's home . " " Then why ca n't I see him ? " I asked her , out of patience . " ' Cause he 's dead , " says she . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not getting a bit excited , but rockin ' back and forth . " Why  --  where is he ? " says I , not knowing what to say . She just pointed upstairs  --  like that himself pointing to the room above . I got up , with the idea of going up there . I walked from there to here  --  then I says , " Why , what did he die of ? " " He died of a rope round his neck , " says she , and just went on pleatin ' at her apron . Well , I went out and called Harry . I thought I might  --  need help . We went upstairs and there he was lyin '  --  COUNTY ATTORNEY I think I 'd rather have you go into that upstairs , where you can point it all out . Just go on now with the rest of the story . p. 6 HALE Well , my first thought was to get that rope off . It looked Stops , his face twitches but Harry , he went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead all right , and we 'd better not touch anything . " So we went back down stairs . She was still sitting that same way . " Has anybody been notified ? " I asked . " No , " says she , unconcerned . " Who did this , MRS . Wright ? " said Harry . He said it business-like  --  and she stopped pleatin ' of her apron . " I do n't know , " she says . " You do n't know ? " says Harry . " No , " says she . " Were n't you sleepin ' in the bed with him ? " says Harry . " Yes , " says she , " but I was on the inside . " " Somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you did n't wake up ? " says Harry . " I did n't wake up , " she said after him . We must ' a looked as if we did n't see how that could be , for after a minute she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask her more questions but I said maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner , or the sheriff , so Harry went fast as he could to Rivers ' place , where there 's a telephone . COUNTY ATTORNEY And what did MRS . Wright do when she knew that you had gone for the coroner ? HALE She moved from that chair to this one over here Pointing to a small chair in the cornerand just sat there with her hands held together and looking down . I got a feeling that I ought to make come conversation , so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put in a telephone , and at that she started to laugh , and then she stopped and looked at me  --  scared . The COUNTY ATTORNEY , who has had his notebook out , makes a note . I du n no , maybe it was n't scared . I would n't like to say it was . Soon Harry got back , and then Dr. Lloyd came , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I know that you don't. p. 7 COUNTY ATTORNEY Looking around . I guess we 'll go upstairs first  --  and then out to the barn and around there . To the SHERIFF . You 're convinced that there was nothing important here  --  nothing that would point to any motive . SHERIFF Nothing here but kitchen things . The COUNTY ATTORNEY , after again looking around the kitchen , opens the door of a cupbord closet . He gets up on a chair and looks on a shelf . Pulls his hand away , sticky . COUNTY ATTORNEY Here 's a nice mess . The women draw nearer . MRS . PETERS To the other woman . Oh , her fruit ; it did freeze . To the LAWYER . She worried about that when it turned so cold . She said the fire 'd go out and her jars would break . SHERIFF Well , can you beat the women ! Held for murder and worryin ' about her preserves . COUNTY ATTORNEY I guess before we 're through she may have something more serious than preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worrying over trifles . The two women move a little closer together . p. 8 COUNTY ATTORNEY With the gallantry of a young politician . And yet , for all their worries , what would we do without the ladies. ? The women do not unbend . He goes to the sink , takes a dipperful of water from the pail and pouring it into a basin , washes his hands . Starts to wipe them on the roller-towel , turns it for a cleaner place . Dirty towels ! Kicks his foot against the pans under the sink . Not much of a housekeeper , would you say , ladies ? MRS . HALE Stiffly . There 's a great deal of work to be done on a farm . COUNTY ATTORNEY To be sure . And yet With a little bow to herI know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which do not have such roller towels . He gives it a pull to expose its full length again . MRS . HALE Those towels get dirty awful quick . Men 's hands are n't always as clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your sex , I see . But you and MRS . Wright were neighbors . I suppose you were friends , too . MRS . HALE Shaking her head . I 've not seen much of her of late years . I 've not been in this house  --  it 's more than a year . p. 9 COUNTY ATTORNEY And why was that ? You did n't like her ? MRS . HALE I liked her all well enough . Farmers ' wives have their hands full , Mr. Henderson . And then  --  COUNTY ATTORNEY Yes  --  ? MRS . HALE Looking about . It never seemed a very cheerful place . COUNTY ATTORNEY No  --  it 's not cheerful . I should n't say she had the homemaking instinct . MRS . HALE Well , I do n't know as Wright had , either . COUNTY ATTORNEY You mean that they did n't get on very well ? MRS . HALE No , I do n't mean anything . But I do n't think a place 'd be any cheerfuller for John Wright 's being in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a little later . I want to get the lay of things upstairs now . He goes to the left , where three steps lead to a stair door . SHERIFF I suppose anything MRS . Peters does 'll be all right . She was to take in some clothes for her , you know , and a few little things . We left in such a hurry yesterday . COUNTY ATTORNEY Yes , but I would like to see what you take , MRS . Peters , and keep an eye out for anything that might be of use to us. p. 10 MRS . PETERS Yes , Mr. Henderson . The women listen to the men 's steps on the stairs , then look about the kitchen . MRS . HALE I 'd hate to have men coming into my kitchen , snooping around and criticising . She arranges the pans under sink which the LAWYER had shoved out of place . MRS . PETERS Of course it 's no more than their duty . MRS . HALE Duty 's all right , but I guess that deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a little of this on . Gives the roller towel a pull . Wish I 'd thought of that sooner . Seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry . MRS . PETERS Who has gone to a small table in the left rear corner of the room , and lifted one end of a towel that covers a pan . She had bread set . Stands still . MRS . HALE Eyes fixed on a loaf of bread beside the bread box , which is on a low shelf at the other side of the room . Moves slowly toward it . She was going to put this in there . Picks up loaf , then abruptly drops it . In a manner of returning to familiar things . It 's a shame about her fruit . I wonder if it 's all gone . Gets up on the chair and looks . I think there 's some here that 's all right , MRS . Peters . Yes  --  here ; Holding it toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I declare I believe that 's the only one . Gets down , bottle in her hand . Goes to the sink and wipes it off on the outside . She 'll feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather . I remember the afternoon I put up my cherries last summer . She puts the bottle on the big kitchen table , center of the room . With a sigh , is about to sit down in the rocking-chair . Before she is seated realizes what chair it is ; with a slow look at it , steps back . The chair which she has touched rocks back and forth . p. 11 MRS . PETERS Well , I must get those things from the front room closet . She goes to the door at the right , but after looking into the other room , steps back . You coming with me , MRS . Hale ? You could help me carry them . They go in the other room ; reappear , MRS . PETERS carrying a dress and skirt , MRS . HALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My , it 's cold in there . She puts the clothes on the big table , and hurries to the stove . MRS . HALE Examining the skirt . Wright was close . I think maybe that 's why she kept so much to herself . She did n't even belong to the Ladies Aid . I suppose she felt she could n't do her part , and then you do n't enjoy things when you feel shabby . She used to wear pretty clothes and be lively , when she was Minnie Foster , one of the town girls singing in the choir . But that  --  oh , that was thirty years ago . This all you was to take in ? MRS . PETERS She said she wanted an apron . Funny thing to want , for there is n't much to get you dirty in jail , goodness knows . But I suppose just to make her feel more natural . She said they was in the top drawer in this cupboard . Yes , here . And then her little shawl that always hung behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here it is . Quickly shuts door leading upstairs . p. 12 MRS . HALE Abruptly moving toward her . MRS . Peters ? MRS . PETERS Yes , MRS . Hale ? MRS . HALE Do you think she did it ? MRS . PETERS In a frightened voice . Oh , I do n't know . MRS . HALE Well , I do n't think she did . Asking for an apron and her little shawl . Worrying about her fruit . MRS . PETERS Starts to speak , glances up , where footsteps are heard in the room above . In a low voice . Mr. Peters says it looks bad for her . Mr. Henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and he 'll make fun of her sayin ' she did n't wake up . MRS . HALE Well , I guess John Wright did n't wake when they was slipping that rope under his neck . MRS . PETERS No , it 's strange . It must have been done awful crafty and still . They say it was such a  --  funny way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . MRS . HALE That 's just what Mr. Hale said . There was a gun in the house . He says that 's what he ca n't understand . MRS . PETERS Mr. Henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive ; something to show anger , or  --  sudden feeling . p. 13 MRS . HALE Who is standing by the table . Well , I do n't see any signs of anger around here . She puts her hand on the dish towel which lies on the table , stands looking down at table , one half of which is clean , the other half messy . It 's wiped to here . Makes a move as if to finish work , then turns and looks at loaf of bread outside the breadbox . Drops towel . In that voice of coming back to familiar things . Wonder how they are finding things upstairs . I hope she had it a little more red-up up there . You know , it seems kind of sneaking . Locking her up in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own house to turn against her ! MRS . PETERS But MRS . Hale , the law is the law . MRS . HALE I s'pose ' t is . Unbuttoning her coat . Better loosen up your things , MRS . Peters . You wo n't feel them when you go out . MRS . PETERS takes off her fur tippet , goes to hang it on hook at back of room , stands looking at the under part of the small corner table . MRS . PETERS She was piecing a quilt . She brings the large sewing basket and they look at the bright pieces . MRS . HALE It 's log cabin pattern . Pretty , is n't it ? I wonder if she was goin ' to quilt it or just knot it ? Footsteps have been heard coming down the stairs . The SHERIFF enters followed by HALE and the COUNTY ATTORNEY . p. 14 SHERIFF They wonder if she was going to quilt it or just knot it ! The men laugh , the women look abashed . COUNTY ATTORNEY Rubbing his hands over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , did it ? Well , let 's go out to the barn and get that cleared up . The men go outside . MRS . HALE Resentfully . I do n't know as there 's anything so strange , our takin ' up our time with little things while we 're waiting for them to get the evidence . She sits down at the big table smoothing out a block with decision . I do n't see as it 's anything to laugh about . MRS . PETERS Apologetically . Of course they 've got awful important things on their minds . Pulls up a chair and joins MRS . HALE at the table . MRS . HALE Examining another block . MRS . Peters , look at this one . Here , this is the one she was working on , and look at the sewing ! All the rest of it has been so nice and even . And look at this ! It 's all over the place ! Why , it looks as if she did n't know what she was about ! After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then start to glance back at the door . After an instant MRS . HALE has pulled at a knot and ripped the sewing . p. 15 MRS . PETERS Oh , what are you doing , MRS . Hale ? MRS . HALE Mildly . Just pulling out a stitch or two that 's not sewed very good . Threading a needle . Bad sewing always made me fidgety . MRS . PETERS Nervously . I do n't think we ought to touch things . MRS . HALE I 'll just finish up this end . Suddenly stopping and leaning forward . MRS . Peters ? MRS . PETERS Yes , MRS . Hale ? MRS . HALE What do you suppose she was so nervous about ? MRS . PETERS Oh  --  I do n't know . I do n't know as she was nervous . I sometimes sew awful queer when I 'm just tired . MRS . HALE starts to say something , looks at MRS . PETERS , then goes on sewing . Well I must get these things wrapped up . They may be through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . I wonder where I can find a piece of paper , and string . MRS . HALE In that cupboard , maybe . MRS . PETERS Looking in cupboard . Why , here 's a bird-cage . Holds it up . Did she have a bird , MRS . Hale ? p. 16 MRS . HALE Why , I do n't know whether she did or not  --  I 've not been here for so long . There was a man around last year selling canaries cheap , but I do n't know as she took one ; maybe she did . She used to sing real pretty herself . MRS . PETERS Glancing around . Seems funny to think of a bird here . But she must have had one , or why would she have a cage ? I wonder what happened to it . MRS . HALE I s'pose maybe the cat got it . MRS . PETERS No , she did n't have a cat . She 's got that feeling some people have about cats  --  being afraid of them . My cat got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to take it out . MRS . HALE My sister Bessie was like that . Queer , ai n't it ? MRS . PETERS Examining the cage . Why , look at this door . It 's broke . One hinge is pulled apart . MRS . HALE Looking too . Looks as if someone must have been rough with it . MRS . PETERS Why , yes . She brings the cage forward and puts it on the table . MRS . HALE I wish if they 're going to find any evidence they 'd be about it . I do n't like this place . p. 17 MRS . PETERS But I 'm awful glad you came with me , MRS . Hale . It would be lonesome for me sitting here alone . MRS . HALE It would , would n't it ? Dropping her sewing . But I tell you what I do wish , MRS . Peters . I wish I had come over sometimes when she was here . I  --  Looking around the room  --  wish I had . MRS . PETERS But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  your house and your children . MRS . HALE I could 've come . I stayed away because it were n't cheerful  --  and that 's why I ought to have come . I  --  I 've never liked this place . Maybe because it 's down in a hollow and you do n't see the road . I du n no what it is , but it 's a lonesome place and always was . I wish I had come over to see Minnie Foster sometimes . I can see now  --  Shakes her head . MRS . PETERS Well , you must n't reproach yourself , MRS . Hale . Somehow we just do n't see how it is with other folks until  --  something comes up . MRS . HALE Not having children makes less work  --  but it makes a quiet house , and Wright out to work all day , and no company when he did come in . Did you know John Wright , MRS . Peters ? p. 18 MRS . PETERS Not to know him ; I 've seen him in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HALE Yes  --  good ; he did n't drink , and kept his word as Well as most , I guess , and paid his debts . But he was a hard man , MRS . Peters . Just to pass the time of day with him  --  Shivers . Like a raw wind that gets to the bone . Pauses , her eye falling on the cage . I should think she would ' a wanted a bird . But what do you suppose went with it ? MRS . PETERS I do n't know , unless it got sick and died . She reaches over and swings the broken door , swings it again , both women watch it . MRS . HALE You were n't raised round here , were you ? MRS . PETERS shakes her head . You did n't know  --  her ? MRS . PETERS Not till they brought her yesterday . MRS . HALE She  --  come to think of it , she was kind of like a bird herself  --  real sweet and pretty , but kind of timid and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silence ; then as if struck by a happy thought and relieved to get back to every day things . Tell you what , MRS . Peters , why do n't you take the quilt in with you ? It might take up her mind . p. 19 MRS . PETERS Why , I think that 's a real nice idea , MRS . Hale . There could n't possibly be any objection to it , could there ? Now , just what would I take ? I wonder if her patches are in here  --  and her things . They look in the sewing basket . MRS . HALE Here 's some red . I expect this has got sewing things in it . Brings out a fancy box . What a pretty box . Looks like something somebody would give you . Maybe her scissors are in here . Opens box . Suddenly puts her hand to her nose . Why  --  MRS . PETERS bends nearer , then turns her face away . There 's something wrapped up in this piece of silk . MRS . PETERS Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lifting the silk . Oh , MRS . Peters  --  its  --  MRS . PETERS bends closer . MRS . PETERS It 's the bird . MRS . HALE Jumping up . But , MRS . Peters  --  look at it ! It 's neck ! Look at its neck ! It 's all  --  other side to . MRS . PETERS Somebody  --  wrung  --  its  --  neck . Their eyes meet . A look of growing comprehension , of horror . Steps are heard outside . MRS . HALE slips box under quilt pieces , and sinks into her chair . Enter SHERIFF and COUNTY ATTORNEY . MRS . PETERS rises . p. 20 COUNTY ATTORNEY As one turning from serious things to little pleasantries . Well , ladies , have you decided whether she was going to quilt it or knot it ? MRS . PETERS We think she was going to  --  knot it . COUNTY ATTORNEY Well , that 's interesting , I 'm sure . Seeing the birdcage . Has the bird flown ? MRS . HALE Putting more quilt pieces over the box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preoccupied . Is there a cat ? MRS . HALE glances in a quick covert way at MRS . PETERS . MRS . PETERS Well , not now . They 're superstitious , you know . They leave . COUNTY ATTORNEY To SHERIFF PETERS , continuing an interrupted conversation . No sign at all of anyone having come from the outside . Their own rope . Now let 's go up again and go over it piece by piece . They start upstairs . It would have to have been someone who knew just the  --  MRS . PETERS sits down . The two women sit there not looking at one another , but as if peering into something and at the same time holding back . When they talk now it is in the manner of feeling their way over strange ground , as if afraid of what they are saying , but as if they can not help saying it . p. 21 MRS . HALE She liked the bird . She was going to bury it in that pretty box . MRS . PETERS In a whisper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy took a hatchet , and before my eyes  --  and before I could get there  --  Covers her face an instant . If they had n't held me back I would have  --  Catches herself , looks upstairs where steps are heard , falters weakly  --  hurt him . MRS . HALE With a slow look around her . I wonder how it would seem never to have had any children around . Pause . No , Wright would n't like the bird  --  a thing that sang . She used to sing . He killed that , too . MRS . PETERS Moving uneasily . We do n't know who killed the bird . MRS . HALE I knew John Wright . MRS . PETERS It was an awful thing was done in this house that night , MRS . Hale . Killing a man while he slept , slipping a rope around his neck that choked the life out of him . MRS . HALE His neck . Choked the life out of him . Her hand goes out and rests on the bird-cage. p. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who killed him . We do nt know . MRS . HALE Her own feeling not interrupted . If there 'd been years and years of nothing , then a bird to sing to you , it would be awful  --  still , after the bird was still . MRS . PETERS Something within her speaking . I know what stillness is . When we homesteaded in Dakota , and my first baby died  --  after he was two years old , and me with no other then  --  MRS . HALE Moving . How soon do you suppose they 'll be through , looking for the evidence ? MRS . PETERS I know what stillness is . Pulling herself back . The law has got to punish crime , MRS . Hale . MRS . HALE Not as if answering that . I wish you 'd seen Minnie Foster when she wore a white dress with blue ribbons and stood up there in the choir and sang . A look around the room . Oh , I wish I 'd come over here once in a while ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to punish that ? MRS . PETERS Looking upstairs . We must n't  --  take on . p. 23 MRS . HALE I might have known she needed help ! I know how things can be  --  for women . I tell you , it 's queer , MRS . Peters . We live close together and we live far apart . We all go through the same things  --  it 's all just a different kind of the same thing . Brushes her eyes , noticing the bottle of fruit , reaches out for it . If I was you I would n't tell her her fruit was gone . Tell her it ai n't . Tell her it 's all right . Take this in to prove it to her . She  --  she may never know whether it was broke or not . MRS . PETERS Takes the bottle , looks about for something to wrap it in ; takes petticoat from the clothes brought from the other room , very nervously begins winding this around the bottle . In a false voice . My , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Would n't they just laugh ! Getting all stirred up over a little thing like a  --  dead canary . As if that could have anything to do with  --  with  --  would n't they laugh ! The men are heard coming down stairs . MRS . HALE Under her breath . Maybe they would  --  maybe they would n't . COUNTY ATTORNEY No , Peters , it 's all perfectly clear except a reason for doing it . But you know juries when it comes to women . If there was some definite thing . Something to show  --  something to make a story about  --  a thing that would connect up with this strange way of doing it  --  The women 's eyes meet for an instant . Enter HALE from outer door . p. 24 HALE Well , I 've got the team around . Pretty cold out there . COUNTY ATTORNEY I 'm going to stay here a while by myself . To the SHERIFF . You can send Frank out for me , ca n't you ? I want to go over everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHERIFF Do you want to see what MRS . Peters is going to take in ? The LAWYER goes to the table , picks up the apron , laughs . COUNTY ATTORNEY Oh , I guess they 're not very dangerous things the ladies have picked out . Moves a few things about , disturbing the quilt pieces which cover the box . Steps back . No , MRS . Peters does n't need supervising . For that matter , a sheriff 's wife is married to the law . Ever think of it that way , MRS . Peters ? MRS . PETERS Not  --  just that way . SHERIFF Chuckling . Married to the law . Moves toward the other room . I just want you to come in here a minute , George . We ought to take a look at these windows . COUNTY ATTORNEY Scoffingly . Oh , windows ! SHERIFF We 'll be right out , Mr. Hale . HALE goes outside . The SHERIFF follows the COUNTY ATTORNEY into the other room . Then MRS . HALE rises , hands tight together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow turn , finally meeting MRS . HALE 'S . A moment MRS . HALE holds her , then her own eyes point the way to where the box is concealed . Suddenly MRS . PETERS throws back quilt pieces and tries to put the box in the bag she is wearing . It is too big . She opens box , starts to take bird out , can not touch it , goes to pieces , stands there helpless . Sound of a knob turning in the other room . MRS . HALE snatches the box and puts it in the pocket of her big coat . Enter COUNTY ATTORNEY and SHERIFF . p. 25 COUNTY ATTORNEY Facetiously . Well , Henry , at least we found out that she was not going to quilt it . She was going to  --  what is it you call it , ladies ? MRS . HALE Her hand against her pocket.
