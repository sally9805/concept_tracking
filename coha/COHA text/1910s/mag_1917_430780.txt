 | One of the most interesting variants of the academy movement , during the second quarter of the nineteenth century , was the manual labor school , an institution which combined literary instruction and manual labor . This educational idea appeared in America in the eighteenth century and was later widely advocated by educational leaders . Benjamin Franklin in his pamphlet entitled " Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania , " which appeared near the middle of the century , urged the use of physical exercises for students . Cokesbury College which was founded at Abingdon , Maryland , in 1785 ? the first Methodist College in the world combined manual labor and literary work . The students were not allowed to indulge in play , but carpentry , gardening , and farming were substituted ; agricultural exercises were taken in connection with Virgil 's Georgics . ' The Columbia Magawine , of April , 1787 , published in Philadelphia , contained a plan for a manual labor school ; a few years later Dr. Benjamin Rush , of that city , loudly advocated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howe , of South Carolina , showed a substantial interest in the idea and made provision for establishing such a school near Abbeyville in that State . Gymynastics for the early militia and physical training at West Point helped to call attention to the subject . Thomas Jefferson showed great interest in physical exercises when he planned the University of Virginia . Elsewhere , also , this idea as well as that of agricultural and mechanical work in educational institutions was being favorably and widely received . The first manual labor school to be established in the United States seems to have been set up under the will of Dr. Howe , of Abbeyville District , South Carolina , who was mentioned above . In 1796 he left the bulk of his property in trust to the South Carolina Agricultural Society for establishing and maintaining an agricultural school at Lethe , the testator 's place  | of residence , for twelve poor boys and twelve poor girls , who had been residents of Abbeyville District for six years . He left detailed instructions concerning the school , the plan of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1787 , which contained " a plan for establishing schools in a new country , where the inhabitants are thinly settled , and whose children were to be educated with a special reference to a country life . " Under Dr. Howe 's instructions orphans were to have preference as pupils and were to be boarded , clothed , educated , and taught to work ; they were also required to make their own clothing . Besides reading , writing , arithmetic , geography , and geometry as far as surveying , the boys were to be taught also scientific agriculture and chemistry ; and the girls , in addition to reading , writing , and the four common rules of arithmetic , were to be taught chemistry . Both boys and girls were to be instructed in " such chemical principles as the success of their different occupations depends on , as malting , brewing , distilling , baking , fixing colors , making vinegar , soap , cheese , butter , etc . " If the accomodations were sufficient , other children in the neighborhood could be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain rate of tuition , provided they would conform to the rules of the school . In admitting the children no regard was to be had for their religious denominations ; but they were to be instructed in the " general plain and practical parts of religion and morality , " avoiding all " controverted points " and doctrines of sects . Industry , intelligence , and morals were the principal qualifications demanded of the teacher . The South Carolina Agricultural Society resigned its trust in 1805 , and under the provisions of the will the legislature of the state appointed trustees and directed them to make annual reports concerning the work . From that time until near the close of the nineteenth century a school was conducted at L , ethe on the original endowment . In 1848 the report showed that the full number of boys and girls was in attendance , that the capital amounted to more than $43,000 , and that the school was being supported at an annual expenditure of about $2,400 . Eleven years later the funds amounted to $47,000 . The report for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual labor half the time , the boys in farm work , and the girls in domestic occupations . The trustees were authorized to apprentice the boys for five years at the age of twelve , and the girls at the age of ten for the same period . A large part of the endowment seems to have been lost during the Civil War , however , and the school seems to have been suspended later for want of funds . But it had a long and useful career and furnished the means of education to a large number of poor children . From the evidence available the school at Lethe seems to have been the first manual labor school established in the United States . Schools more or less similar to that established at Lethe sprang up here and there in the early part of the nineteenth century . The manual labor school experiment received its greatest impetus , however , through the industrial work of the Pestalozzian-Fellenberg movement which attracted wide attention in the United States during those years . Pestalozzi had taught farming and textile work at Neuhof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and operate an institution which successfully combined literary instruction and industrial labor . He established such a school at Hofwyl in Switzerland in 1806 which in a short time became well-nigh famous and attracted world-wide educational attention . Henry Barnard believed that this school , which continued until 1844 , and in which the students pursued their literary work in the mornings and farmed in the afternoons , had a wider influence than any other institution in Europe or America in the nineteenth century . Through discussions concerning the " return to nature movement " and the work of the philanthropinists , the public mind had already come to be more or less educated to an appreciation of the value of physical exercises for youth ; and through reports on the work and influence of Pestalozzi and of Fellenberg , the need for physical exercises for students began to claim attention in the United States ; and the agitation for giving them a place in the schools greatly enlarged . This agitation proved more or less disappointing , however , although it resulted in a wide-spread realization of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Confidence in the value of formal physical exercises gradually weakened and with the collapse of the formal gymnastics movement , Fellenberg 's plan of combining manual labor and intellectual pursuits was eagerly seized upon as a means of preserving the health of students . Advocates of agricultural and mechanical work in educational institutions began to increase in number ; but the movement did not gain much force until near the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century . Interest in the experiment gradually increased , however , and for two decades or more manual labor schools sprang up in numerous places . The manual labor feature was introduced widely in theological institutions , colleges , and academies , and by 1830 there were numerous literary institutions in the United States in which it was a prominent feature . Whereever practicable , farms and shops were provided for such schools and the time of the students divided between manual labor and study . The preservation and invigoration of health were no doubt powerful motives in the introduction of the manual labor feature in many literary institutions during these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no more weight in promoting its adoption than its promising pecuniary advantage or its value as an agency for recruiting sectarian ranks . It was during this period , it will be remembered , that denominational controversies were very intense . The theoretical side of the experiment culminated in the early thirties , by which time the movement had also attained considerable practical proportions . Elias Cornelius , editor of the American Quarterly Register and secretary of the American Education Society , and other educational leaders lectured and wrote on the Fellenberg system . In June , 1831 , an enthusiastic meeting of manual labor advocates was held in New York , when the " Society for Promoting Manual Labor In Literary Institutions " was formed , and Theodore D. Weld was appointed as its general agent . Weld had been connected with the Oneida 1llanual Labor Institute at Whitesboro , New York , an institution made conspicuous by its manual labor feature from 1827 to 1834 . He was enthusiastic in advocating the new system and made a tour of many states , including several  | in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weld made a report which contained the most elaborate presentation of the movement ever published , setting forth the claims of manual labor as a necessary part of a sound educational system . The report was published at New York in 1833.3 The report advanced many ingenious and apparently plausible arguments in favor of manual labor in educational institutions . It claimed that the system of education in practice at that time jeopardized the health of the students , tended to effeminate the mind , was perilous to the morals of the students , failed to stimulate effort , destroyed habits of industry , and was so expensive that its practical results were noticeably anti-democratic . Moreover , the report argued , the manual labor feature furnished the kind of exercise best suited to students . Military exercises , it was held , were proper in strictly military schools but were not adapted to any other educational institution and would not be " until fighting becomes the appropriate vocation of man and human butchery the ordinary business of life . " Ordinary gymnastic exercises were not suitable because they lacked pecuniary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor promised to correct all these and numerous other educational defects . It would furnish physical exercises " natural to man " and adapted to intellectual interests , would produce happy moral effects , and equip students with valuable practical acquisitions . It would , moreover , promote habits of industry , independence of character and originality , render " permanent all the manlier features of character , " and afford opportunity and facilities for " acquiring a knowledge of human nature . " The plan promised to reduce the expense of education , to increase wealth , and make all forms of honest labor democratic and honorable by destroying " those absurd distinctions in society " which make one 's occupation the standard of one 's worth . Finally , also , it was claimed the manual labor feature in the schools would help to preserve republican institutions . In spite of its nature , Weld 's report contained material of considerable historical and educational interest . First of all , it gave much attention to the education of the time which  | was charged with working a " fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given from a wide testimony to show some of the evils alleged to result from the plan of education in operation in the schools and colleges of the period . That part of the report which urged attention to a rational system by which the physical needs of students could be cared for now has a fresh interest : and it is of especial interest in view of the rapidity with which many American schools and colleges recently abandoned the undecorated humbuggery of interscholastic and intercollegiate athletics , in which only a small part of the students participated , and turned immediate and serious attention to regular and systematic military drill in which practically all students participated . On this question of physical exercise many competent witnesses testified . Dr. Miller , of Princeton Theological Seminary , said : " The waste of health , and strength , and life , which is daily going on among the youth of talent and high promise in every part of the land , is enough to make any intelligent observer weep . " President Lindsley , of Nashville University , said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are liable to become effeminate , as to be rendered , without some subsequent change of habit , utterly unfit for any manly enterprise or employment . How frequently , too , do they fall victims of this ill-timed system of tenderness and seclusion ! " President Cossitt , of Cumberland College , Kentucky , considered " a literary institution , which makes no provision for the regular exercise of its students , no better than a manufactory of invalids , and the slaughter-house of cultivated talent . " A Reverend Mr. Frost , in an oration before the alumni of Middlebury College , said : " It is believed that at least one fourth of those who pass through a course of education for the learned professions , sink into a premature grave , or drag out a miserable and comparatively useless life , under a broken constitution . " And Thomas H. Gallaudet , who had observed students at Yale , said : " So far as my personal observation has extended , I should consider it perfectly safe to say , that three-fourths of our diligent students impair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nearer the truth to call the proportion nine-tenths . "  | Equally competent witnesses testified that " The present system of education effeminates the mind , " and others supported the statement that " The present system of education is perilous to morals . " " Could the veil be lifted from some of our higher seminaries , " said one witness , " and all the sources of youthful corruption be exposed , the better part of the community would demand an immediate reform , or withhold their patronage . " Another declared : " It is a fact that ought not to be disguised , that the morals of youth frequently become corrupted in our academies and colleges . " And Veld added : " This is not the only way in which the moral character is put in jeopardy , and the moral sensibilities are blunted by the present system . The state of the body occasioned by neglect of exercise corrodes the temper , and deadens moral feeling . " Constant occupation was recommended by all as the most effectual security against external and internal causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be efficient : exercise promoted virtue and subdued the storms of passion . A system of manual labor would not only promote health but would exclude many of those plans of mischief which are made and executed in times of relaxation from study . Tricks of youthful collegians came in for their share of attention in the discussions of those who advocated labor schools . According to its advocates , the manual labor system of education would furnish the students with facilities for acquiring a knowledge of human nature . The substance of the argument was about as follows : " Let the students put on a working dress and spend three hours a day in agricultural or mechanical employment , and they would disarm the laboring man of his prejudices , and beckon him toward them . That discontent , jealousy , envy , disgust , and those heart burnings , which keep in a ferment the laboring classes in the vicinity of our higher seminaries , would give place to kindlier feelings . These classes would become approachable ; a brotherhood would be established , and the student would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as they are , which would otherwise be denied him ...... " Moreover , absurd distinctions in society  | would disappear if the manual labor system of education prevailed : " Let the contents of our sixty colleges , and fifty professional seminaries , with a thousand academies and high schools , pour themselves into our fields and workshops , and there , for three hours each day , ply the implements of agriculture and the mechanic arts , would it not have a powerful tendency to render labor honorable , and the laboring man more respected ? Would it not create sympathies between the learned and the laboring classes , a permanent community of feeling , and identity of interests ? The thousand repulsions arising from dissimilarity of habits , which have so long operated to estrange them from each other , cease with the causes which produced them . Instead of being driven asunder by jealousies , and smothered animosities , they approach each other with looks of kindness , and form a compact , based upon republican equality , and the interchange of mutual offices of courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system a tendency to these results , has mingled little with men ; and however profound in other things , is a novice in human nature . " Objections to the system were hurriedly considered and as rapidly dismissed as unsound , " absurd , " " sentimental , " and " ridiculous . " Some of the strongest objections were : " The manual labor system will have a tendency to destroy a graceful carriage , and make the student stiff-jointed and awkward in his movements ; " it will have " a tendency to make the student a sloven ; " it will " degrade the mind , making it dull and plodding , and restraining the excursions of genius " ; if the labor should be required , " a youth of high spirit would never submit to it . " If it were optional , " a high-minded young man would feel himself above such drudgery . " " There is no necessity of making exercise a part of the system , or of making public provision for it . Let the student be urged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another objection was : " If the manual labor system is generally adopted , and institutions are established upon that plan , it will operate unfavorably upon existing institutions , by drawing away their students . " Finally , the objection was made that the system was impracticable , " inasmuch as some manual labor schools have failed , " and that it was unpopular with the teachers and pupils .  | Both the objections and the answers to them are of historical interest ; certainly they suggest the " faddishness " of the manual labor experiment . The " Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions " had a short life of activity . Weld served as its general agent only one year and his successor was never appointed . The popularity of the movement which the organization was formed to promote was likewise short-lived . But in the thirties and forties several institutions introduced the manual labor feature , having been stimulated no doubt by the work of Weld and his society . The experiment was especially popular in several of the Southern States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a short time made manual labor compulsory for all its students . Emory and Henry , founded by the Methodists in Virginia in 1838 , included manual labor as a part of its required program . The students worked on the farm fog two hours in the afternoons and received a few cents an hour for their work . Later the compulsory feature of the scheme was abandoned , but the institution retained manual labor for a few years as a voluntary feature . Efforts seem to have been made , but without success , to introduce the manual labor plan in Hampden-Sydney College . The Donaldson Academy and Manual Labor School was chartered by the legislature of North Carolina in 1833 . The trustees " cast themselves upon the munificence of an enlightened community " and secured the sum of $14,000 in subscriptions . A site was purchased on Hay Mount , near Fayetteville , and in 1834 the school was begun . This enterprise was under the auspices of the Presbyterians and was put in charge of the Reverend Simeon Colton , " an able , efficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been connected with similar work at Amherst , Massachusetts . The trustees were unable to collect all the money subscribed , and in 1836 they memorialized the legislature for assistance from the literary fund of the state to establish a teachers ' department in the school and to complete the equipment of the manual labor department , " where the students might devote a portion of their time to labor , thus securing to themselves better  | health by exercise and diminishing at the same time the expense of education . " The committee to whom the memorial was referred believed , however , that the literary fund should be used to aid common schools , and the petition was not granted . The manual labor feature was soon discarded in the school . Colton became convinced that " close habits of study and manual labor were incompatible . " The experiment was likewise tried at what is now Davidson College , North Carolina , which was founded by the Presbyterians . In laying the foundation the trustees planned to make the college " thorough by electing to its chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church . It could , it was fondly hoped , be made cheap by adopting the Manual Labor System ' then so much mooted in educational circles , and put into practice in several northern colleges . " Interest was soon taken in the plan and the records of the Presbytery of Concord , in session at Prospect Church , in Rowan County , show the following paper under date of March , 1835 : " Presbytery , taking into consideration the importance of a more general diffusion of useful knowledge , and the expediency of adopting some system of sound and thorough education , that may be accessible to all classes of the community , and having heard with pleasure that the Manual Labor System , as far as it has been tried , promises the most happy results in training up youth to virtuous and industrious habits , with well cultured minds , unanimously " Resolved . That this Presbytery , deeply impressed with the importance of securing the means of education to young men , within our bounds , of hopeful piety and talents preparatory to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of God ) the establishment of a Manual Labor School ; and that a committee be appointed to report at the next meeting of Presbytery the best measures for its accomplishment and the most favorable places for its location . " The plan collapsed at Davidson after three or four years trial . A large number of the students were sons of farmers  | and had learned to work in the fields before taking up their collegiate studies ; and they naturally thought it a loss of time to plow and cut wood while at college . A similar experiment was made at Wake Forest , a Baptist institution in North Carolina , but with the same or similar results . South Carolina saw the manual labor feature tested in several instances . In the various reports of the free school commissioners to the legislature of that state in 1839 , when the school system was critically examined , some of the commissioners who reported believed that the introduction of the manual labor feature would help solve the persistent educational problem which confronted the state during those years . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were instructed to study the commissioners ' reports and to suggest an educational plan for the state , was unfavorable to the manual labor scheme . " Neither would the manual labor system meet the difficulties of the case , " they said : " for besides that they have proved egregious failures in almost every instance , they are not suitable to the tender years of those who fall properly within the ages of school instruction . " 6 Despite this opinion , however , the plan seems to have been experimented with at Cokesbury or Bethel School by the Methodists ; at Erskine , by the Associated Reformed Presbyterians ; at Furman , by the Baptists ; and at Pendleton , by " working citizens ; " but in practically every case with the usual unsatisfactory results . A manual labor school was opened at Eatonton , Georgia , in 1832 , under the auspices of the Baptists of that State , though Adiel Sherwood seems to have promoted the enterprise very largely on his own responsibilty . The denomination soon lent its support , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sanguine . " The following year this school was discontinued and a more pretentious manual labor plant was set up , under the same auspices , near Greensboro , in Greene County . Three or four teachers were engaged for the work and thirty pupils enrolled the first year . During the next few years the attendance was about eighty or  | ninety , " and always more applicants than can be accommodated . " In 1837 the school owned a thousand acres of land , large convenient buildings , large stocks of horses , cattle , and hogs , and the students labored " from two to three hours a day , growing cotton , corn , and potatoes , and are happy . " In that year they had in a high state of cultivation ten acres of potatoes , fifty acres of oats , sixty acres of cotton , and seventy acres of corn . " These will produce , no doubt , one thousand bushels of potatoes , the same quantity of oats , one hundred bushels of corn , and thirty bags of cotton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report continued ; " in the first year a large number of the students professed religion . " Other manual labor schools in Georgia were established at McIntosh in 1832 , near Athens in 1833 , at Medway , in 1835 , and at Covington , in 1835 , all of which were controlled by religious denominations . The one at Covington was known as the Georgia Conference Manual Labor School and operated on a large scale . " An area of about three acres is enclosed by the buildings of the institution , covered with beautiful shade trees , of the natural growth . The scene is picturesque and rural . " The plant and equipment consisted of twelve " students ' houses , " a superintendent 's house , a steward 's house , a steward 's hall , an administrative and scholastic building , a chapel , two large barns and twelve stables , and more than two thousand " acres of good farming land , about 700 cleared , and in good repair , " nine horses , two wagons , one yoke of oxen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The school also had " a very valuable astronomical , philosophical , and chemical apparatus , excelled by few in the country . " In 1837 the officers consisted of a superintendent , a teacher of mathematics , a teacher of languages , an assistant in English , a steward , and a farmer . The students numbered 120 , more than one-half of whom were boarding students . The school year was divided into two terms : one commenced the first of January and ended the middle of July , and the other began July 25 and closed the first of December . The students received board for $1.25 a week , laundry for seventy-five cents a month , tuition for $2.50 per month , and room rent for $2 per term . The salary  | of the superintendent was $1250 ; the teacher of mathematics and the teacher of languages each received $800 and board. ? In Arkansas the manual labor school was able to attract a measure of attention . The experiment was tried in Benton Academy , in Saline County , which was chartered in 1842-43 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was chartered in 1844-45 . It is of interest to note also that the trustees of the township schools , established in 1843 , were authorized to establish " a laboring school wherein the students shall be required to labor a portion of the day . In several other states efforts were made to use the manual labor plan . In 1832 some friends of the scheme undertook ' to establish a school with the manual labor feature in a community near Tallahassee , Florida , but the undertaking was not successful . In Maury County , Tennessee , a manual labor school was chartered about 1829 , but little is known of its history or of the purpose of its incorporators . Practically all the institutions which tested the experiment soon abandoned it as unsatisfactory and impracticable , and the movement finally collapsed . Practical difficulties rather than the inherent weaknesses of the principles underlying the plan cooled enthusiasm for it . The extreme faddishness of the experiment appears when it is noted that the introduction of athletics in educational institutions has proved only an indifferent substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the idea of that plan was not lost . Instead , it appeared in the Morrill Act of 1862 which greatly influenced industrial education in the United States , and in another form it has appeared in the manual training movement of recent years , which is no doubt achieving some of the more creditable purposes which the earlier movement sought to attain .
