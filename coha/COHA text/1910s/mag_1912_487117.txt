The opening of the new Grosvenor Gallery last month is an event of more note than the exhibition held to inaugurate it . London is probably worse off for picture galleries than any other large town in Europe , even in England . The Royal Academy is a close corporation ; the British Artists ' and the Old Water-Color Society 's rooms are comparatively small and rather far from the beaten picture-show track ; those of the Institute in Piccadilly are only a little larger ; the New Gallery , the best of them all , was a few years ago converted into a Vienna cafe , and now has disappeared altogether , to make way for one of those " Picture Palaces , " or " Cinemas , " that provide the sort of art the British public loves best , and that are scattered over London almost as plentifully as the Lyons ' and A. B. C. tea-shops . There remains the Grafton , an unusually difficult gallery to hang and not particularly well lighted . The new Grosvenor ought , therefore , to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Its position is good , in New Bond Street . It is understood to have strong backing , as the company running it i. said to consist mainly of two leading firms of London picture dealers . It is large enough to be used for some of the most important shows held during-the year , and already it has announced that the annual exhibitions of the Arts and Crafts , the International , and the National Portrait Painters ' Societies will be held in it . There are five rooms , two of them of fairly good size , and a lon.g narrow entrance hall for watercolors and black-and-white . Unfortunately , it is without the sculpture hall that was such a feature at the New Gallery . The light is excellent , that is when there is any light to be had in London . The whole place has been freshly and elaborately decorated , perhaps too elaborately , for the walls are covered with old-rose brocade , hanging curtain-wise in loose folds , and the perpendicular lines thus made and the vivid color overpower only too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original and now historic Grosvenor ' Gallery , has just written to the Times , objecting that this revival of the name which must ever be associated with his may mislead the public . But of this there is little danger . Indeed , just now the use of its name only helps to point the difference - between the conditions in Sir Coutts Lindsay 's day and in ours , as well as between the ends then regarded as revolutionary , for which he established his Grosvenor , and the more conservative aims of the new company in establishing theirs . When the Grosvenor was started in the seventies , the Royal Academy was at the height of popularity and power . It gave the hallmark of success . The public that crowded to its shows recognized no painter not included in its ranks . Outsiders might , and usually did , have their private patrons , and often were prosperous . But publicly they had no chance , and it was to make this chance for them that Sir Coutts opened his sumptuous gallery . Its history has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed there , eagerly as his presence was desired , Burn esTon es , Holman Hunt , Whistler , Walter Crane , and many others against whom the Academic door was ' closed , did , giving its exhibition a character and an interest that few exhibitions in England had - ever had before , that few have ever had since . It was different from every other exhibition of the day , so different that it could not be ignored . It excited - the critics , it bewildered the public , it be came the talk of the town until it got into Punch , which the Briton has always taken as seriously as his Bible , and into the Gilbert and Sullivan opera , then the other most popular thing in London , and the " Greenery-Yallery , -Grosvenor-Gallery " young man flashed into fame . The sole drawback was that Sir Coutts Lindsay had not the courage of his own ideas . If his gallery was not  - -  Le be the rival of the Academy , it had no particular reason for existence , and yet he seemed afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Grosvenor Gallery gradually lost its special character , just as the International has in our time by dropping its international element and degenerating by degrees into an annex of the Academy . The Grosvenor was doomed . An effort was made to kindle new life into it by showing the work of the Glasgow School when the Glasgow School began to be talked about in Lon -- don . But it was no use . The Glasgow men were not sufficiently strong to work the miracle . Now to turn to the new Grosvenor is to find that there is at present no distinguished group of outsiders waiting for the public recognition that should Academic standard ; to show on its walls has ceased to mean the one high-road to fortune . Besides , societies like the New English Art Club and the International are supposed to represent the more independent groups , though their members are falling , if they have not fallen , into a rut scarcely less conventional , scarcely less hackneyed , than the Academician 's . The Grosvenor offers a shelter to societies with no home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pariahs , the outcasts of official British art , as Sir Coutts Lindsay did , for the good reason that there are no longer any to be collected . To look into the catalogue of the Inaugural Exhibition , is to find the names chiefly of members of the New English and the International ; to look on the walls is to find much work that has been already shown in the exhibitions of these societies , or even in the Academy . Many of the artists to whom prominence is given ? Lavery , Gruen , Derwent Wood , Strang , C. H. Shannon , have been made Associates of the Academy , and there is not so very much to choose between their work nowadays and that of the Academicians against whom the old Grosvenor was a protest : it has no greater freshness , it is as vowed to formula . Really , I saw nothing notable that I had not seen before except a vigorous sketch of a Picador , a memorandum of movement , by J. Crawhall , who produces little , but in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there ; a group of those lithographs of the Panama Canal by Joseph Pennell , of which the entire series has recently been bought by the British Government for the South Kensington Museum . One bid for sensation is ' the addition , since the gallery opened , of the studies by Albert Rothenstein of the costumes for Granville Barker 's production of " The Winter 's Tale " : costumes that are only a trifle less awkward and affected on paper than on the stage . Another is the reappearance of Walter Greaves in a room full of Nocturnes  --  paintings of Whistler 's subjects with istler 's titles . But it has not made a sensation ; in fact , it seems more likely to put an end to the Greaves sensation of eighteen months ago So far , in a word , the chief success of the new Grosvenor , whatever it may have in store for us , has been to revive interest in the old . It may not be altogether to blame for this since new movements are not the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor one  --  to a movement is Post-Impressionism which the Grosvenor has allowed the Grafton Gallery to capture , perhaps because its chief leaders are foreigners , and the few Englishmen who the Grafton is the most successful now open , the edge of the sensation made by Post-Impressionism has been somewhat worn off . The Post-Impressionists ' first show at the Grafton , of which I wrote a year or so ago , appealed to the great public by its novelty and had the virtue of including work by Cezanne , who , if not the supreme master and Post-Impressionist he is claimed to be , was at times an interesting painter ; by Van Gogh , who , when not insane , was an artist of great distinction ; by Gauguin , in whose work beauty was not systematically disdained . But in this second show there are only four or five canvases by Cezanne and nothing by Van Gogh and Gauguin , except a salesroom full of photographs of the works of all three , for Post-Impressionism from the first has been largely a commercial enterprise . Matisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the introduction to the catalogue Roger Fry kindly prepares us for what we ought to find in the work of each : continuity and flow of rhythmic lines , reality of form , logic of space relation , a new use of color in Matisse ; in Picasso , an abstract language of form , a visual music  --  whatever this cryptic pronouncement pay mean . Unaided , I should not have suspected these qualities in the large designs by Matisse  --  an interior , apparently of a studio ; an arrangement of nudes for the decoration of a palace in Moscow ; a " Conversation " between two figures in which , as in all his figures I have seen , if in - varying degrees , reality of form is emphasized , or distorted , into caricature , while in the large as well as his smaller paintings , space , color , and line are used as the designer of posters might use them . Indeed , many of them , one is inclined to suspect , were intended for posters , but designs that are appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in railway stations , if often delightful and accomplished for their special purpose and place , are not adapted to the decoration of a palace or to he framed and hung as pictures Picasso expresses form in cubes and squares of paint and in dingy color , his language so abstract that the head of a man of which he seeks to give his impression disappears entirely , and to discover it , even as the motive for his design , becomes as difficult as an algebraic problem or a Chinese puzzle , and the music that he would make visual fades away in the hopeless search for a clue . These are the two m en who set the standard at the Grafton . True , there Are a few like Bonnard , Flandrin , Doucet , who have the independence to work out their artistic salvation after their own fashion ; true , the Russian group have travelled very little further than the English Pre-Raphaelites in their day , with the difference that the Russians for their models have gone back to their own Byzantine primitives . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Picasso that is most in evidence . With all the sympathy in the world , with every desire to grasp and accept the point of view of these two men whom the younger generation is looking up to as leaders , I have endeavored in vain to understand what they are driving at . Now , with the old masters , with Rembrandt , Titian , Velasquez , it is possible to see what they are trying to do in their work , if impossible to see how they do it ; with the Post-Impressionists , it is just the other way round , and it is as difficult to see what they are trying to do , as it is easy to see how they do it . This , I think , explains their weakness If they have sacrificed beauty , as it was once conceived , of form , color , and line , if they are indifferent to the dignity , the quality , the exquisiteness of surface hitherto prized by the masters , it is because they are supposed each to be striving to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? by means as essentially personal . And yet , you need go no further than the Grafton Gallery to find any number of men and women of many nationalities , expressing just the same thing in the same way  --  apparently passing through the same rare " spiritual experiences , " and evolving the same individual method of recording them . Roger Fry himself , their exponent , after coquetting unsuccessfully with - older masters , now appears a full-fledged Post-Impressionist , and such numbers of other Englishmen have caught the trick that the Grafton is not large enough to hold them , and they have overflowed into the Grosvenor and into a show of their own now open at the smaller Stafford Gallery . Nobody has ever managed to become a second Rembrandt , or Titian , or Velasquez , but everybody who chooses appears to be able to turn into a Post-Impressionist while you wait . N. N.

The seals on the vases were in three tombs inscribed with kings ' names , thereby giving assured dates for the cemetery .
