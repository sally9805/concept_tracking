txt The " man in the street , " meaning the trader on the curb , has no doubt about the success of the forthcoming city loan . He is bidding a premium , and the significance 1s all the greater if the appraisal is inspired rather than original . It is true that he bid too high for the previous issue , and had to pay smart money to settle . That was clear case of misadventure , and nothing to the prejudice of the new loan . Everybody 's attention was attracted in 1915 to the worth of the tax exemption feature , which was emphasized by the personal tax fiasco , and all start fair this time . There is an established premium on the bonds , although the city has reduced the rate , and the indications rather are for the Increase of the premium than for the Increase . of ' the yield .

The award to the syndicate was at 101.044 for the long-term bonds and 101.166 for the serials . The city therefore promises to be put in funds for a year or so to come ' on acceptable terms . But a city loan offered at public bidding concerns all in any degree interested in the money ' market . That the city gets its money cheaper raises the question why it does not get it more cheaply still . Never was there such a flood of funds , both of actual gold and of potential credit . Yet the city 's bonds within ten years have sold as much below a 4 per cent . yield as they now sell above It . There are many reasons why the city can not now , as formerly , sell 31/2 per cent . bonds at par or at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during so many years existed now IS shared with other Issues . The premier city 's bond was for long the premier investment of this country . Only one thing could be rated higher , namely , a Government bond , and as the United States was not borrowing money , no Federal bonds were being offered . Now AngloFrench bonds , Canadian bonds , and offerings of many cities of the United States beyond suspicion of unsomedness provide a feast for investors such as never was , and there is an endless flood of them to come . Government Is outbidding the private user of funds . But why does the private user of funds allow himself to be outbid ? It is not because of any despondency . It may be partly from caution and partly from canniness . The public bidders are such from necessity . The warring world must have funds at any cost . Even New York City is a necessitous borrower .

During the war the United States has exported two billion pounds of sugar , a value of $75,000 , - 000 , compared with $2,000,000 for the Preceding twenty months . In - 1.915 England sold 30,000,000 tons of coal less than in 1913 , and the United States is overwhelmed with an unaccustomed business . There never was known such an'iron and steel business at such a range of prices .

The commercial money market is not running as wild as it might be expected to . Whether from the caution of lenders or from self-control of those making marvelous profits , the fact is that the borrowing is good enough for the business doing and in prospect , and not so good as to frighten the timorous
