Of all fool propositions , this is the foolest . Such a line would be needed only In the hot months ? at a time when subway travel promotes serious misgivings in most people as to a future life , and its possibilities of discomfort . What chance would such a route have In competition with the present fast elevated express trains , open to all the breezes , or the increasing , boat service , both open to all the breezes that blow ? Wherein is it needed ? It seems to me that the whole future welfare of this thriving community is not all bound up , in its facilities for riding all over creation in a stuffy hole in the ground for 5 cents .

The other plans involve years of delay , hundreds of millions of debt , and 10-cent fares , after all , for half the people who would use the route !
