In the story of the trial , the sentence , the plea for mercy , and the execution of Miss Edith Cavell , as told by Hugh S. Gibson , secretary of the American Legation at Brussels , there is lacking no circumstance , save one , that might be calculated to arouse the indignation and scorn of mankind . It can not be charged that the act of the German military governor was in violation of the German military law . It was doubtless wholly legal ; Miss Cavell herself fully avowed her guilt , and indeed it appears that her noble candor furnished the military court with evidence that might otherwise have been lacking . But when this has been granted , all is granted that can be . In the straightforward , lucid , and comprehensive statement of Mr. Gibson  --  a statement in which no trace of passionate resentment appears except such as the simple facts inescapably infer  --  we read a story of brutal callousness , brought into higher relief by the mean and petty deception which was resorted to in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy and humanity to defer , and thus possibly to balk , the fulfilment of the executioner 's will . That the original blunder of invading Belgium should now have been capped with the huge mistake of putting to death an English nurse in Belgium shows how slow the German high command is to learn moral lessons . And the fact that the Kaiser has quickly pardoned other women convicted of the same offence as Miss Cavell , at once places in a ghastly light the haste and secrecy of her execution and puts the finishing touch to a deed which , in addition to being barbarous , was eminently stupid . The English press is aflame with indignation over the deed . We may be sure that the German newspapers will reply with a chorus of invective directed against English cant , English hypocrisy . And we may be equally sure that no German newspaper  --  however learned its editorial staff , however familiar with English history and English literature  --  will quote what the great historian of England said in commenting , upon a deed singularly siniilar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman whose life had been one of charity and good works ; she had given shelter to a fugitive who had escaped from the destruction of Monmouth 's rebel army in 1685 . Macaulay points out " the absurdity and cruelty " of a law which makes such an act punishable by death , and proceeds : It is evident that nothing but a lenient administration could make such a state of the law endurable . And it is just to say that , during many generations , no English Government , save one , has treated with rigor persons guilty merely of harboring defeated and flying insurgents . To women especially has been granted , by a kind of tacit prescription , the right of indulging , in the midst of havoc and vengeance , that compassion which is the most endearing of all their charms . Since the beginning of the great Civil War , numerous rebels , some of them far more important than Hickes ? or Nelthorpe , have been protected from the severity of victorious governments by female adroitness and generosity . But no English ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James alone excepted , has had the barbarity even to think of putting a lady to a cruel and shameful death for so venial and amiable a transgression . In an age when burning alive was a legal punishment and executions for treason were the most familiar of phenomena , in a reign whose infamy stands out unique through the butcheries of Jeffreys , the execution of this pure and good woman still glares out of the pages of history after the lapse of centuries , still adds to the blackness of one of the blackeSt of records . In the eye of a Reventlow the killing of Edith Cavell may be a noble act ; in the eyes of many of his countrymen it may appear justifiable , though abhorrent ; but at least let theta not charge Englishmen with hypocridy when they give vent to fierce indignation over a deed done by their enemy to-day , the like of which , done by one of their own kings 230 years ago , they still hold in remembrance as a deep stain upon their history . That this fresh reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the series which began not with the Lusitania , nor yet with Louvain , but with Zabern  --  will produce a profound impression upon Ameri- , can feeling there can be no doubt . But its effect ought not to stop there . We do not believe that many Americans ' take at their face value , or at one-tenth their face value , the rose-colored presentations of the bless- , ings of German conquest to which we are occasionally treated , and of which Mr. McClellan 's recent preposterous article in the New York Tinges is one of the latest examples . Yet there is among many , no doubt , a - ? sneaking feeling that , after all , there may be something in such a view . How false the view is , even from the standpoint of the external facts , has fortunately been exposed , in the case of Mr. McClellan 's article , by a number of writers . Professor Dupriez and Mr. James Gustavus Whiteley have ably shown up in the New York Times the ignorance and falsehood with which the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Post was an effective protest . It can not too plainly be said that , remarkable as is the thoroughness of German system , it does not by any means accomplish the miracles asserted of it , and that if the Belgians are not suffering more than they are , the chief credit is due to themselves . But that is not the main thing . The main thing is that all such defences of German conquest as that of Mr. McClellan leave out the heart of the matter . What these apologists ask is that we shall stand agape , lost in admiration of a whited sepulchre . The trial and execution of Edith Cavell sends a flash of light into the in-tenor , and we think no more of the white-ness of the outer walls or the smoothness of the adjacent roads or the trim perfection of the grass around the tomb . We think of the rotting bodies within , and we think of the mourning and embittered souls of those upon whom this awful cross has been laid We think of that " slavery " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope , and to which he declares that hiS country will never consent to submit . And as we think of these things , our indignation may perhaps be permitted somewhat to over- , flow its narrower bounds , and include in its scope any American so forgetful of his country 's ideals , as to imagine that Americans can regard as compensation for the loss of all that a people hold dear the precious gift of machine-made efficiency bestowed , or Ina - posed , by the German military hierarchy . THE FALLIBLE EYEWITNESS . The bitter business of war has Its humorous aspects . The comic relief has been chiefly supplied by the " observer on the spot . " Frequently he is a newspaper cor'respondent just back from a personally con-ducted tour along the front . Sometimed he is a professional novelist who has been driving ambulances for the Allies . Sometimes she is an American girl who studied music in Vienna and who recently spent two days in Berlin . If they would only be content to give us their personal experiences , they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing less than the certain outcome of the war and the reconstruction of Europe . Our music student knows that von Mackensen has taken 600,000 men intoServia , and that Germany has food enough for two years . Our ambulance driver knows , that the French nation has been re-born , though this is his first visit to Paris . As for our correspondents who have been all along the front , the tone is familiar . " I have been in. the trenches , I have eaten white bread and beef stew with the pioupious , I have seen the great gun pointing towards Metz , and I know that at Creusot there are two thousand such guns , " ? note the ease with which he passes from the one gun he saw to the two thousand he did not see ? " and can confidently say that the Germans will never get to Paris . " As a matter of fact , such an observer would not have known the difference if the big gun had been pointing to Verdun instead of Metz . He could not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand men within a mile of him or two hundred and fifty thousand . A polite officer of the General Staff had to show him which end of the range-finder was the top . Nevertheless , with a Napoleonic sweep of the eye he knows that Paris is safe . It is precisely as if he said , " I have covered on foot every inch of the ground from the Aquarium to Fulton Street , I have seen the crowd on the Curb , I saw the men working on the twenty-second story of the Equitable Building , and I know that the Federal Reserve Bank has made financial panics impossible for all time . " - Your eyewitness ceases to be amusing and becomes something of a nuisance when he starts to draw " lessons " from his experiences and begins to apply them at home . For instance , to have been caught by the war in one of the capitals of Europe immediately qualifies a man to write on Preparedness in America . Such an observer sounds a call to arms in the November Century . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who saw " proud cities of yesterday , to-day smouldering in ashes , " and " nations of happy artisans and farmers reduced in a twinkling to a starving mob , " panic , destitution , insane fear . All this the writer may have seen , but it does not entitle him to draw a map of the Eastern United States and trace a line from the Canadian border to Newport News through the Adirondacks , the Catskills , and the Blue Ridge , and assert that " such a line , once occupied , could easily be held by 400,000 German , British , or French troops against any army in the world . " The reason is obvious . In the first place , the transition from the horrors of invasion to the requirements of strategy is too sudden . In the second place , when our writer speaks of military affairs in Europe , he is a very poor observer indeed . As for example : The deadliness of modern weapons which makes it possible to defend a frontier with fewer than 2,000 men per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile in Galicia-and could not hold . It is a well-known fact , for instance , that Germany has for more than eight months held the western battle line of nearly six hundred miles with fewer than 900,000 men . The fact is that Germany has at least twice that number of men-in. the west . The territory of the United States lying east of the dead-line comprises only about 100,000 square miles , or less than half the total area of France . This requires the services of an arithmetician . If Germany , with nearly two million men , holds less than 10,000 square miles in France , which lies just across the border from Germany , how many men would it require to hold ten times the amount , 4,500 miles from Germany across the Atlantic ? But there is no need of harping on details . Our observer may have seen what he saw . As an advocate of preparedness he is no better than another . Greater weight attaches to the observations of a writer in the New York Times , a former Socialist and believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the brotherhood of man is still far off . After carrying wounded soldiers under fire , " bandaging the stumps of arms and legs , " eating and sleeping within the sound of shell fire , he became convinced that original sin is still in man . We have here an apparently sincere account of a kind of psychological conversion which the touch of actual experience often does work ; the history of the Saints is replete with such spiritual changes . To the extent that the writer , moved by the horrors of invasion , is determined that his own nation shall be spared its horrors , the argument is sound . But here , too , the observer succumbs to the temptation of generalizing beyond his observations : For instance , I found that there is such a thing as a French national spirit . We at a distance have always known that it was there , just as there is a British , German , Russian , Italian , Servian , and Bulgarian national spirit . I know that it has never once , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is rhetoric , because every national spirit flags and wavers under disaster , and recovers with success . From the observers who reported the Kaiser 's hair turning white after the battle of the Marne to the observers who describe the French national spirit , there is a great deal of " knowing " things that the observer really does not know . When he describes his personal relations to war , he is useful . When he begins to generalize about humanity , he creates confusion . When he begins to write about preparedness and the geography of the Appalachians , he gives one a headache . " CHANCES " OF THE CONSTITUTION . There is a great deal of speculation about the vote on the new Constitution for New York State , which will be taken next Tuesday . On Sunday the New York Sun had reports from various counties in the State , the net inference from which is that the outlook for the Constitution . is , on the whole , favorable , though if adopted it will be by only a small majority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment has been made . We have little but guesswork to go upon . Personal motives and politics have become mixed up with the fate of the new instrument of government at the polls . Many are confidently predicting that it will be overwhelmingly beaten . But we may remind them that similar and even more positive forecasts were made of the defeat of the Constitution of 1894 . Boss Platt himself did not believe that it would be adopted . It was , however , easily . A similar surprise may be in store this year for the politicians who think that the new Constitution is already as good as defeated . About this we make no prophecy . We refrain . partly because we do not know , but more because the main thing to consider between now and November 2 is not the chances of the Constitution on election day , but its substantial merits , and the arguments used against it . Some of the latter are respectable and sincere , no doubt , but it can not be denied that many of the attacks upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of sheer clap-trap and self-contradictory assertion has been put forth to confuse the minds of the voters . For example , the Socialist newspaper , the Call , has just become violently excited at the threat of establishing an " autocratic " government at Albany , with the accompanying destruction of " the freedom of the Legislature . " Whether this be honest ignorance or not , we do not undertake to say ; but no one can fail to be amused by it who recalls the consistent Socialist picture of the Legislature as made up of a set of manikins , owned body and soul by capital , or controlled absolutely by venal bosses . It is this kind of legislative dummy of which , we are now told , the freedom is endangered . Those who cry out against the plan of a State budget take precious good care not to cite the text of the amendment embodying it . That would be fatal to their imaginary fears . For the power of the purse is left with the Legislature , virtually as before . The spectacle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely fanciful . Preparation of estimates ; public defence of economies proposed ; free debate of fiscal measures advocated  --  none of these things can interfere with the right of the Legislature to utter the final word , nor are they intended to . To introduce reason and business principles into the conduct of the State 's finances is not to introduce tyranny ; and no one knows this better than some of the men and the newspapers that are trying to make a fearsome bogey out of the budget system . Much the same is to be said of the efforts of Senator Brown and others to kick up a dust over the proposal to give the Governor power to make some of his own appointments . This is held up as if it were borrowed froth Czardom ; whereas it is simply a slight extension of the principle of centralized responsibility , which we have all been for a long time approving and acting upon in city , State , and nation . It would be hardly worth while to refer to Judge Cullen 's rejoinder to Mr. Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunals subverting the courts of this State , were it not to show to what straits the opponents of the new Constitution are driven . Judge Cullen does not at all question-Senator Root 's demonstration that the presentConstitution  --  unchanged in this respect by the proposed amendments  --  affords the most ample protection against dragging citizens before military courts . All this he passes by , merely to reiterate the charge that a special addition to the Bill of Rights was voted down by the delegates . Froth that he makes a rapid but not very graceful transition to several other objections which he has to the new Constitution . The effect of this , we must say with all respect for Judge Cullen , is very much as if he had frankly admitted that his original and sole argument had been shown to be invalid , but then declared that he had several others just as good . The real hope of the adoption of the Constitution lies in the belief ' that the mass of the voters are intelligent enough to discriminate between false assertion and the fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the actual provisions which they are asked to approve or reject , they will know that a vast deal of lying about them is being done . If they stop to consider the whole trend of politicaldiscussion and reform , during the past few years , they will conclude that the Convention made a cautious beginning in meeting the demands of enlightened reformers and publicists in the matter of readjusting some of our forms of government . It is the merits of the scheme , not its " chances " at the polls , which the voters of New York should keep steadily in mind . If they do , there will be no doubt of the adoption of the Constitution . FADS AND FANCIES THAT PAY . Advocates of school reform , like pioneers in. so many other fields , too often neglect to present their case in a form that will appeal to your average , practical citizen , whose opinions or prejudices must , after all , be recognized as a factor to be dealt with . Too many articles written in defence of the Gary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's curriculum . It is extolled as a school of democracy and as an education to a broader life . In this , indeed , the principal merit of the Gary system may consist , and the cost it will involve may very well be worth while . But spiritual values , to find acceptance among the hard-headed people who manage to shape the forms of society , must take on a concrete value . It is doing better to point out that the child who has been educated into complete , intelligent manhood will be worth so many more concrete dollars to the community . But even that may seem a trifle indefinite and remote . New York would never have taken up the Gary plan so earnestly if the actual exigencies of the municipal budget had not brought economy to the front . The Gary scheme may or may not turn out to be cheaper than our present system ; the fact is undeniable that it is receiving attention because the community hopes to get out of it - more results for more of New York 's school children than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not sneer at fads and fancies if he can see a profit in the tangible future . - An instance of the kind of innovation in schools that is plainly not a fad was supplied by the exhibition of the high-school art courses in relation to women 's work recently held in the galleries of the Fine Arts Building . The work of pupils in eighteen schools , and in perhaps a score of various crafts , was on display . The first impulse of your practical citizen would be to reject these efforts in the industrial arts , and chiefly in the field of art design , as another in- stance of fad and fancy . Yet the mere mention that these classes are similar in scope to those which are to be found in every European city should be enough . It is not merely a question of developing a national fine taste to be satisfied by products from abroad , but of educating a trained class of workers in the finer crafts . One authority writes : What skilled designers we have are for the greater part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has for years paid immense sums for the privilege of purchasing abroad materials we ourselves possess , but have failed to utilize with the aid of good design into manufactured forms which can command our own markets . To-day this nation is engaged in a breathless attempt to build up dyeing industries and other chemical industries , from which we have been cut off by the war . By this analogy we would wait for the siege and close investment of Paris before setting out on a frantic attempt to build up a fine industry in fabrics while the customer went unprovided . Ignorance or lack of imagination will account for the average citizen who in one breath will condemn fads and fancies in the schools of America and humble himself before German efficiency . Our conception of efficiency is hazy with random ideas released by the much-discussed " scientific management . " It is true that we speak of Preparedness , but efficiency and preparedness have become confused in a vague impressiOn that the victories of the German armies have somehow been made pOssible by " scientific " systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . The Kaiser 's kind of efficiency consists much less in saving thirty minutes than in using intelligently the other eight hours and thirty minutes of the working day . It consists less in saving waste motions than in developing the several thousand motions in the factory or at the desk , with which no system of scientific management can dispense . The great secret of German efficiency is applicationand training . Preparedness means training ; not magic formulas , but very hard work and foresight extended through the years . Germany 's strength is- in her schools , military or technical , - and in the last analysis it is the technical schools that count . Schools of all kinds , schools in forestry , schools in textiles , schools in brewing , craft schools , and by no means least , schools of applied design . Germany takes fads and fancies and turns them into industries and arts . All this is elementary , but it is our national habit to be blind to elementary things until they are forced upon our attention by something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that for the public-school boy there was some oth-er destiny than going to high school or going into the blind-alley of office-boy . We have learned and have gone in for vocational education . Must it take years before we have made a further step and learned that for the graduate of the girls ' high school there is something between college and the stenographer 's desk ? Between the two lies a field of great possibilities , the entire range of the artistic crafts , for which the American woman would seem to be specially qualified , with her acknowledged flair for beauty in clothes and in the home . We have our spasmodic awakenings . We had recently a sudden patriotic movement for American fashions for American women , - which has probably gone as quickly as it came . The assumption was , apparently , that out in Seattle or Detroit the native genius of America would assert itself by January 1 , and put Paquin and Poiret out of business . That is not the way the Germans or the other Continentals go about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , we will he efficient and prepared . " Preparedness is draining and schools . THE THEATRE ADRIFT . In ten years , if the moving pictures continue - their triumphal progress , the spoken drama will be dead . When Mr. W. A. Brady made this gloomy prophecy the other night he used the word " spoken " in a very general sense , in contradistinction to the silent or screen drama . He was not thinking of the spoken drama as practiced , let us say , by Paul Hervieu , of the French Academy , who died on Monday in Paris ; of the drama , that is , in which character and ideas , expressing themselves in words , are not sat ; rificed to " action , " by which , in the native drama , is understood something - " doing . " The Hervieu play , the Continental- play as a rule , is spoken drama to the point of frequently being talky , against which we justly protest . The ideal play undoubtedly is what the textbooks always call for : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ideal is not often realized . The Europeans have emphasized the talk . We have gone in for the action , with the result that there arose the distinction between the " literary " drama and the action play . The idea that there can be an action of the mind and the soul , that the subtleties of a Hervieu have a for- ' ward movement of their own , has not found acceptance here . And rightly enough . The enjoyment of brilliant analysis and talk in itself is not part of the national endowment . Our spoken drama , if we have one , must stand somewhere between the Hervieu or Shaw play and the " movies . " Can that middle ground be found ? Is there a legitimate field for the spoken play in this country , which the movies can never occupy ? Common-sense would argue that there is such a field . An art some twenty-five hundred years old can not conceivably perish as suddenly as the managers predict . When a crisis in the spoken drama supervenes , the tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external causes . Some time ago it was the automobile . Then it was auction bridge and the tango . Now it is the motion pictures . It must be frail virtue that succumbs before every fad of the moment . It seldom occurs to these practical men to ask whether they themselves are not largely responsible ; but to-day there is very evidently a busy searching of hearts along Broadway . All this pother about price-cutting , and ticket agencies , and alliances made and broken the same day , indicates both the existence of a crisis and its cause . Big Business in the theatre has struck a slump . The revelations in court about circuits and syndicates and territorial delimitations and booking privileges read very much like a proceeding under the Sherman Anti-Trust law . The same methods that have ' brought so many railways into the hands of a receiver have operated in the theatre . Under the influence of Big Business , the spoken drama has undergone an evolution which did make it exceedingly vulnerable to the competition of the movies . Managers in buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a play must be one of a very wide appeal A long run in New York city , such as would satisfy the wildest dreams of the European playwright , was not enough . The play must run in the provinces , and employ several road companies . Point to charming plays that have been highly successful in Nevi York , and your practical man of the theatre will say , " Yes , but it starved on the road . " Writing , then , for a nation-wide audience , the dramatist has been compelled to go very thin on character , ideas , dialogue , to concentrate on . action , and action reduced to its elementary terms . The spoken drama has been reduced to a minimum of speech . It became largely a matter of pistol-waving on the one hand and crude sex appeal on the other . And when it comes to pistol-waving , the photo-play can beat the living theatre at the game . If the spoken drama is to compete with the screen-play on the mere ground of action , then Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the badly written , psychologically worthless spoken play should survive . But once you give up your dreams of huge profits - and agree to call a play successful which will appeal not to the millions , but only to the tens of - thousands , the outlook for the spoken drama is far from hopeless . The drama , says Mr. Brady , is not sustained in New York as it is in London , Paris , Berlin . The answer is that in those cities people do not think in terms of enormous royalties . There are audiences in this country which should make the spoken drama quite profitable , not the spoken drama of Hervieu , but the drama as it seemed to promise when Clyde Fitch , Augustus Thomas , Langdon Mitchell , and Edward Sheldon at his best were at work . From that we might have gone on to still better things . The real play is impossible if you persist in thinking of indefinite runs and half a dozen road companies . How can even half a dozen road companies compare with the movie film which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope for the spoken drama , because men like Augustus Thomas may command $10,000 for a movie scenario written in a few minutes . If Mr. Thomas insists on making $10,000 every few minutes , he will , indeed , let the regular theatre go . But we imagine that for Mr. Thomas there is an appeal about the theatre which might counterbalance the call of enormous profits from the movies . Or Mr. Thomas might earn $50,000 by writing five scenarios in half an hour and then have plenty of time left for the drama . At any rate , the film play in itself need not be an enemy of the true drama . The film play may yet turn out to be a blessing in disguise . If it weans away from the theatre the men who think of profits in war stocks , there might be a chance for the managers content with lesser profits to be made in furnishing real plays to the public . By satisfying the elementary appetite for " action , " it may yet drive pistol-waving from the theatre and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to the movies for one thing and to the theatre for another . And the dramatist who is relieved from the demand for something " doing " every minute may give us plays that are spoken in a more real sense than the " spoken " drama of crooks and detectives .
