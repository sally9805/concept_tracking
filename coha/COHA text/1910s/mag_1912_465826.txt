He may carry his investigations far enough to enable him to recognize and demonstrate the falsity and frequently the absurdity of assertions constantly and confidently made . But only a limited portion of the whole ground can be covered by an individual . To arrive at correct conclusions on all disputed points would require the labor of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collating the evidence gathered from the examination of the whole body of our best literature . This is a work which has never been done . So far , indeed , is it from having been done that it has never been even attempted . Yet until it is done the field is left open to every sciolist who has the effrontery to substitute his hastily formed notions for the results of thorough investigation . Perplexing as are such questions in the case of every one of the parts of speech , those connected with the pronoun are the greatest in number and difficulty . About none others have so many grammatical conflicts raged . The problems presented have in certain cases never been settled decisively , save in the minds of those who have scrupulously refrained from any attempt to impair preconceived opinion by acquiring knowledge of disturbing fact . The main reason for this condition of things is simple . The pronoun has preserved more of inflection than the other parts of speech subject to declension . The adjective , once abounding in distinct forms for gender , number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sameness of form which has come to the noun and adjective as a result of the loss of the characteristic endings of these eases is an all-important ' fact in the history of usage . The burden of maintaining the distinction once denoted by them has fallen upon half a dozen pronouns . It is little wonder that they have proved unequal to the task . In consequence we have lost to a large extent that subtle linguistic sense which by constant practice comes to be almost a second nature to the users of synthetic speech . Our aptitude in dealing with the questions involved has accordingly become distinctly impaired . In the ease of the noun or the adjective , the speaker is enabled to conceal his ignorance or his error by means of the likeness of form which prevails . But this is not possible with the pronoun . It is therefore little matter of surprise that in no other part of speech has the controversy between strict and loose employment of etymological forms been more violent . In some cases the adherents of the former have triumphed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are points in dispute in which the struggle has been going on for centuries and seems now no nearer settlement than it was at the outset . There is no intention to express here an opinion as to the correctness or incorrectness of these disputed points . It is how the differences came to exist that comes under consideration , as well as the varying attitude taken toward them by the users of speech . In this respect the history of the pronoun is of special in-w terest . In its case the dullness of linguistic perception , which is a consequence of the general loss of distinction between the nominative and the objective , has had a steady tendency to betray men into grammatical pitfalls . One deserves special notice from the frequency of its present occurrence . This is the employment of the objective whom as the subject of a verb when it is separated from it by an intercalary phrase . The newspapers in this country in the columns of which such misuse of this pronoun can not be found constantly are exceptions to the general rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furnish one or more illustrations of the error . But this particular violation of grammar is far from being confined to quarters in which the element of haste can be pleaded by way of palliation . It shows itself ? at least in America inthe sermons of divines , in the letters of officials holding prominent positions , in the decisions of judges of the highest courts . Unfortunately , too , this violation of grammar is not limited even to these quarters . It appears at times in the writings of those who hold more or less distinct literary repute . In truth , indefensible as it is , it has behind it a certain amount of respectable authority in the literature of both the past and the present . The number of illustrations which could be furnished from living authors would , if given , be distinctly startling . But to take examples from contemporaries is always an invidious task . Furthermore , it is here an unnecessary one . The point can be brought out just as satisfactorily by citing errors of this sort from reputable authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of no one can be hurt by having their linguistic misdeeds pointed out . It will be sufficient , therefore , to show the prevalence of this grammatical sin by giving a few examples from writers of the past , merely premising that many similar ones , and very certainly more of them , could be furnished from the living than from the dead . For instance , the philosopher Locke exemplifies the error in one of his letters to Molyneux . " You would find , " he wrote , " three or four in the parlor after dinner , whom you would see passed their afternoons as agreeable and jocundly as any people . " In the twenty-fourth number of Sir Richard Steele 's periodical paper , The Lover , belonging to 1714 , the same sort of construction turns up . " Your cousin , " writes this author , " whom you are too inadvertent to perceive does not want sense . " It is not the only instance of this kind of blunder for which Steele is responsible . Later in the century we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the ceremony attendant upon a wedding of breaking the cake over the head of the bride , he tells us that the fragments were distributed among the bystanders " on the supposition that who ate of the hallowed cake should that night have a vision of the man or woman whom Heaven designed should be his wedded mate . " A flagrant example may be taken from the early part of the last century . " On my return , " wrote in 181:3 Sir John Mackintosh to his daughters . " I found the whole fashionable literary world occupied with Madame de Steel , whom you know was the author of Corinne . " As a final example , we find that in 1853 a character in Bulwer Lytton 's My Novel speaks of a " literary vagabond whom he supposed had long since gone to the dogs . " In all these examples whom has been made to do duty for the nominative . In the quotations given it is the subject , respectively , of passed , of does wane , of should he , of was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown out , the violation of grammar would stand out conspicuously in its nakedness . Such errors as these , men frequently , perhaps usually , fall into from carelessness . Yet this is not always the case . From the pertinacity with which some writers cling to the construction under consideration , it is manifest that there are those who write had English of this sort under the belief that it is their positive duty to do it . They take pains to employ whom when even to them who would be the much more natural expression . Surprising as their conduct may seem , it is no more so than the indifference to it of those who devote themselves to the preservation of the purity of the speech . The manifest defiance of good usage exhibited appears largely to escape the notice of these defenders of the faith . The constructions about which they are watchful are those in which nominative and objective are confounded without the agency of any intervening phrase to distract the attention . Examples of this departure from strict grammatical propriety have more than existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Failure to distinguish between the proper use of nominative and objective was sure to show itself in the pronoun as soon as distinction of form between these eases had disappeared from the other parts of speech . The resulting condition of carelessness in their employment was of course not reached in a day . If we can draw a safe inference about the usage of any period from its literature , it was in the latter part of the sixteenth and the early part of the seventeenth century that confusion of ease in the pronoun reached its climax in colloquial speech . So far as literature is concerned , it would be mainly manifested at that period in the writings of the dramatists . It was they and they alone who represented the language of conversation . The result reached then must be observed , however , in the plays as they were first published , not as they now frequently appear under the purifying hand of editors who are steeped in the lore of the latest grammatical text-books . How far the original form of these plays represented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was perverted by actor or transcriber , it may be difficult to tell with certainty . But , making the utmost allowance for this source of error , it is hardly possible to take any other position than that a great deal of the license of speech which was displayed in the theatrical productions of that time must be imputed to the author himself ; that in writing as he did he was following a general if not the general practice of his own age in the use of colloquial English . Accordingly , in spite of the efforts of modern editors to confer impeccability of expression upon these Elizabethan authors by silently altering the text in order to conform to modern ideas , there still remain plenty of passages which are be-VOL CXXV. ? No. 150. - 118yond the relief of any grammatical surgery . We have never recovered from the linguistic havoc which was wrought in the speech during the reigns of Elizabeth and James . In the case of the pronoun of address the objective has succeeded in establishing itself as the regular nominative . Grammar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin one of the grossest of corruptions . But this is merely a single illustration of the confusion which came to prevail generally . All along the line the distinction between nominative and objective seems to have started on the road to extinction . If we can trust the representation of colloquial speech , as furnished by the dramatists of the time , not merely were ye and you interchanged , but also I and me , thou and thee , he and him , we and us , and who and whom . They and them seem to have suffered the least from this general upheaval ; but they . too , suffered . Since that period the language has striven gallantly to recover from the linguistic disturbance which threatened for a time to turn everything topsy-turvy . The tendency to confuse the two cases has been in a measure checked , but traces of the once prevalent disorder still survive in whole or in part . The now established use of the objective of the pronoun of address as the nominative proves conclusively that we probably shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place during the Elizabethan period . In some instances the effort to bring us all hack to a state of linguistic purity has met with a reasonable degree of success . In others the success has been so moderate that to this day differences of opinion continue to prevail . One distinct survival there is of the once widespread confusion of ease . This is the everlasting discussion which exists as to the propriety of using it is me in place of it is I. The controversy has gone on for an indefinite period . It is apparently no nearer solution now than it was several hundred years ago ? that , too , in spite of the fact that the vast majority of grammatical text-books have placed themselves on record as condemning the one and insisting upon the exclusive correctness of the other . In England col- loquial speech , which apparently recognizes the propriety of both expressions , seems , on the whole , to prefer it is me . Such , at all events , is a natural inference from the representation of its prevalence which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there stoutly defended by many ; for in the old country men are much less ridden by formal grammar than in this so-called land of liberty . There , indeed , plenty of educated persons are found to speak scoffingly of those who censure it . With us the schoolmaster is much more abroad . He does not always content himself with being merely positive ; he is not unfrequently rampant . Still , even here his all-pervading influence has been insufficient to banish the usage . Its employment , however , serves one satisfactory purpose : it sometimes enables the controversialist who is unable to answer his opponent 's arguments to distract attention from his failure by assuming an air of superior linguistic , and inferentially of superior logical , virtue over him who chances or chooses to employ the condemned expression . Yet , in spite of its apparent general prevalence in England , there is at the present day something of a disposition to recognize the theoretical correctness of the exclusive use of the nominative form , even by those who employ the accusative . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest to comment on the impropriety of using the one case where rigid grammar requires the other , while at the same time they pay no heed to the requirement in the representation they give of the current speech . This is not true of the past . Fielding and Richardson and Smollett , when so disposed , resorted to the objective fearlessly , and , as some would think , shamelessly . It was with them a matter of course . The English writers of fiction of later days follow the same practice ; but they occasionally manifest an uneasy consciousness of its impropriety . It shows the influence which the persistent attacks of purists have made upon the mind of authors that the modern novelist has occasionally come to assume an apologetic attitude for representing the speech of his fellow-men as he finds it actually to be , not as according to grammarians itought to be . He takes occasion at times to let his readers see that be himself knows better ; that he recognizes the theoretical existence of a higher law , which he persistently violates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substitution of the accusative for the nominative is a bad or risky procedure . Having borne his witness and relieved himself from any possible charge of ignorance , he calmly proceeds to make his characters indulge in this same bad or risky procedure . Take as an illustration Trollope 's novel of The Duke 's Children . " Our only comfort was , " writes the son and heir to the father , " that the Carbottie people were quite as badly off as us . " Here we are told that the duke , who is putting down comments on the margin of the letter , makes " another memorandum as to the grammar . " Yet elsewhere in the novel the various characters indulge in similar usages without rebuke from the imaginary interlocutor in the story or comment from its actual creator . Take again the words of the hero of Swinburne 's Love 's Cross Currents : " ' That 's her , ' said Reggie , using a grammatical construction which , occurring in a Latin theme , would have brought down birch on his bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , let us turn to the most delightful of female scamps which fiction presents . In a confidential letter to her sweetest and dearest Amelia , Becky Sharp reports the words of Sir Pitt Crawley about a tenant of his who has been sent to the workhouse . " Him and his family , " says her new employer , " has been cheating me on that farm these hundred and fifty years . " Becky , who has a hankering after linguistic virtue in lieu of the lack of certain other kinds held in high esteem by the censorious , comments on this breach of the proprieties . " Sir Pitt , " she writes . " might have said he and his family , ' to be sure ; but rich baronets do not need to be careful about grammar , as poor governesses must be . " Yet her creator was not disposed to be too positive about the invariable necessity of employing the nominative . In The Adventures of Philip we meet with the following sentence : " ' Is that him ? ' said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage was merely questionable . To the ordinary American schoolmaster it would be damnable . It remains to be said in passing that , looked at from the standpoint of ancient usage , both of these expressions are corruptions ? that is , as discoursers on usage define corruptions . The etymologically correct form of words is not it is I , but it am I , or I am it . Such it was in the original speech . Such it still continues to be in allied Teutonic tongues . No German , for instance , thinks of saying es ist ich ; he says id , bin es . Such was the usage with us , also , in that pure and perfect past to which our attention is always being directed by the bewailers of the ruin overtaking the speech . In English this strictly correct method of expression flourished to the end at least of the fourteenth century . It probably survived to a later period . In that most exquisite of narrative poems , " The Knight 's Tale , " Chaucer puts it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In modern orthography , his words read as follows : " I am thy mortal foe , and it em I That loveth so hots Emily the bright That I will die present in her sight . " There seems , in fact , to have been a peculiar fascination for the users of speech in the accusative of the pronoun . The tendency to substitute it for the nominative has prevailed during all periods of modern English . The Quakers started out with a bold defiance of common usage by employing the singular for the plural when addressing an individual . But , however successful they may have been in upholding theoretical grammatical purity in the matter of number , they broke down lamentably in the full as important matter of case . Thee came largely to be used by them as the subject of the verb in place of thou . It still continues . This , however , is the practice of but a single sect ; there is another instance in which all men agree in defying the precepts of rigid grammar . If in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominative , so one idiom there is in which something of the same operation has been achieved by the relative . No usage is more firmly established in our language than the employment of the accusative whom after theconjunction than . It has behind it the authority of great writers of our own speech for hundreds of years . Yet this fact seems sometimes unknown to lexicographers , who usually differ from grammarians pure and simple by being content to record the state of the language as it is and not as in their wisdom they conceive it ought to be . " Even Milton says than whom , ' " is the comment made under the first of these words in one of our great dictionaries . It would have been more to the point for it to have mentioned a single author of repute who did not use it whenever occasion required . Venturesome as it certainly is to affirm a negative , it is doubtful if there can be found in the great writers of our speech a single instance of the employment of the strictly orthodox than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged into the full light of day . At all events , than whom is so firmly established that there is no likelihood that it will ever be dislodged from the position which it has held unchallenged for centuries . But , if this he so , how shall the component parts be treated ? Only two ways seem open : to purists it would be hard to decide which would be the more objectionable . One of them is to treat whom here as a nominative . Such a procedure is something at which the gorge of every grammarian would rise . If this , accordingly , be not possible , what other course is there than to regard than as a preposition ? To many , perhaps to most of the class just mentioned , this would be almost as offensive . It would open the way at once to the legalization of the numerous instances in literature in which the objectives me , us , thee , him , and them have followed than . Such a practice has been one of the happy hunting-grounds of the verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves with the faults , real or supposed , of great authors . In consequence we seem to be grammatically between the devil and the deep sea . There still linger with us other survivals of heretical usage which have come down from this past period of linguistic turmoil . Some of them the prolonged and persistent efforts of grammarians have not succeeded in driving entirely out of employment . No observant student of the language of Shakespeare and his contemporaries can fail to be familiar with the interchange already mentioned which went on between the nominative and the accusative of the personal pronouns . Some of the expressions in which this interchange appeared have never died out . One of the phrases that deserves special mention ? though there are several others like it ? is to be found in " The Merchant of Venice . " " All debts are cleared between you and I , " writes Antonio to Bassanio . This usage , common in Elizabethan English , can be traced through the following centuries . It still survives in spite of all that grammarians of successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having once become current , die hard . They do not die any the less hard because from the point of view of strict grammar they can furnish little or nothing to say for themselves . But the confusion caused by the interchangeability of the two eases is not confined to the personal pronouns ; it extends to the relative and interrogative . Attention has already been called to the now persistent misuse ? at least in this country ? of the relative whom for who when separated from its verb by an intervening clause . Far less frequent , but still occasionally found , is the use of who for wham . This showed itself at an early period . " The Duke of Meehenberg , " wrote Aseham , in 1551 , " who they took prisoner , is dead . " So expressed himself the great scholar of the sixteenth century . Such usage , however , is rare in the case of who as a relative ; but when it is employed as an interrogative it abounds . From the Elizabethan period down to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who for whom in beginning an interrogation is a prevalent practice ; one is tempted to say that it is the almost universal practice . Accordingly there seems no grammatical way open save to treat it in such cases as an accusative . If we canjudge from the writings of novelists and playwrights , it was not until after the middle of the last century that who showed any disposition whatever to retire before whom at the beginning of interrogative sentences , in spite of the incessant bombardment to which the practice had been subjected for a hundred years . One , indeed , can judge only from one 's own necessarily limited examination . So far as that goes , it was not until the time specified that the grammatically correct whom seems to put in anything but an occasional appearance when introducing a question . The truth is that the employment of the nominative who for the accusative in certain forms of interrogation has become so imbedded in common usage that resort , even now , to the strictly orthodox practice frequently requires , on the part of educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem natural . In the past , assuredly this nominative form , where precise grammar would require the accusative , turns up with almost invariable regularity in works which set out to represent colloquial speech . " Who is it from ? " says the mother , in Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , to her daughter , who has just received a letter . " Who is it like ? " says the heroine of Jane Eyre to St. John Rivers , as she shows him the picture of Rosamund Oliver . Such examples could be multiplied by hundreds . There are eases , indeed , when the use of whom would strike upon the ears of most of us as painfully pedantic . " Who the devil is he talking to ? " says Sir Lucius O'Trigger , in Sheridan 's " Rivals , " as he notices Captain Absolute soliloquizing . To tolerate whom in place of who in such a sentence as the last would require the speaker to be so thoroughly steeped in grammar that the sense of traditional usage , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome . That height of linguistic virtue few of us there are who attain .
