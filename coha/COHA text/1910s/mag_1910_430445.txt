NOT so very long ago we designed a dining room for a New York apartment . It was not an original room , but we had much pleasure in doing it . Instead of going shopping , we searched for its furnishings among the seventeenth-century Dutch masters . With the rise of the Dutch republic , a. home-keeping art sprang into being that greatly concerned itself with the representation of the domestic interior . After years of war , the charm of familiar things came as a sudden and poignant revelation to the Dutch people and developed a school of painting that we call the " Dutch Little Masters . " Their pictures have often an interesting suggestiveness for the house furnisher . Gerard Don 's masterpiece in the Louvre suggested the long window seat and the fireplace with its sloping mantel breast . A cabinet in the " Gift of the Hunter , " by Gabriel Metsu , suggested the shape of the china closet , and a hanging cabinet in Maertensz Sorgh 's " The Mandolin Player " suggested the details of the wood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with boards above , and the broad wooden strips of the floor were suggested by Pieter de Hooch 's " Woman Reading . " The table was a rectangular-framed table with turned legs . The dining chairs were leather-covered , with low , rectangular backs . By the fireplace , to serve as easy chairs , were two X chairs suggested by Jan Steen 's " The Doctor 's Visit , " which is a picture , not only masterly in technical quality , but . unlike many of Jan Steen 's pictures , charming in its portrayal of maidenhood . We studied these furnishings , not for their association or for their historical value , but because we felt that they are of value to the modern home . We wanted oak furniture stained a dark brown . We wanted it simple and dignified , of good wood , without the expense of carving , and yet with some variation from the straight lines of the mission . All this the seventeenth-century furniture , with its turned legs and ' modified forms , suggested . Last January we were therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feeling , for we saw it embodied in a store window in a new style of furniture that acknowledged its inspiration in its very name . It was called Flanders . The province of Flanders was composed in the first half of the seventeenth century of a part of Holland , Belgium and northern France , and Antwerp was its most active center of production . The Flemish originated the style for their native oak after a short period during which they imitated the Italian woodwork of walnut . It was so successful that it was borrowed by the other northern nations . It was also imported into our colonies , where the low , rectangularbacked chair was usually found among people of wealth and high social position . In this new style of Flanders there is a chair design with leather-covered seat and back , another with antique cane and a. third with a leather seat and slat back . This slat back has the same shape as the leather-covered back and the same turned posts . The slats are of two widths , two  | narrow slats alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both the single and double beds , and with the turned posts is very effective . There is a dignity of form and deep richness of color about this furniture that should make it popular in rooms with dark woodwork and corresponding wall colors . In a dining room with a wall painted a deep old yellow and with window curtains of deep ecru and hangings of yellow cloth of Sheba , this dull brown furniture , with deep red leather coverings and added touches of red in minor furnishings , would make a wry satisfying color scheme . There is a round top extension table which does not seem in keeping with this style and is altogether lacking in its poetic spirit ; but all the other table designs are good . There is a round table with slanting legs and crossed stretchers and with a certain Bohemian air that would make it fascinating for a country house ; while the hundred-legged drop-leaf tables are more in keeping for the city . For a library or living room in this style , there could be an olive or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be oils in dull black frames , with a narrow gold molding on the inside , or brown photogravures in wide brown frames . The shop window which we saw was furnished as a bedroom . Many people do not like dark furniture in a bedroom , but one year in Rome I had a large , high -- ceiled room in an old palazza , with quaint brown furniture . The sight of the shop window revived all my old love . An effective arrangement of drawers , or a delightful form , or a happy detail , can have as pleasurable and invigorating an effect as bright colors . In educating our taste we give altogether too little thought to form and space divisions . A bedroom in old French blue or rose would have a rich look with this furniture ; or a simpler effect would be to have a more neutral wall color with a bedspread and hangings of toile de lin or some English printed linen with a small . conventional , all-over pattern . WALLPAPERS FOR A BEDROOM Question ? We are about to decorate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow paper . Can you suggest something ? We had the doors finished in mahogany and the woodwork is white enamel . Answer ? There are some excellent papers on the market at present in good bed- room colors , papers with a broken color effect that is gained with faint crosslines in white on a solid color background . They are being much used . The only regret is that they are so often finished at the top with a cut-out paper festoon of flowers that robs them straightway of their excellence . There is something tawdry about a festoon of flowers cut out and pasted upon the wall . It hardly becomes a flower lover to resort to such devices . And yet this festoon probably reflects a longing that is highly creditable and loving , a reasonable desire for gayety and brightness . Do n't you think some artistic decorators very stern lawgivers , who overlook in our poor outward expressions , that are prompted by our inexperience , the deepdown longing of our hearts ? I had a talk one day with the wife of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while she asked me to come upstairs to see her rooms . She took me into her bedroom . It was calcimined a bright blue . There was a white lace bedspread . On the wall hung a painting of the Virgin and Child . I really do not know whether the room wa lovely or not . All I could see was the loveliness of its spirit , immaculate in its cleanliness , full of aspiration in its lace bedspread , and full of faith in its oil painting of the Virgin , and Child . It is , after all , in the spirit that the real values be . What substitutes are there for the cutout flower festoons , substitutes that brighten and make gay ? A flowered cretonne or linen taffeta can be used as hangings . It sounds paradoxical , but it is true that a few lengths of flowered taffeta against a plain wall color give a room a gayer look than whole walls of flowers . The plain wall color accents the design in the material and makes it more telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taffeta against a light blue wall tint . There is something sunny in a deep yellow and pale pink pattern cretonne in a yellow room . There is a printed Aberdeen linen with a hardy garden pink in red and some bluebells that would make quaint , old-fashioned hangings in a room with bird's-eye maple furniture . In a green bedroom that wants a touch of red ; one of the red-and-white printed liberty silks would be quite daring . Some of the new silks , though in plain colors , come in shades that are very re- freshing . One silk , having a self-colored resign , is the very soul of refinement . It has a kind of hexagonal figure of lovely proportions and of a satin sheen against a ribbed silk background . If there are only simple white curtains for the bedrooms , there can be a pattern touch in the upholstery of an easy chair or a couch . If the room is lighted by electricity , there can be pretty patterned shades for the side brackets . Sometimes the touch can be given a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vases and candlesticks . Distel ware , for instance , is lovely for a bedroom . It has a body of mat cream color with artistic patterns . It is a Dutch pottery and comes in many unique shapes . Sometimes an interesting c o l o r touch can be added by the bedspread . I saw , a few weeks ago , a bedspread worked in reds and blues that had all the richness of a Bulgarian embroidery . As soon as you do away with the paper festoon , the world will seem full of beautiful substitutes . PLANNING THE FLOWER GARDEN QUESTION ? Would you kindly give us your advice about a garden ? I am inclosing a rough plan of the grounds . The new part has been added recently and we would like some ideas about beautifying it . The house is an old-fashioned white one with many gables and casement windows . I think there are possibilities of making an old-fashioned garden on the new land we have bought . B. E. 0 . ANSWER ? A large plot of ground on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an old-fashioned flower garden . The row of maples that you show on the plan beside the house and the rows of trees on the streets will form a good green background for your garden , The winter months are the months to make garden plans for early spring planting . I am sending you a sketch of a flower garden . If I were you , if 7 had not had much experience with flowers , I would not lay out the wholE garden plan at once . I would have s four feet wide border all around with e lawn in the center . Do not plant too many different kinds of flowers . Many a garden with lovely flowers is spoiled because the garden is not considered as a whole . Plant so as to get effective massings of color and so as to have a succession of bloom from early spring until late in fall . In the spring you could start with daffodils , those favorites of our grandmothers that still bloom in deserted gardens . Along the fence plant hollyhocks and cosmos . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pink and lavender , but you may prefer a single color or more varied massings , from pure white to vivid searlet . Be sure when you mass different colors that they belong to varieties of equal size . I know white varieties that grow foar feet high the second year and scarlet ones that do n't seem to grow at all . They do not make amicable comrades when shoulder to shoulder . Buy large , field-grown plants . If you buy four or five dozen to begin with , in three years you can separate the roots and have three or four times as many . Foxgloves are biennials , but they are so interesting they are well worth the extra trouble . They are June favorites and bloom with the sweet Williams . These latter and the old-fashioned spicy pinks make lovely perennial edging plants . The Yucca is a hardy native of Mexico . It blooms at the same time as the hollyhocks . Its tall , white stems of flowers are very effective in clumps here and there in a long flower border . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you must give them plenty of room and plant them deep . The flowers are as lovely as orchids , but I like iris , too , for its sword-shaped leaves . They are very effective among the other plant foliage and remain green and upright even when the late cosmos blooms . Get the hardiest chrysanthemums to be obtained and be sure that you choose colors that will look well with the colors  | of the cosmos . I love the delicate pink ones , but in such long borders as you have , you could plant various colors with effect . The first year the chrysanthemums will not be very bushy , but in a few years they will take all the room that you can spare for them . That is one thing about starting a perennial garden : you must have patience for a few years and not get discouraged until the plants have had time to grow . Fill in the vacant " spots with annuals . Try the German stocks . Sow blue cornflowers and coreopsis . Sow the seeds of asters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early September . Sow the lovely Shirley poppies , fairies even in the midst of flowerdom . When you lay out the beds around the circle that I have indicated on the plan , I will not have to suggest what to grow . By that time you will want to grow so many flowers it will be difficult , even for the sake of effective massings , to omit a single one . When you lay out these beds , let the walks be of grass . As for the circle , it could have a sundial . A sundial is more than a timepiece . The romance of centuries clusters around it . It is the child of poetry . Perhaps you would prefer a garden of aquatics in a circular pool . Think of growing your own water lilies ! Or , perhaps , you will want a summerhouse with rambler roses and clematis climbing over it , and with cozy seats and tables for afternoon needlework and tea . There are many ideas that can be worked out in a garden , but the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUGGESTIONS QUESTION ? May I have a few suggestions for the bungalow we are building ? The house is to be 32 by 22 feet , with a porch across the length . There are three rooms downstairs and two up under the gambrel roof , also storage room over porch . The sides and roof are covered with shingles . The masonry is exposed and includes a double chimney built on outside of natural rough and creamy stone . There are doors of birch and casement windows . With the creamy stone , we wish to use the dark-brown shingle stain for sides , porch posts and lattice . Would it be wrong to make the roof shingles moss green instead of brown ? If the roof is green , must the upstairs and shingles under gambrel roof be green or brown ? In just what places should ivory-while paint be used besides on window w work if window and door frames made brown like shingles ? The pain around here have always made the wisdow and door frames lighter in color that bulk of house . I certainly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would not be incorrect to use moss green on the roof shingles , and if you do so , all the shingles on the side of the gambrel roof should be the same brown as the rest of the side shingles. think , while green is not incorrect , you would be more pleased if you would ha the roof shingles stained a grayish bl It would give a brown and cream col effect that would be more refined than it would be with the introduction of a third color . I should paint the sashes white and all the rest of the trim brown , as you intend doing , unless the design of the house is very symmetrical and of a certain Puritan trimness . In that case . it might be very attractive to paint the window casings and doors as well a. - the balustrades a white , more of a cream white than an ivory . In painting a. house so much dependupon the architectural design ! A long . rambling , unconventional design could be absolutely spoiled by using the white on the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a new house . It is a small colonial design . May I ask what color you think best for trimmings if house is shingled and left to weather and roof is stained a moss green . What color shades are to be used with such an outside ? ANSwER ? The best color to be used for a colonial design , if the shingles are left to weather , is white . with white shades for the windows . QUESTION ? What shall be done if the doors and the other exposed parts of the healer grow rusty ? ANSWER -- Scrape off the rust , and then paint the exposed surfaces with black . heat-resisting enamel paint . In the same way it is well to keep the various water pipes that are not packed in good condition by giving them a coat of aluminum paint periodically . A cellar that is in shipshape order can be a source of much pleasure and gives you an underlying feeling of genuineness . That reminds me of the comment of a young man on the family of a young lady he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it  | turned out to be a rainy afternoon , so they were invited to the laundry for a fencing match . Young men are often keen philosophers . " I know they are genuine people , " he said ; " they keep their cellar as orderly as their living room . " A little thoughtfulness and care in arranging the cellar is well repaid through its labor saving and convenience . It would seem an axiomatic bit of advice to have the coal bin and the furnace door in some juxtaposition . Observation alone can convince you that this primary consideration is often overlooked in the general stress of things . It pays to pile up the kindling wood , to hang the garden tools on a row of nails , to have a row of shelves for the flower pots , for empty bottles , for potatoes , to have a carpenter 's bench with individual drawers for the separate supplies , and it pays to have a large laundry closet . It pays , not only in an economic sense , but also because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those things that contribute to your comfort and happiness . A " MODERN AMERICAN " COTTAGE Too many houses look socially ambitious . Of course , there is a healthy social ambition , a longing for the society of the best people and for the observance of the best customs that gives distinction to a home ; but a social ambition that is materialistic and comprehends only the abundance of material things that constitute riches , that is unmindful of the world of ideas , is not only unhealthy , but the very bane of all good architecture . An ugly house is a breaker of laws . What makes a front elevation like the one in the accompanying illustration interesting and full of quality , while another house with a sash window on either side of the door and a gable roof with a single dormer , might look plain and characterless ? There is at present a prevalent and eager national desire for beauty and , according to Ruskin , that is sure to produce good architecture . People are becoming more and more interested in the meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detail . Ralph Adams Cram , in a prefatory note to Picturesque Eng- lish Cottages and their Doorway Gardens , suggests that men were unexpectedly awakened to a new heaven and a new earth when the truths of old English cottage building came home to them . With the growing popularity of cement and concrete in house building , there is also a more widespread appreciation of the inevitable quality of the English cottage . Some people have called the house of the illustration an English cottage , but I should call it modern American ; for while cognizant of old English cottage building , it has not so much sought to perpetuate old forms as to satisfy new conditions in the light of the best traditions . The angle buttress is an interesting feature of the elevations . It not only gives a feeling of solidity to the base , but a line and shadow value to the elevations . Some houses are so interested in a window front that they do not give house corners a chance to come into their own . The flat arch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . The solid shutters have a freshness of design that immediately catches the eye . The texture quality of the roof is obtained by using 16-inch-long cedar shingles and spacing them 2 , 3 and 4 inches to weather , in varying courses with irregular lines . The shingle is turned down at the gable ends and the courses woven into each other . Even the bargeboard is individualistic , although it is only a. straight board , 14 inches wide , of stained cypress , with a sawed end and with brackets to support it . The bargehoard is , as you may know , the board hang from the edge of a gable roof where it projects beyond the gable wall , and simple as its function may seem , it can form an important part in the decorative treatment of a house . The bargeboard belongs to a rich past ? to the , gablecrowned towns of half-timbered Europe . It belongs to the traditions of honest carpentry . The house of the illustration has a decided color value . The stucco and the door and window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casings and the roof are stained brown . The leaders are an oxidized copper . The shutters and the box tree tubs are a dark , vivid green , and the walks and terrace are laid with a'trimly edged bright red brick . The outdoor living room or inclosed piazza has become an essential in our home building . The illustration shows an interesting example of how it can-be made an integral part of the house . Too often a piazza is a flat-roofed extension without any real relationship to the general design . In another and much larger house in its style , built by Mr John F. Capen , the architect , at Madison , N J , there are two side wings that form the inclosed piazza . They are one story high , with deep gable roofs to correspond to the lines of the main roof . Such solutions , however , need a broader tract of land than the average 50-foot suburban lot . Many houses think they owe their failings to the narrowness of their lot , but there is nothing finer in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ARISTOCRATIC ZINNIA , THE LOVELY PHLOX For ten days we had been shooting the rapids of the Delaware . We had been paddlers and tent dwellers , the kindred of the wild flowers and the starlight . In all those ten days we had felt like the elect , like nature 's aristocrats . Why was it that the first country house garden we encountered should dub us tramps ? I was actually overawed by the lavishness of a garden into which I strayed with my three-quart pail . There were wonderful massings of color . All was well planned and well thought out , but terrifyingly exclusive . The whole garden seemed an intellectual accomplishment to overawe my army flannel shirt and four-in-hand tie . No pompous butler announcing me at a formal reception has ever made me feel so defenseless . There was no one in sight . I intended to make my way to the kitchen door , but the kitchen side was so rich with zinnias that my hobnails instinctively made their way to the barn . I never thought that zinnias could drive me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not from any well-defined reason , but just from some vague notion . I had thought them common flowers and garish . It is not wise to be snobbish . How often we miss the lovely because of the barriers of our prejudices ! How often we cut ourselves adrift in our search for high company ! There were masses of deep red zinnias by the kitchen . Their stiff stems and trim flowers spoke worlds for the orderliness of household management . There was another mass of zinnias of salmon pink and canary yellow in another part of the garden . I should think that a border of rose color , violet and white would be appropriate to many an undecorated spot . There is a wee zinnia but a foot high with button-like scarlet flowers scarce an inch across . It makes a trim edging plant and is called Red Riding Hood . The curled and crested zinnias have a place where straightlaced neatness craves a touch of grace .  | Could a flower be more dramatically named with a bigger feeling for contrasts than the zinnia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did it happen that this composite genus of Mexican herbs was named after a German professor , Zinn , of Goettingen Uni-versity ? This garden came into being , as everything true comes into being , in the most natural way . The house was built near the woodsy bank in a treeless hay field far back from the road . It was the utilitarian desire to do away with the straggly line between the lawn and the hay field that brought these flower bor'ders into being and this flower love into a woman 's life . How often women put off the thought of bearty to some rich unknown future when all the while its possibilities abound on every hand in the straggly line of the hayfields ! My lady came from the city and did not even know the common virtues of perennial phlox when she started the first garden . Now she has two gardens full of bloom from early spring until hard frost . The day I saw them was the first of September . The phlox was still in lovely bloom . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know whether the rose phlox was a later variety , or whether it made an especial appeal to my rose color preferences . But I know that I came away from the phlox with many a new feeling . I had looked over phlox lists in plant catalogs , but it takes a phlox lover to win another heart to phlox . To make it realize , for instance , the vast joy in differentiation between a white phlox with carmine eye and a lavender pink and white . The white with the carmine eye is called Bouquet fleuria blooming bouquet ? and the lavender pink and white is called L'Esperancehope . There is a striped lilac-and-white kind called the Cross of Honor . The phlox border started at one end with white phlox with a red center and ended at the other with pure white . Between were masses of salmon color , of rose and pink , of scarlet , of lilac and lavender . To the lady , each kind was dearly beloved , of personal acquaintance . It was bought with thrills of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is work in a garden , but Mark Twain 's idea of heaven , you remember , is that it " is as blissful and lovely as it can be ; but it 's just the busiest place you ever heard of . " There was no rain for a long time along the Delaware last summer . The garden became very dry and had to be thoroughly watered . There were two garden hydrants for each garden , but no pressure . This year there is to be a new water supply with plenty of pressure from the hills five thousand feet away , but this summer after sundown everyone on the place was kept busy carrying tubs and cans to water the garden . Behind the phlox garden is a row of shrubs with something blooming from early until late . There is the Golden Bell , that blooms in April ; the Rose of Sharon , that has flowers in October ; and the Snowberry , that has large white berries clinging to it the greater pert el the winter . In front of the phlox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks after they are sown . They need but a slight protection to survive the winter and to bloom profusely the following spring . The Chinensis and Heddewigii pinks also come to bloom a few weeks after being sown and continue to bloom until hard frost . It is good to know of plants that will grow at such short notice . They can fill in bare spots and can make quick gardens . By the rose bushes in the second garden , there is a border a hundred feet long of blooming asters . They are the late-growing asters , in white , azure blue , shell pink , rose pink , deep rose , pale lavender and deep purple . These lategrowing asters are , above all others , the September flowers , the go-betweens of the phlox and the chrysanthemums . An annual garden all of asters would be a fascinating experiment . The Queen 's Flower in early July , the Ostrich Feathers and the Comets in August , and the Giants with the late flowering way into September . The aster garden for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow flowers for the decoration of the house . In another border , there were twenty kinds of dahlias from seeds and tubers . There were lovely orchid-like gladioli . With them were hyacinth beans , verbenas , mourning bride , bachelor buttons and tall French marigolds . Besides these French marigolds there are African varieties , such as the Orange Prince and the Lemon Queen . These two varieties , together with a dwarf variety , belong to the genus Tagetes and really come from South America and Mexico , while the  | Old World harden Marygold of Shakespeare 's time is the Calendula , named from the Roman calends . It was these Roman calends that finally reminded me of Jack in the waiting canoe . The sun was low and the moon would be late . The willows and the shore flowers were flitting shadows , while our camp firelight fell full upon a small mound of stones , a pre-pottery vase of September garden flowers , of orchid gladioli , pale asters and L'Esperance phlox , emblems of a lovely visit that came with me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of night . HEDGES For a long-stretched , green-shingle house set thirty feet back from the street , a barberry hedge would be appropriate and attractive . There is a freedom and unconventionality about a barberry hedge that puts it upon an intimate footing with a shingled house . The barberry hedge is graceful the year round . It does not grow as rapidly as some hedges , but if you give it plenty of sunshine it will soon be hedge enough . In the spring its flowers remind one of the huckleberry . In the fall the hedge is a wonderland of reds . And in the winter its berries are an abiding bit of warm color .
