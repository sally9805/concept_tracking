SCENE  --  A dark room , the library of a house in a fashionable New York suburb . In the rear , french windows looking out on the lawn and the driveway in front of the house . On the left , a doorway leading to the main hall . On the right , another doorway screened by heavy portieres . Bookcases around the walls . In the center of the room , a table with books , periodicals , and a reading lamp on it . The room is in darkness except for the light from the hallway . The portieres on the right are cautiously parted and Lucy enters . She stops and stands motionless for a moment or so in an attitude of strained attention , evidently listening for some sound from the hallway . Hearing nothing , she goes to the table and throws herself into a chair beside it . She rests her head on her outstretched arms and sobs softly . Making an effort to control herself , she dries her eyes hastily with her handkerchief , gets up , and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stands by the table for a minute staring straight before her , her expression betraying the somber thoughts which are passing through her brain . Then , with a quick movement of decision , she pulls out a drawer in the table and slowly takes a revolver from it . She looks at it with frightened eyes and puts it down on the table with a convulsive shudder . p. 3 There is the sound of a motor from the roadway outside . Lucy gives a nervous start and looks quickly around the room as if searching for a hiding place . She finally hurries back into the room on the right , pulling the portieres together behind her . The noise of the motor grows steadily louder . At last the machine stops in front of the main entrance of the house , and only the soft purr of the engine is heard . The glare from the headlamps pierces the darkness beyond the french windows . Someone is heard walking along the hallway to the front door . The outer door is heard opening . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid . Then the door is closed again . Tom 's voice is heard calling from the top of the hall stairs : " Is that the car ? " The maid 's voice answers : " Yes , sir . " , and she is heard returning to the rear of the house . Tom and Leonora are heard conversing as they come down the stairs in the hall . Leonora 's infectious laughter rings out . Tom appears in evening dress in the doorway , left , and looks toward the door at the right . He calls softly : " Lucy " ; then takes a step forward into the room . Leonora calls to him from the hall : " We 'll be late . " Tom makes a movement of impatience and raises his voice : " Lucy ! " BARNES ( from the hallway ) She 's probably out in the garden mooning with Gab . Come on ! Tom allows a muttered " damn " to escape him , and walks back into the hall . p. 4 The outer door is again opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes quickly to the table . The sound of the limousine door being slammed is heard . A wild look of determination comes into Lucy 's face and she snatches the revolver from the table . The noise of the motor increases in volume . The curtain starts to fall . The car outside starts . Closing her eyes tightly , Lucy lifts the revolver to her temple . The curtain hides her from view . As it touches the stage there is the sound of a shot. @x SCENE  --  The living room of the Ashleighs home in the neighborhood of Gramercy Park , New York City . It is a large , high-ceilinged room furnished in sober , old-fashioned good taste with here and there a quaint , half-humourously protesting modern touch . Dingy portraits of severely-sedate ancestors are hung on the walls . There are well-filled bookcases , sufficient in size and the number of volumes contained to denote a creditable amount of sound classic culture on the part of the occupants . In the center of the rear wall , a doorway leading to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows looking out on the street . At left , an open doorway hidden by heavy portieres . The time is the present . It is about eight-thirty of a warm June evening . Mr. and Mrs. Ashleigh are discovered sitting by the ponderous oak table in the center of the room . Mrs. Ashleigh is a handsome , white-haired woman of fifty , calm , unruffled , with a charmingly-girlish smile and dark eyes dancing with a keen sense of humour . Ashleigh is sixty and rather bald . He is tall and portly , and suggests by his clothes and demeanor the retired banker whose life has been uneventful and prosperous . Inefficiently pompous , he becomes easily aroused to nervous irritability when his own respectable dogmas are questioned . ASHLEIGH ( rustling the evening paper he is pretending to read  --  irritably ) This has simply got to stop ! ( He turns to his wife . ) I wo n't put up with it any longer . p. 6 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( looking up from the book she is reading  --  quietly ) Wo n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insane faddism . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) So its Lucy again . ASHLEIGH Yes , its Lucy again ! ( indignantly ) You simply wo n't realize how serious the situation is . Why her conduct for the past year since she left college has been  --  there is no other word for it  --  absolutely indecent ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( calmly ) Do n't take it so seriously . Its just her youth  --  effervescence of an active mind striving to find itself , needing an outlet somewhere . ASHLEIGH ( obstinately ) But a healthy outlet  --  not a lot of half-baked theories . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( teasingly ) Lucy 's new theories are very interesting . ( Ashleigh looks shocked at this remark . Mrs. Ashleigh laughs at him . ) No , you need n't be alarmed . I 'm not catching the fever . Our daughter has hopelessly outdistanced me , and you are far behind . She is tomorrow , I am today , and you , my dear Dick , are yesterday . ( She leans across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about Lucy . I understand her better than you do , and she 's just her mother over again . ( a trace of sadness creeping into her tones ) Besides , you wo n't have her at home to plague you into tempers  --  after tomorrow . p. 7 ASHLEIGH ( slowly ) Tomorrow . Our little Lucy married tomorrow ! It does n't seem possible . Why it seems only yesterday she was running around in short skirts , singing at the top of her lungs and raising the devil generally . ( with a smile ) She 's always had a will of her own , that little lady . ( after a pause  --  slowly ) Its going to be lonely here at home without her . MRS . ASHLEIGH We must try to accept it philosophically . Its simply the law of nature  --  when the little birds learn to fly , they fly away . ASHLEIGH Its a cruel law . MRS . ASHLEIGH No , its a just law . Lucy would stagnate here . Our desire to keep her is selfish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accumulate her little store of memories just as you and I have done , just as her children will do after her . ( Ashleigh sighs . ) And I think we ought to be as cheerful as two about-to-be-bereaved parents can be under the circumstances . Lucy is fortunate in her choice . Tom Drayton is a rare type  --  me clean , wholesome young American . ASHLEIGH Yes , Tom 's a fine fellow , right enough ; a splendid young chap with plenty of go to him . That 's why I ca n't understand why he does n't put a stop to all this foolishness of her 's . Its ridiculous to see a man of his stamp play the meek little lamb . Why the way she twists him around her finger is  --  is disgusting . p. 8 ASHLEIGH Perhaps Tom has seen enough of our family life to hope that the meek lamb will succeed where the  --  ( she smiles over at him ) roaring lion has failed . ASHLEIGH Well , even you 'll admit I 've good cause to roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . ASHLEIGH ( smiling ) What was it this time ? Did she buy another Futurist painting and bring it home to show you ? ASHLEIGH No . MRS . ASHLEIGH Has she written another five-act tragedy in free verse ? ASHLEIGH No . MRS . ASHLEIGH Has she bought another Greenwich eucalalie which she ca n't play ? ASHLEIGH No ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Did she bring home a tramp poet to live in our garret ? ASHLEIGH No ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Not even a long-haired sculptor smelling of absinthe ? ASHLEIGH ( exasperated ) No , no , no , I tell you ! MRS . ASHLEIGH This must have been one of Lucy 's idle days . ( her eyes dancing with merriment ) Has she gone in for psycho-analysis again ? p. 9 ASHLEIGH No . MRS . ASHLEIGH Do n't tell me she has disinterred another Yogi mystic in a cerise turban ! ASHLEIGH ( huffed ) If you 'll stop questioning me for a moment , my dear , I might be able to enlighten you . ( Mrs. A. puts her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said she and Tom were going to the theatre ? MRS . ASHLEIGH I thought she merely said they were going out . ASHLEIGH ( crossly ) Well , anyway , I thought she must be going to the theatre . Where else do normal people go when they do n't stay at home ? ( Receiving no answer , he continues with impressive slowness ) Do  --  you  --  know where she  --  did go ? MRS . ASHLEIGH No ; not to  --  ? Oh , I forgot . I must n't guess . Well , then , where  --  did  --  she  --  go ? ASHLEIGH To an Anarchist lecture ! MRS . ASHLEIGH And dragged Tom along with her ? ASHLEIGH Yes ; the idiot ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Did Tom tell you ? ASHLEIGH No . Lucy cooly informed me that I ought to go and hear it . p. 10 MRS . ASHLEIGH Well , I ca n't see the enormity of her going . ASHLEIGH I tell you the woman who gave the lecture was an Anarchist . Most of the audience were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes . ASHLEIGH ( astonished ) What ? Did Lucy tell  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH No . She 's been too busy talking trousseau to me . I meant to say I can guess what the lecture was about . ASHLEIGH What ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Birth control , of course . Everyone is lecturing on that subject now , judging from the papers . Its quite the rage . ASHLEIGH And you do n't think its infamous ? MRS . ASHLEIGH On the contrary I 'm enough of a radical myself on that question to quite approve of it . ASHLEIGH Well , I 'll be  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH Damned ! There , I said it for you . ( Then as he rises from his chair and gets ready to crush her with the weight of his eloquence , she shakes her finger at him . ) Now Dick ! Now Dick ! Every time you 've read the words " birth control " in the newspapers you 've condemned them at length and in detail , and I 've listened with wifely patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So I know all you 're going to say beforehand . So do n't say it . ( as he is going to speak ) Do n't say it ! ( She laughingly puts a finger over his lips. ) p. 11 ASHLEIGH ( mollified  --  with a sigh ) All right , I wo n't ; but  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH ( kissing him ) That 's a dear . ( A ring of the bell is heard . ) There 's the bell . I wonder who it can be . ( A moment later the maid appears at the door . ) A MAID AT THE ASHLEIGH 'S Its Miss . Barnes , m'am . She has a picture for Miss . Lucy , she says , m'am . ASHLEIGH ( with a groan ) Another painting ! Good heavens ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( to the maid ) Show her in here , please . ( The maid goes out . ) Now , Dick , you run up and make your peace with Lucy . You know you 'll have it on your conscience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He goes toward the door on left . ) And do n't loose your temper again . ASHLEIGH I wo n't . ( He goes out . Leonora Barnes enters from the doorway in rear . She is a tiny bit of a person , rather pretty , but pale and aenemic looking with great dark circles in under her bright , restless eyes . She is dressed in a pink painter 's smock , dark skirt , and wears sandals on her bare feet . Immediately on entering she throws aside her queer hat revealing thick blond hair bobbed in a Dutch clip. ) p. 12 BARNES ( breezily ) Hello . ( She stands the small canvas she is carrying against the wall near the door . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( shaking hands with her ) How do you do , Leonora . BARNES ( flitting nervously about the room with quick , bird-like movements ) Oh , I 'm fair . Terribly bored with everything , though . ( She squints scornfully at the portraits . ) Now I ask you , are n't those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are they ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Only a few ancestors . BARNES Oh . ( Then she says to herself , not realizing she is talking out loud ) Philistines ! Chinese ancestor worship ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( amused ) Wo n't you sit down ? BARNES ( throwing herself into an easy chair ) Thanks . ( She takes a bag of tobacco and cigarette papers from the pocket of her smock and starts to roll a cigarette  --  then stops and looks questioningly at Mrs. Ashleigh . ) Oh , I forgot where I was . You do n't mind ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Not at all . p. 13 BARNES ( finishes rolling her cigarette , takes a long ivory cigarette holder from her pocket , and fixes the cigarette in it ) I did n't think you would , being Lucy 's mother , but you never can tell . Most of the older generation do object , you know . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) Yes , we 're dreadfully behind the times , I 'm afraid . BARNES ( flitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its hard to live out of one 's period , I dare say . ( musingly ) I suppose even I 'll be respectable when I 'm too old to be anything else . ( throwing herself back in the chair ) Where 's Lucy ? MRS . ASHLEIGH She 's resting . You know tomorrow  --  BARNES ( exhaling a cloud of smoke ) Oh yes , the marriage ! Do n't blame her for resting up . Frightful ordeal  --  I imagine . Too bad . Lucy has talent and temperament . What does she want to marry for ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( gently ) Perhaps because she is in love . BARNES ( airily ) Mid-Victorian sentimentality ! Love is no excuse . Marriage is for propagation , and artists should n't propagate . Takes up too much of their time . p. 14 MRS . ASHLEIGH But artists fall in love the same as ordinary people  --  so I 've heard . BARNES Oh , love , of course ; but free love ! I 'd argue with you about it only I 'm not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm only interested in it superficially . Art takes up all my time . ( her eyes falling on the canvas she brought in ) Oh , I was forgetting . ( She jumps up and goes over to it . ) Here 's something of mine I brought for Lucy . ( making a wry face ) You may call it a wedding present , if you like . Lucy admired it when she was up at the studio and I thought she might like to have it . MRS . ASHLEIGH That 's very sweet of you , my dear . I know Lucy will be delighted . May I see it ? BARNES ( bringing over the canvas ) It 's good , I think . It expresses something of what I tried to put into it . ( She holds the painting on the table in front of Mrs. Ashleigh . The audience can see Mrs. Ashleigh 's face but not the painting . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( trying to conceal the look of blank amazement on her face ) Er  --  what wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather fine . Everyone agrees on that . Its much more effective in daylight , though . p. 15 MRS . ASHLEIGH Has it  --  er  --  any title ? BARNES I call it the Great Blond Beast  --  you know , Nietzsche . ( raptly ) It is the expression of my passion to create something or someone great and noble  --  the Superman or the work of great art . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with perfect courtesy ) Hm  --  yes  --  I can feel that in it . BARNES ( delighted ) Oh , can you ? How wonderful ! I knew you could n't be as Mid-Victorian as your environment . ( She indicates the room with a disdainful gesture . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( smiling ) I 'm afraid I am . BARNES ( enthusiastically ) Nonsense ! You 're not at all . You 're one of us . ( She throws her arms around Mrs. Ashleigh and kisses her . ) You 're an old dear . ( suddenly standing off and regarding Mrs. Ashleigh critically ) Why do n't you dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( without waiting for an answer ) I 'll put this out of the way . ( She stands the canvas against the wall near the window . As she is doing this , Tom Drayton enters . He is a tall , blond , finely-built man of about thirty with large , handsome features. ) p. 16 MRS . ASHLEIGH Hello , Tom . DRAYTON Hello , mother . ( He comes over and kisses her . ) BARNES ( waving her hand to him from the window ) Hello-hello ! ( as he turns to her with a puzzled expression ) I 've met you . You need n't be shocked . You came to my studio with Lucy . Remember ? DRAYTON Oh , yes , of course ; I remember now . How do you do , Miss .  --  er  --  BARNES Never mind the Miss . Call me Leo . They all do . ( She comes forward and shakes his hand . ) Are you interested in any form of art ? What are you  --  I mean what do you do ? DRAYTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BARNES ( disdainfully ) Hmm ! ( suddenly ) You see you attract me physically . ( Tom is stunned . Mrs. Ashleigh smiles at his confusion . ) DRAYTON ( at last ) Oh , yes , I see . You 're a painter , are n't you ? BARNES I do n't mean I want you for a model . I mean you have all the outward appearance of my ideal of what the Great Blond Beast should look like . ( scrutinizing him closely ) Ever read Nietzsche ? No , business men do n't , do they ? They go to the Follies. ( measuring him with a searching glance ) Maybe there is something more to you than you realize yourself . ( decisively ) Some day I 'm going to find out . ( She carelessly tosses the butt of her cigarette on the rug and stamps on it , much to Mrs. Ashleigh 's consternation . ) I 'll have to be getting along . ( puts on her hat ) You two must have no end of details to fuss over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely coming to the wedding ? BARNES No , I think not . Too much stir over nothing . Tell Lucy I 'll see her when she gets back . And tell her I think she 's a fool to marry . And do n't forget the painting . Ta-ta ! ( She runs out the doorway in the rear . ) DRAYTON ( smiling ) A breezy sprite , is n't she ? Where 's Lucy ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Upstairs  --  resting , I hope . I 'll send for her in a moment . But now , sit down ( pointing to the chair opposite her ) for I have something ( she smiles ) very serious to say to you ! DRAYTON You may fire when you are ready . MRS . ASHLEIGH I ask permission to play the mother-in-law before the fact , promising in return to forever hold my peace after the ceremony . DRAYTON ( affectionately ) Oh come now , you must n't say that . Your advice will always be invaluable . It would be downright unkind of you to keep any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extremis you may call on me . Now for what I was going to say to you . You 've known Lucy now for two years and yet I 'm afraid you may not know her at all . p. 18 DRAYTON I think I understand her . MRS . ASHLEIGH Let me ask you a question then . How do you accept her wild ideas about society and the world in general ? DRAYTON I attribute them to youth and inexperience and an active mind and body . They are part of Lucy  --  and I love Lucy . MRS . ASHLEIGH And their startling manifestations do n't annoy you ? DRAYTON Annoy ? Good heavens , no. ( smiling ) But the outbreaks are a trifle disconcerting at times , I must confess . MRS . ASHLEIGH That means you do n't take them seriously . ( thoughtfully ) That 's where you 're both right and very wrong . ( Tom looks at her with a puzzled expression . ) Right in believing that beneath the high-strung girl of flighty impulses there exists the woman whose sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her present extravagant poses . ( warningly ) But you must not expect a drastic change immediately . Lucy has been our spoiled child all her life and is used to having her whims respected . DRAYTON Oh , I know that a period of transition  --  ( boyishly ) Besides , hang it all , her poses are adorable . I do n't want her ever to lose them  --  all of them , at least . p. 19 MRS . ASHLEIGH You may love them for a time , but they 're hard to live with  --  even after one has become inured . DRAYTON ( smiling ) Perhaps I 've become acclimated already . ( Mrs. A. shakes her head doubtfully . ) But you said a moment ago I was also very wrong in my attitude . How ? MRS . ASHLEIGH In not pretending to take Lucy seriously . That 's the most important thing of all . DRAYTON But I do pretend . MRS . ASHLEIGH Not very successfully . I 've been observing you . DRAYTON ( protestingly ) But have n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible poems , met millions of impossible lunatics of every variety ? Have n't I done all this gladly , nay , even enthusiastically ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes , you 've done all of that , I must acknowledge ; but , seriously , Tom , do n't you know that your attitude has been that of kindly tolerance  --  the kindly tolerance of an elder brother toward an irresponsible child ? DRAYTON But Lucy is a child in such things . MRS . ASHLEIGH A child feels lack of sympathy with its dreams more keenly than anything else . p. 20 DRAYTON But everyone around her , her father , even you  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH We 've all been wrong and its too late for us to change . You 're just beginning and you must profit by our mistakes . That 's why I wanted this talk with you  --  because the most vital thing left to me in life is that you and Lucy should be happy together . DRAYTON ( gratefully ) I know that , Mrs. Ashleigh , and I 'll do whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirit of Lucy 's rainbow chasing , and show her you feel it . Its the old , ever young , wild spirit of youth which tramples rudely on the grave-mound of the Past to see more clearly to the future dream . We are all thrilled by it sometime , in someway or another . In most of us it flickers out , more 's the pity . In some of us it becomes tempered to a fine , sane , progressive ideal which is of infinite help to the race . I think Lucy will develope into one of those rare ones . DRAYTON ( impulsively ) I 'm sure of it . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( warningly ) If she is not goaded into wilder and wilder revolts by the lack of sympathetic understanding in those around her . ( seeing Tom 's troubled frown ) Do n't be alarmed , though . Lucy looks on you as a promising neophyte . That 's one reason why she 's marrying you . p. 21 DRAYTON To convert me ? All right then , I 'm converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( approvingly ) That 's the spirit ! See that you stay converted . Agree with her . Encourage her . Be earnest with her , and  --  ( she smiles ) trust to your wife 's dormant sense of humour to eventually end your agony . You wo n't have long to suffer . Lucy has advanced to the ridiculous stage even now . Its only a step to the return to reason . Now I 'm through lecturing and you may breathe easier . I 'll send for Lucy . Will you ring for the maid ? ( Tom goes over and pushes the button . ) Do smoke . You look so unoccupied . DRAYTON ( laughing ) Thank you . ( He lights a cigarette . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( as the maid comes in ) Annie , will you tell Lucy that Mr. Drayton is here ? A MAID AT THE ASHLEIGH 'S Yes , m'am . ( She goes out . ) DRAYTON ( wandering around the room , stops on seeing the canvas against the wall ) Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes . Bring it over to the light . You 'll enjoy it . Its a wedding present for Lucy . ( Tom brings it to the table and holds it in the light . It is an orgy of color 's done in the wildest Synchromist manner . Tom looks at it with an expression of amused contempt . Mrs. Ashleigh watches his face with a smile . Ashleigh enters from the left . He appears wildly excited , and his face is red with indignant rage. ) p. 22 ASHLEIGH What do you suppose  --  ? ( He sees Tom and comes and shakes hands with him warmly . ) Hello , Tom . Its lucky you 're here to put a stop to  --  ( He turns to his wife . ) Mary , what do you suppose  --  ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Ssshh ! Do n't interrupt our mood . Come and look at this work of art . Its a wedding present for Lucy . ( He comes and stands beside Tom and looks at it blankly . ) ASHLEIGH What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ASHLEIGH That little Miss . Barnes ; you know ; you met her the other day with Lucy . ASHLEIGH ( growling ) Oh , that short-haired lunatic ! I might have guessed it . ( indignantly ) Does she call that a picture of something ? What tommyrot ! Its blithering idiocy , eh , Tom ? DRAYTON I ca n't even get mad at them any more . I 've been to too many exhibitions . I 'm hardened . ASHLEIGH ( disgutedly ) What 's it supposed to be , I 'd like to know ? ( He peers at it sideways . ) You must have it upside down . ( Mrs. Ashleigh turns it around . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( oratorically ) Approach it with an open mind and soul freed from all conventional prejudices and categorical judgements , and tell me what emotion it arouses in you , what feeling you get from it . p. 23 ASHLEIGH You 're beginning to talk as absurdly as the craziest of them . I 'll be going mad myself the next thing . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think it is , just for curiousity . ASHLEIGH Tommyrot ! Tommyrot ! That 's what I know it is . MRS . ASHLEIGH And you , Tom ? DRAYTON I ca n't make out whether its the Aurora Borealis or an explosion in a powder mill . ( Ashleigh laughs . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( impressively ) You are both wrong . It is the longing of the soul for the Great Blond Beast . ASHLEIGH Great Blond Rot ! ( to Tom ) Never mind that thing . Listen to me for a moment . Mary , do you know what Lucy was doing when I went up to her room ( sarcastically ) where you thought she was resting . MRS . ASHLEIGH Reading , I suppose . ASHLEIGH Yes ; reading some trashy novel by some damn Russian ; and she insisted on reading it out loud to me  --  a lot of nonsense condemning marriage  --  on the night before her wedding . ( He appeals to the ceiling . ) Trying to convert me to free love  --  at my age ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all and  --  p. 24 DRAYTON ( appalled ) What ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Remember what you promised me , Tom . ( He immediately smiles and becomes composed again . ) ASHLEIGH Yes , that 's what she said . ( Lucy appears in the doorway on left . ) Here she is now . ( with grim satisfaction as he sits down in a chair ) Now you can listen to her for a while ! ( Lucy comes slowly into the room . She is slender , dark , beautiful , with large eyes which she attempts to keep always mysterious and brooding , smiling lips which she resolutely compresses to express melancholy determination , a healthy complexion subdued by powder to a proper prison pallor , a vigorous , lithe body which frets restlessly beneath the restriction of studied , artificial movements . In short , Lucy is an intelligent , healthy American girl suffering from an overdose of undigested reading , and has mistaken herself for the heroine of a Russian novel . She is dressed in a dark , somber kimona , and Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She comes to the center of the room and gives him her hand with a drooping gesture . Tom stares at her in embarrassment . Lucy glides into a chair near her mother , rests her chin on her hand , and gazes into the immensities . There is a long silence. ) p. 25 ASHLEIGH ( drums on the arm of his chair in extreme irritation ) Well ? ( then as Lucy gives no sign of having heard him , in a louder tone ) Well ? LUCY ( coming out of her dream  --  slowly ) I beg your pardon . I 'm afraid I interrupted you . You must keep on talking as if I were not here . I 'm so distrait this evening . There is so much turmoil in my soul . ( appealing to them with a sad smile ) Strindberg 's daughter of Indra discovered the truth . Life is horrible , is it not ? ASHLEIGH ( fuming ) Bosh ! Bosh ! You know very well what we were discussing , Miss. , and you 're trying to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discussing the meaning of this painting Leonora brought for you . LUCY ( abandoning her pose for an unguarded moment  --  with real , girlish pleasure ) A painting ? From Leo ? How charming of her ! ( She goes quickly to the table and looks at the painting . While she is doing so she remembers herself and resumes her pose . ) DRAYTON ( feeling bound to say something ) Beautiful , is n't it ? p. 26 ASHLEIGH ( looking at Tom scornfully ) Beautiful ! Why you just said  --  ( Mrs. Ashleigh makes violent signs to him to be silent . He grunts disgustedly . ) LUCY ( holding the painting at arm 's length and examining it critically ) Beautiful ? Yes , perhaps as a photograph is beautiful . The technique is perfect , but  --  is that the meaning of Art ? ( She lays the canvas down with an expression of mild disdain and resumes her chair . ) I am somewhat disappointed in Leonora . She seems to have little to express after all . ASHLEIGH ( with satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ) She is too old-fashioned . Her methods are those of yesterday . ASHLEIGH What ? LUCY ( not noticing his interruption ) I once thought she would soar to the heights but I see now it is hopeless . The wings of her soul are weighed down by the dust of too many dead yesterdays . ASHLEIGH I do n't know what you 're talking about but I 'm glad to learn you 've sense enough to know that thing is tommyrot . ( He points scornfully at the canvas. ) p. 27 LUCY ( with real indignation ) I never said such a thing . As usual you misunderstand me . I think its fine and I deeply appreciate her giving it to me . ASHLEIGH ( sarcastically ) Then maybe you can tell us what it represents ? ( He winks at Tom who pretends not to see him and wears a face of deadly seriousness . ) LUCY ( glances doubtfully at the painting  --  then lightly ) What would be the use ? You would only misinterpret what I said . Besides , Art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as Ashleigh is about to answer ) It was very thoughtful of her to give Lucy a wedding present . She does n't look any too prosperous , poor child , and it must have taken up a lot of her time . LUCY ( slowly ) Wedding present ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes . She said you might regard it as such . LUCY ( after a pause  --  turning to her father accusingly ) Then you have n't told them ? ASHLEIGH I have n't had a chance ; and , anyway , I refuse to believe that rubbish you were telling me. p. 28 MRS . ASHLEIGH What rubbish ? ASHLEIGH ( indicating Lucy who is gazing moodily into space ) I will leave it to our lady anarchist to explain . LUCY ( slowly  --  after a pause ) There will be no wedding . ASHLEIGH ( looking at the others with an I-told-you-so air of satisfaction ) There ! Now you know ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with the utmost calm ) You mean you want it postponed ? LUCY ( firmly ) I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirms in his chair and seems about to protest but catches Mrs. Ashleigh 's meaning glance and stops abruptly . Lucy revels in the impression she knows she has made . Wearing her best Russian heroine pose she comes slowly over to Tom 's chair and takes his hand . ) I am sorry , Tom . I would not hurt you for anything in the world , but this  --  must be ! My highest duty is toward myself , and my ego demands freedom , wide horizons to develope in , ( she makes a sweeping gesture ) Castles in the air , not homes for human beings ! ( tenderly ) You understand , do n't you Tom ? DRAYTON ( with an effort  --  matter-of-factedly ) Yes , Lucy , I understand . p. 29 ASHLEIGH What 's that ? LUCY ( a trace of disappointment in her manner in spite of herself ) You mean you will give up the idea of our marriage , tomorrow or at any future time ? DRAYTON Since it 's your wish , yes , Lucy . LUCY ( showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . ) I knew you would understand . ( She goes back and sits down . This time her eyes are full of a real emotion as she stares before her . ) ASHLEIGH ( to Tom  --  angrily ) So ! Its your turn to play the damn fool , is it ? I thought you had some sense . ( He snatches a paper from the table and pretends to read . ) DRAYTON I love Lucy . I 'll do whatever she thinks necessary to her happiness . ASHLEIGH Humph ! She does n't know what she thinks . LUCY ( agonizingly ) Oh , I 've thought and thought and thought until my brain seemed bursting . I 've lain awake in the still , long hours and struggled with myself . I 've fought against it . I 've tried to force myself to submit  --  for Tom 's sake . But I can not . I can not play the hypocrite to the extent of binding myself by a pact which means nothing to me . It would be the meanest form of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most despicable of all the laws of society . ( Ashleigh rustles his paper angrily  --  Lucy continues scornfully ) What is it Nietzsche says of marriage ? " Ah , the poverty of soul in the twain ! Ah , the filth of soul in the twain ! Ah , the pitiable self-complacency in the twain ! " p. 30 ASHLEIGH ( enraged ) There ! That 's the stuff she was reading to me . Look here , young lady ! Do n't you know that all the invitations are sent out and everything is arranged ? Do you want to make all this infernal mess at the last moment ? Think what people will say . LUCY ( scornfully ) As if I cared for the opinion of the mob  --  the much-too-many ! ASHLEIGH They 're not mob . They 're my friends ! LUCY Stupid bourgeois ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( hastily  --  forseeing a row ) I can quite sympathize with your objections to marriage as an institution , Lucy ,  --  ASHLEIGH ( bursting out ) Mary ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Even if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to be treated like dumb beasts with no souls of their own . LUCY ( surprised but triumphant ) Thank you , mother . MRS . ASHLEIGH When we have the right to make our own laws we ought to abolish marriage the first thing . ( violently ) Its an outrage against decency , that 's what it is. ( catching Lucy 's look of amazement ) I see you 're surprised , Lucy , but you should n't be . I know more of the evils of marriage than you do . You 've escaped it so far , but you must remember I 've been in the toils for over twenty years . p. 31 LUCY ( a bit shocked in spite of herself ) Why , mother  --  I never  --  ( She hesitates , at a loss to account for her mother 's outburst . ) ASHLEIGH Well , I 'll be damned ! ( He burries his nose in the paper , choking with suppressed rage . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a great sigh  --  hopelessly ) But in the present we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of ourselves . You love Tom , do n't you , Lucy ? LUCY I do . MRS . ASHLEIGH And Tom loves you . Then , notwithstanding , the fact that your decision is just , it is bound to make both of you unhappy . LUCY ( resolutely ) No , not if Tom agrees to the plan I have in mind . ALL ( astonished ) Plan ? LUCY ( going over to Tom ) You are sure you love me , Tom ? DRAYTON How can you ask , Lucy ! LUCY And you will dare anything that we may be together ? DRAYTON Anything ! LUCY ( fervidly ) Then why this useless formality of marriage ? Let us go forth into the world together , not shackled for better or for worse , but as free spirits , comrades who have no other claims upon each other than what our hearts dictate . ( All are overwhelmed . Even Mrs. Ashleigh is evidently taken off her feet for a moment . Lucy looks from one to the other to enjoy the effect she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change one of our plans . Let the marriage only be omitted and I will go with you . p. 32 ASHLEIGH ( turning to his wife ) The girl 's out of her head ! LUCY I was never saner in my life than at this moment . ASHLEIGH ( exasperated beyond endurance ) But do n't you see , ca n't you understand that what you 're proposing is nothing more or less than  --  than  --  than free love ! LUCY Yes , free ! free ! free love ! ASHLEIGH Have you no shame ? LUCY ( grandly ) None where my liberty is concerned . ASHLEIGH ( furiously  --  to Tom ) And you  --  why do n't you say something and put a stop to this disgusting nonsense ? DRAYTON I must  --  Give me time . I  --  I want to think it over . ASHLEIGH ( indignantly ) Think it over ! ( Lucy turns away from Tom who looks questioningly at Mrs. Ashleigh . She nods at him approvingly . ) LUCY ( seeming to be reassured after the moment 's suspense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me in free comradeship , afraid of what people will say , afraid of your conventional conscience . Well , perhaps you are right from your light , but  --  p. 33 DRAYTON One moment , Lucy . I did n't say I refused . On the contrary , I see your way is the one way out for both of us . ( He stands up and takes Lucy 's hand . She seems bewildered by his acceptance . ) ASHLEIGH ( white with rage ) So you  --  a gentleman  --  encourage this infamous proposal ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( calmly ) Be reasonable , Dick . It seems the only thing they can do . ASHLEIGH ( wildly ) I wo n't listen to you any longer . This is all a filthy joke or  --  or  --  my God , you 're all insane ! ( He rushes out of the door in rear . ) LUCY ( to Tom  --  evidently trying to dissvade him ) I want you to think deeply over your decision . It probably involves greater sacrifice for you than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and start again together , or else , remain  --  DRAYTON ( quickly ) Yes , it will be braver to remain . LUCY Then you 'll have to face the stupid sneers and snubs of all your associates . It will be hard . You 're not accustomed  --  DRAYTON Its all right . I 'll manage somehow . p. 34 MRS . ASHLEIGH Lucy , how can you ask such a sacrifice of Tom  --  if you really love him as you say ? LUCY ( sees a way out and eagerly clutches at this straw . She stands for a moment as if a tremendous mental conflict were taking place within her , then turns to Tom sadly . ) No , Tom , mother is right . I can not be so selfish . I can not tear your life to pieces . No , you are free . Time heals everything  --  you will forget . DRAYTON ( putting his arm around her ) No , Lucy , I could never forget . ( firmly ) So tomorrow we 'll start life together as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness ) No  --  for your sake  --  I can not . MRS . ASHLEIGH Why not sacrifice yourself , Lucy ? You might marry Tom as you intended to do . ( with a pretence of annoyance ) Where is your sense of humour , you two ? Why all this seriousness ? Good heavens , the marriage ceremony is merely a formula which you can take with as many grains of salt as you please . You need n't live up to it in any way . Few people do . You can have your own private understanding  --  and divorce is easy enough . LUCY ( feeling bound to protest ) But , mother , that would be hypocritical  --  ignoble ! p. 35 MRS . ASHLEIGH Ignoble , fudge ! Hypocritical , rats ! Be sensible ! What is the use of butting your heads against a stone wall ? You have work to do in this world and you ca n't afford to leave yourselves open to the malicious badgering and interference of all the moral busy-bodies if you expect to accomplish your purpose in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love if it could be free . I object to it because its less free than marriage . LUCY ( tragically ) There must be martyrs for every step of progress . MRS . ASHLEIGH Martyrs are people with no imaginations . No ; make your marriage a model of all that 's best in free love , if you must set an example . True progress lies along those lines . LUCY ( vaguely ) But  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH But nothing . You agree with me , do n't you , Tom ? DRAYTON Perfectly . I never intended to regard our marriage in any other way . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( hustling Lucy ) Then make out your own wedding contract and sign it yourselves without the sanction of church or state or anything . You 're willing that Lucy should draw up the terms of your mutual agreement , are n't you , Tom ? She 's the chief objector. p. 36 DRAYTON I repeat again for the hundredth time  --  anything Lucy wishes I will agree to . LUCY ( embarrassed ) I believe I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Tom  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH Have you it with you ? No ? Then run and get it . I 'll keep Tom company while you 're gone . ( Lucy hesitates a moment ; then goes out left . After she has gone Tom comes over to Mrs. Ashleigh and takes her hand . They both commence to laugh . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH There ! I 've given you the best example of how to manage Lucy . See that you profit by it . DRAYTON I wo n't forget , I promise you . Do you think I 'm learning to be a better actor ? MRS . ASHLEIGH My dear boy , you were splendid . Poor Lucy ! She was frightened to death when you decided to accept her in unshackled free love . DRAYTON ( with a laugh ) But where did you learn all this radical rigamarole ? You had me fooled at times . I did n't know whether you were serious or not . MRS . ASHLEIGH Oh , Lucy has sown me with tracts on the sex problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DRAYTON ( with a comic groan ) I can imagine the terms of this agreement Lucy has written out . p. 37 MRS . ASHLEIGH Pooh ! Keep up your courage , agree to anything , be married tomorrow , and live happy ever after . Its simple enough . ( Lucy enters from the left with the paper in her hand . She has regained her composure and wears a serious , purposeful expression . She lays the paper on the table . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( getting up ) And now I 'll leave you to yourselves . Your poor father must have torn out his few remaining hairs by this time . I 'll go and reassure him . ( She goes out , rear . Tom sits down at the table . ) LUCY ( standing by him  --  impressively ) I wrote this out last night . It is my idea of what the ideal relationship between a free man and woman should be . Of course , its tentative , and you can suggest any changes you think proper . One thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no children by our union . ( directing a searching look at Tom ) I know you 're far too intelligent not to believe in birth control . DRAYTON Er  --  for the very poor I consider it desirable . LUCY We of the well-to-do class must devote all our time to caring for the children of the poor instead of pampering our own . To do this effectively and unselfishly we must remain childless . The little proletarians will take the place of our own flesh and blood . ( seeing the badly-concealed look of disapproval on Tom 's face ) Do n't think I wish to shirk the burden of motherhood . You know how I love children . p. 38 DRAYTON ( hastly ) Of course . I understand , Lucy . LUCY And you agree to the provision ? DRAYTON I do . LUCY Then read the whole contract and tell me what you think . DRAYTON ( reading ) Our union is to be one of mutual help and individual freedom . Agreed . Under no conditions shall I ever question any act of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way . Agreed . I will love you as long as my heart dictates , and not one second longer . Agreed . I will honor you only in so far as you prove yourself worthy of it in my eyes . Agreed . I will not obey you . ( with a smile ) According to the old formula it is n't necessary for me to promise that , Lucy . LUCY The slips are identical . I made a carbon copy of mine to save time . Here . ( She takes his slip from him . ) You can scratch out what does n't apply to you . ( She takes a pencil and scratches out the sentence and hands the slip back to him . ) DRAYTON ( reading ) For sociological reasons I shall have no children . That hardly applies to me either . ( He takes the pencil from her and scratches it out . ) In our economic relations we shall be strictly independent of each other . Hmm . Agreed . I may have lovers without causing jealousy or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovers ? Hmm , that must be your part , too . ( He pauses and sits looking down at the paper with a frown. ) p. 39 LUCY But you agree that I may , do n't you ? ( as Tom still hesitates  --  with sudden indignation ) Why , you seem to suspect I desire to have them ! DRAYTON ( hastily ) Indeed I do n't ! I was only thinking  --  LUCY Its only a clause to show you I am free . DRAYTON I know , Lucy , I know ; and I agree . ( He marks off the clause on his sheet and continues his reading . ) Under the above conditions I will live with you in the true comradship of a free man and woman . Agreed , emphatically ! ( He looks up at her . ) And now , what ? LUCY We exchange slips after we 've both signed our names to them . ( They write down their names and pass over each other 's slips . ) DRAYTON And now , what ? LUCY ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jumps to his feet and takes her in his arms and kisses her . ) LUCY And now run along home like a dear . I 'm so worn out . I 'm going upstairs . DRAYTON ( anxiously ) I would n't sit up any more tonight reading the books . It  --  er  --  it might hurt your eyes . ( He goes toward door in rear ) p. 40 LUCY ( yawning ) I promise . I 'm too sleepy . DRAYTON ( turning at the door  --  uncertainly ) You 'll be sure to be at the church , dear ? LUCY ( resuming her pose as if by magic at the word " church " ) I will be there , but  --  ( she looks at him questioningly ) its absolutely meaningless , remember ! DRAYTON ( moving back toward her ) Oh , absolutely ! LUCY And a terrible bore , is n't it ? DRAYTON ( very near her again ) Terrible ! ( He catches her in his arms and kisses her . ) Good-night . ( He runs out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after him with a smile ) @x SCENE  --  The library of the Drayton 's home in a fashionable New York suburb . The room is light and airy , furnished unpretentiously but in perfect taste . The only jarring note is supplied by two incredible paintings in the Synchromist manner which are hung in conspicuous places , and not to be ignored . In the rear , french windows looking out on the driveway which runs from the road to the front of the house , and the stretch of lawn beyond . On the left , a doorway leading into the main hall . On the right , rear , a window opening on the garden . Farther forward , a doorway , screened by heavy portieres , leading into another room . In the center , a table with books , periodicals , and an electric reading lamp on it . Three months have elapsed since Act One . It is about noon on a warm day in September . Mrs. Ashleigh and Lucy are discovered . Mrs. Ashleigh is seated by the table reading a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds . She sighs fretfully and comes forward to where her mother is sitting ; picks up a magazine , turns over the pages disgustedly , and throws it back on the table with an exclamation of contempt . LUCY Pah , what silly , shallow stuff ! How can you waste your time reading it , mother ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( laying down her magazine resignedly ) I find it pleasant these warm days . Its light and frivolous , to be sure , but it serves to while away the hours . p. 42 LUCY ( scornfully ) While away the hours ! That 's because your mind is unoccupied . Now , if you had a vital purpose  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH ( hurriedly ) Stop right there , my dear Lucy . I suffered from an overdose of your vital purposes when you were my daughter and I had to submit to keep peace in the family ; but now that you are Mrs. Drayton , I rebel ! LUCY ( laughing , sits down on the arm of her mother 's chair and puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am your daughter , mother . ( She kisses her . ) Unless you 've disowned me . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( fondly ) Indeed I have n't ; but I 'm determined to shun your stern principles . They 're too rigorous for a lazy old lady . LUCY You 're nothing of the kind . Only if you 're going to read why do n't you read something worth while ? Have you looked over that copy of the new radical monthly , The Crash , I loaned you ? MRS . ASHLEIGH No . My brain perspired at the sight of it . LUCY ( laughing ) Mother , you 're incorrigible . You must read it . Theres a wonderful poem by Gabriel  --  p. 43 MRS . ASHLEIGH Now , Lucy , you know I think Gabriel 's poetry is  --  well  --  unmentionable . LUCY ( loftily ) That 's blind prejudice , mother . You do n't like Gabriel and you wo n't see the beauty of his work on that account . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a sigh ) Have it your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like him overmuch . I ca n't for the life of me imagine what you find interesting in him . LUCY ( in the same lofty manner ) You do n't understand him . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a trace of irritation ) Perhaps not . Certainly I do n't understand why he should be always hanging around here . You never used to see much of him , did you ? LUCY I used to run into him around the Square quite frequently . MRS . ASHLEIGH Where did you first meet him ? LUCY Leo introduced me to him . He and she have a studio together . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( raising her eyebrows a trifle ) And I suppose they  --  live together ? LUCY ( assertively ) Yes . They do . In free comradship ! p. 44 MRS . ASHLEIGH Hmm ! LUCY Do n't be bourgeois , mother . MRS . ASHLEIGH Oh , I was n't belittling their morals . They 're free to do as they please , of course . I was only thinking of little Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think she had such bad taste in the matter of companions . LUCY ( indignantly ) Mother ! ( The front door is opened and shut , and Tom appears in the doorway on the left . ) DRAYTON Ah , here you are . ( He comes over and kisses Lucy who submits rather constrainedly and walks away from him to the windows where she stands with her back toward him . Tom looks at her with a puzzled expression ; then turns quickly to Mrs. Ashleigh . ) This is an unexpected pleasure , mother . ( He bends down and kisses her . ) I did n't think I 'd find you out here . MRS . ASHLEIGH It was so warm and sunshiny , I just could n't bear to remain in the city . DRAYTON ( with boyish enthusiasm ) Bully out here , is n't it ? I do n't regret the half-hour train trip . One breath of this air after all those sultry streets puts new life into you . ( turning to Lucy ) Eh , Lucy ? p. 45 LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRAYTON You do n't say that as if you meant it . Do you know , Mother , I think Lucy still pines for the stuffy studios of Greenwich Village . LUCY ( coldly ) You 're mistaken . MRS . ASHLEIGH I can hardly believe that of her . Anyway , she can motor in whenever she feels homesick . She has the car . You seem hardly ever to use it . DRAYTON No , that 's Lucy 's plaything . The old train is good enough for a hard-working business slave who ca n't afford to take chances on blow-outs . MRS . ASHLEIGH But you used to be such an enthusiastic motor fiend . DRAYTON Married life has had it 's sobering effect . I 'm less frivolous . LUCY ( turning to him abruptly ) I suppose you forgot the tickets I asked you to get for the concert this afternoon ? DRAYTON ( looking at her for a moment  --  gently ) Do I usually forget anything you ask me ? LUCY ( abashed ) No  --  I  --  I did n't mean it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had them . p. 46 DRAYTON I sure have . ( He takes the tickets out of his pocket and holds them up for her to see . ) Just to show you I 'm a man of my word . LUCY Thank you . What time does it begin ? DRAYTON Two-thirty , I believe . We 'll have to leave a little before two if we want to make it in the car . ( He takes a bundle of papers from his pocket . ) I 've got to run over these papers . I 'll have time before lunch , I guess . ( He goes out left . Lucy stands staring moodily out of the windows . Her mother looks at her searchingly . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( after a pause ) Come , Lucy , what 's the matter ? Its ungrateful of you to be blue on a beautiful day like this . LUCY ( with a sigh  --  fretfully ) I do n't like weather which is so glaring and sunshiny . Nature makes too vulgar a display of it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Besides , the weather ca n't heal my mood . ( with exaggerated melancholy ) My blue devils live deep down in my soul . MRS . ASHLEIGH Do n't you like it out here any more ? You seemed so enthusiastic when you first came . LUCY Oh , I knew it was what Tom wanted , and , well , I 'd never had the experience before so how could I know ? p. 47 MRS . ASHLEIGH Experience ? Why , you 've only been here three weeks . LUCY That 's long enough  --  to realize . But , Mother , it does n't make any difference where I am , the conditions are the same . I feel  --  cramped in. ( with an affected yawn , throwing herself into a chair ) And I 'm mortally bored . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a sigh ) Ever since you saw that play the other night you 've done nothing but talk and act Hedda Gabbler ; so I suppose its no use trying to argue with her . LUCY ( irritated at having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm simply telling you how I feel . ( somberly ) Though I 'll confess there are times when General Gabbler 's pistols have their fascination . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) Tut-tut , Lucy . You 're too morbid today . You 'll be longing next for someone to come " with vine leaves in his hair . " LUCY ( maliciously ) And perhaps he will come . MRS . ASHLEIGH Hmm ; well , it wo n't be our friend Gabriel , to be sure . I 'm certain he 's one of your precise modern poets who drowns his sorrows in unfermented grape juice , and goes in for scientific eating  --  counts his calories and proteins over one by one , so to speak . p. 48 LUCY ( not deigning to smile at this ) There 's much more to Gabriel than you have any idea of . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) As Leonora said to Tom once . LUCY ( with affected carelessness ) What did she say ? MRS . ASHLEIGH She began by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom was flabbergasted . He hardly knew her at that time . LUCY ( stiffly ) She is rather rude . MRS . ASHLEIGH It would have been impossible in anyone else , but Leonora has a way with her . Tom did n't mind . Then she went on to make it worse  --  said he had more to him than he dreamed of and she was determined to find it out some day . LUCY ( with a short laugh ) Perhaps she will . MRS . ASHLEIGH I think Tom was inclined to regard her as a freak at first but he likes her quite well now . Does she come out here much ? LUCY Quite often  --  with Gabriel . MRS . ASHLEIGH Leonora is a charming little elf . LUCY ( frowning ) She gets on my nerves at times now , and bores me with her chatter . p. 49 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( in surprise ) Why I thought you and she were  --  Oh , well , this is one of your days , Miss . Hedda Gabbler , to be bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop calling me Hedda Gabbler , Mother . What has that to do with it ? Leo wearies me with her silly talk of the Great Blond Beast . MRS . ASHLEIGH That 's what she said Tom reminded her of . LUCY ( with a sneer ) She must be imaginative . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( after a pause ) When you came back from your honeymoon you were so full of healthy good spirits ; and now you 're falling back into the old morbid rut again . LUCY I 'm not morbid . Is it morbid to look the truth in the face ? ( pettishly ) I suppose its all my own fault . I was never intended for a hausfrau . I should never have allowed myself to be bullied into marrying when all my instincts were against it . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( astonished ) Bullied into marrying ? Why , Lucy ! LUCY ( peevishly ) Yes , you did . You and father and Tom were all so set on it . What could I do ? If I had only known  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ! I want freedom to love and dream beyond all these deadly commonplaces ! p. 50 MRS . ASHLEIGH It seems to me you 're perfectly free to do as you please . LUCY ( scornfully ) Do you call this freedom  --  this bourgeois paradise ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with asperity ) I certainly call it as lovely a home as anyone could wish for . LUCY Home ? I do n't want a home . I want a space to grow in . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a sigh of vexation ) I believe all this talk of your 's comes from your association with Gabriel . LUCY ( excitedly ) He 's the only real sympathetic human being who comes into this house . He understands me . He can talk to me in terms of the things I love . You and Tom  --  you take me for granted . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( seeing Lucy 's excitement , comes over and puts her arm around her ) I 'm sure we try our best to be sympathetic , dear . ( She kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it now . The humidity is too oppressive for argument . Let 's go out in the garden for awhile . LUCY ( getting up ) I can only stay a moment , Mother . I 'm expecting Gabriel and Leo any minute . I asked them out for lunch before I knew about the concert . ( with a defiant glance at her mother ) Gabriel promised to read some new poems to me. p. 51 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( eagerly  --  much to Lucy 's surprise ) I 'd like to hear them , if I may . You see I want to know Gabriel more intimately . I 'm afraid , after what you 've told me , I must be wrongly prejudiced against him . LUCY I assure you you are , Mother . ( They walk together to the windows in rear . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH How beautiful everything looks ! Let 's walk around in back where those lovely , shady maple trees are . ( They go out and walk off right . A moment later the hall door is heard being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway on the left . Gabriel has rather long black hair and big soulful eyes . His face is thin and intelligent , with irregular large features . He wears clothes sufficiently unconventional to attract attention . His manner is that of a spoiled child who is used to being petted and enjoys every moment of it . Leonora is dressed in her usual bizarre fashion . ) BARNES Now I ask you , why did n't you ring , you impossible person ? ADAMS ( throwing himself into the easiest chair ) I do n't need to . I belong with the Lares and Penates of this house . In fact , I am them . I am more than they are . I am the great god , persona grata. p. 52 BARNES ( peering around ) There is n't a soul here . ADAMS I quite agree with you . If there is one thing this home could harbor without fear of overcrowding , its a soul . BARNES ( throwing herself into a chair ) I say ! Why do you trot out here so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naivete to ask me that ? ( He takes a box of cigarettes from his pocket and lights one . ) BARNES Give me one . ( She takes a cigarette . ) And a light . ( She lights her cigarette from his . ) Yes , I do ask you that . ADAMS ( shaking his head ) You who are familiar with the asininity of editors and the emaciated condition of my form and purse . You , whose cooking will eventually make a Carlyle out of me  --  BARNES I do n't pretend to be a cook . ADAMS Because the most unworldly stomach would see through such a pretence . No , my adored Leonora , your cooking is very much akin to your painting  --  difficult to absorb . BARNES ( with outraged dignity ) You know nothing at all about painting . p. 53 ADAMS But I have a sensitive appreciation where true Art is concerned , Leo , my own ; and as I have told you so many times , your paintings are rubbish . BARNES ( her face flushing with rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You 're speaking of something you 're too small of soul to understand . BARNES ( judicially ) I understand the beauty of real poetry . That 's why I 've always told you your stuff is only sentimental journalism . ADAMS ( outraged ) What ! ( sputtering ) Your opinion is worthless . No , by God , its even flattering , considering the source . BARNES Its worth as much as your criticism of my Art . ADAMS ( with a sneering laugh ) Your Art ? Good heavens , do you call that stuff Art ? BARNES ( bursting forth ) Conceited ass ! ADAMS Idiot ! BARNES Fool ! ADAMS Imbecile ! BARNES Bourgeois rhymster ! p. 54 ADAMS ( quivering with fury ) Have the last word , you little simpleton ! ( He springs to his feet and , picking a book from the table , appears about to hurl it on the floor . ) BARNES Now I ask you , what are you doing with that book ? This is n't our place . You ca n't work out your rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this relationship a moment longer ! BARNES You 've said that before . Ta-ta ! Go ! You know noone else would put up with you  --  and you ca n't take care of yourself . ADAMS ( crashing the book on the floor ) Damn ! ( He strides up and down holding his head . ) BARNES ( calmly ) Shall I ring and have the maid pick up that book for you ? ADAMS ( picking the book up and putting it back on the table with a great show of dignity ) I do n't desire menial service . Its abhorrent to my love of freedom . BARNES So I 've observed . Certainly there have never been any menials around the studio since I arrived . ( as she sees Gabriel is about to give vent to his anger again ) Now do n't fly off into another tantrum , Gab. p. 55 ADAMS Do n't call me Gab . Its vulgar , and it makes me ridiculous . How often must I tell you ? BARNES Very well , then  --  Gabriel . ( suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't that a lovely brawl ? ADAMS ( with a sigh ) Well , its over for today , at any rate . You know what we swore to each other ? BARNES Only one row a day . ADAMS ( smiling ) What if the Philistines had heard us ! They would perish with the rapture of a revelation  --  at last , Bohemia ! BARNES We must be careful . The dignity of free love is at stake . ( laughing ) If they only knew  --  ADAMS Ssshh ! Someone 'll hear you . Do you want to ruin us ? Remember the high cost of eating . BARNES Where are they all , I wonder  --  and more important , where is lunch ? I 'm as hungry as a tiger . ( turning to him  --  suddenly ) How is your affair coming on with the Blessed Damozel , Lucy ? ADAMS Too well . BARNES I 've noticed she 's been cool to me lately . You must have been making love to her . p. 56 ADAMS I have n't ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid the time has come to be prosy . BARNES Poor Lucy ! I like her so much , but she 's such a nut . ADAMS She 's exceeding fair to look upon , at least , and that 's something . If she only knew the wisdom of silence , the charm of vocal inaction in the female  --  but no , I must listen to all her brainstorms . Its a bit thick , you know . She 's just been to see Hedda Gabbler for the Nth time , and she 's obsessed by it . So I have to play the drunken gentleman with the vine leaves in his hair , whatever his name is . BARNES If she saw you on some of your nights she would n't doubt your ability to fill the bill . I 'm afraid she 's becoming quite impossible  --  Ibsen , in this advanced age ! Imagine a modern husband living with an old-fashioned Ibsen woman ! I begin to pity the Blond Beast . ADAMS There , you 're wrong . After all , with all her fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband but an overgrown clod . BARNES Ah , so ? You do n't know him . There 's more than you dream of beneath his boyish exterior . ADAMS How do you know ? ( indignantly ) Have you been flirting with him ? BARNES ( airily ) Perhaps . Attend to your own love affairs and I 'll attend to mine . p. 57 ADAMS Great Blond Beast ! Great Big Imbecile ! BARNES It seems you 're getting jealous again . Why , Gabriel , how refreshing ! Kiss me ! ADAMS I wo n't ; do n't be an idiot ! ( angrily ) I tell you I wo n't stand  --  BARNES Do n't . ADAMS I wo n't endure being made a fool of behind my back . BARNES ( calmly ) Do n't . ADAMS If I thought for one second  --  I 'd leave you instantly . BARNES Do . ADAMS What ? ( They are interrupted by the entrance of the maid . Gabriel strides around the room fuming . Leo turns to the maid . ) BARNES Is Mrs. Drayton around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss , in the garden , I think . Shall I tell her you 're here ? BARNES Yes , do , will you ? ( The maid goes out rear . ) ADAMS ( stands in front of Leonora with his arms folded ) Remember . I 've warned you . BARNES Pooh ! ( She snaps her fingers . ) That for your warning . When I brought Lucy to our studio you did n't hesitate to start right in casting your spells in under my nose . p. 58 ADAMS But she 's necessary to my work . BARNES Stuff ! The old excuse ! You 've said that about every one of them . Its your own love of being adored , that 's the real reason . Do n't think I 'm jealous . Go right ahead and amuse yourself . I do n't mind . ADAMS ( incredulously ) You do n't ? BARNES Not a bit ; but you 've got to let me have my own little fling . ADAMS Little fling ! You mean that lout , Drayton ? BARNES Perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure he has a good mind , too . ADAMS ( with an attempt at superior disdain ) I must say your tastes are very low . ( furiously ) And am I to submit while you make a monkey of me in this fashion ? BARNES I 've had to . It 'll do you good to find out how a monkey feels . ADAMS I tell you I 'll leave you flat at the first inkling  --  BARNES Run along , then . ( He turns away from her and strides toward the windows . ) Farewell , my beloved ! Are n't you going to kiss me good'bye ? ADAMS ( coming back to her  --  intensely ) You 're an empty-headed nincompoop ! p. 59 BARNES ( gets up and dances around him singing ) Empty-headed nincompoop ! But I do not give a hoop ! ( Lucy appears at the windows in the rear . Leonora sees her and runs and flings her arms around her as she enters . ) What a dear you look today ! ( She kisses her effusively . Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper . ) LUCY ( embarrassed by Leonora 's reception ) Have you been here long ? I went for a stroll in the garden with mother . BARNES Where is she ? Never mind , I 'll find her . I must see her . She 's a dear . Ta-ta ! ( She runs out into the garden . ) ADAMS ( is himself again . He comes and takes Lucy 's hand and looks into her eyes ardently . ) Leo was right . You are beautiful today  --  as ever . ( He kisses her hand passionately . ) LUCY ( embarrassed ; taking her hand away , hurriedly ) Have you brought your poems ? ( She comes forward and sits down on the lounge . He pulls up a chair close to her . ) ADAMS Yes ; but I wo n't bore you with them yet awhile . LUCY ( reproachfully ) Bore ? It is n't kind of you to say that when you know how deeply I admire them . p. 60 ADAMS Life is the most beautiful poem of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe , live , here in the same room with you for an eternal moment or so . That will be a more wonderful poem than any I could read . LUCY ( haltingly ) I 'm afraid you 'd soon find it  --  very tiresome . ADAMS It would be heaven ! I am weary of reading , writing , thinking . I want to feel , to live a poem . I want to sit and let my soul drink in your beauty , and forget everything else . LUCY ( archly ) Ah , sir poet , but you must n't . If you do n't feel in the mood for reading , then you must talk . I am lonely , and you are the only one who can understand my solitude . I can not talk to the others . They live in another world . You are the only one who loves the things I love . ADAMS ( kissing her hand ) How can I thank you for feeling that ? ( She allows him to keep her hand in both of his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ADAMS Ah no , no , Princess ! LUCY But yes . You do not mock my dreams , my longings , with the old thread-bare platitudes. ( then wearily with a great sigh ) My life appeared so futilely hopeless ; I was so alone , until you came ; and I was mortally bored with everything . p. 61 ADAMS ( hastily ) I know how you feel  --  crushed in , tied down by the petty round of family life . ( with affected melancholy ) Do you think I have n't mentally rebelled against the same bonds , suffered from the same irritating restraints as you ? Ah , you do n't know . LUCY But you  --  you 're not married . Its hardly the same . ADAMS ( hurriedly ) Of course  --  in that sense , you 're right . Nevertheless  --  ( He heaves a great , unhappy sigh . ) LUCY ( with awakened curiosity ) But I thought your relationship with Leonora was ideally happy . ADAMS ( with a scornful smile ) What is ideal in this miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . All poets are ; and I must achieve my punishment with the rest . LUCY ( softly ) Then you are n't  --  happy ? ADAMS ( bitterly ) Happiness ? What is it ? A mirage ? A reality ? I do n't know . ( looking at her meaningly ) I see it before me now , within my reach , and yet so far from me ; guarded , withheld by every damnable convention in the world . ( She drops her eyes before his intense gaze . He laughs shortly . ) But I 'm talking about myself . What do I matter ? " Dear God , what means a poet more or less ? " I am used to suffering , but you , you must not ! You are too good , too wonderful , too beautiful to know anything but joy . Your life should express itself only in beauty , in growth , like a flowers . p. 62 LUCY ( immensely pleased ) I 'm afraid you have much too high an opinion of me . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Simply a discontented , morbid , spoiled child , perhaps , as my mother thinks . ADAMS ( indignantly ) How can she misunderstand you so ? Why should n't your fine spiritual inner nature revolt against all this sordidness ? ( With a sweeping gesture he indicates the room and the grounds outside . ) All this bourgeois sty ! At least , I understand you . ( with tender appeal in his voice ) Do I not ? LUCY ( slowly ) Yes , you do . You are the only one who does . ADAMS Ah , if you would only let me help you ! LUCY You have  --  so much , already . ADAMS If you only felt that someone from without could come into your life and take you away , to the mountain tops , to the castles in the air , to the haunt of brave dreams where life is free , and joyous , and noble ! If you only felt the need of such a person  --  ( He looks at her questioningly . ) LUCY ( hesitatingly ) Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let me be the one ! Your very presence fills me with strength . For you I could do anything , everything ! ( Lucy grows ill at ease at this excited outburst and casts an anxious look toward the door on left . Gabriel continues passionately : ) Ca n't you read the secret in my heart ? Do n't you hear the song my soul has been singing ever since I first looked into your eyes ? ( He kisses her hand ardently . She is frightened and attempts to withdraw it . ) I love you , Lucy ! Do n't you know that I love you ? ( Tom appears in the doorway at the left . He stands there looking at them , an expression of anger coming over his face . Lucy suddenly catches sight of him and tears her hand from Gabriel 's grasp with a little cry . Gabriel turns around and jumps to his feet when he sees Tom . ) DRAYTON ( icily ) I beg your pardon ! ( Then , overcome by his anger he advances toward Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around wildly for some place of escape . ) LUCY ( stepping in between them ) Tom ! DRAYTON ( recovering himself with an effort , forces a smile , and holds out his hand to Gabriel ) Hello , Adams . I did n't know you were here . p. 64 ADAMS ( looks at the outstretched hand uncertainly  --  finally takes it ) Er  --  just got her  --  Leo and I  --  a moment ago . ( He pulls away his hand hurriedly . ) Er  --  where is Leo , by the way ? ( He looks around as if he had thought she was in the same room . ) She was here a second ago . She 's always running away like that . Must be in the garden . I 'll go and find her  --  if you 'll excuse me . DRAYTON ( ironically ) Oh , certainly . ( Gabriel makes his escape . Tom comes over and stands before Lucy who is sitting down on the lounge again , staring at the floor , her cheek resting on her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes ? DRAYTON ( awkwardly ) Is n't this  --  going a bit too far ? LUCY ( calmly ) What ? DRAYTON I mean  --  you know  --  in my own house  --  LUCY ( coldly ) I 'm glad you recognize the fact that its your house and not mine . DRAYTON You know I did n't mean that . p. 65 LUCY But I mean it . DRAYTON But  --  what I meant was  --  I do n't understand  --  LUCY No , that 's the tragedy of it  --  you do n't understand . DRAYTON ( hurt ) You 're not fair , Lucy . LUCY Fair ? And do you think you 're fair after the scene you created a minute ago ? DRAYTON I do n't see that I made any scene . I think I held myself in pretty well , considering the circumstances . LUCY ( lifting her eyebrows  --  haughtily ) Considering the circumstances ! DRAYTON Yes . ( wrathfully ) Dirty little cad ! LUCY What circumstances are you referring to ? DRAYTON Now , Lucy , you must acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that little puppy licking your hand . LUCY Do n't be vulgar ! DRAYTON Well , then , kissing your hand . LUCY And what of that ? Gabriel is one of my dearest friends , and  --  DRAYTON You ca n't deny he was making love to you , right here in under my nose , the insolent scribbler ! p. 66 LUCY ( stiffly ) I deny your right to talk to me in this manner . DRAYTON ( hurriedly ) Oh , I 'm not blaming you ; I know you do n't realize what he really is or you would n't stand for him a minute . I know his kind  --  making love to every woman he sees , getting off a lot of poetic slush which sounds good to them ; and the worst part of it is all the romantic fools think its genuine ! LUCY ( jumping to her feet in angry indignation ) So that 's what you consider me  --  a romantic fool ! DRAYTON ( realizing he has put his foot in it ) I did n't say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care to hear your excuses . Besides , what does it matter ? I tell you quite frankly : Gabriel was making love to me . DRAYTON Of course he was . He does to everyone . I 've heard all about him . LUCY ( wincing ) Do n't try to revenge yourself by repeating all the cheap scandal of your stupid friends . How could they ever know the real Gabriel ? DRAYTON But that 's just what they do know  --  the real Gabriel . p. 67 LUCY ( stiffly ) I prefer to rely on my own judgement , not on theirs . I believe , not his words , but my own intuition . DRAYTON And , thinking he was serious , you permitted it ? LUCY ( defiantly ) Yes . DRAYTON But why ? Why ? ( fearfully ) Do n't you  --  love me ? LUCY ( rising to the occasion  --  moodily ) I do n't know . DRAYTON You do n't know ! Surely you do n't  --  you ca n't  --  you do n't love him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The measly little shrimp ! I 've a good notion to break him in half . LUCY ( scornfully ) Leonora should see you now . She would think you were the blond beast . ( Tom subsides a bit at this . ) You 've no right to ask me if I love Gabriel or anyone else . You should rely on my frankness to tell you of my own free will . I wo n't be forced . DRAYTON ( with a hollow laugh ) No right . No , I 'm only your husband ! p. 68 LUCY ( with a lofty disdain ) Husband ? You know that word has no meaning for me . DRAYTON Well , it has for me. ( pathetically ) You see I love you . LUCY ( continuing as if she had n't heard ) You are honorably bound by our agreement  --  DRAYTON ( roughly ) That was all foolishness ! LUCY ( angrily ) You may think so but I do not . For me its the only thing which is binding . Our being married in the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find I love Gabriel I 'll leave with him that instant . DRAYTON ( suffering ) Lucy ! Please ! ( He tries to take her hand but she holds it away from him . ) LUCY No , its no use being sentimental about it . I advise you to reread the agreement you signed as a man of honor , and you 'll have a clearer idea of the conditions of our life together . You seem to have forgotten . Until your misconceptions are cleared up I prefer not to discuss the matter with you further . ( She starts to sweep past him out into the garden. ) p. 69 DRAYTON ( bitterly ) I remember I 'm allowed the same liberty of action as you are by that agreement . I have n't forgotten that . LUCY ( stopping ) Certainly you are . What do you mean ? DRAYTON ( with a hard laugh ) I mean its about time I made use of some of my  --  freedom . LUCY ( trying to appear indifferent  --  coldly ) You may do as you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair , lights a cigarette , throws it away , gets up and walks up and down irritably . Mrs. Ashleigh enters from the garden and stands for a moment looking at Tom who does not see her . She comes forward . ) DRAYTON ( trying to conceal his irritation ) Ah , Mother , too hot for you outside ? ( He arranges an easy chair for her and she sits down . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( smiling at him  --  gently ) What 's the matter , Tom ? Even if I could n't read you like a book , I 've seen Gabriel , and I 've seen Lucy , and I know something unpleasant has occurred . What was it ? DRAYTON ( hesitatingly ) Oh  --  nothing much  --  only I came to get something in here , and I found that little insect  --  ( He stops , frowning. ) p. 70 MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes ? DRAYTON ( blurting it out ) Holding her hand and kissing it . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) Oh , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe . Its so romantic , and it gives one such an air . Why , he kissed my hand out in the garden not ten minutes ago . DRAYTON ( angrily ) It was the way he did it . MRS . ASHLEIGH And what happened afterward ? DRAYTON Oh  --  nothing . MRS . ASHLEIGH Now , Tom ! Surely you can confide in me . DRAYTON Oh , well , he ran away as soon as he could ; and then Lucy and I had a regular row . ( He throws himself into a chair and frowns fiercely . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( smiling ) Your first row ? DRAYTON Yes . MRS . ASHLEIGH What ? Not one on your honeymoon ? DRAYTON No . MRS . ASHLEIGH The first row is always a blow . I can remember mine  --  the day after my marriage . So you see you 're lucky . The tenth one wo n't be so bad , and the hundredeth  --  not to mention the thousandth  --  poof ! Mere puffs of wind ruffling the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . ASHLEIGH Then I 'll be serious , too ; but you must answer my questions . Did you tell Lucy you objected to this Gabriel ? DRAYTON Certainly I did ! I 've stood it long enough . He 's around the house more than the cat is . Wherever I go I find him . If I start to sit down in a chair I discover he 's in it . I ca n't see Lucy alone for a minute . I have to sit and listen to his everlasting poems . Its got to stop . MRS . ASHLEIGH You 're on the wrong tack . I made the same mistake myself this morning  --  became irritated because Lucy kept quoting his banal epigrams  --  on this hot day ! So I allowed myself a few disparaging remarks about the gentleman . ( shaking her head ) Its foolish . I should n't have done it . You should n't either . We ought to know better . DRAYTON Oh , I know what you preached to me the night before we were married , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good its done ! MRS . ASHLEIGH You 're ungrateful . If it was n't for my advice I think your first quarrell would have taken place ten minutes after leaving the church instead of four months later . DRAYTON Its too humiliating . I ca n't give in all the time . p. 72 MRS . ASHLEIGH You must  --  if you want to have your own way . DRAYTON There 's a limit to everything . Why last evening I went to the bathroom and found him there shaving  --  with my razor ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( laughs  --  then becomes serious ) It seems we 've both made a frightful mess of things today . Lucy will make Gabriel the leading issue after this , out of pure defiance . DRAYTON Well , I ca n't knuckle down now  --  after our row . MRS . ASHLEIGH What did Lucy have to say in answer to your objections ? DRAYTON Referred me to that silly agreement I was foolish enough to sign . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( horrified ) You did n't put it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manliness ) Yes , I did  --  only stronger . MRS . ASHLEIGH Oh , this is frightful ! Why did you do it ? The agreement of agreements , Lucy 's masterpiece of free , unfettered radicalism  --  and you dared to cast slurs on it ! What did you say , in heaven 's name ? DRAYTON I told her if she was going to use her guaranteed-by-agreement liberty in the way she 's been doing , it was about time I began to use some of mine along the same lines . p. 73 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( aghast at first ) You did ! ( then thoughtfully ) Hmm . ( her face suddenly lighting up ) Why , Tom , its an inspiration ! I have underestimated your wiles . DRAYTON ( modestly ) I only meant it as a bluff . MRS . ASHLEIGH Bluff ? Indeed not ! Its exactly what you must do . DRAYTON What do you mean ? MRS . ASHLEIGH And now I remember something which ought to be valuable to us . Its right in line with your idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I 've any intention of carrying out that foolish threat of mine ? MRS . ASHLEIGH But you must ! ( as Tom shakes his head decisively ) Of course I mean you must pretend to , you great baby ! DRAYTON ( commencing to smile ) Oh , I see . MRS . ASHLEIGH Did Lucy act taken back when you asserted your right to bestow your affections elsewhere ? DRAYTON ( grinning ) She did n't look very pleased . p. 74 MRS . ASHLEIGH Then it will be all plain sailing . ( She leans back in her chair with a sigh of relief . ) So that 's settled . DRAYTON Yes ; but what 's settled ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Why , that you 're to fall in love with Leo . DRAYTON ( astonished ) Leo ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Leo  --  Leonora  --  The little Nietzsche lady  --  Gabriel 's Leo . You shall be her Great Blond Beast . DRAYTON But I do n't see  --  why Leo ? MRS . ASHLEIGH For many reasons . First , you like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of her in that light . MRS . ASHLEIGH Of course you did n't , silly boy . I assure you I 've no suspicions regarding you whatever . The second reason is  --  revenge ! You 'll be getting back at Gabriel . It will hurt his pride dreadfully and I know he 'll be infernally jealous . DRAYTON I 'd like to make him sweat . MRS . ASHLEIGH And the third reason I 'm not going to tell you . You would n't believe it , and I 've no proof to offer you . Its just what you 'd call a hunch of mine , but I know it will turn out to be the best reason of all . p. 75 DRAYTON Well , granting my willingness to carry out my part , how do you know Leo will fall in with this idea ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Why she 's just perishing to start a flirtation with you . Are you blind ? She 'll think its the greatest lark . DRAYTON ( uncertainly ) But is all this fair to Lucy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way I can see to bring her back to earth and get her to take up the business of married life seriously . She 'll never realize the worth of her good fortune until she sees it slipping from her . DRAYTON Well  --  if you think its best  --  I 'll try it . MRS . ASHLEIGH Do ; and I 'll let you know from the inside how things are developing . ( She gets up from her chair . ) I need fresh air after all this intrigue . It must be nearly lunch time . I 'll go and tell them . DRAYTON ( going over with her to the windows ) Here comes my light-of-love now . ( Leonora comes running breathlessly into the room . She stops suddenly on seeing them . ) BARNES I 'm not interrupting anything , am I ? Every where I go I seem to be one too many . p. 76 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( putting her arm around her ) Certainly not , dear . BARNES Gab 's in the garden doing the book-reading scene from Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were a contagious disease . ( Tom frowns . ) What time is it ? How long before lunch ? DRAYTON Oh , ten minutes or so ? BARNES Then I 'll have time to take a bath ! ( She dances around gleefully , snapping her fingers . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH A bath ? In ten minutes ? BARNES Oh , I just hop in and out . There 's never any hot water where we live . ( to Tom ) Is there plenty of hot water here ? DRAYTON ( with a smile ) I think so . BARNES And towels ? DRAYTON I hope so . BARNES Now I say , I forgot ! I should have asked you , should n't I ? May I , please , use your honorable bath tub ? DRAYTON ( making a deep bow ) It is at your disposal . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a significant glance at Tom ) I 'll walk out and tell them how late its getting to be . If Lucy 's going to the concert with you she ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's hesitation  --  as Mrs. A. is going out ) Perhaps you 'd better tell Lucy I 'm not sure whether I can go with her or not . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a comprehending smile ) Very well , I 'll tell her . ( She goes into the garden and off right . ) BARNES That 's right , you are going to a concert , are n't you ? Do n't you think they 're a bore on a day like this ? DRAYTON Yes , I emphatically do . BARNES Then do n't go . DRAYTON But I 've practically promised Lucy . BARNES She wo n't mind . Let her take Gab . He pretends he just dotes on the new music . There 'll be a pair of them . One ought to suffer for one 's poses , do n't you think ? DRAYTON I sure do . But how will I spend the afternoon ? BARNES Come with me . DRAYTON Where to ? BARNES Oh , I have to drop in at an exhibition for a few minutes but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway , do n't you ? DRAYTON Some paintings . p. 78 BARNES Now I say , do n't be bourgeois ! Come down with me and you 'll see enough art to talk about with the country folk for years . Do n't look so glum . I wo n't keep you there long . You can take me to the Lafayette afterwards and we 'll have an absinthe together . I 'll blow you . I 've got seventy cents . We can get quite squiffy on that . DRAYTON ( after a moment 's hesitation ) Its a go . I 'm with you . BARNES Ta-ta , then . I 'm off for my dip . ( She looks up at him scrutinizingly for a moment . ) Bend down your head . ( He obediently does so . Lucy appears at the windows in the rear and stands looking at them . Leo runs her fingers through his hair , and squints her eye at it . ) I say , you have got nice hair , have n't you ? Well , au revoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skips laughingly out of the room . Lucy walks into the room . ) DRAYTON ( turning to her  --  with a forced laugh ) Leo 's the devil of a tease , is n't she ? LUCY ( coldly ) Yes ? ( trying to conceal her irritation ) I can remember when you considered her a freak . DRAYTON Yes ; strange how erroneous one 's first impressions sometimes are . Now that I know her better I like her more than any of your friends . p. 79 LUCY So I perceive . DRAYTON Eh ? LUCY Nothing . Mother said you did n't know whether you 'd go to the concert or not . Is n't it rather late to back out ? DRAYTON You can easily find a substitute . Take Gab along . He 'll pretend to enjoy that stuff better than I could . ( He takes the tickets out of his pocket and hands them to her . ) Here 's the tickets . ( She masters her impulse to fly into a rage and takes them from him . ) LUCY Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no . I 'm through with work for the day . LUCY Then why do you break this engagement with me ? DRAYTON You know I do n't care about concerts . I 'd only be bored to death if I went . LUCY ( insistently ) Wo n't it be just as much of a bore to stay in  --  ( scornfully ) this place ? DRAYTON ( warmly ) For you it might . You see our tastes differ . Anyway , I do n't intend to remain here . I feel like a little relaxation . LUCY ( scornfully ) The baseball game ? p. 80 DRAYTON ( regretfully ) No . LUCY Then what , if I 'm not too inquisitive ? DRAYTON ( playing his part  --  jubilantly ) A regular lark  --  with Leo . I 'm going to take her to an exhibition of paintings someplace , and  --  LUCY ( laughing sarcastically ) That will be interesting  --  for you . DRAYTON Yes , it will . Leo promises to explain them all to me . I 've often wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driving at ; and she being one of them herself can put me on to all the inside stuff . LUCY You must have changed to take such a sudden interest in Art . DRAYTON I have . LUCY ( with a sneer ) Strange I have n't noticed it . DRAYTON I have n't let you see it . I was sure you 'd misunderstand me . LUCY ( flushing ) Are you trying to be humourous at my expense ? DRAYTON Heaven forbid ! I mean what I say . Do n't think you 're the only misunderstood person about this house . I have my own aspirations which you will never understand ; only I 'm resigned to my fate . p. 81 LUCY ( caustically ) You are trying to be funny , are n't you ? DRAYTON Please forgive me for feeling cheerful . I ca n't help it . You see Leo has promised to take me to the Lafayette , blow me to absinthe , tea me at her studio , and I feel light-headed at the prospect of such a bust-up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel keeps as far away from Tom as he can . ) LUCY Would you like to go with me to the concert , Gabriel ? ADAMS ( looking at Tom ) Why  --  er  --  you see  --  I 'm not sure  --  DRAYTON ( heatily ) You 've got to go . I ca n't ; and Lucy insists on someone being bored with her . ADAMS Oh , in that case , I 'd love to , Luc-  --  Mrs. Drayton . DRAYTON Then that 's fixed , and Leo and I can have our bust-up . ADAMS ( frowning ) Leo ? DRAYTON Yes ; she and I are going to have a real party together . ADAMS ( looking angrily round the room ) Where is Leo ? p. 82 DRAYTON Upstairs , taking a bath . LUCY ( indignantly ) Bath ! DRAYTON Yes , I gave her the freedom of the tub . ( to Gab ) You know there 's never any hot water at your place . A MAID AT THE DRAYTON 'S ( entering from the right ) Lunch is served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concert if we wait for her . I 'd better run up and tell her to hurry . ADAMS ( furiously ) I 'll go up and tell her . DRAYTON ( stepping before him ) Oh no , we could n't think of putting you to the trouble . You three go in and start lunch . I 'll run up and tell her . ( Lucy and Gabriel both show very apparent disapproval of this proposition . While all are standing in hesitation , Leonora enters hurriedly from the left . She has on Tom 's bathrobe which trails in a long train in back of her , her bare feet peeping out from beneath the front of it . ) BARNES ( calmly critical and absolutely unembarrassed ) @x SCENE  --  Same as Act Two  --  a month later . It is about seven o'clock in the evening . Tom and Leonora are discovered . Tom is sitting by the table , frowning , his mind evidently troubled about something . He is making a polite but ineffectual attempt to appear intevested in Leonora 's effervescent chatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from chair to chair , sitting on the arms , perching on the edge of the table , picking up books and throwing them down again , going to look out of the windows , etc . BARNES ( coming over to Tom and looking at him with a quizzical smile ) Now I ask you , what are you so gloomy about ? ( Tom attempts a smile . ) Heavens , what a movie-actor smile ! Do n't do it again . You need n't be polite with me , you know . I love to talk to myself , and your replies are no good anyway . A second ago you said " no " when any perfect gentleman should have said " yes " and agreed with me . DRAYTON ( a bit confused ) I guess I 'm a little off color tonight . BARNES ( sitting on the edge of the table ) Indigestion . I ate too much myself . We all do out here . ( Tom looks at her impatiently . ) But its jolly to be a glutton for once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chuckle ) How Gab gorges himself ! He 's losing his spiritual waist line since he began coming out here . Have you noticed ? p. 84 DRAYTON ( explosively ) No ! BARNES Yes , he 's gradually assuming the blubber of prosperity  --  given up free verse for free food . He has n't written a poem since my last Welch rabbit . DRAYTON ( bitingly ) Thank God the situation has some redeeming features . BARNES Oh , he does real stuff every now and then , when he forgets himself for a moment . ( She goes over to the window and looks out at the garden . ) Where 's mother ? I have n't seen her since dinner . DRAYTON Mother ? BARNES Your mother-in-law  --  Mrs. Ashleigh . DRAYTON ( sarcastically ) Oh ! BARNES She told me I could call her that . She 's a dear . Where is she , I wonder ? DRAYTON ( grumpily ) I do n't know . BARNES Probably chaperoning those two . ( Tom winces . She comes back to the table and commences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with each other ! Its too dark for Gab to read his poems , and without the sound of his own voice to spur him on , he 's a stick . ( She fixes the cigarette in her holder and lights it . ) I 'll bet they 're holding hands and saying : " Ai n't nature grand ! " p. 85 DRAYTON Damn ! ( He gets up and strides up and down the room . ) BARNES ( sitting on the edge of the table and smoking  --  calmly ) You 're not jealous of Gab , are you ? DRAYTON ( trying to appear scornful ) Jealous ? Do you think I 'm crazy ? BARNES I do n't know . You would be if you were . I assure you Gab 's entirely harmless . He 's in love with himself and there 's not a rival in sight . ( looking at him keenly ) Do sit down ! ( He does so . ) There 's something wrong with you . What is it ? Tell me. ( doubtfully ) You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRAYTON ( decidedly ) I am not . BARNES You need n't be so unflatteringly emphatic about it . But its just as well . You have a certain physical appeal , as I 've often said , but I 've given up sex for good . I 've been through it all , and there 's nothing in it for anyone who wants to accomplish something real . DRAYTON ( forced to smile ) I 'll take your word for it , Miss . Barnes . BARNES The next time you call me that I hope you choke . What 's the matter with Leo ? Of course , it is n't my real name . I 'll bet you ca n't guess the horrible title my silly parents wished on me. p. 86 DRAYTON What was it ? BARNES Pearl ! Imagine , Pearl ! I simply could n't put up with Pearl . We once had a colored cook who was called Leonora  --  she was named after a race horse , she said  --  and I liked the sound and swiped it . So Leonora I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring grumpily before him and not paying any attention to her . ) What ho ! ( Tom comes to with a start . ) There is something wrong . Do n't you feel well ? DRAYTON Oh , its nothing . BARNES Is it business worries , then ? DRAYTON ( grasping eagerly at this excuse ) Yes  --  sort of . BARNES ( interestedly ) You have n't been dabbling in Wall street and robbing the till , have you ? ( clapping her hands ) I say ! That would give me a moment  --  seeing a movie crook in real life . DRAYTON ( dryly ) I 'm sorry , but I 'll have to disappoint you . BARNES ( putting out her cigarette ) I suppose its the price of paper or some other dull thing that 's bothering you . ( She jumps to the floor and stretches , yawning . ) This is a bore ! ( Lucy , Mrs. Ashleigh and Gabriel enter from the french windows in the rear . ) Hello , hello , hello ! Here you are at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles , while Gabriel appears furious at finding Leo and Tom together. ) p. 87 DRAYTON ( getting up from his chair , and adopting a pose of smiling joviality ) Hello ! We did n't expect you back from your walk so soon . ( Lucy and Gabriel sit down on right . Mrs. Ashleigh takes the chair in the middle . Leo hops to the edge of the table again . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH It was becoming chilly outside so we thought we 'd better come back . ( There is an uncomfortable silence following this . Each one appears to be trying desperately to find something to say . ) BARNES ( bursting out impulsively ) I say ! This is a bore ! You 're all as glum as a tree full of owls . Let 's do something , anything ! DRAYTON ( forcing a smile ) I 'm game . What do you suggest ? BARNES Lets all motor down and take in some theatre . MRS . ASHLEIGH That 's a good idea , Leo . What do you think , Lucy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , Mother . BARNES Is n't there some perfectly shocking burlesque we can see ? ( clapping her hands ) That would be a lark ! ADAMS What silly nonsense ! p. 88 BARNES ( airily ) Speak when you 're spoken to , Gab , my dear . ( to Tom ) Is n't there one ? DRAYTON ( with a smile ) I 'm hardly posted on that subject . LUCY ( coldly ) Of course , Leo is only joking . She knows Mother would n't go . BARNES I 'll bet she would . She 's more of a sport than any of us . Now I ask you , would n't you , Mother ? ( Lucy shows her indignation at this familiarity and turns to Gabriel who is biting his lips and glowering at Leo . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( gently ) Its so long since I 've been to one , my dear , I 'm afraid I 'm not young enough to enjoy them any more . ( Lucy looks at her mother in shocked surprise . ) However I suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like something cheerful  --  something with jokes and music  --  say , a good musical comedy . ADAMS You wo n't find that , Mrs. Ashleigh , in a country where vulgarity is mistaken for humour . DRAYTON ( sarcastically ) They do it differently in Jersey City , eh , Gabriel ? BARNES Do n't mind Gab . He 's only posing . He went with me to see " Oh , You Cutey ! " last winter  --  the press agent gave us passes , you know  --  and nearly went into hysterics laughing . And then the papers came out next day and called it the most vulgar exhibition that had ever disgraced a New York theatre . p. 89 ADAMS ( jumping from his chair  --  furiously ) I was not myself that night  --  and you know it ! BARNES You were squiffy , you mean ? All the rest of the audience knew that , too . But that 's no excuse . In vino veritas , you know , and all the rest of it . DRAYTON ( who has been glancing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Casino . ( getting up ) I 'll phone for the tickets and order the car . ADAMS I 'm afraid  --  Thank you just the same , Drayton , but  --  the fact is I 've just remembered an engagement  --  BARNES Liar ! ADAMS ( raging ) Will you hold your tongue , you little  --  ( He controls himself by a violent effort . Leo laughs and makes a face at him . ) DRAYTON ( perfunctorily ) Sorry you ca n't come . That 'll make it four . ( He starts for the door . ) LUCY ( languidly ) I do n't think I care much for that type of amusement either . BARNES Oh I say , here 's our party breaking up already . p. 90 DRAYTON ( frowning ) Then you wo n't come ? LUCY ( coldly ) I think not . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( coaxingly ) Do come , dear ! I 'm sure you 'll enjoy a little foolishness for a change . LUCY ( wearily ) No , I 've a headache , Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then perhaps we 'd all better stay . LUCY No . You three go . ( looking at Tom defiantly ) I 'm sure Gabriel will keep me company , part of the time at least  --  ( she turns to Gab , questioningly ) if his engagement  --  ? ADAMS ( looking at Leo with malicious satisfaction ) Oh , that was nothing of any importance . I can phone . I 'll be delighted to remain , Mrs. Drayton . BARNES ( breezily ) Then that 's settled . ( She flits up to Tom who is standing uncertainly , glaring at Gabriel , and gives him a push . ) Hurry on now , and phone . They may be sold out . DRAYTON ( gloomily ) That 'll be three . ( He goes out left. ) p. 91 BARNES I do hope there 'll be acrobats in it ! I adore acrobats ! They 're so decorative in their tights and spangles . I 'd just love to paint them . ADAMS ( sneeringly ) I 'm sure the acrobats would recognize you as a fellow-craftsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something of your trapeze stunts in free verse but I wo n't . You ca n't pick a fight with me tonight , Gab . I ate too much dinner . MRS . Look in the paper , Leonora , will you ? ( Leo picks up the paper and commences glancing through it . ) LUCY ( boredly ) You wo n't miss anything if you 're late , Mother . Those productions were concocted with an eye for the comfort of the Tired Business Man . ADAMS Exactly ! BARNES Well , we 'll have one with us  --  Tom ; so he ought to enjoy it . ( She turns over the paper angrily . ) I never could find anything in the beastly papers . ( Tom enters from the left . ) DRAYTON They had nothing left but a stage box . I told them to save that for us. p. 92 MRS . ASHLEIGH A box ! Good heavens , look at me . I ca n't go in a box . BARNES Why ? You 're all right . DRAYTON Why yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in the direction of Lucy and Gabriel ) No , really , I could n't go looking like this . Besides , I 've been thinking while you were gone that perhaps , after all , I better not go . BARNES Oh , do come along . MRS . ASHLEIGH I 'm sure Mr. Ashleigh will expect me home early after my staying out here for the past two nights . So I really do n't think I 'd better go . You take Leo , Tom , and send the car back for me . DRAYTON ( reluctantly ) All right , Mother , if you think its best . ( Lucy and Gab show very evident disapproval of this plan . ) ADAMS Why not call it all off for tonight ? BARNES Well , I guess not ! I must have my acrobats tonight or die . ( She looks ruefully at her smock . ) But what am I going to wear , I ask you ? If I go this way they 'll think I 'm one of the performers . DRAYTON ( boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . p. 93 LUCY ( starting to her feet  --  her eyes blazing ) I  --  I 'd be glad to , but you seem to forget Leo is much smaller than me . BARNES ( delighted ) Oh , I can fix that all right . I 've worn too many hired costumes to masquerades not to know how to make things look a fit . With a few pins  --  You can let your maid help me . I 'll be ready in no time . I can wear your fur coat till we get in the box and then sit in back . Noone 'll know the difference . Lucy , you 're a dear ! DRAYTON ( looking at his watch ) We 'll have to hurry . The car 'll be here at quarter of . BARNES Do n't worry , ole love . I 'll be in my soup and fish as soon as you will . Show me what I can wear , Lucy . I promise not to tear it . LUCY ( her voice trembling a little ) Very well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway on left , biting her lips . ) BARNES Mind ? I think its no end of a lark . You must come up too , Mother , and help tuck me in . Will you ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with an uneasy glance at Lucy  --  uncertainly ) Of course , my dear . ( They all go out left leaving Gabriel alone. ) p. 94 ADAMS ( sitting for a moment in silent rage ) Of all the damned cheek ! ( He gets up and strides furiously up and down the room , running his hands through his hair . Suddenly he utters a loud " damn " and picks a book from the table as if he were going to hurl it at someone . He still has the book held high in the air when Lucy returns . He puts it back on the table sheepishly . ) LUCY ( her face still flushed with anger  --  irritably ) What in the world are you doing with that book ? ADAMS ( following her and sitting down on a chair close to the lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth I was about to give way to a stupid fit of rage . LUCY ( coldly ) About what ? ADAMS Why the way Leo jumped at wearing your gown . It was so nervy of her , so ill-mannered , so  --  LUCY I 'm sure she 's perfectly welcome to it if she thinks she can make it fit . ADAMS I was never so ashamed of anything in my life . LUCY I would n't take it so seriously if I were you . ADAMS Leo is too preposterous at times . p. 95 LUCY ( irritably ) Please ! Let 's drop the subject . ADAMS ( with an ill grace ) I beg your pardon . ( There is an uncomfortable silence . Lucy stares straight in front of her , now and then casting a side glance of irritation at Gabriel who is fidgetting nervously in his chair , and biting his nails fiercely . ) LUCY ( endeavoring to make talk ) Do you know anything good for a headache ? ADAMS Why  --  bromo-seltzer , is n't it ? LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be good . LUCY It is n't . ( The talk abruptly ceases . ) ADAMS ( after an unpleasant pause  --  desperately ) Is it very bad ? LUCY What ? ADAMS Your toothache . LUCY ( icily ) My toothache ? I have n't  --  ADAMS ( hastily ) I mean your headache . LUCY Splitting . p. 96 ADAMS ( perfunctorily ) I 'm so sorry . Is n't there anything I can do ? LUCY No , thank you , I think not . ( Another long silence . Gabriel becomes more nervous than ever . He is evidently re- straining an outburst of rage only by a mighty effort . Lucy 's lips are compressed and she glares at him angrily . ) ADAMS ( in an exasperated tone ) How shall we spend the evening ? Ca n't we  --  ? ( He can find nothing to suggest . ) LUCY Yes ? ADAMS What do you say to a walk ? LUCY We 've just come from one ; and besides , its too chilly . ADAMS ( jumping up from his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't sit here all night like a couple of  --  ( he hesitates , then blurts it out ) of mummies . Its ridiculous ! LUCY ( her eyebrows raised ) If you would rather go home  --  ADAMS ( quickly takes her hand in both of his , much against her will ) You know I did n't mean that , Lucy . I 'm terribly out of key . Do n't be cruel to me . I only want  --  I love you so much I ca n't bear to have anyone  --  Forgive me , Lucy ! ( He raises her hand and kisses it. ) p. 97 LUCY ( snatching her hand away  --  pettishly ) Do n't be silly ! ADAMS ( in accents of wounded pride ) Silly ! LUCY Someone is liable to come in any moment . ADAMS ( relieved ) Oh ! Yes , of course , you 're right . I 'm too impulsive . I forget  --  these infernally stupid conditions . ( Lucy tries to wither him with a look but he does not see it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stares soulfully into space . Lucy taps her foot nervously on the floor . There is a long pause . ) ADAMS ( suddenly ) What are they doing all this time ? LUCY ( coldly ) They have n't been gone five minutes . ADAMS ( rudely ) It seems five years . ( Lucy stiffens at this remark . ) You would n't care to have me read to you , would you ? ( He reaches into his pocket with a complacent smile and takes out some manuscript . ) I 've a couple of new poems here I 'm sure you have n't heard . I think they 're some of the best things I 've done  --  and it was your inspiration which gave birth to them all . Shall I read them ? p. 98 LUCY ( harshly ) No , please , not now ! ( Gabriel is dumbfounded . Lucy attempts a feeble smile . ) I 've such a headache I 'm afraid I could n't appreciate them tonight . ADAMS ( crestfallen  --  stuffs the poems back in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commencing to bore you . ( He waits for Lucy to deny this , but as she does not , he continues huffily ) In fact , I 'm quite sure they bore you . LUCY ( with weary vexation ) Please do n't misunderstand me . I meant nothing of the kind . ADAMS But there was something in your voice which  --  ( with hurt dignity ) I promise I wo n't bore you with them in future . LUCY ( coldly ) One does n't feel in the mood for poetry all the time . We ca n't all be poets . ADAMS ( with a superior air ) Decidedly not . LUCY ( meanly ) And some of your poems are  --  well  --  rather difficult to understand . ADAMS ( stung ) One must possess a fine soul to really appreciate any true poetry . p. 99 LUCY ( indignantly ) By which you mean I have n't ? ADAMS ( fuming ) I do n't mean anything . I was n't thinking of what I was saying . What difference does it make what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What time is it , I wonder ? They 'll be late . What can be keeping them up there so long ? ( Lucy makes no reply but sighs wearily . Gabriel walks up and down , frowning , muttering to himself , on the verge of an outburst . ) LUCY ( a trace of contempt in her voice ) You 're in a fine temper tonight . ADAMS ( roughly ) And why should n't I be ? LUCY Why should you be ? ADAMS ( drawing a deep breath ) Because  --  ( bursting forth ) I tell you I wo n't endure it any longer ! ( He bangs his fist on the table . ) LUCY ( contemptuously ) I do n't know what you 're talking about . ADAMS Oh yes , you do ! You are n't blind . You can see what 's in front of your eyes , ca n't you ? ( raging ) I 'll tell you what I mean . I mean this shameless affair between your husband and Leo which is going on openly right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put a stop to it , I will ! p. 100 LUCY ( freezingly ) I refuse to discuss the matter with you . ADAMS ( miserably ) Please do n't be angry with me , Lucy . Do n't take that attitude . Why should n't we discuss it with each other ? Noone else cares . ( flying off again ) Its an insult to our intelligence  --  the way they flaunt it before us . Its  --  its revolting ! We 've got to put a stop to it , that 's all ! LUCY Speak for yourself . ( her voice trembling ) For my part , Tom is free to do as he chooses . ADAMS Ha ! Just you try and see how far you 're free to do as you choose . You 'll soon have your eyes opened . LUCY You 're mistaken . We are both equally free . We signed a mutual agreement to that effect the night before we were married . ADAMS ( scornfully ) Pooh ! A lot of attention he 'd pay to that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( growing pale ) I do n't understand you . ADAMS You mean you wo n't understand me . It seems you prefer to be blind . LUCY ( indignantly ) I see a purely harmless flirtation , if that 's what you 're driving at . p. 101 ADAMS ( with a sneer ) Purely harmless ? Flirtation ? Well , you are a little innocent  --  if this is n't a pose of your 's . LUCY It is n't a pose ! Its what I believe in spite of all your nasty insinuations. ( her eyes filling ) I know Tom would tell me if  --  ( She catches herself in time to choke back a sob . ) ADAMS ( vehemently ) Its a shame , a beastly shame , for him to treat you this way . And Leo  --  she 's a little fool . But you must face the truth . Its decidedly serious , this affair of their 's , when you come to know the facts . LUCY ( stubbornly ) You must be mad . You 've no proof of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? How do you know ? You 've heard Leo rave about him as her cursed Great Blond Beast , have n't you ? Have you read Nietzsche ? Do you think Leo has any moral scrupples about anything ? Well , I do n't . And where have they gone on all these motor trips ? LUCY They always told us where they went . ADAMS And do you think they told us the truth ? Well , I am hardly as naive as that . LUCY Do you mean they lied ? Why do you say such a thing ? p. 102 ADAMS I know  --  and that 's enough . And how about all those teas alone together at the studio ? Do you think  --  Oh , but what 's the use ? If you wo n't see  --  LUCY ( hysterically ) Its a lie ! I wo n't listen to you ! ADAMS ( becoming more and more excited ) Its the truth ! And you 've got to realize it . Things ca n't go on in this way . I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to calm herself ) You wo n't stand for it . How about me ? ADAMS Its a thousand times easier for you . If he goes away you can always get a million more just like him ; while I  --  I ca n't live with any woman but Leo . She 's the only one who understands me , who can protect me from the others  --  and from myself . I tell you she 's necessary to me and I wo n't give her up to any Philistine like him . LUCY ( scornfully ) So this is your free comradship ! Has n't she a right to her own soul ? ADAMS No ! She 's a fool ! LUCY And if she loves someone else ? ADAMS She does n't . She only thinks she does . She 's a fool , I tell you ! ( after a pause ) You must break up this shameless intrigue . p. 103 LUCY I must ? ADAMS Yes , you must . Tell him I wo n't permit it . Tell him he must n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you possibly think I 'd degrade my pride to that extent ? ADAMS ( imploringly ) But you must save me ! I implore you , Lucy  --  for my sake ! I 'd be lost without her , the fool ! I could n't even find my toothbrush . I would n't even know when to get up . Besides , its nothing to you but your hurt pride because he 's your husband . You do n't really care anything about him . LUCY ( her eyes flashing ) How dare you say that ! ADAMS ( staring at her in amazement ) But  --  you love me , do n't you ? LUCY ( with supreme contempt ) Love you ? Do you think I 've lost my mind , you stupid little egotist ? ADAMS ( stands stunned for a moment ) But  --  your actions  --  the things you 've said  --  the things you 've let me believe  --  LUCY It was you who said you loved me . ADAMS But I say that to every woman . They know I 'm a poet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit make you think I took you seriously  --  had fallen in love with you ? Oh , this is too disgusting ! ADAMS Think of the confessions you made about your unhappy home life . You ca n't deny them . ( Lucy covers her face with her hands . ) What was I to believe , in heaven 's name ? ( She does n't answer or look up at him . ) But you 'll persuade him not to run away with Leo , wo n't you ? All the more reason to do so if you love him and do n't want to loose him . They 're liable to fly off tonight , I tell you . You have no idea what a fool Leo is . LUCY ( angrily ) Why do n't you speak to her ? ADAMS She 's such a fool ! She would n't listen to me . You 're the only hope I 've got . LUCY ( furiously ) And you ask me  --  to do this ! ADAMS You must ! There 's no other way . LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can dare to continue to insult me by suggesting such a thing ? ADAMS ( horrified ) Then you wo n't ? LUCY ( tearfully ) No ! No ! Let him go if he wants to . After what you 've told me I never want to see him again . And Leo has a right to go . She is n't married to you . p. 105 ADAMS ( frenziedly ) Did she tell you that ? Its a lie ! Its cowardly of her to deny it . LUCY ( looking at him in amazement ) You mean to say you are married ? ADAMS Of course we are ! We 've been married for two years . ( Lucy suddenly commences to laugh hysterically . Gabriel is irritated . ) What are you laughing at ? Its the truth . LUCY ( wildly ) Nothing ! Nothing ! ( She continues to laugh . ) ADAMS The only reason we concealed it was because we were taking a studio in Greenwich Village together when we moved to New York and we were afraid they 'd consider us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , in God 's name , do you laugh like that ? LUCY ( hysterically  --  between laughter and tears ) Go ! Go away ! I ca n't bear the sight of you . Please go ! I want to be alone . ( She makes a motion as if she were pushing him out of the room . ) ADAMS ( stands looking down at her for a moment  --  angrily ) Well  --  Oh , I 'll go crazy if you do n't stop that racket ! I must get out of this rabbit hutch. ( dramatically ) I must go out under the stars  --  to think ! I must have clean air to breathe ! ( He rushes out of the french windows in the rear to the garden . Lucy stops laughing and hides her face in her hands and sobs violently . After a moment Mrs. Ashleigh enters from the hallway . She comes quickly over to Lucy with an anxious expression. ) p. 106 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( putting her hand on Lucy 's shoulder ) Lucy ! Lucy ! What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more violently than ever . Mrs. Ashleigh sits down beside her on the lounge and puts her arm around her  --  soothingly ) There , there , dear . Have a good cry and get it over with . ( Lucy gradually grows calmer and finally lifts her tear-stained face to her mother 's . Mrs. Ashleigh kisses her and smiles . ) And now tell me the cause of this breakdown . LUCY ( rising from the lounge  --  a bit wildly ) Its nothing , Mother . I 'm tired and my nerves are worn out , I suppose . I have n't slept much the past week . MRS . ASHLEIGH You poor child ! LUCY And I 've a splitting headache ; and , oh , I 'm so sick of everything and everybody  --  I wish I were dead  --  or away off someplace alone ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( rebukingly ) Now , dear , you mus n't begin again in that foolish morbid strain . LUCY ( wildly ) Leave me alone ! I 'll be what I want to be in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I did n't mean that , Mother . I do n't know what I 'm saying or doing any more . Just let me alone . p. 107 MRS . ASHLEIGH But what happened ? Please tell me . Did Gabriel  --  LUCY ( irritably ) No ! No ! What has he to do with me ? MRS . ASHLEIGH It seems to me , my dear , he 's had a lot too much to do with you during the last month . LUCY Then all I can say is you must all have evil minds if you 're so suspicious of everything . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( indignantly ) Why , Lucy ! Do you realize what you 're saying ? LUCY He 's nothing to me , less than nothing . I do n't care if he lives or dies . He was amusing , that was all . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( insinuatingly ) Even his love-making , Lucy ? Was that amusing ? LUCY He 's a poet and he makes love to every woman . He told me so himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person who was made very unhappy by it  --  someone who loves you very much . LUCY ( sceptically ) Who ? You , Mother ? MRS . ASHLEIGH Indeed not . I gave you credit for too much good sense . Gabriel did n't bother me in the least . p. 108 LUCY ( a trace of defiance in her tone ) It could n't have been anyone else . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( gently ) I was speaking of  --  Tom . LUCY ( with a bitter laugh ) Tom ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Why do you adopt that tone ? Do n't you believe me ? Do you imagine its been pleasant for him to see you always with that crack-brained piece of conceit ? LUCY ( sarcastically ) He 's had plenty of consolation . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a smile ) You mean little Leo ? Do n't be silly , child . LUCY ( indignantly ) Silly ! If you knew  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH ( interrupting her  --  calmly ) I do know all about it , and its your own fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eternally mooning around together , did you think Leo and Tom would mope in separate corners until you were through amusing yourselves ? Remember the contract you drew up yourself  --  equal liberty of action . You 've no reason to complain , my dear . It serves you right . LUCY ( tensely ) And you can taunt me with it in this manner ? p. 109 MRS . ASHLEIGH Yes , I can . You deserve it . LUCY This shameless , disgusting liason ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with smiling reproof ) Those are strong words . I did n't think they were used any more outside of cheap melodrama . LUCY There are no words vile enough to describe what I feel . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( a trifle impatiently ) Come , Lucy ! Do n't overact your part of the abused wife . Vile ? Shameless , disgusting liason ? What extravagant terms to apply to an amusing flirtation . LUCY ( scornfully ) Flirtation ? Then you do n't know , after all . ( bitterly ) Or are you just trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't a word of truth left in the world . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( hurt ) Lucy ! Is that the way you speak to your mother ? ( Lucy does not answer and her face remains hard . Mrs. Ashleigh , plainly worried now , speaks with an attempt at calmness . ) Let 's get to the bottom of this . I do n't understand you . What is it I do n't know ? LUCY ( fiercely ) You do n't seem to know  --  or you could n't taunt me with it  --  that Leo is now Tom 's mistress ! p. 110 MRS . ASHLEIGH ( shocked and stunned , stares at the distracted Lucy in amazement for a moment ) Oh ! LUCY Now you know ! Now tell me its my fault  --  that it serves me right  --  that I brought it on myself ! MRS . ASHLEIGH Lucy ! What a wicked lie ! I 'm ashamed of you ! LUCY ( with a hard laugh ) Of course , I knew you would n't believe it . You think everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things in your world . ( She laughs mockingly . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH Lucy , has your mind become so distorted that you can believe an infamous falsehood like that ? LUCY I believe what I 've seen , what I 've suspected , what I now know to be the truth . Do you think I 'm blind , that everyone else is blind ? Where did they go on all their motor trips ? Do you think I can put any trust in the foolish tales they told us ? MRS . ASHLEIGH ( severely ) Stop , Lucy ! I refuse to listen to you when you accuse Tom of deliberately lieing to you , of deceiving you in the basest manner . LUCY ( wildly ) Of course he 's a liar ! They 're all liars . Everyone lies ! What about their teas together all alone in the studio ? And the times they were supposed to be at exhibitions of paintings , which I know he hates ? And the night he said he had to stay in town ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111 MRS . ASHLEIGH Are you out of your mind ? Do you realize what you 're saying ? LUCY ( frantically ) Her Great Blond Beast ! Well , she can have him ! ( She shudders . ) You must give him a message from me . I loathe him too much to speak to him . MRS . ASHLEIGH Lucy ! LUCY Tell him I 'll leave this house tomorrow  --  and I never want to see him again . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( resolving to be diplomatic  --  suppressing her grief and anxiety ) I will if you 'll stop talking wildly and listen to me for a moment . ( Lucy looks at her mother with stubborn defiance . ) Come , Lucy , please sit down . You 're trembling all over . I 'm afraid you 'll be ill . Sit down and rest for a while and try to calm yourself . ( Lucy reluctantly sits down on the lounge beside her mother . ) What a state you 've worked yourself into ! And all for nothing . There . Sit still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn you in advance , Mother , that nothing you can say will make me change the resolve I 've taken . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( gently ) You may do whatever you think is best , dear . You can come home tomorrow and stay with your father and me for a while if you like . The change may do you good . p. 112 LUCY ( harshly ) Come home ? And be driven insane by father 's eternal nagging and questioning ? And even you  --  ( she chokes back her tears ) are against me . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( tenderly ) You know that is n't so , dear . LUCY I wo n't go home . I do n't need any help or sympathy . I 'll go out alone and live my own life as I choose . MRS . ASHLEIGH As you like , dear . No one is objecting to that . And now listen and I 'll explain all this misunderstanding away . ( coaxingly ) Will you believe your mother when she swears to you that this apparent affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 's  --  Tom 's and mine  --  to make you jealous , to rid you of the nasty influence of that detestable Gabriel person ? ( But Lucy has gone too far to believe anything but her own suspicions . She stares at her mother with wild-eyed scorn . ) LUCY Stop , Mother ! I ca n't bear it ! Do you expect me to believe that silly cock-and-bull story  --  that you and Tom suspected me of something terrible and deliberately planned to do your best to make me unhappy and miserable ? Do you think I 'm a child to be put off with a silly tale like that ? MRS . ASHLEIGH But , my dear , you have n't heard  --  p. 113 LUCY ( weeping hysterically and clapping her hands over her ears ) I do n't want to hear any more ! Let me alone ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( seeing the futility of argument ) All right , dear . I wo n't mention the matter again . ( Lucy gradually grows calmer . ) And now do n't you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be sick tomorrow if you do n't . LUCY ( hoarsely ) Upstairs ? With her ? I 'd die first ! MRS . ASHLEIGH ( indicating the room on right ) Then go in there and lie down on the couch . The darkness will rest your eyes . ( Tom enters from the hallway . He is in evening clothes but his tie has not yet been tied . Lucy gets up abruptly and , without looking at him , walks into the next room pulling the portieres shut behind her . Tom looks after her gloomily . ) DRAYTON ( savagely ) Did you see that ? She never even looked at me . MRS . ASHLEIGH You must n't mind her tonight , Tom . She 's dreadfully upset . DRAYTON It is n't only tonight . Its every night . ( throwing himself into a chair ) And I 'm sick of it . p. 114 MRS . ASHLEIGH Ssshh ! She might hear you . DRAYTON ( grumpily ) I do n't care if she does . Its about time she knew the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom ! DRAYTON ( morosely ) I 'm tired of being treated like a dog . And that fine plan of your 's seems to be messing things up worse than ever . This Leo is getting on my nerves . She 's too  --  too exuberant . I 'm not in love with the idea of this theatre party . I 've a good notion to chuck it . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( thoughtfully ) Perhaps you 'd better . DRAYTON ( defiantly ) No , I 'll be darned if I will . Lucy 'd only think I wanted to spy on her and that little doggie of her 's . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( with a sigh of comic despair ) I see I 've two big children who need spanking instead of one . DRAYTON Its nothing to laugh at . ( getting up from his chair ) I 've half a mind to go in and have it out with her right now . MRS . ASHLEIGH ( grasping his arm ) No , Tom . Please do n't  --  now . p. 115 DRAYTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's in a dreadful state of nerves . She 'd only become hysterical if you started to quarrell with her . Wait until you come back . I 'll see to it she gets rested up before then , and willing to listen to reason . DRAYTON ( with real anxiety ) She is n't really ill , is she ? MRS . ASHLEIGH No  --  ( in almost a whisper ) Someone 's been telling her some nasty tales and  --  DRAYTON About me ? ( Mrs. Ashleigh nods and puts her finger to her lips . Tom clenches his fists . ) I 'll bet it was that  --  MRS . ASHLEIGH ( hurriedly interrupting him ) No , no . I 'll explain it all to you later . Not here . I ca n't now . She might hear me. ( aloud ) Do you want me to tie that tie for you , you big baby , you ? DRAYTON ( ruefully ) I can tie it all right but I left it for Lucy  --  she usually  --  I thought I 'd have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor boy . ( Leo comes tripping in from the hallway . She is dressed in a white evening gown of Lucy 's which shows every evidence of having been shortened , tightened , and otherwise made over with the aid of pins and basting thread . However Leo has an air which carries it off . She is bubbling over with delight at the strangeness of her make-up. ) p. 116 BARNES Now I ask you , am n't I the ultimate gasp ! My dear , if I dare to heave a sigh I 'll be in the nude . That will give the audience a moment . ( to Tom ) You do n't mind , do you ? DRAYTON ( sullenly ) You can go the limit as far as I 'm concerned . MRS . ASHLEIGH You look quite bewitching in that dress , does n't she , Tom ? ( The portieres on the right are parted a trifle and Lucy 's pale face is seen for a moment and hurriedly withdrawn . ) White is your color . BARNES ( making a mocking grimace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit . ( seeing Tom 's tie ) I thought you were all ready . I say , look at your tie . You ca n't go with me like that . Here . Let me fix it . Bend down , my Beast  --  or page me a stepladder . ( She ties the tie for him and slaps his face roguishly . ) There . Now are n't we beautiful ? DRAYTON ( looking at his watch  --  sulkily ) You 've got three minutes to put on the rest of your armor if there 's anything missing . BARNES I 'm all ready , I think , excepting my coat . ( suddenly feeling her face with her hands ) Oh , I 've forgotten my beauty spots . I must have beauty spots ! They 'll help cover my nakedness . ( She lifts up her skirts and skips out of the room , shouting back over her shoulder ) I 'll be right down . p. 117 DRAYTON ( suddenly beginning to feel in his pockets ) Dammit , here I am starting out without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in . ( He starts for the doorway , left . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH Just a minute . I 'm going up to phone to Mr. Ashleigh. ( in a low voice ) And I 've a few words to say to you before you go . DRAYTON All right , Mother . MRS . ASHLEIGH Not here . ( She casts a significant glance at the room on the right . ) We 'll turn these lights out so they wo n't disturb her . I hope she 's asleep , poor dear . ( She switches off the lights . The room is in darkness except for the light from the hallway . She and Tom go out , left , and can be heard conversing as they go up the stairs . The portieres on the right are carefully parted and Lucy enters . She stops and stands motionless for a moment or so in an attitude of strained attention , listening for some sound from the hallway . Hearing nothing , she goes to the table and throws herself into a chair beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs softly . Making an effort to control herself , she dries her eyes hastily with her handkerchief , gets up , and walks nervously from the table to the windows in rear and back again . ( She stands by the table for a minute staring straight before her , her expression betraying the somber thoughts which are passing through her brain . Then , with a quick movement of decision , she pulls out a drawer in the table and slowly takes a revolver from it . She looks at it with frightened eyes and puts it down on the table with a convulsive shudder . ( There is the sound of a motor from the roadway outside . Lucy gives a nervous start and looks quickly around the room as if searching for a hiding place . She finally hurries back into the room on the right , pulling the portieres together behind her . The noise of the motor grows steadily louder . At last the machine stops in front of the main entrance to the house , and only the soft purr of the engine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the french windows . ( Someone is heard walking along the hallway to the front door . The outer door is heard opening . There is the brief murmur of the voices of the chauffer and the maid . Then the door is closed again . Tom 's voice is heard calling from the top of the stairs : " Is that the car ? " The maid 's voice answers : " Yes , sir " , and she is heard returning to the back of the house . ( Tom and Leonora are heard conversing as they come down the stairs in the hall . Leonora 's infectious laughter rings out . Tom appears in evening dress in the doorway left , and looks toward the door on the right . He calls softly : " Lucy " ; then takes a step forward into the room . Leonora calls to him from the hall : " We 'll be late . " Tom makes a movement of impatience and raises his voice : " Lucy ! " ) p. 118 BARNES ( from the hallway ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on . ( Tom allows a muttered " damn " to escape him , and walks back into the hall . ( The outer door is again opened and shut . Lucy comes out from behind the portieres and goes quickly to the table . The sound of the limousine door being slammed is heard . A wild look of determination comes into Lucy 's face and she snatches the revolver from the table . The noise of the motor increases in volume . The curtain starts to fall . The car outside starts . Closing her eyes tightly , Lucy lifts the revolver to her temple . The curtain hides her from view . As it touches the stage there is the sound of a shot. ) @x After an interval of three minutes during which the theatre remains darkened , the curtain is again raised . The second that the curtain starts to rise the shot is again heard . As the curtain goes up Lucy is discovered standing in an attitude of abject terror , the revolver still clutched in her trembling hand . Suddenly it drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . She lies there motionless . The outside door is opened and shut and Tom comes into the room from the hallway followed by Leonora . He switches on the lights . Both of them utter exclamations of terror as they see the prostrate form of Lucy almost at their feet . DRAYTON Good God ! BARNES Heavens ! She must have fainted . ( She sinks to her knees beside Lucy and starts rubbing one of her wrists . Gabriel appears outside the french windows . He takes one look at the scene inside and then hurries into the room . ) DRAYTON ( He is looking at the revolver with an expression of dazed stupefaction . ) No . ( He picks the revolver from the floor . ) Look ! ( Mrs. Ashleigh enters from the left . ) MRS . ASHLEIGH ( rushing over to her daughter ) p. 120 Lucy ! ( She leans down and puts her hand over Lucy 's heart . ) DRAYTON ( dazedly ) She shot herself ! ADAMS Shot herself ! ( He stands petrified . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she must have missed . She has no wound anywhere . ( peremptorily ) You , Gab , do n't stand there like an idiot . Get some water . ( Gabriel hurries out . ) DRAYTON ( opens up the revolver and stares at it stupidly  --  a sheepish relieved grin spreads slowly over his face . He chuckles . ) Hmm ! BARNES ( looking up at him ) Well ? DRAYTON I forgot  --  its never been loaded . ( Gabriel comes back with a glass of water . Leo dips her handkerchief in it and dabs it on Lucy 's face . Lucy gasps and opens her eyes ; then struggles hastily to her feet . She backs away from Tom to the right of room . Gabriel follows her . ) ADAMS ( hurriedly  --  in a low voice ) You were n't going to do  --  that  --  on account of what I said this evening  --  about them , were you ? ( Lucy nods slowly . Gabriel goes on earnestly. ) p. 121 Do n't be a fool and take me seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of truth in what I said . Perfectly harmless . Just my infernal jealous imagination . Believe that ! ( He comes back beside Leo . ) DRAYTON ( receiving a nudge from Mrs. Ashleigh , goes to Lucy  --  pleadingly ) Lucy . ( She throws herself into his arms and sobs softly . He pats her shoulder and soothes her . ) There ! There ! Its all over , little sweetheart . BARNES ( throwing her arms around Gabriel ) Kiss me , Gab . Its being done just now . ADAMS ( very dignified ) You are a fool ! ( But he kisses her . ) LUCY ( suddenly breaking away from Tom  --  in tones of frightened wonder ) But the shot  --  the shot ! ALL ( puzzled ) Shot ? What shot ? ( The chauffer comes into the room carrying a removable wheel with a flat tire . ) DRAYTON 'S CHAUFFER Pardon , sir . ( They all turn and look at him . ) It is n't bad , sir . ( He points to the tire . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There is a roar of laughter as the realization of what the shot really was comes to them . The chauffer looks from one to the other of them with open mouth , as if he thought they were crazy. ) p. 122 BARNES ( turning to Lucy and pointing dramatically to the tire )
