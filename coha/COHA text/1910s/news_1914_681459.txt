txt The situation respecting the attitude of Great Britain toward American shipments of cotton , oil , and copper and the status of contraband in general was distinctly cleared today when Sir Cecil SpringRice. the British Ambassador to the United States , delivered to Counselor Robert Lansing , the Acting Secretary of State , two notes dealing definitely with the matter . The first of these notes dealt with cotton and confirmed officially the fact that American cotton would not be treated as contraband and would have the freedom of the seas so far as Great Britaill was concerned . The other note dealt with the reasons for the detention of the Standard 011 tank-ship John D. Rockefeller , which has since been released , and emphasized that Great Britain was standing by the traditional American doctrine of ultimate destination , rather than the immediate destination of goods , in determining whether they were to be treated as contraband The two notes from the British Ambassador and an announcement . from London that the American tank ship Brindilla had been rrcered released at Halifax . N. S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , similarly would be permitted to continue her voyage , cleared up every pending question on the subject or : snipping which had arisen between the United States and Great Britain . After the position of Great Britain respecting cotton had been cleared through the assurances given in the first of these notes , the fact that cotton was to retain its immemorial freedurn of the seas was at once officially communicated to the Treasury and other Departments of the Government . so that it might have the widest publicity . This was not because the State Department had any doubt from the beginning that eeeton must be treated as non-contra-band. but because there had been so much doubt in American shipping and commercial circles regarding the atti'tude of Great Britain toward this great staple crop upon the marketing of which the American balance of trade was so vitally dependent Clears " Marine Risks . After the Secretary of the Treasury was notified of the delivery of the British Ambassador 's notes to the State Department Mr. issued the following statement : It has been announced by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government that cotton will not be treated by Great Britain as contraband , and that it is on the free list and will so remain . There is no reason , therefore , why underwriters who cover marine and war risk insurance should now hesitate to issue policies on cotton in neutral bottoms , so far as Great Britain Is concerned . The Bureau of War Risk insurance of the Treasury Department is writing insurance freely on cotton when carried In American vessets . The note from the British Ambassador regarding cotton shows that Sir Cecil Spring-Rice cabled last Friday to his Government inquiring what was its view with regard to cotton and whether it considered cotton to be contraband . This request , it was learned at the State Department today , was not made because the American Government entertained any doubt on the matter . The American State Department did not understand how Great Britain could take any position that would rob cotton of its right to be treated as non-contraband . But there had been interference with American vessels conveying cotton to Europe , and this inspired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British determination to treat cotton as contraband It has since developed that these stoppages were not due to cotton being treated as contraband , but for other , reasons . The steamer Camperdown is now being held at Stornoway , Scotland , not by the act of the British Government , but of the Scotch owners of the ship , who were involved in some differences with the American charterers of the vessel . As a result of developments in the last twenty-four hours , it is absolutely plain that all cotton shipped in American bottoms , as well as in neutral bottoms  --  in fact , in any vessels not flying the flags of Germany and Austria  --  will be safe from molestation by the British Government , so far as the cotton is concerned There will be no ' interference with cotton as such , al'though if cotton is shipped in a vessel carrying goods that are contraband ; and the ultimate enemy destination of these igoods is plain , it may be necessary to stop the ship on account of the other products . This , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its journey . Tangle Over Exchange . One difficulty , it was learned authoritatively tonight , respecting cotton ' shipments has grown out of international exchange complications . British ships in American ports have been mixsous to take cotton to Great Britain . but they were unable to obtain cargoes because American cotton men or bankers were unwilling to allow their goods to go abroad on account of the uncertainty of payment or international exchange difficulties . On the authority of B. B. Blackett , of the British Treasury , who came to Washington with Sir George Paish , Special Adviser to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , it can be stated that part of this difficulty has been due to ignorance of the fact that the British Government has guaranteed all approved produce bills accepted in London . The British Government , in conjunction with the Bank of England and the joint stock banks , have agreed to meet at maturity all approved bills drawn upon London , whether premoratorium or post : moratorium . The guarantee of the British Government with respect to bills of both periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Government has also permitted the accepting houses to give a prior charge on their assets to post moratorium bills over any liabilities on ' account of pre- " moratorium bills and has arranged for the Bank of England . with the Government guarantee , for an extension of loans made to meet premoratorium bills until the end of the war . Similar arrangements are under discussion with respect to the mercantile export houses which have uncollected debts due them from both enemy and other countries with respect to goods of sales made before the war . Cotton Not Contraband . The communication delivered by Ambassador Spring-Rice to Acting Secretary Lansing , officially confirming the fact that cotton is on the free list and will remain there so far as Great Britain is concerned , read as follows : British Embassy , Washington , Oct. 20 , 1914 . Dear Mr. Counselor : In compliance with your request . I telegraphed on the 23d inst. to my Government to inquire what was their view with regard to cotton and whether or not they considered it to be contraband . You addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doubts in certain quarters in this country as to the attitude of my Government . Last night I received a reply from Sir Edward Grey , in which he authorizes me to give the assurance that cotton will not be seized . He points out that cotton has not been put in any of our lists of contraband , and , as your department must be aware from the draft proclamation now in your possession , it is not proposed to include it in our new list of contraband . It is , therefore , as far as Great Britain is concerned , in the free list , and will remain there . I am , dear Mr. Counselor , yours sincerely . CECIL SPRING-RICE . The Rockefeller Case . The other communication delivered by the British Ambassador to Acting Secretary Lansing with reference to the Rockefeller case and the general attitude of Great Britain on the contraband question . confirming statements previously made in Tun New YORK Trams to the effect that the British Government is adhering to the American doctrine of " ultimate destination . " followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions of the United States Supreme Court , reads as follows : Dear Mr. Counselor : With reference to the case of the Rockefeller I think it would be opportune were I to make some remarks on the general question of contraband and the attitude of the British Government . You are doubtless aware that in the last few weeks there has been a marked increase of the export of certain articles , as compared with previous years , to those neutral countries which are in direct communication with the belligerent nations . I will choose , among many , the single instance of mineral oils , and the returns for the month of September . Whereas the value of United States exports of the principal articles for that month as compared with September , 1913 , have decreased from $107,000,000 to $70.000,000 , or 30 per cent. , the export of gasoline naphtha , &c.,; has increased from 20.000,000 to 23,000.000 gallons . or 15 per cent , and of fuel - oil from 36.000,000 to 58,000,000 gallons , or 61 per cent . I need not point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of the motor , the airship , and the submarine , all of which are consumers of mineral oil . I. may add that there is reason to behove that mineral oil in all its forms may be used for these purposes . A large proportion of the exports of this country has been consigned to neutral ports , and , according to evidence in our possession , has been transmitted from them to a belligerent country . As you are aware , the Supreme Court of the United States in lag-3 considered vessels as carrying contraband , although sailing from one neutral port to another , if the goods concerned were destined to be transported by land or sea from the neutral port of landing into enemy territory . It then decided that the character of the goods is determined by their ultimate and not their immediate destination , and this doctrine was at the time acquiesced by Great Britain , though her own trade was the chief sufferer . On the other hand , the neutral countries concerned , who are anxious in the interests of their neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either belligerent . are now making arrangements which will give sure guarantees that articles which may be used in war shall not be reexported . In a word , , they are anxious to prevent their ports from becoming the backdoor of either belligerent . When these arrangements are complete it . is to be confidently hoped that trade between neutrals will be subject to little or no hindrance . But it is , of course , essential in the interests of free and undisturbed trade between neutrals that every security possible should be provided in order to enable belligerents to form a speedy and sure judgment as to the neutral destination of goods which may be used for peaceful or warlike purposes . In the case of the Rockefeller , which was bound for a port in the near neighborhood of the chief naval port of a belligerent , the oil she carried was consigned to order , and there was therefore no guarantee that it would not be forwarded to the enemy . She was accordingly detained until proof was afforded of the neutral destination of her cargo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be hoped that for the future adequate precautions will be taken in order to Chow the real destination of goods consigned to neutrals , which , if trans-shipped to a belligerent , might be used for belligerent purposes . I may observe in conclusion that . although the British Government have detained cargoes of contraband in order to make sure that they are really intended for neutral countries , and have retained some cargoes , such as copper , destined for Krupp 's ammunition works , they have not yet taken a single cargo without paying for it , and have allowed every cargo really destined for neutral countries to proceed to its destination . I am , dear Mr. Counselor , yours sincerely . CECIL SPRING-RICE . Big Belief to Planters . The announcement of the British Government 's policy in regard to cotton was received with distinct satisfaction by those engaged in efforts to evolve a plan to relieve the plight of the cotton producer in the South and provide a market for his crop . The immediate effect will be , it is said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for marine underwriters to issue policies on cotton in neutral bottoms freely  --  precisely as they would in times of peace . The hesitation , heretofore , in accepting such risks In marine insurance has been a serious impediment to the market , and in the opening weeks of the war it absolutely barred all buying for export . The Bureau of War Risks has been writing insurance on cotton in American bottoms , but there has been little insurance of such cargoes outside Government auspices . The importance of the decision regarding cotton may be understood when the details of the shipments of raw cotton to Europe last year are examined . In the twelve months ending with June 30 , 1014. our exports of raw cotton to the five belligerent countries , Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , and Russia was in the total 4,389,694 bales , the total value of which was $282,205,174 . Our entire export last year was 9,105,000 bales with a value of $610,475.000 . In detail exports of cotton to the belligerent countries last year were as follows : Germany 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria 101.780 6,739,000 Russia 94.726 6.482,000 Market Still Crippled . It is too soon and there is no data on which to base estimates to determine the actual commercial effect of the British announcement . It is safe to say that there will be nothing like the normal movement of cotton to any of the belligerents . Even Germany could not be expected to buy our cotton this year in anything like the amount of an ordinary year . It is to be remembered that taking account of England nearly two-thirds of the spindles of the world are in the countries that are at war . This means that if the demand continues in anything like normal degree there must be some market for cotton in the belligerent countries . Of the 50,000,000 spindles in - countries that are at peace 32 , - 000,000 are in the United States , and here cotton manufacturing is stagnant . Japan is working her mills day and night and the Indian mills are under full production . These two countries have 8,000,000 spindles , so that there are only 10,000,000 spindles in other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the export of manufactured goods from the United States , can supply the needs of the densely populated countries of Europe is improbable . Therefore , a fairly good market for the raw staple may be expected to develop in Germany and France . Just how large this demand will be no experts here were willing to say today . The prospect they regard as wholly problematical . The tide of the war and the demand for men in the armies will have much to do with the situation . But every one was willing to say that Germany would be . buying cotton because her industrial population had not been so closely draft . e for war purposes as had those of the other countries on the Continent . POOL NEEDS $42,500,000 . Reserve Board to Raise Remainder of $zoo , 000,000 Cotton Fund . ? The cotton pool plan having been approved by the Federal Reserve Board , the next step will be the raising of the remainder of the $100,000,000 to be put up by the banks outside of the cotton States . New York has pledged $50.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pool originated , already had raised $7,500.000 . The other $42,500,000 is to be raised by the members of the Federal Reserve Board , not acting officially , but - as a Central Committee of the pool . The position of the New York banks throughout has been that they would be participants , but not leaders , in organizing the fund . It was represented to them that a crisis existed in the South , but they felt that they had not sufficient knowledge of the cotton situation or of the cotton business to determine whether this was so or not . They left it to the Federal Reserve Board or its members to decide whether a crisis ' existed . If so , they were willing to advance $50,000 , - 000 as requested . They . would not , however , undertake the management of the pool , and in their conferences in Washington last Saturday , the representatives of the New York banks made it clear that , having done this , they had done all that could be required of them . In agreeing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subscriptions . One thing they wanted to make sure of was that participation in the pool was not contrary to the Sherman law or the National Bank act . That was an additional reason for stipulating that the pool he managed by the members of the Federal Reserve Board , and they insisted further that the subscriptions should be contingent on an opinion from the Solicitor General of the Treasury Department that they . could legally be made . This opinion had not been rendered , so far as they knew yesterday . but they understood that it would he . They also understood yesterday that the members of the Federal Reserve Board had approached the banks of Philadelphia , Boston . and other cities on the subject of subscriptions . Share of Southern Banks . If the $100,000,000 from the non-cotton States is raised , as they expect it will he , the banks in the cotton States will have to nut up $33,533.333 in order to utilize it . The New York banks maintained that if they made the advances for the benefit of the cotton people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they be protected against loss . They arranged , therefore , that the principal risk should be taken by the Southern banks by which the loans are made . The way the plan will work is this : If a Southern bank wants to loan $100 , - 000 on cotton , it will first have to put into the pool one-quarter of the amount , or $25,000 . It can then obtain the remainder , or $75,000 from the pool . If the crisis described actually exists , the Southern banks will put up one-third as much as the $100,000,000 raised outside the cotton States . in order to draw out of the pool the entire 5100.000.000 . It is further provided that for their $100,000,000 the Northern and Western banks shall receive Class A certificates of participation , while the Southern banks , as they put their money into the pool in order to draw out three times as much more , will receive Class B certificates of participation . Whenever enough loans have been paid to warrant a distribution , the percentage repaid to Class B participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , if the distribution amounts to 10 per cent . on Class A certificates , 5 per cent . will be paid on the others . After the point is reached where both classes have the same interest in the pool , equal distributions will be made to both classes . The result of this arrangement , It Is predicted , will be to make the Southern banks cautious about making doubtful loans . In each case the Southern bank will have its own money in the loan to the extent of 25 per cent. , and in case of loss , the loss will fall on the Southern banks . Guarantee by Borrowers . The plan also includes a guarantee fund to be put up by the borrowers . This has nothing to do with the rate of interest , which has been reduced at the instance of the New York banks froin per cent. , as proposed In the Wade plan . to 6 per cent . The borrowers will be required , however , to advance 3 per cent . of the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be paid the expenses of the pool and any losses sustained . The balance willI be repaid to the borrowers . While the money is thus tied up , it will be invested in Class A certificates , bearing 6 per cent . interest , which will go to the borrowers . When the pool has been completed by the Central Committee , consisting of the members of the Federal Reserve Board , its operations will be conducted by a Committee on Administration , of which it is proposed that W. P. 0 . Harding shall be Chairman and Paul M. Warburg a member . Both of these are members of the Federal Reserve Board . The New York subscribers will he represented by Albert H. Wiggin and James S. Alexander , Presidents of the Chase National and the National Bank of Commerce , and each of the other subscribing cities will have a representative . Under the supervision of this committee , there will be State committees and local committees In the South . and no loans will be made by the pool unless approved by the local committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Central or the Administrative Committee . The loans will be made up to six cents a pound on ' the cotton involved. - JUMP IN COTTON EXPORTS . Germany Said to be Buying  --  Drop in Sterling Exchange . Bills drawn against exports of cotton appeared in large supply in the foreign exchange market yesterday , and were of first importance , according to exchange brokers , in bringing about another abrupt fall of rates . Demand sterling showed a net loss of 2 cents to the pound at the close of business , and cable trans- ' : fers receded about as much . Last quotations were $4.90 for sight bills and $4.901/2 for cables , prices that were some- ; what above the minimum of the day , but were themselves closer to the normal level of exchange on London than rates had previously been on any day since July 29 . Buying for cash at the direction of ; the German Government was reported as the day 's feature of operations in the " spot " cotton market . German buyers have been placing contracts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of the British authorities not to interfere with shipments of cotton to any of the European countries evidently lent a spur to purchases yesterday . It was said in shipping circles that several cargoes of the staple would leave Southern ports this week for Italy and Denmark ostensibly , although the cotton was intended for transshipment to German mills . Cotton is quoted in Hamburg at 17 cents a pound , and at this figure a comfortable profit I awaits the buyer who gets his supplies ; on this side at 7 cents or under . As much of the cotton taken for Germany has been paid for out of funds arranged for here , a smaller proportion of bills representing purchases have come to this market than in case of transactions involved in the course of exports to England and France . There was enough exchange in reichsmarks in sight yesterday , however , to force a decline from 89% , Saturday 's closing figure , to 88741 . In addition to a few cotton bills a substantial amount of exchange derived from sales to Germany of other commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates strengthened the impression of bankers that progress downward to a normal level would be swift as soon as cotton began to move more freely , and shipments of gold to Canada had offset our most pressing obligations to Europe . One foreign exchange house reported that it had discounted $600,000 worth of cotton bills during the day , and that there were indications of a large increase of offerings during the week .
