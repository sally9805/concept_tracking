txt A comparative peacefulness settled over the hotel world yesterday , although it was not easy to determine whether this was due to a regard for the day or to the fact that among the hotels and restaurants of the city not yet afflicted with a walk-out few were ripe for that expression of militant unionism . When night fell the union delegates struck blows at a few places , just to keep their hand in . The most notable of these was , the walk-out that interrupted the Sunday dinner of 1,500 people gathered at Pabst Harlem , in West 125th Street When Organizer Eltser finished with his strikers ' meeting on Saturday night , his last and most fearful threat was breathed in the direction of Coney Island . That haven of the day off would feel the heavy hand of the union on Sunday . Its day of days , said Mr. Eltser . And Coney Island was frightened . The day came warm and inviting . Ail New York seemed bent on going to the shore , and last evening it was estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amuse . The nervousness of the restaurant proprietors grew as the day advanced , and it oecame evident that the tables would be jammed . It was known that delegates had been at work at Coney , and it was feared that many of the striking waiters had combined duty with pleasure by visiting the resort in the interest of the cause . The police were asked to keep a close lookout , and strikebreakers were stored away for emergency use . There was no need of them . There was almost no trouble . When dinner time came some fifty of the extra waiters at Reisenweber 's , in Ocean Boulevard , decided that the time had come to ask for a raise of re ) cents . Manager Fischer was conciliatory , met their demands , and in the end fleisenweber 's lost only ten men and were in nowise inconvenienced . The other restaurants were unscathed . Hotel Men Feeling Better . The placidity of yesterday was due in no email part to the fact that in the minds of many of the hotel proprietors there wa.e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were concerned . This sentiment was expressed with remarkable unanimity by Mr. Reed of the Park Avenue . Mr. Boldt of the Waldorf-Astoria , Mr. Muschenheim of the Astor , Mr. Taupier of Delmonico 's , Mr. Haan of the St. Regis , and Mr. Sterry of the Plaza , and by many of the proprietors of the smaller hotels that have been stricken in the waiters ' war . From the first the hotel men have declared that they would never give in and teat they would rather close their hotels than recognize the union , but yesterday many of them spoke as though they had no reason an earth to anticipate that they would have to take such extreme measures . They have survived the walkouts even better than they expected to , and in proof of the allayed alarms Mr. Reed went out on a long automobile drive yesterday , Mr. Muschenheim forsook the Astor fur his Summer home , and Mr. Boidt announced that he had turned the whole question of the strike over to his head waiter to adjust . In almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were moving with surprising ease yesterday . Here and there it has closed an establishment , In more places a dining room has been dropped out of the regular Summer service , and in still more hotels a few tables have been withdrawn , and the efforts of the staff - concentrated . But In a surprising number of the afflicted restaurants the management is proceeding quite as though nothing had happened . " I tell you , the strike is broken , " said Mr. Reed , when he returned to the Park Avenue last evening . " The outcome of the attempt to unionize the hotels has Justified the position which the members of the Hotel Men 's Association took at the outset . Mr. Boldt said then that there would be two men found for every post left vacant by walkouts . Everybody laughed at his optimism , but it has since been established that he was exactly right . The strike has developed the fact that New York is simply filled with floating waiters , and most of us have had no trouble in filling our restaurants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that now that the time had come for counting noses the Astor had been so forehanded as to he overstocked with help . At Delmonico 's Mr. Taupier commented on the surprisingly good quality of the men that he had been able to find to fill the vacancies caused by desertion at his place . Not Beckoning the Strikers . Another indication of a growing confidence on the part of the hotel men was the changed attitude on the question of taking back the old waiters if they should have a change of heart in the course of a few days . At first most of the hotel managers said that they would reinstate their men when they got over their " folly , " but the tone became a trifle less cordial yeetetday . The sltkAle.bres , kets have begun to ask what is to be their reward if the strikers suddenly capitulate . They ask whether they are to be turned out of their newly acquired positions . And most of the managers said yesterday that every strikebreaker who in these troublous days proved himself a good waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old men would have to file applications for work precisely as though they had never worked under their old managers . Sotto voce directions have been given to some of the head waiters to use their own judgment in the question of reinstatement , for there have been scattering efforts or some of the men to get back , and not a few have come around and asked that posts be held for them to take as soon as the strike is over and they dare nut in an appearance at the hotel again . Mr. Reed said that this Imovement to return is assuming large proportions . But there is to be no whole-1 sale reinstatement , he said . The manageis will pick and choose and many of those h have gone on strike will never regain their positions . The hotels have heard from more employment agencies than they ever dreamed were in existence , and some of them have been startled by the offer of a ' crew of twenty-five men for 88 a day for each man . Co-operation has come from some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as far west as Detroit , Managers there with good staffs were glad to offer sections of them at the beginning of the dull season . Help From Ocean Liners . The hotel men have also been meeting the incoming ocean liners , seeking to sign up the saloon waiters , known on the high seas as " wingers . " This activity was very annoying to the union leaders , who vowed that the immigration laws were being violated and that the hand of the Government at Washington . would he raised against the hotel managers , but on the other hand it was pointed out that the men were in this port and had l a perfect right to take neW positions here if they chose to do so . ' The union men , on the other band , voiced no qualms as to the success of their movement , even if they felt any . They said that the union treasury was comfortably filled with $8,000 and that its power to tie up the hotel business was yet to be felt to the full . Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or words to that effect , and that Brooklyn , Jersey City , and the shore resorts were rapidly being organized by innumerable volunteer delegates . And let me tell you , " he said , " that the threat to tie up the Childs restaurants is no idle one. , ' Rumor had it last evening that this noon would see a renewed activity in the walking-out line . The Astor House , haan 's , and other downtown places , so report said , would be nipped at the noon hour , and Big Business will go hungry . The question as to the hunger of the waiters themselves came up yesterday In preliminary negotiations for the opening of a special restaurant where the strikers may be fed . A house in West Fprtysecond Street had been practically decided upon , the leaders said , and what with the idle tales at their command they rather expect to serve very enviable repasts . " You see , we know more about this business than Oscar himself . " said a son of generations of Swiss hotel keepers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in Fifth Avenue is coming in no small degree from the men who have now been on strike for many days more than they had planned to be when the walkouts were first proposed . Some of the men who started the procession at the Hotel Belmont have already had recourse to the union treasury , and it is expected that many applications for funds will be made in the course of to-day and to-morrow . Four More Walkouts . The four places In Manhattan that experienced the walkout last evening were the New Weston , at . Forty-ninth Street and Madison Avenue ; ' the Hotel Empire , at Sixty-third Street and Broadway ; the Hotel Navarre , in Seventh Avenue , and Pabst ' , Harlem . Earlier in the day the Manhattan Square lost the larger part of the force that weathered the walkout the night before , and early yesterday morning about closing time the forty waiters at Joel 's , in Forty-first Street , bade farewell to that establishment , some of the older men with tears in their eyes . It was at 6:45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two delegates who wanted him to sign a contract on the spot . The proprietor was away and the manager begged for time . Telephone instructions from union headquarters forbade this and then the manager tried the effect of a moving speech , similar to the ones that have been delivered in'many hotels during the last week . After all was said and done , sixty-five of the seventy-five waiters put on their hats and departed . The doors were closed against further trade last evening , despite the generous offers of assistance at serving on the part of the ' cabaret dancers . A similar walkout was feared and perhaps forestalled by the manager of the West End Restaurant in West 120th Street . Hearing that the / strike had invaded Harlem he discharged six waiters who had been grumbling audibly all evening . Manager Sandborn at the New Weston had more than one talk with his waiters yesterday , but when the letter came from , union headquarters eighteen out of his twenty-three waiters left him , and six went from among his ' kitchen help . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed . He had been caught I in the same way the evening before at Delmonico 's . The Empire lost fifteen of its waiters and the Navarre lost only five . The slender proportions of this last walkout caused the head waiter to shake with laughter . They will-never win this strike , believe me , " he said . " I have been- in this businese twenty-five years , and I know that they have n't a chance . I remember three other strikes . I remember twenty years ago when 15,000 waiters walked down Fifth Avenue . and there was a great to-do , but when it was all over they were worse off than before . I tell you that waiters and cooks , jealous of each other ' es they always are , will never stick together in this works . " Of the efforts to replace the strikers with waiters of another sort . Louis Bustanoby is most delighted with the course I he has chosen for the Taverns Louts , in the , Flatiron In response to his advertisements more ' than 100 girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant . He strove manfully to confine his selections to applicants who had already had experience as waitresses , and he did select forty-nine of these . He also selected five.because it seemed to him that they would improve the appearance of the Taverne . Chorus girls out of work were among his most eager applicants . The girls are to wear trim black gowns to their shoe tops , with little white frilled aprons . ? " Like so many French maids , " said M .. Louis happily . Negro help , which will not be employed by the hotels except as a last resort . were installed yesterday in the Marseille at Broadway and 103d Street , where most of the waiters went out on Saturday evening . The captains and headwaiters departed yesterday when they were asked to run the dining rooms with negroes , and their places , in turn , were promptly filled by . negroes , . committee of the . strikers . ylelted a number of negro preachers yes-. terday , asking them to urge their congregations to keep the race question out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys at some of the deserted posts has aroused great bitterness among some of the men . " Is n't this a pretty commentary higher education ? " cried one of the sympathizers , holding forth at the union headquarters yesterday afternoon . " If the colleges train men to be unsympa-1 thetic and to side with the inhuman , they are not good for much . " Fines for Six Rioters . The eight men who were arrested as a result of the riot on Fifth Avenue , In front of the Hotel Netherland . Saturday evening , were arraigned in Yorkville Court yesterday morning before Magistrate Kroten . To six charged with disorderly conduct he administered a fine of $10 each , which was paid in each instance . Michill Calozia of 200 East Twenty-fourth Street and James Aqurantis of 77 West Forty-fourth Street were held in $1,000 bail for examination tomorrow on a charge of assault . According to the story told by the detectives in court these were the men who gave ' Detective Foy such a struggle and who kicked him when he fell to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear against the prisoners . Before . disposing of the disorderly conduct cases Magistrate Krotel lectured the men , telling them that they were the first to be brought before him on that charge during the strike . He said that they could go on strike , provided they behaved themselves well , but he warned them if they or any others in the strike were brought before him again he would send them to the Workhouse for six months . As the result of the visit of some of 1 the strikers to a dance in Thompson , Street Saturday night , several men were in the Tombs Court yesterday to bo fined for the disorderly conduct Involved In lan a row that grew to the proportions lively fight before the police interfered . Disorder was . suppressed yesterday , the , Peace and quiet of the union headquarters . - being ! brolten upon ; only by the steady ' efforta-Of a phonograph , and last evening ' the strikers were all drawn to Bryant ' .

The only victory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chop House would capitulaate , and the union leaders comforted their men by the tidings that a half dozen other smaller res-taurants would yield to-day .
