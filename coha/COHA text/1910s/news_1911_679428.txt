txt The State Controller has issued a public statement as to the grounds on which he asks that a large number of places under him shall be exempted from the tests of competitive examination and probation , and may be filled by him at his personal discretion . There is nothing new in his facts or his restsoiling . Both have been used over and again for similar purposes . He follows the same line that was taken by gentle-I men of his views and with his aims long before the constitutional requirements as to the merit system were enacted . after full discussion and in the light of ample experience . Those requirements are now a part of the fun- I damental law and they should be respected by all , especially by those who have the trusteeship of the public funds . ' Possibly Mr. SOHMER is not acquainted with them . His studies may not have taken that direction . But they are very clear and simple , and we ere confident that the Controller will have no trouble in making them out and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will give them a little candid consideration . They are contained in Section 9 of the Fifth Article of the Constitution , relating to " civil service appointments and promotions , " They are as follows : Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the State and in all the civil divisions ' thereof , including cities and villages , shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained , - so far as practicable , by examinations which , so far as practicable , shall be competitive . It will be seen that these terms are very comprehensive as well as plain . Any public officer seeking to make appointments in any other way than is sot down in the Constitution must be able to show affirmatively , first , that his sole purpose is to secure merit and fitness , and second , that it is not practicable to ascertain merit and fitness in the manner prescribed . We do not think that Controller SOHMER can bring any proof for such a proposition as to the places he wishes to have put at his discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been filled from lists secured by examination . Other places of the same sort , with like duties , have been filled in large numbers in the State Government and in the Government of the United States . The ' assumption that examinations and probation would not turn out trustworthy men was thrashed out before the Constitution was adopted , and the number of exceptions was found to be negligible . The plan provided and exacted by the Constitution has been tried in Mr. Sosuza 's own office with entirely satisfactory results . It is not open to him now to go back of this experience and maintain that he can not get good men unless he is allowed to choose them freely himself . Moreover , it is notorious that officers who are connected with Tammany Hall are not clothed with freedom in the choice of their employes . We should say that it was a matter of extreme uncertainty whether Mr. SOHMER , if he could get the privilege of selecting men without examination and probation , as required now by tile law , and in accordance with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to select those approved by his political organization . Now , this is a , problem that does not concern the Controller alone , or the powerful political body with which and for which It is customary for him to act . It concerns the people of the State and the Governor , who directly represents all the people . It is not a good thing that Tammany should gat its grip on the patronage of a State department so important as the Controller 's office . It is plainly not a good thing for Gov . Dix . The question will finally come to him for decision unless the Commission reieets Mr. SOMME 'S application . It can not be legally granted without the approval of the Governor . It is announced that , if the matter should reach him , he will give a hearing on it . It will be an important hearing , for the application Includes not merely an attack on the merit system , but a plain Issue with the Governor on his definite pledges to sustain and extend the merit system . We doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will certainly be made very clear to the Public , and the.outcome will be watched very closely
