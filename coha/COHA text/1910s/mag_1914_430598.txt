 | The farmer , or any other man who buys and sells products or services , has vital need for the cheapest money and credit that are possible within the limits of safety . His money must be a sufficiently accurate standard of the measure of his valuables ; and of such a form and size to enable him to exchange it for commodities of all qualities and quantities . It must be sufficiently stable in its value to cause both the creditor and the debtor to feel full confidence that all their credit transactions rest upon a foundation that is solid . It should be used as many times in a year as possible , so as to make its expense the minimum . It will be fortunate for all when many more of us recognize the truth that money brings returns by the number and frequency of its services ? never by mere hoarding . The farmers ' credit institutions ? his banks and other deposit or loan agencies ? should be so effectively and economically located and managed as to make it practically impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as cheap a service as possible . Money stimulates and creates trades ; it makes them more economical . Credit ? the power and the opportunity to borrow the use of another 's goods or capital ? promotes trades to a still greater degree . Does the North Carolina farmer have as effective and cheap money and credit as his own prosperity and that of those who consume his products demand ? Does he cause his money to perform the greatest possible number of services in a year ? Can he borrow money , credit , or goods at a rate sufficiently low and for a time sufficiently long for him to make his crop or improve his soil , buildings , machinery , or stock , in the most effective manner ? Does the fact that we have in the United States approximately three and a half billion dollars of reasonably sound and efficient money , a large part of which is ready for constant use , necessarily make the farmer of North Carolina able to obtain as much as he needs , just when he needs it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and as much as twenty-five billion of banking resources really enable the North Carolina farmer to borrow from these as much as he needs , at rates small enough to be attractive to him ? In order to answer these most vital questions in a reasonably satisfactory manner , the Rural Organization Service of the United States Department of Agriculture has made an investigation in a large number of the North Carolina counties . While this examination has not covered every county in the state , it has covered a sufficient number in every section to make its findings fairly representative of the real conditions prevailing throughout the commonwealth . The larger part of this investigation has been made in the field by Professor William R. Camp , of the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station , and by myself . The facts as to the credit conditions of the North Carolina farmers , and farmers of other states , many of which were obtained in confidence , have been tabulated and studied at Washington . A digest of them is now public for the use of the national government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purpose , in this paper , to give the details of these facts . Nor could I with fairness mention by name any of the institutions or individuals with whom these facts have the most vital relationship . It is my desire to give only my own personal impressions ? those impressions that have driven them selves into my mind and heart as I have carried on investigations in the field , or as I have made a study of the facts and estimates obtained by the other men who have worked directly or indirectly for the Rural Organization Service . Our investigation quickly confirmed the notion that the merchant plays a large part in the credit of the farmer . The merchant has been , in fact , from the beginning of life in North Carolina , one of the farmer 's chief credit agencies . This is as true today as it has been in the past . though the relative amount of time purchases as compared with cash purchases made by farmers has had during the past decade a considerable change . Just what part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to state with exactness : it can only be estimated . The estimates made by bankers and others who possess more or less accurate information cover a very wide range . In the counties of the northeastern section of the state  | the range of the time purchases is from 95 to 20 per cent of the total purchases made by the landowning and landless farmers . A fair average may be , I think , approximately 60 per cent . In the counties from the middle part of the state to Buncombe and along the North Carolina-South Carolina border , the range is from 80 to 25 per cent . with a possible average of 45 to 50 per cent . The larger percentage of time purchases prevailing in the northeastern counties is , perhaps , due to the greater proportion of tenant farmers , many of whom are negroes , as compared with landlord farmers . These averages may be too large , but when a big share has been taken away from them the fact still remains that a very important percentage of the purchases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the farmer must have , is bought on time . The tenant farmer , of all classes , is the largest user of this form of credit . He possesses no land and very little other property , which can be used as security for loans from banks ; and his personal note has , almost without exception , no power at a bank . He may at times secure from his landlord an endorsement of his note and upon it be able to borrow a small amount from the bank . This is. however , the case in the fewest instances . Our investigation proves , with the greatest clearness , that the tenant farmer of North Carolina ? and as many as 42 percent of the farms are operated not by the landlord but by the tenant , a class of people deserving the best consideration that our minds and hearts have to give ? had practically no power at any of the banks of the present type . And I see no possibility of his possessing this power in the future , unless he can cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a greater degree ? perhaps a very remote possibility . The small landlords are also , as a rule , slight users of bank credit and , consequently , large users of store credit . Their failure to make use of bank credit or their incapacity to obtain it are , I believe , due in part to their lack of business knowledge or to their disposition to keep aloof from their neighbor in matters of business . Many of them do not really know the exact difference between their time prices and their cash prices at the store . So slight is their knowledge of the mercantile business , that they are oftentimes unaware that they are buy- ing credit from the store at from 12 to 20 per cent a year , while they might obtain it from a bank at from 6 to 8 per cent . Their suspicion of a bank and of their neighbors , whatever may be its cause , is another reason for their failure to borrow credit at a bank . Any movement that can persuade the average small farmer of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his neighbor , that they should always co-operate with each other in borrowing the use of credit , in marketing many of their products , etc. , would bring the greatest possible benefit not alone to the farmer but to every one who lives in North Carolina . Many a small farmer does not obtain his credit from a bank simply because he will not secure the signature of his neighbor to his note . A large ratio of time purchases to cash purchases made by the farmer is , however , in itself not a disadvantageous thing for him or for his community . It depends fundamentally upon the difference between the time prices which he actually pays and the cash prices at which he might buy all of his supplies . This point was , of course , a vital one in our investigation , though it could not be reduced , in a manner that would gratify the heart of the mathematician , to a very exact statement of fact . Here , too , we could only obtain asmanyestimates as possible from the people most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time prices as compared with cash prices paid by farmers and tenants cover the wide range of from 3 to 33 per cent , depending upon the nature of the commodity bought , the general reputation of the purchaser , the volume of his business with one store , and the location . An average of 12 per cent is , I am convinced , not too high ; and this is for a period of from six to eight months . When the North Carolina farmers come to the understanding that this is buying credit at a rate of approximately 20 per cent . a year , they will put forth greater effort to buy it from a bank at a very much smaller rate . Such a rate for the use of another 's goods is almost as large as that charged by the famous Jewish money shark of the middle ages , while the risks of today are insignificant as compared to his . The farmers , notably the tenants , who have poor reputations for paying their credit obligations are practically unable to buy until they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby they transfer to the merchant  | practically all of their legal right to their chattels , crops , stock , if not indeed their babies , until their debts are paid ; and it not infrequently happens that their debts possess a remarkable capacity to live after burial . But what are the relationships of the North Carolina farmer to the banks ? As I have said , the tenant farmer has practically no standing as a borrower at the banks , and deposits from him are most rare . The small farmer as a class has comparatively little power to borrow from a bank , and his deposits are primarily made , not as the result of a loan from the bank but to obtain the small savings interest ? four per cent . The larger farmers are , on the other hand , important depositors , borrowers , and even shareholders . Our investigation revealed the fact that the holdings of bank stock by farmers are very considerable in most of the small towns of the state . In a few of the larger towns , they hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they own from five per cent in some places to fifty per cent or more in other places . Since the capital stock of the great majority of the banks in the state is small , ranging from five to twenty-five thousand dollars , the farmers ' ownership of bank shares does not give them as a class much banking power . The number of farmers who hold stock in any one county is insignificant as compared with the total number in that county . As depositors in the banks , the North Carolina farmers are worthy of the bankers ' best consideration . In a large number of the banks , the farmers ' deposits make up an important percentage of the total deposits . Some of these deposits originate in the loans which the farmer obtains from the bank ; he borrows from the bank and leaves the amount on deposit , to be checked out as he has need . Our investigation gave point to the unfortunate fact that the larger part of the loans made by banks to farmers is taken in cash ? not left as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire of the farmer to obtain the four per cent . savings interest on his time deposits . The farmers who make such deposits , as a rule , are not borrowers from the banks . In many cases they rarely withdraw their interest accumulations or principal , unless the " Ford Machine " habit fixes itself upon them . Such depositors are more generally , I think , small farmers , who are for  | the most part thrifty but unprogressive . A far more profitable thing for them to do would be for them to invest their small savings of a life time in the improvement of their soil , equipment , stock , etc. ; from this form of investment they would , upon the whole , realize a much larger interest than four per cent . Loans made to farmers are of two general classes ? short time notes with personal endorsement and long time notes secured by mortgages on farms . From the very nature of the business carried on by the present type of our bank , it is the short time note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of one or two additional persons , which the banker prefers . It is much more readily convertible into cash ? into something which enables him to meet the demand of his depositors . The larger share of the loans made by banks to farmers is of this class ; and I feel sure the banker is sincere when he says that he would be glad to make the volume of such loans much larger than it now is , should the farmers ask for it and present the required personal security . Such loans are advantageous to the banks . Are they best for the farmer who borrows ? The range of their duration , including renewals , is usually from five to nine months , with an average of perhaps six or seven months . This is a sufficient term when the proceeds of the loans are invested in making a crop or holding it for an advantageous market , but it is entirely too short for the purpose of buying land or improving it or its equipment . For these purposes , it is generally necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage on his farm and to ask for a long time loan . Does the farmer obtain from the bank as much credit of this type as he needs or calls for ? The national banks have not hitherto enjoyed the legal right to make such loans directly or in the first instance . The state banks and trust companies have the power to make such loans , and make them , though the relative amount of the mortgage loans as compared with the personal security loans depends very largely upon the policy of the officers of the bank ? as to whether they prefer to invest their funds for longer or shorter periods . In a number of places the banks have a decided preference for the short time  | loans ? for a period of three , six , nine , or twelve months , with an average of actual time of perhaps six months ? whether made to a farmer or to a business man . They consequently do only a slight business in farm mortgage loans . In other localities , the banks make from 60 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of short time or long time loans seems to have no sectional distinction . The banks in the northeastern section have practically the same policy and practice as those in the western and southern boundary sections . The size of the town has something to do with this , though here the distinction is not sharp . In the largest towns the bank funds are naturally much more largely invested in loans to industrial and business men than to farmers . Whenever the farmer can borrow credit from a bank , he can usually do it to at least 50 per cent . of the estimated value of his farm ? in some places and in some cases to 60 or 75 per cent . The bankers , almost without exception , declare that they would make such loans up to 50 or 60 per cent of the value of the farm , occasionally to 75 per cent , though in our examination of many hundred mortgage notes we found very few with a proportion of loan to value of farm above 60 per cent , in fact few above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , make complaint against such a proportion . For what length of time can they borrow from banks on such mortgages . Can they borrow for a term sufficiently long to stimulate the greatest possible use of credit in the enlargement of the farm or in its improvement ? Our investigation proves that in many instances they actually obtain the loans for a period of three to five years , in a few cases as long as eight to ten years . In most places they get the loan for only ten to twelve months , but it is more generally renewed to two , three , four , or five years . The renewal may , however , not be granted by the bank ; it depends entirely upon the condition of the bank 's funds and upon the general estimate its officers may put upon the borrower 's disposition and condition . The average term of the great majority of farm mortgage loans obtained from the banks is ? at least it may be ? too short for the farmer to make the maximum use of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And loans for at least ten  | years , in some cases for thirty or forty years , seem absolutely necessary for such improvements . The North Carolina farmers must , therefore , go to other lenders than the banks for the majority of their long time loans . They go to insurance companies , to individual capitalists , or to lawyers who act as agents of trust funds . In the eastern counties of the state , and in the western , the farm mortgage loans made by insurance companies seem not to be very important . In the central , southern , and southeastern counties , their business in such loans is very considerable , if not indeed large . One Greensboro company makes , in fact , a speciality of farm mortgage loans : and it carries a big volume of them , in nearly fifty counties of the state . Individuals ? local capitalists , merchants , or farmers ? and lawyers acting as agents of funds do in practically all the places covered by our investigation an important business in farm mortgage loans . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 per cent to 75 per cent of all such loans , and from 25 to 60 per cent in the central , western , and southern border counties . A point of large significance is that this business is carried on under no state regulation . The banks and insurance companies are more or less effectively examined by special state officials ; the individual lenders are never so examined . We have , to be sure , a general usury law , but it , like many other laws , has only the shadow of a real existence . A violation of it ? and there are a good many such transgressions , in the main by individual lenders , not banks , every day in the week save the Sabbath ? can be brought to trial only by that slow and most uncertain process of an indictment by a grand jury . The cost of loans to farmers is , of course , a most vital point , so vital , in fact , that it practically determines the volume of the loans and their effects ? the prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the cost is high , few loans are made , while the real conditions of agriculture may demand many . The public should , therefore , be deeply interested in how much it costs a farmer to borrow other people 's capital or goods . The cost of farmers ' credit at the store has already been given . The short time credit which the farmer  | obtains from the bank upon personal endorsement sells , for the most part , at the prevailing bank rate ? at 6 per cent most generally , occasionally as high as seven or eight per cent . That which he buys from individuals on the strength of personal endorsement sells at whatever price he is compelled to offer . It is upon the cost of long time or mortgage credit , that it is necessary to speak with some detail . The cost of making an official record of the mortgage , and such record must be made , always falls upon the borrower . This item in the purchase price of mortgage credit is , however , only slight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2.50 , with an average of approximately $1.50 an amount insignificant when the loan is fairly large . It is the charge made by the lawyer for examining and abstracting the farmer 's title which constitutes a much larger item of expense . In practically all of the counties under investigation this item amounts to from $5 to $100 ? an average of perhaps about $10 . In a very few cases , where the title is remarkably clear and its description very brief , the fee is as small as S2.50 . The bank officials may not , of course , demand a new examination of the title in case they are lending to one of their regular customers ; and in some cases they do not . Such practice is , however , the exception . An average cost for abstracting the title of $10 per loan makes the rate important for small loans . Our investigation made it remarkably clear that a system of official description and registration of each piece of land , like the Torrens System or its modification , would be of great benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his land is so described , he can always show proof of his possession without delay or cost . And the banker would be pleased , whatever the lawyer who makes part of his income out of abstracting titles might say of it . Not only must the farmer pay the cost of recording his mortgage and that of abstracting his title to his farm , but he must pay the current rate of interest on his loan . This is more generally six per cent when the loan is obtained from a bank ; in some cases as much as seven or eight per cent . It may be at a higher rate when the loan is obtained from an insurance company or agent , from an individual , or from a lawyer , as an agent of funds . The insurance companies  | charge , as far as we could discover , the legal rate , six per cent , but they make practically all their loans to those who purchase insurance from them . The loan very frequently is made solely upon the condition of the borrower becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more generally has a definite ratio to the size of the policy bought . This is excellent business for the insurance company but it often causes the farmer to pay for his loan from one to three per cent above the legal rate . Individuals and lawyers acting as agents charge the legal rate and not infrequently a commission which makes the actual rate from one to four per cent ? at times six per cent ? higher . The actual rates which the North Carolina farmers pay for their loans , especially their long time mortgage loans , have important variations ? from six to twelve per cent ; and these variations are due for the most part to the commission which is charged by the lender or the bonus which is offered by the farmer who is under pressing need of more capital . Banks do not resort to the use of the commission as a general rule . Trust companies , on the other hand , maintain a more general practice of charging a commission . Some of them collect one per cent yearly , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent for the first year of the loan and one-half of one per cent for each succeeding year . The insurance companies do not directly charge a commission upon their loans to farmers , but the insurance policy which they sell as a prerequisite to the loan in the great majority of cases brings indirectly a commission . It is the individual money lender , who , of all classes of sellers of credit , most systematically transgresses the usury law . He most frequently of all lenders charges , in addition to the legal rate , a commission , or accepts a bonus from the borrower in exchange for the accommodation in the form of a loan at the current rate . And his commission or bonus most frequently amounts to an important percentage of the size of the loan . He comes nearer being in the class of the famous Jewish shark of old than any other of our sellers of credit to farmers , save the merchant who charges a time price 20 per cent and more above his cash price . How may such an unfortunate situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity be stimulated and  | enlarged ? It is not my purpose to give , in this paper , a specific plan of relief . That is a topic sufficiently big to demand the space of a separate paper ; and , too , I prefer not to give at this time my own plan . Whatever plan the national government may finally decide upon , whatever the legislature of North Carolina may attempt to do , this situation in rural life will not , I am convinced , be greatly changed or improved unless the farmers themselves take the leading and vital part . Many of the farmers are in their present condition largely because of their own disposition or their lack of business knowledge and method . Some of them have not yet learned how to use the banks which they have near their doors ; they keep their savings buried at home instead of in the care of a bank , from which they could be loaned to the profit of their owner , the bank , and its borrowers . Some of them , who never buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining their personal endorsement upon a promissory note . Until the farmers themselves come to know their own credit problems , until they are willing to have a confidence in each other that is strong enough to cause them to endorse each other 's notes , until they are ready to join into a co-operation among themselves that will tie them together more closely in their responsibilities as well as in their opportunities , any plan of relief which the nation or the state may see fit to provide will , in my judgment , fail to make a vital change in the present ineffective condition of rural life in North Carolina . I do not , by any means , deny the need of governmental action in the matter of farmers ' credit . Our investigation has made clear the necessity for a change in our banking system ? either an important modification of the present bank , or the creation of a type designed distinctively for farmers . The North Carolina farmer as a class is today an ineffective user of credit . This is in part due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a banking facility which his own peculiar business demands .
