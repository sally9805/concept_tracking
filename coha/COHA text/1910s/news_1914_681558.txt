txt HARDEN , whose Berlin paper Zukunft has often shown good marksmanship in shooting folly as it flies , is now one of the pillars of the war party . He exhorts the Germans not to allow the flame of confidence to be extinguished , yet he has the courage to see and to say that the fact must not be concealed that " we are " appallingly far from our goal , and " that we never had as many enemies " around us as at the eve of the corn ' ing year . " Even an overwhelming majority of the neutral nations are against us .. not because they are not told the truth , but because they are unable to think as we Germans do . So far as it goes that is a sound analysis . The neutral nations do not think as the Germans do , they have a very different way of thinking . But , since Mr. HARD2 . ' N admits that an overwhelming majority of them are against Germany , would it not be well for the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding out if it has not some defects ? If an overwhelming majority of the neutral nations think in a way that is not the German way , is it not conceivable , probable , even , that the Germans are thinking wrong , that the rest of the world is right ? The German-Americans for the most part think in the German way , they agree with their kinsfolk at home . But how can they miss the significance of such a sermon as that which was preached last Sunday night by a clergyman who is known throughout the land from the pulpit of what is perhens the best-known church in the United States ? Dr. Taarxas knows Germany , he ' has often lectured about Germany and the lessons we might learn from her . At the outbreak of the war he praised Germany ; in an interview given after his sermon of Sunday night he said that at first he " took the part of the German people " in the dreadful war that has come . " Now , he says , he has changed his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has instructed his Yecture bureau to withdraw his lecture on " The New Germany " from the list . It was about the middle of September . he says , that he first realized that German success would mean " a world of armed camps " ; that we in this country " would have to adopt militarism in order to live . " In his interview , speaking of the causes of the war , Dr. Husas gives much prominence to Germany 's desire to secure the rich bodies of iron ore that have been discovered in France . Germany has imperative need of iron and steel , she coveted the French ore beds , and her need and her desire impelled her to begin the war . We must dissent altogether from Dr. HiLlas 's opinion that " this is the whole situation in a nutshell . " The causes of the war are too numerous and too big to be contained in any nutshelL Power and dominance are the ends Germany seeks to attain . and as those conceptions have shaped themselves in the German thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in his sermon in Plymouth Church Sunday night Dr. Hittis paid a good deal of attention to the German way of thinking , to iNia way the Germans think about ademselves and about Germany , the nation 's destiny and its place in the universe . For one thing , they cling to the old tribal idea of GOD . He is their GOD , He is always with them . " The tribal idea of GOD , " said the preacher , " belongs with " the ox carts and the medicine man " and the cave dweller . " Yet when the German soldiers are sent into Belgium they are told to make themselves as terrible as the Huns of A'rrita , " and the Lord will give you victory . " The Germans believe too much in the " Gun With us " idea . If Got ) is demonstrably with them in this war , then it is time to begin building arks , for anrely there will come a second deluge to drown the more than a billion and a half of sinners outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs and pray for the success of the Allies . The significance of Dr. HILLIS 's " sermon lies not so much , however , in what he said as in the fact that such a Settnon was preached . Like Dr. E=o2 and CHABLES ? 5'S/AK1/4-0* ADAnis and Preside:it ar.Asident HIBBEN , Dr. HILLIS is a representative American . These men think not in the German way , but in the American way , they speak with authority the thought and the convictions of the American mind . When Dr. Ilims exhorts German-Americans to use their influence with the men of the Fatherland . as THE TIMES has already urged them to do , to put aside their ideals of militarism and power and domination and seek a more enduring prosperity for Germany and the greater happiness of the German people in new paths and nobler aspirations , would it not be well for them to pay heed to his adjuration ? To say of Dr. Hums or of THE TIMES that this friendly counsel originates in hostility to the Germans is as unwise as it is untrue . Wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reason whether it be sound and worth adopting . There is in this country no feeling of unfriendliness toward the German people . Says Dr. Muffs : Americans who admire German efficiency , the German people , and want to see German science preserved , and feel an immeasurable debt to MARTIN Ln-rnsc , do not want to see Germany destroyed . But Germany will not listen to England , nor France , nor America . There is only one Voice that can reach Germany  --  it is the voice of the German-Americans in this country . ? ? ? And do they not owe something to this Republic ? Should they not use their influence with the Fatherland ? Having escaped conscription and years of military service with heavy taxation and enjoyed the liberty of the press ; having become convinced that militarism does not promote the prosperity and manhood of a people , why should they not as one man ask the Fatherland now to present their cause to arbitrators ? To no body of American citizens has there ever come a more strategic opportunity or a responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a form very easy to grasp . There are many signs , and they are every day increasing in number , that Germany 's ally , Austria , is in sore distress and would welcome a way of escape from the war . She may before long find herself with no choice save to make peace . Then the very cause of the war would be removed , for Germany took up arms against England . France , and Russia to maintain Austria 's right to work her will upon Servia . Logically and in strict consistency Germany should then declare the war at an end . But logic and consistency are laid aside when the sword is drawn . Germany 's blood is up , men like HARDEN are exhorting the Germans not to fail in confidence , and there is a great probability that even with Austria out of it the war would be continued by Germany . Would the German-Americans miss that golden opportunity to make their voices heard , their influence felt ? But they need not , they should not , wait for Austria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's judgment that condemns her Germany can not triumph . The German Empire faces certain defeat and German imperialism and militarism are doomed . It is the German people who are to be saved , and now is the time for the work of salvation to begin . We can not believe that the GermanAmericans will be so blind as not to see the path of duty that lies straight before them .
