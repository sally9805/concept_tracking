txt Congress is having no sort of trouble with finding a basis upon which to calculate a tax of S per cent . upon profits in excess of S per cent . The formula has been prepared , and Congress has passed along to the consideration of exemptions . That is easier yet . The farmers are the favorites or the politicians . Besides , the farmers are exempted from all the war taxes abroad , and imported schemes of taxation are as much in favor as imported products are taboo . The foreign excess profits taxes run from 30 to Z0 per cent. , and Americans who are asked only to pay S per cent . should think upon their mercies rather than resent the request for funds to support preparedness in their defense . It is known to all that preparedness is for the sole benefit of these who make excess profits in manufactures . There is no such thing as excess profits for farmers . They are insufficiently rewarded in the year when their products have been appraised at $13,500,000,000 , or nearly three billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased value of their lands and the decrease of costs which our paternal Government is arranging through the establishment of farmers ' banks with Government funds . It is not possible to do enough for the farmers . They are entitled to exemjidon from the excess profits tax just as they are entitled to exemption from the personal property tax and to undervaluation on the realty tax . It is only a just reward for virtue and unwearied services against the money devil which is responsible for all evil , just as the farmers are responsible for all good . No politician will dispute these axioms of how to win the farmers ' vote . A subsidy for agriculture is as admirable as a subsidy for shipbuilding is accursed . Foreigners supply all the ships necessary to carry the farmers ' products which are exported , ' with the result of making Americans bid higher for their food . No navy is needed to protect the farmers of the mideontinent . The farmers showed what they thought of the army by their boycott of the force sent to the Mexican border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to conceal their profits made in shameless traffic with those shedding human blood . The farmers are neutral , caring nothing which side wins so long as the war creates a need which they are working overtime to supply . No one will dispute these self-evident truths . Even the fact that last week the South Jersey Farmers ' Exchange declared a stock dividend of 100 per cent . and a cash dividend of 8 per cent . has nothing to do with the case . Farmers ' beneficent co-operative movements are exempt from the law against combinations in restraint of trade , and this particular organi ; ation of benevolence is merely an example of the manner in which the farmers struggle to supply the people 's needs by the distribution of farmers ' products where and when prices are highest . It is a suggestion of those tainted with excess profits that farmers are exempt abroad beIcause the fighting peoples are starving , and that they have no resource except to look to those who can supply the necessities of life by the billion dollars ' worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a reason in favor . Should such superhuman efforts to relieve the hungry go unrewarded ? Blessed are . the farmers , for they possess the earth .
