txt The managers of the Clark boom were busy all day try , ing to pin down enough votes , with those lof the Murphy-Sullivan-Taggart combination , to give the Speaker the nomination on the first or second ballot and to prevent desertions from their ranks on the part of those who voted for Bryan for Temporary Chairman yesterday against their programme . Ti ey declared that they would have the 729 votes needed , but nevertheless they were on the anxious seat and at work on the waverers . The fact that half of their followers refused to take the Parker hurdle has weakened them in the eyes of delegates whose only desire is to find the band wagon early , and they have had to meet the argument that the vote for Bryan shows that more than a third of the convention will stand out for a teal progressive  --  probably ' Wilson or Bryan  --  making it impossible for Clark to get the necessary two-thirds . The Clark combination with the reactionaries , which many of the leaders thought had been rounded up to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken down to-night , with the result that the Murphy-Sullivan-Taggart crowd are up In the air . The chief trouble is said to have been with the Underwood States ? Florida , Alabama , Georgia , and Mississippi  --  with S4 votes , which it was found impossible to deliver to Clark . Taggart was said to be having the time of his life trying to  --  drag the Indiana delegates into line , with the result still in doubt . It was also said that Thomas F. Ryan was unable to control the Virginia delegation of twenty-four , the majority of whom are for . Underwood , although none of the delegates is instructed . The Vermont delegation also , which was included In the projected combination , decided to-night to vote for Gov . Foss of Massachusetts , who was born in the Green Mountain State . All these States , it was said to-night by those on the inside , were needed to give Clark the nomination . Clark leaders pooh-poohed the idea that there was any break in their lines , declaring that-Clark was second choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination would mean the Speakership for their man . Trouble a-plenty for the Clark men was also reported in the Kentucky delegation , which instructed for Clark , but which , it was said , might desert him early in the contest , the reason being that 011ie James would become the leader in Kentucky if Clark is nominated . Twenty of the twenty-six delegates are opposed to James , who was beaten for control of the State Convention . The Harmon men began to-night to take a more hopeful view of life when these reports were received , and the Wilsonitea showed renewed confidence that the Clark rush had been stayed . The Clark people expected the MurphySullivan-Taggart combination to deliver about 260 votes to their candidate . These are made up of Charles F. Murphy 's personally conducted party of 90 from New York ; " Tom " Taggart 's 30 from Indiana , who are ostensibly for Gov . Marshall ; the 14 from Connecticut , who are instructed for Gov . Baldwin ; the 24 from Virginia , who , like the New Yorkers , are uninstructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as nisny of the Pennsylvania delegates as James Gaffey can control , which they put at 30 ; Harmon 's 48 from Ohio , and about 20 from Michigan . Roger C. Sullivan 's contribution to the combination is 56 of the 58 Illinois delegates , who are already instructed for Clark . The instructed Clark delegates number 423 , and those who are claimed for him without instructions bring the total to 512 . Adding the 260 the Clark men say , gives 772 for the Speaker , considerable more than two-thirds . Hope for Anti-Harmon Votes . Some of these , of course , the Clark men do not claim on the first ballot , as they are instructed for " favorite sons . " The Ohic delegation contains 29 Harmon and 19 anti-Harmon men , of whom 14 are for Wilson . The Clark men argue ' that the anti-Harmon men are controlled by John R. and that six more will be won over , making a majority which will bind the entire delegation for Clark . Practically all the ' Wilson delegates in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after it has been made apparent that Wilson can not be nominated and that fact will be shown on the first ballot . Wilson , they , declare , can not control a third of the votes on the first ballot and that means that he is beaten . In general , the argument of the Clark Men is that the vote on the Temporary Chairmanship showed that neither the Bryan-Wilson element nor the reactionaries can control the nomination and therefore - the successful candidate must be agreeable to both . They say they foresaw this condition from-athe start and that they have consistently presented Clark as the harmony candidate . Bryan , they say will be satisfied ' with the ultimate outcome as he will have his say in the platform and on other matters . To offset the talk that the Bryan mon in their own camp will desert them they gave out several interviews with delegates in this category . Representative Scott Ferris of Oklahoma , whose delegation cast its twenty votes for Bryan , said this was done to compliment the man who had been so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to voting for the nominee , the ten delegates who were instructed for Clark would vote for him , until he was nominated . Bernard Sheridan , Chairman of the Kansas delegation , made a similar statement regarding the twenty votes east for Bryan , saying that they would stick to Clark to the end , Theodore A. Bell , Chairman of the California delegation , Part of which went to Bryan . said ilk ; State would vote for Clark until he was nominated . State Senator Van-Tilborg of the Colorado delegation , half of which voted for Bryan , said that all the votes of the twelve delegates would be cast for the Speaker throughout the balloting . Having figured Wilson out of the running , the Clark people proceeded to dispose of reports that the reactionary combination would try to nominate Underwood . They pointed to the fact that Underwood had little more than 100 votes and that with the SGO or so of the Murphy-Sullivan-Taggart crowd , he would be far from the nomination , and where , they asked , would he get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark was in the leading position , they cited the fact of the unanimous selection of 011ie James of Kentucky as Permanent Chairman as a recognition of Clark 's strength . The crowning reason why the 260 votes of the combination would come to Clark , his backers said . was that the menace Of Bryan 's nomination still hung over the convention , and that the only way to make its prevention sure was for the reactionary element to help nominatel Clark . The Wilson managers , realizing the concentration of strength against them , declare that Clark can not muster two-thirds of the votes . lie will not get them on the first ballot , they say , and if he has accessions from the " favorite son " States on the second they will be offset by desertions on the part of the Bryan men instructed for the ' 1 speaker . After that , they argue , the Clark forces will go to pieces , and in the end the nomI ination will go to a Progressive . With Bryan out of it , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the selection of 011ie James for Permanent Chairman , they point out that although he is a Clark man he was deserted by most of the Clark supporters in the National Committee , while the ' Wilson men voted for him . They have stood ready at all times to support any Progressive , and showed it by voting first for James , then for Bryan , and now again for James . The Wilson men say Bryan 's defeat did not show that the Progressives were not in control of the convention , since ninny I delegates voted against him because they thought his election might lead to a stampede to him for President , and this would be unfortunate after he had led the party to defeat three times . If Bryan bad announced , say the Wilson men , that in running for Chairman he had no ulterior motive , and was simply representing the Progressive sentiment , he would have been elected instead of Parker . Another thing the Wilson men bring forward as showing that Clark can not be nominated is that the Underwood vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made to put Clark through , they say , the Underwood vote will go to Wilson . Clark will not get Virginia , they ' say , because of the sentimental effect of the fact that Wilson was . born in that State . They deny that Massachusetts will stick to Clark after one or two ballots and say that Mayor Fitzgerald of Boston will swing part of them to Wilson . They say they will get the Idaho delegates and all of those from Nebraska except three , who are instructed for Harmon as soon as the break-uP of Clark 's strength comes . They add that . there are many other instances of this kind . They also point out that the talk of the Clark men yesterday was that Wilson had been eliminated and that to-day they were putting up arguments that he could not be nominated and could not prevent the Clark nomination . As showing the Progressive sentiment of the West they showed a telegram from Gov . West of Oregon , saying : The Republican Party has definitely become the party of privilege and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past professions and throw away the political opportunity of a generation if it does not by a platform and its candidates clearly and uncompromisingly stand for absolute progressive and fundamental democracy in the interests of the common people and thus invite to it all true Progressives of whatever former affiliation . Make no concession to ' reactionaries Within or without the party . The telegram was also signed by Chairman Haney of the Democratic State Central Committee and several others . The New York Wilson Conference Committee sent a circular letter to the delegates today reading as follows : We are from New York and we are for 001% ' Nilson . We have come to Baltimore to tell you why . If New York voters were allowed to explain themselves , Wilson would have a very large majority of New York 's Ealthmore delegation . Predatory interests care nothing about the result of an election if they succeed in determining the selection of both candidates . Shall they control another National Convention ? The answer rests with you . Near York has a large " progressive vote " - Unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shalt ' lose the State . We carried New York In 1876 for Tilden ; we carried New York in 1884 for Cleveland . and - we carried New York In ISM for Cleveland , because these men got the independent vote . All men know who opposed those nominations . Do you think you can win without New York ? No Democrat has ever been elected President who did not obtain New York 's vote . except Madison , in 181E , and Buchanan , in 1856 . Can you win without New York to-day ? We speak for the great mass of the Democratic voters in New York Stale . We ? speak also for the independents of all shades of opinion in New York State . Ail these votes we must have in order to win . New York can be carried for Wilson , be ! cause he can get both the regular Demo ! eratie and the independent vote . nominate ' Wilson  --  that 's all . Aside from the talk that the reaction . ' ary combination may concentrate on riniderwood Instead of Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harmon bborns . The Gaynor boom , however , took on an I added importance from the prospect that Clark might fail to get the nomination on an early ballot , and that Wilson , while I heading off Clark , might not muster enough votes to win himself . In other words , the Gaynor people expect Wilson to stop Clark and Clark 's strength to dissipate , leaving the convention free to take up a dark horse . Chance for Mayor Gaynor . That is-just the situation they have been looking for and they think they see it coming . With Harmon and Underwood out of it , according to their calculations , it is the ' Wilson-Bryan element against Clark and the reactionaries . Bryan and Wilson . they say , will hold more than a third of the delegates , but will not be able to nominate Wilson . In their opinion , Bryan will never consent to the nomination of Clark in view of his defeat for Temporary Chairmaw by the Clark managers and halt of the Clark delegates . The consent of both Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any candidate , and both sides , they say , can unite ' en the Mayor . A number of delegations were addressed by ex-State Senator Cantor and other Gaynor boomers to-day with a view of winning their votes later on , and the reports were that in all cases the . delegates were well disposed toward their candidate .
