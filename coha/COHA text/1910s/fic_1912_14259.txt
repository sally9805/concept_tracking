SCENE .  --  A woodshed , in the ell of a farm house . The shed is open on both sides , front and back , the apertures being slightly arched at the top . In bad weather , these presumably may be closed by big double doors , which stand open now  --  swung back outward beyond sight . Thus the nearer opening is the proscenium arch of the scene , under which the spectator looks through the shed to the background  --  a grassy yard , a road with great trunks of soaring elms , and the glimpse of a green hillside . The ceiling runs up into a gable with large beams . On the right , at back , a door opens into the shed from the house kitchen . Opposite it , a door leads from the shed into the barn . In the foreground , against the right wall , is a work-bench . On this are tools , a long , narrow , wooden box , and a small oil stove , with steaming kettle upon it . Against the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stacked , the uneven ridges sloping to a jumble of stove-wood and kindlings mixed with small chips on the floor , which is piled deep with mounds of crumbling bark , chips and wood-dust . Not far from this mounded pile , at right center of the scene , stands a wooden arm-chair , in which LINK TADBOURNE , in his shirt-sleeves , sits drowsing . Silhouetted by the sunlight beyond , his sharp-drawn profile is that of an old man , with white hair cropped close , and gray mustache of a faded black hue at the outer edges . Between his knees is a stout thong of wood , whittled round by the drawshave which his sleeping hand still holds in his lap . Against the side of his chair rests a thick wooden yoke and collar . Near him is a chopping-block . In the woodshed there is no sound or motion except the hum and floating steam from the tea-kettle . Presently the old man murmurs in his sleep , clenching his hand . Slowly the hand relaxes again . From the door , right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature for her age . She is dressed simply . In one hand , she carries a man 's wide-brimmed felt hat ; over the other arm , a blue coat . These she brings toward LINK . Seeing him asleep , she begins to tiptoe , lays the coat and hat on the chopping-block , goes to the bench and trims the wick of the oil-stove , under the kettle . Then she returns and stands near LINK , surveying the shed . On closer scrutiny , the jumbled woodpile has evidently a certain order in its chaos : some of the splittings have been piled in irregular ridges ; in places , the deep layer of wood-dust and chips has been scooped , and the little mounds slope and rise like miniature valleys and hills. * A suggestion for the appropriate arrangement of these mounds may be found in the map of the battle-field annexed to the volume by Capt . R. K. Beecham , entitled Gettysburg , A. C. McClurg , 1911 . Taking up a hoe , POLLY  --  with careful steps  --  moves among the hollows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothing the little mounds with the hoe . As she does so , from far away , a bugle sounds . LINK snapping his eyes wide open , sits up.Hello ! Cat-nappin ' was I , Polly ? p. 3 POLLY Just a kitten-nap , I guess . Laying the hoe down , she approaches . The yoke done ? LINK giving a final whittle to the yoke-collar thong . Thar ! When he 's ben steamed a spell , and bended snug , I guess this feller 'll sarve t ' say " Gee " to  --  Lifting the other yoke-collar from beside his chair , he holds the whittled thong next to it , comparing the two with expert eye. and " Haw " to him . Beech every time , Sir ; beech or walnut . Hang me if I 'd shake a whip at birch , for ox-yokes.  --  Polly , are ye that ? POLLY Yes , Uncle Link . LINK What 's that I used to sing ye ? " Polly , put the kittle on , Polly , put the kittle on , Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give this feller a dose of ox-yoke tea ! POLLY The kettle 's boilin ' . LINK Wall , then , steep him good . POLLY takes from LINK the collar-thong , carries it to the work-bench , shoves it into the narrow end of the box , which she then closes tight and connects  --  by a piece of hose  --  to the spout of the kettle . At the further end of the box , steam then emerges through a small hole. p. 4 POLLY You 're feelin ' smart to-day . LINK Smart !  --  Wall , if I could git a hull man to swap legs with me , mebbe I 'd arn my keep . But this here settin ' dead an ' alive , without no legs , day in , day out , do n't make an old hoss wuth his oats . POLLY cheerfully.I guess you 'll soon be walkin ' round . LINK Not if that doctor feller has his say : He says I ca n't never go agin this side o ' Jordan ; and looks like he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gal , sence I had that stroke . POLLY pointing to the ox-yoke.You 're fitter sittin ' than most folks standin ' . LINK briskly . Oh , they ca n't keep my two hands from makin ' ox-yokes . That 's my second natur ' sence I was a boy . Again in the distance a bugle sounds . LINK starts . What 's that ? POLLY Why , that 's the army veterans down to the graveyard . This is Decoration mornin ' : you ai n't forgot ? LINK So ' t is , so ' tis.Roger , your young man  --  ha ! Chuckling . He come and axed me was I agoin ' to the cemetery . " Me ? Do n't I look it ? " says I. Ha ! " Do n't I look it ? " p. 5 POLLY He meant  --  to decorate the graves . LINK O ' course ; but I must take my little laugh . I told him I guessed I wa' n't persent'ble anyhow , my mstache and my boots wa' n't blacked this mornin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs .  --  Be you a-goin ' to take your young school folks , Polly ? POLLY Dear no ! I told my boys and girls to march up this way with the band . I said I 'd be ' a-stayin ' home and learnin ' how to keep school in the woodpile here with you . LINK looking up at her proudly.Schoolma'am at seventeen ! Some smart , I tell ye ! POLLY caressing him.School-master , you , past seventy ; that 's smarter ! I tell ' em I learn from you , so 's I can teach my young folks what the study-books leave out . LINK Sure ye do n't want to jine the celebratin ' ? POLLY No Sir ! We 're goin ' to celebrate right here , and you 're to teach me to keep school some more . She holds ready for him the blue coat and hat . LINK looking up.What 's that ? POLLY Your teachin ' rig . She helps him on with it. p. 6 LINK The old blue coat !  --  My , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Old Army Boys ! Dreamily . Yes , we was boys : jest boys ! Polly , you tell your young folks , when they study the books , that we was nothin ' else but boys jest fallin ' in love , with best gals left t ' home  --  the same as you ; and when the shot was singin ' , we pulled their pictur 's out , and prayed to them ' most more ' n the Allmighty . LINK looks up suddenly  --  a strange light in his face . Again , to a far strain of music , the bugle sounds . Thar she blows Agin ! POLLY They 're marchin ' to the graves with flowers . LINK My Godfrey ! ' t ai n't so much thinkin ' o ' flowers and the young folks , their faces , and the blue line of old fellers marchin '  --  it 's the music ! that old brass voice a-callin ' ! Seems as though , legs or no legs , I 'd have to up and foller to God-knows-whar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . No ; durn it , no ! I jest ca n't stan ' the music . POLLY goes to the work-bench , where the box is steaming.Uncle Link , you want that I should steam this longer ? LINK absently.Oh , A kittleful , a kittleful. p. 7 POLLY coming over to him.Now , then , I 'm ready for school .  --  I hope I 've drawed the map all right . LINK Map ? Oh , the map ! Surveying the woodpile reminiscently , he nods . Yes , thar she be : old Gettysburg ! POLLY I know the places  --  most . LINK So , do ye ? Good , now : whar 's your marker ? POLLY taking up the hoe.Here . LINK Willoughby Run : whar 's that ? POLLY points with the hoe toward the left of the woodpile.That 's farthest over next the barn door . LINK My , how we fit the Johnnies thar , the fust mornin ' ! Jest behind them willers , acrost the Run , that 's whar we captur 'd Archer . My , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She points to different heights and depressions , as LINK nods his approval . Peach Orchard , Devil 's Den , Round Top , the Wheatfield  --  LINK Lord , Lord , the Wheatfield ! POLLY continuing.Cemetery Hill , Little Round Top , Death Valley , and this here is Cemetery Ridge . p. 8 LINK pointing to the little flag.And colors flyin ' ! We kep ' em flyin ' thar , too , all three days , from start to finish . POLLY Have I learned ' em right ? LINK A number One , chick ! Wait a mite : Culp 's Hill : I do n't jest spy Culp 's Hill . POLLY There wa' n't enough kindlin 's to spare for that . It ought to lay east thee , towards the kitchen . LINK Let it go ! That 's whar us Yanks left our back door ajar and Johnson stuck his foot in : kep it thar , too , till he got it squoze off by old Slocum . Let Culp 's Hill lay for now .  --  Lend me your marker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reaches with it and digs in the chips . Death Valley needs some scoopin ' deeper . So : smooth off them chips . POLLY does so with her foot . You better guess ' t was deep as hell , that second day , come sundown.  --  Here , He hands back the hoe to her. flat down the Wheatfield yonder . POLLY does so . Goda'mighty ! that Wheatfield : wall , we flatted it down flatter than any pancake what you ever cooked , Polly ; and ' t wa n't no maple syrup neither was runnin ' , slipp'ry hot and slimy black all over it , that nightfall . p. 9 POLLY Here 's the road to Emmetsburg . LINK No , ' tai n't : this here 's the pike to Taneytown , where Sykes 's boys come sweatin ' , after an all-night march , jest in the nick to save our second day . The Emmetsburg road 's thar.  --  Whar was I , ' fore I fell cat-nappin ' ? POLLY At sunset , July second , Sixty-three . LINK nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she set a dozen times that afternoon , red-yeller as a punkin jacko ' lantern , rairin ' and pitchin ' through the roarin ' smoke till she clean busted , like the other bombs , behind the hills . POLLY My ! Wa' n't you never scart and wished you 'd stayed t ' home ? LINK Scart ? Wall , I wonder ! Chick , look a-thar : them little stripes and stars . I heerd a feller once , down to the store ,  --  a dressy mister , span-new from the city  --  layin ' the law down : " All this stars and stripes , " says he , " and red and white and blue is rubbish , mere sentimental rot , spread-eagleism ! " " I wa n't t ' know ! " says I. " In Sixty-three , I knowed a lad , named Link . Onct , after sundown I met him stumblin '  --  with two dead men 's muskets for crutches  --  towards a bucket , full of ink  --  water , they called it . When he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bullet holes .  --  Wall , sir , he had a piece o ' splintered stick , with red and white and blue , tore ' most t ' tatters , a-danglin ' from it . " Be you color sergeant ? " says I. " Not me , " says Link ; " the sergeant 's dead , but when he fell , he handed me this bit o ' rubbish  --  red and white and blue . " And Link he laughed . " What be you laughin ' for ? " says I. " Oh , nothin ' . Ai n't it lovely , though ! " says Link . p. 10 POLLY What did the span-new mister say to that ? LINK I did n't stop to listen . Them as never heerd dead men callin ' for the colors do n't guess what they be . Sitting up and blinking hard . But this ai n't keepin ' school ! POLLY quietly.I guess I 'm learnin ' somethin ' , Uncle Link . LINK The second day , ' fore sunset . He takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind it thar lies Longstreet with his rebels . Here be the Yanks , and Cemetery Ridge behind ' em . Hancock  --  he 's our general  --  he 's got to hold the Ridge , till reinforcements from Taneytown . But lose the Wheatfield , lose the Ridge , and lose the Ridge  --  lose God-and-all !  --  Lee , the old fox , he 'd nab up Washington , Abe Lincoln and the White House in one bite !  --  So the Union , Polly ,  --  me and you and Roger , your Uncle Link , and Uncle Sam  --  is all thar  --  growin ' in that Wheatfield . POLLY smiling proudly.And they 're growin ' still ! LINK Not the wheat , though . Over them stone walls , thar comes the Johnnies , thick as grasshoppers : gray legs a-jumpin ' through the tall wheat tops . And now thar ai n't no tops , thar ai n't no wheat , thar ai n't no lookin ' : jest blind feelin ' round in the black mud , and trampin ' on boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' smoke , and stingin ' smother , and  --  up thar through the dark  --  that crazy punkin sun , like an old moon lopsided , crackin ' her red shell with thunder ! In the distance , a bugle sounds , and the low martial music of a brass band begins . Again LINK 'S face twitches , and he pauses , listening . From this moment on , the sound and emotion of the brass music , slowly growing louder , permeates the scene. p. 11 POLLY Oh ! What was God a-thinkin ' of , t ' allow the created world to act that awful ? LINK Now , I wonder !  --  Cast your eye along this hoe : He stirs the chips and wood-dirt round with the hoe-iron . Thar in that poked up mess o ' dirt , you see yon weeny chip of ox-yoke ?  --  That 's the boy I spoke on : Link , Link Tadbourne : " Chipmunk Link , " they call him , ' cause his legs is spry ' s a squirrel's.  --  Wall , mebbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood lookin ' down on him that day , keepin ' the Devil 's hoe from crackin ' him . Patting her hand , which rests on his hoe . If so , I reckon , Polly , it was you . But mebbe jest Old Nick , as he sat hoein ' them hills , and haulin ' in the little heaps o ' squirmin ' critters , kind o ' reco'nized Link as his livin ' image , and so kep him to put in an airthly hell , whar thar ai n't no legs , and worn-out devils sit froze in high-backed chairs , list'nin ' to bugles  --  bugles  --  bugles , callin ' . LINK clutches the sides of his chair , staring . The music draws nearer . POLLY touches him soothingly . POLLY Do n't , dear ; they 'll soon quit playin ' . Never mind ' em . LINK relaxing under her touch . No , never mind ; that 's right . It 's jest that once  --  once we was boys , once we was boys  --  with legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugle . Onct , though , he was : and all God 's life a-snortin ' outn his nostrils , and Hell 's mischief laughin ' outn his eyes , and all the mornin ' winds ablowin ' Glory Hallelujahs , like brass music , from his mouth .  --  But never mind ! ' T ai n't nothin ' : boys in blue ai n't bugles now . Old brass gits rusty , and old underpinnin ' gits rotten , and trapped chipmunks lose their legs . With smoldering fire . But jest the same  --  His face convulses and he cries out , terribly  --  straining in his chair to rise.  --  for holy God , that band ! Why do n't they stop that band ! p. 12 POLLY going.I 'll run and tell them.Sit quiet , dear . I 'll be right back . Glancing back anxiously , POLLY disappears outside . The approaching band begins to play " John Brown 's Body . " LINK sits motionless , gripping his chair . LINK Set quiet ! Dead folks do n't set , and livin ' folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Goda'mighty , how kin he set , and them a-marchin ' thar with old John Brown ? Lord God , you ai n't forgot the boys , have ye ? the boys , how they come marchin ' home to ye , live and dead , behind old Brown , a-singin ' Glory to ye ! Jest look down : thar 's Gettysburg , thar 's Cemetery Ridge : do n't say ye disremember them ! And thar 's the colors : Look , he 's picked ' em up  --  the sergeant 's blood splotched ' em some  --  but thar they be , still flyin ' ! Link done that : Link  --  the spry boy , what they call Chipmunk : you ai n't forgot his double-step , have ye ? Again he cries out , beseechingly.  --  My God , why do You keep on marchin ' and leave him settin ' here ? To the music outside , the voices of children begin to sing the words of " John Brown 's Body . " At the sound , LINK 'S face becomes transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straighten . No !  --  I  --  wo n't  --  set ! Wresting himself mightily , he rises from his chair , and stands . Them are the boys that marched to Kingdom-Come ahead of us , but we keep fallin ' in line . Them voices  --  Lord , I guess you 've brought along your Sunday choir of young angel folks to help the boys out . Following the music with swaying arms . Glory !  --  Never mind me singin ' : you kin drown me out . But I 'm goin ' t ' jine in , or bust ! Joining with the children 's voices , he moves unconsciously along the edge of the woodpile . With stiff steps  --  his one hand leaning on the hoe , his other reached as to unseen hands , that draw him  --  he totters toward the sunlight and the green lawn , at back . As he does so , his thin , cracked voice takes up the battle-hymn where the children 's are singing it : "  --  a-mold'rin ' in the grave , John Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown 's body lies a-mold'rin ' in the grave , But his soul goes  --  " Suddenly he stops , aware that he is walking , and cries aloud , astounded : Lord , Lord , my legs ! Whar did Ye git my legs ? Shaking with delight , he drops his hoe , seizes up the little flag from the woodpile , and waves it joyously . I 'm comin ' , boys ! Link 's loose agin : Chipmunk has sprung his trap . With tottering gait , he climbs the little mound in the woodpile . Now , boys , three cheers for Cemetery Ridge ! Jine in , jine in ! Swinging the flag . Hooray !  --  Hooray !  --  Hooray ! Outside , the music grows louder , and the voices of old men and children sing martially to the brass music.With his final cheer , LINK stumbles down from the mound , brandishes in one hand his hat , in the other the little flag , and stumps off toward the approaching procession into the sunlight , joining his old cracked voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
