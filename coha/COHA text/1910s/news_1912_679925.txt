txt It was in 1910 that Capt . Amundsen was starting on his great expedition to the north pole in the Fram , but there was scanty interest shown in him and his undertaking , and still scantier were his funds . Ever since his first expedition with the Gjoa , however , he had had to sail heavily burdened with debt , for which he was personally responsible , and now , as then , he put out to sea one Summer night in the silence . It was in the Autumn that there came a message from him that in order to raise the necessary funds for his north pole expedition he was bound for the south pole . At first the people were amazed , hardly knowing what to think or what to say . Such a thing was unheard of ? to go to the south pole on his way to the north . Some thought it grand , but others . and these were the many , considered the venture doubtful . There were many who exclaimed that it was wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had him stopped , but the echoes of the controversy reached him not . He had set his course ; as he had determined , and without looking back . The matter Was Soon forgotten , and ' people reverted to their own affairs . It was foggy day after day , week after week  --  a charitable fog of mediocrities in which all that is high and great is shrouded , when all at once , and unexpectedly , a sunoy Spring day dispels the fog . A new message comes . Men stop and look up , and there , high above them shines a deed  --  a man . It is irresistible . It goes like a whirl of rapture through the minds of all . Flags fly aloft and flutter in the bright air . Men look into new and unknown tracts , and for a moment are forgetful of themselves . Yes , we have looked in upon a new land and have read the story of Amundsen 's matchless journey from beginning to end like a new and wonderful tale . So grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique as a deed , as a voyage of discovery , and in its results , and is told so simply as if it were an 1 ? aster pleasure trip on the mountains . And yet what does it not convey of sage , well-laid plans and splendid execution , of determined courage , endurance , and manly power ! Must not even those who know him not glow and rejoice over this , man of iron will , who goes on his own way quietly and , as is his wont , without looking to right or left ? New Light on Age-Old Problems . And what has he now discovered ? New light is thrown upon large questions . Portions of the veil that rests on antarctic Problems are raised . Amundsen has taken a great stride toward solving the last great geographical enigma . Not only is there light cast upon the antarctic of the present day , but it reaches also over the ice caps of the ice periods of remote ages . t is as yet too early to attempt to measure the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light already gleams through what he told us of his sledge journey over the antarctic ice cap . In 1902 Capt . Scott made the important discovery that South Victoria Land continued from 78 degrees south latitude due south , with a high chain of mountains , or rather , a mountainous coast line , far beyond his most southerly point , 82 degrees 17 minutes , and he further found that the glacier surface he was traveling on . along the foot of these high mountains , did not rise noticeably to the southward , for which reason he concluded that it probably must be ice , more or less floating on the sea . Shackleton continued , in 1908 , the discovery of this mountainous coast further southward , past 84 degrees south latitude , arid he penetrated on his bold journey by way of Beardmore Glacier on to King Edward VII . pla. - teau , 8,000 feet to 10,000 feet high inside these mountains , and reached on it 88 degrees 73 minutes south . Amundsen , now for the present , has completed these researches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view , Amundsen seems to have made the discovery that the amount of precipitation was comparatively small in the parts he was in . This will perhaps provide the key to enable us to understand the remarkable glacial conditions that have been found , and explain why the entire land , with-its mountains and valleys , is not buried deep under a continuous ice cap similar to the ice cap of Greerhand . An important discovery is probable in the connection between South Victoria Land and Capt . Scott 's King Edward VII . Land . The New Mountain Range . Perhaps even more remarkable is the vast chain of Queen Maud Mountains , which appears to be a continuation of the Queen Alexandra range , and with Peaks of 12,000 feet and 15,000 feet in height stretches southeastward into the unknown , probably to the other side of the pole in the direction of Weddell Sea , south of South America . This is an important step in the advance toward an understanding of the geography of these hitherto unknown regions , and also a new link in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through Amundsen 's observations we also achieve a final comprehension of the nature of Ross Barrier . It is obviously an enormous glacial mass , floating more or less on the sea in the great bay between South Victoria Land and King Edward VIf . Land . This floating mass of ice is formed and fed by the glaciers which force their way down through the valleys and passes in the great mountain range which stretches southward from South Victoria Land , and similar glaciers may quite possibly originate from the south of Amundsen 's newly found continuation of King Edward VII . Land . It was on such an ice slope , or glacier , which comes down from the higher plateau , that he made his remarkable ascent with his dogs in four days to a height of over 7,000 feet . Another glacier of this kind is Beardmore Glacier. where Shackleton made his dangerous ascent . These glaciers obviously originate from the inner ice cap , which , at a height of from 8,000 feet to 10,000 feet , stretches over the land west and south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Edward VII . ' s plateau , which Shackleton reached , and King Haakon 's plateau , which surrounds the pole itself . The Smooth Surface at the Pole . On account of the unusually low temperature in this region and the resulting small precipitation , this ice cap is not able to grow so great that it can bury the mountains in this case . In the inner porta of Greenland these glacial masses correspond to what in the - Alps-  are called ? Whieh- the . Alacisrs originate and descend into the , 411-6s ? : Amundsen 's descriptions of what he calls the Devil 's Glacier and the Devil 's Ballroom are very remarkable , the ice surface being there so hard that they could not even use skis . As he himself gives minus 5 degrees Centigrade as the maximum temperature during the whole journey at midsummer and after , and as the temperature in these inner regions must be much lower than this , the ice can not , so far as one can judge , be formed by melting . It must rather be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred on the snow fields and on drifting ice near the north pole , where the snow in Winter , in the severe frost and wind , was covered with a sharp and hard ice crust composed of great ice crystals . By the force of the wind , such a surface is kept smooth and hard . As the temperature on the glacial plateau traveled over by Amundsen and Shackleton is so low and precipitation is so small , it is probable that the glaciers originating from it have very little movement . Amundsen 's many height measurements and observations during his journey across these glaciers and the inner plateau , combined with Shackleton 's earlier observations . will be of the greatest importance in enabling us to understand conditions in this remarkable land , which is so perfectly different from all other lands on earth . Tlfey will help us to a clearer understanding of what conditions have been during the former great ice ages . Lieut . Prestrud 's Discoveries . In addition to all this and a great deal more discovered by Amundsen , Lieut . Prestrud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Whales , and the ice barrier in the surrounding neighborhood . We can also expect that this will give information of great geographical and geological importance . All who are acquainted  --  with Amundsen 's previous scientific work will know that his observations of every description are as reliable as the careful use of the instruments at his Command can make them . The heights are measured both with the aid of a hypsometer 1 by determining the boiling point of pure water ) and by an anerolde . And his determination of his position at the pole itself . Is it not like him for the four of his party to take on Dec. 16 an observation every hour for twentyfour hours with the sextant and artificial horizon , in addition to the series of observations on the previous day , and then explore the surrounding neighbor-hood ? There is not much room left for doubt that the expedition , front firstto last , has been carried out on Amundsen 's own plans and calculations , and without a single mishap . No Luck . No Chance . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has had the good fortune that accompanies the strong . Even such a difficult thing as to lay down depots on the flat ice cap , . devoid . of any landmarks , and find them again with certainty , at which former polar explorers leave failed , this man accomplishes with the greatest ease . lie goes through every difficulty as if such a thing never existed . Amundsen and his men have , in truth , accomplished great feats of discovery . They journeyed the whole time through unknown regions , and from first to last Amundsen found his way , It was considered certain in England that Amundsen would make for Beardmore Glacier , discovered by Shackleton , and by that route proceed to the high plateau , since he would be certain there of being able to advance . We , who know the man , did not consider this probable . It would be more like him to make his route away from the tracks . traversed by others , and , fortunately , this surmise is found to be correct . . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincide with the English one . This is a great scientific gain . Scott Sure to do Good Work . Unfortunately , we have so far no information as to Scott 's journey , but his advance southward was in all probability made at about the same time as Arnundsen 's . This is inded a happy circumstance , since the value of the discoveries made by the two expeditions will thereby be mutually augmented to a high degree . Scott is ' an eminent man and a leader of the first rank . His expedition was equipped with unusual completeness , and we can be certain that both he and his men have achieved various discoveries of the very greatest significance . His expedition was a great undertaking , with a staff of scientific experts . He therefore regarded reaching the south pole itself as only one of the many tasks which he had set himself . We therefore could not expect him to have been ahead of Amundsen in the Journey south . 14foreover , besides his dogs .

He may possibly remain there ' another year , if he has not concluded his numerous investigations ' to his satisfaction . The Fram and.Her Crew .

During the time that elapsed from the day when Amundsen landed on the ice until they returned ' to fetch him again . Capt .

In 1913 , as-soon as he has again completed preparations , the Fram will convey him through Bering Strait into the darkness and cold of the North , thence to drift through the polar sea for at least five years . It sounds almost sulperhuman , but Amundsen is the man for- the task , and we may - be sure that achieve it " as well as that which he has just finished .
