txt New York city has elected as mayor a very young man . Jahn Purroy Mitchel is a little older than Eugh J. Grant was when Grant was first elected mayor , and he is two or three years older than Theodore Roosevelt when he was a candidate for mayor . This YOung man is. in his four years ' administration as mayor of New York , to face financial and economic problems of difficulty , some of them quite as difficult as those which Alexander Hamilton worked over when he . at about the same age Mr. Mitchel now is , became secretary of the Treasury in Washingtona administration . New York city now rs burdened with a debt which is greater than the bonded debt of the United States . Unlike our national debt , it is constantly increasing . Many additional millions in money must be secured in the four years of SIr . Mitebel 's administration as mayor . For unless large mounts of money are obtained by borrowing It will be impossible to undertake or even to template public works the reasonableness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest end most expensive system of rapid transit established in any city in the-world , will entail hundreds of millions of dollars . It is true that the city itself will not be obligated for most of this money , but the city 's credit will be availed of in order to procure the marketing of the securities . The recently demonstrated energy of Boston in the direction of so perfecting port facilities as to enable the city to command that share of the ocean ' commerce which her Pne harbor and her commercial importance Justify , has at last stimulated energy in New York city . The result is that able engineers have-now recommended the matron . tion of one of the greatest drydocks in the world . This recommendation is backed by the statement that New York city must have a drydock of this kind or Newport News in the South or Halifax in the North or within a short time , Boston wilt cut heavily into New York 's prestige . A drydock of that kind , however , will costa good deal of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought face to face whet the question : ' Shall New York defend its commercial prestige by building a colossal drydoek even though the city incurs additional indebtedness in doing it ? " There must be great improvements of the dock and pier facilities of the city . The work taken up by General George B. McClellan a year or two after the close of the Civil War , which was left Ineomplete by him , when be bet:Lido governor of New Jersey , will command the consideration of the new administration . General McClellan constructed a sea mall on the Hudson river side of the city from a point near the Battery , which is the lowest point in Manhattan Island , to a point some two miles farther north . But it Is incomplete . It should extend practically the whole length of Manhattan Island on the Hudson river Mae . Public work of this kind , however , will cost a great deal of money . There are other public works whose con. stnntion is justified , in fact made imperative , by the rapid growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure of millions . Then , too , there is the question of the yearly budget . IL is now in excess of the national budget et the time of the Civil War . There was much rejoicing when , a day or two ago , the authorized board found that it could yote for a budget , a few millions under two hundred millions . Wealth in New York city is very heavily taxed and the exaction of the income tax and presumably an increase of state taxation will considerably add to the amount which wealth each yeer is compelled to pay back in the form of taxation . Mr. Mitchel , the newly elated mayor , has gained what even kis political enemies have admitted  --  a highly deserved reputation of possessing the scrutinising ' eye which analyses bills and Items of expenditure , , quick to detect signs of extravagance or dishonesty . It is expected that the service of this kind he will perform while mayor will be of great value , but ha has yet to reveal that he possesses constructive ability 0 the kind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growth are not impaired. ?
