THE room suggests long occupancy : its book-lined walls and old-fashioned furniture indicate the owner 's love of simplicity rather than a small purse . A large engraving of " The Sistine Madonna " in a faded , black wooden frame first catches the eye . Lamps and candle-sticks about are whimsical in shape , and they rest securely in settled places amid the horse-haired sofa and chairs . A fireplace at the left , near a door which opens into DONNA 'S room , casts its wavering light upon a snow-rimmed window by it . The general entrance to the room is in a further corner at the right . Another door on this side leads to MR . LEE 's bedroom . The soft lights , with a suggestion of wind and snow without , give a sense of comfort and intimacy to those within . As the curtain rises , DONNA and MR . LEE , with BARKER waiting on them , are seated at the table just finishing their meal . DONNA is a sweet girl , about twenty , with golden hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though there is a suggestion of strength she gives rather the impression of frank , unspoiled innocence . MR . LEE is middle-aged , handsome , and with a delicate tenderness which somehow is lost at times beneath a spasmodically assumed manner of speech . His hair is already prematurely gray , and while he is powerful to the eye , a close observer might detect signs of physical weakness . He has evidently lived an intent life aimed at a great desire and shadowed by deep sorrow . He is in his long smoking-jacket . BARKER is sixty , fairly vigorous , and unoffensively paternal . By preference he is obviously in a butler 's suit  --  rather old-fashioned . BARKER has placed the ices upon the table , but they are left untouched . Something preoccupies each . BARKER removes the ices , showing that he has noticed they have not been eaten . He places a small cup of coffee before DONNA . She waves it aside in silence . MR . LEE I 'll take coffee to-night , Barker . p. 3 BARKER ( Half reprovingly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always forbid you taking the only things you care about . ( BARKER reluctantly pours it half out . LEE motions him to fill cup . Takes a sip , puts it down , pushing it aside . ) Bah ! Something 's the matter with everything to-night , Barker . BARKER So I see . Neither you or Miss Donna have eaten at all , and I was especially careful on this occasion . DONNA LEE ( Sweetly ) Everything was splendid , Barker , only  --  I  --  I was n't hungry . MR . LEE Neither was I , Barker . BARKER I should have known you would n't be  --  this , last night together . ( LEE motions him to be silent . DONNA rises and crosses , pulls aside the window curtains . She breathes upon the windowpane , and looks absently out with a curious mingling of gravity and controlled nervousness . LEE watches his daughter a second and sighs . ) MR . LEE ( Aside ) Barker , you 're a damn fool ! BARKER So your father said . ( LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . He sits with a slight effort . BARKER looks from one to the other knowingly . There is a broken pause during which BARKER clears the things to a small serving-table in back . ) It was a bad night out , sir . ( No answer . ) Yes , sir . ( He pauses . ) Papers say it 'll be clear to-morrow . Hope so . Church bells sound so much sweeter across the snow  --  after a storm when the air is clear , and the sunlight  --  ( He sees they are paying no attention . He deliberately rattles a plate . They look . ) Yes , sir ! Before we were married , the late Mrs. B. remarked there was sunshine tucked away in most dark clouds . Do n't take it so hard . Suppose it would have broken the late Mrs. B. 's heart , too ,  --  to have seen you leave us , Miss Donna . Never had any children of our own  --  to speak of . Our boy did n't amount to much  --  You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Dear old nursie ; how good she was to me . And I was so cross  --  when I was young . ( LEE grunts . ) BARKER Yes . The late Mrs. B. often remarked it . But she loved you  --  as we did  --  just for crying day and night . MR . LEE Babies always cry at night . ( Thoughtfully ) So do grown people  --  when they cry . Wonder why ? ( He sniffles suspiciously . ) I must have caught a cold . Better bring another log . BARKER ( Choking up ) Yes , sir ; we 've both got colds . Miss Donna , ( She turns ) I have a little wedding present for you . DONNA LEE ( Impulsively ) Oh , no , Barker , you ca n't  --  BARKER Ca n't afford it ? I 'd like to know what I 've been a butler all my life for . DONNA LEE I did n't mean that , Barker . Only Gilbert and I have so many presents , I do n't know how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have your love , your good wishes , your  --  BARKER Yes , Miss . But I have as much right as MR . Lee : he 's only your father . When he was away so often the late Mrs. B. and me combed out your golden curls many a time , and washed your face , and  --  p. 5 DONNA LEE ( Reminiscently ) Yes , yes ,  --  Daddy never saw how dirty I could be ( Laughing ) and how I loved it . BARKER It 's not much . ( He feels in one pocket , then another , until at last he pulls out a plush box containing an old-fashioned jeweled necklace of odd design . ) Hope you 'll wear it to-morrow . It really is n't from me . I 've just been keeping it all these years for you . Had it fixed up a bit . It 's from the late Mrs. B. DONNA LEE ( Takes it tenderly ) Oh ! how lovely ! Look , father ! ( Pause . ) Barker , I should like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she bows her head . He fumbles in fastening it . ) BARKER My fingers are sort of mixed to-night . ( She stifles a little sob . LEE coughs suspiciously , which BARKER notes . ) I 'd better get that log . We 're all catching cold . ( BARKER exits hastily with serving tray . DONNA watches him with teared eyes . The door closes ; pause . LEE grunts . DONNA runs to her father , losing control of herself ; she sobs , kneeling beside him . ) DONNA LEE Oh , Daddy , I ca n't leave you . I ca n't go away alone with Gilbert to-morrow . I do n't want to be married . p. 6 MR . LEE ( Holding her close , with infinite understanding and tenderness throughout ) Girlie ! girlie ! DONNA LEE I ca n't bear leaving home and all my little treasures . I feel just as though I were losing everything I held dearest  --  everything and you , Daddy . MR . LEE I know . I know . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't , my little girl . ( He controls himself . ) Now , I understand how your grandmother must have felt when I took your mother away from home . I never thought I 'd be feeling it myself . It 's twice as hard : I have no one to bear it with me . DONNA LEE Daddy , say I ca n't go . MR . LEE That 's natural . Every girl  --  But you must n't feel this way with Gilbert . ( She looks at him . ) You must n't . DONNA LEE Oh ! I ca n't help it . I 've tried but I ca n't . And I love him so . I 've always loved him so . But he 's going to take me away from you to-morrow , and I 'll be alone with him , and then  --  ( Trembling ) Oh ! I ca n't  --  I ca n't  --  I ca n't . ( She sobs heart-broken on his breast . He soothes her hair . He feels helpless . Long pause. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( He draws a long breath in recollection . ) You need her now , do n't you , girlie ? DONNA LEE Yes  --  yes  --  she 'd understand . MR . LEE Maybe I do a bit , too ; though I 'm only a man . I have n't been father and mother to you all these years without knowing  --  DONNA LEE ( Looking up into his face ) Oh ! Daddy ! you 've been everything to me . Everything a girl could want . That 's partly what makes it so hard to go  --  because I know how it will hurt you to see me leave the church . ( Eagerly ) Oh , Daddy ! why wo n't you come and live with us ? Gilbert wants it . Why do you say you must be alone , now ? MR . LEE Because it 's best , girlie  --  best . You and Gilbert know each other better than most lovers  --  since you were little tots , too , eh ? But there 'll be many new things you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't do to have an old , settled , gray-haired man like me snoozing around meddling and mixing things up . No , no . It 's best young people should start alone . DONNA LEE I suppose you 're right ; you always are . ( He denies this . ) But you said you were going on a long journey . Could n't we  --  p. 8 MR . LEE ( Smiling and concealing significance ) The long journey I start on soon , I shall take alone . DONNA LEE But I could have waited . So would Gilbert , if I had said so . ( Eagerly ) It 's not too late now . If you 'll only say so , we 'll postpone  --  MR . LEE ( Smiling ) No , no  --  DONNA LEE Let me tell him to wait until  --  MR . LEE ( Shaking his head and lifting hers with his two hands until she looks into his eyes ) You think it 's because you 're leaving me and home that you feel this way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I understand the real reason , this last night , girlie . I understand everything . DONNA LEE ( Her head sinks into his lap as she realizes he understands her fear ) Yes , that 's why I am afraid  --  afraid  --  afraid . ( She sobs nervously . There is a long pause while the clock slowly strikes nine . LEE notes it , and looking up sees the Madonna , which has slowly grown out of the darkness as the moonbeams have stolen in through the window . Pause. ) p. 9 MR . LEE ( Rambling casually ) The night is slipping away and the storm has ceased . See ! the moon is struggling a wee bit to silver all the land . It takes me back to another night when  --  ( He sighs . ) Little girl , I 've tried to let you know life as it is with no falseness : for the best women are those who know dark secrets yet keep their hearts pure . You 've been about enough to know  --  enough . Gilbert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he ? ( She nods quickly . ) Gilbert has n't anybody but us . Remember his father ? Often wondered why he asked me to take care of his son after he passed by . Now I know : it was for you . I 've made Gilbert see some of the world  --  for I wanted you both to understand that  --  ( He looks at the jeweled necklace BARKER has given DONNA . ) Good old Barker ! Did you ever think , Donna , that jewels grow in the earth  --  only some one must clean away the darkness before their beauty shines ? Most rare things are like that . ( Making point , and noting its effect upon her . ) Love 's a bit like it , too : the kind that crowns a life . My , my ! how the hours are flying , and soon you and Gilbert will be facing that great world out there  --  hand in hand . ( He impulsively hugs her as if in protection . ) You ca n't know yet how foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've passed . But you all do it , somehow . So there 's not much an old fool of a father can say to you now . ( Looking at Madonna ) Yes , there is one thing : one message . p. 10 DONNA LEE ( Nestling ) Daddy , Gilbert said you 'd wish to talk with me . That 's why he wo n't be here to-night . Oh ! he is so thoughtful and good . Why is it , several times tonight , when I thought of to-morrow , I almost wished he 'd never come ? Ca n't it go on just as it is between him and me ? I do n't want it to be different . I ca n't think of  --  oh , no ! I do n't mean that  --  there 's something wrong with me  --  wrong . I try to be calm and happy  --  but I 'm all upset and afraid of , and  --  oh ! ( He puts his hand on her head and pushes back curls . ) MR . LEE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a bigger meaning  --  to see the spirit in it . ( Looking at Madonna again ) I 've been thinking lately perhaps I 'll have to set you straight about it all . ( BARKER has entered with a log . He fixes the fire in silence , and it burns up . The wind outside is heard occasionally . ) BARKER Shall I light the others ? DONNA LEE Let me . Just the candles and the firelight . We 'll sit beside it , Daddy , you and I , and talk , and the wind outside will tell us we are all alone . BARKER ( Crossing to door ) I 'll get the candles . p. 11 MR . LEE Let Donna . I like to watch her light them . ( DONNA exits . ) BARKER ( After a pause , looking about the room , including picture ) Pardon me , sir , but do you notice anything strange about the room to-night ? ( LEE questions . ) Somehow , it seems so sacred-like . MR . LEE You noticed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Touching himself ) It seems like some memory whispering silently . ( He rises abruptly . ) You sent my note to MR . Gilbert ? BARKER He 's hardly had time to get here yet . MR . LEE Nonsense : I said she wanted to see him . BARKER I 'll show him right in . MR . LEE And go to bed yourself and sleep if you can . ( He places hand on heart quickly as though in great pain . Staggers . BARKER goes to him . ) BARKER Sit down , sir . MR . LEE ( Recovering ) It 's the old trouble , you know . Ca n't keep up much longer . Doctor said so . Rupture of aneurism threatened : that means a broken heart . I 've had a hard time keeping the pieces together since  --  Donna must n't know  --  about my long journey alone  --  that she and Gilbert will only have each other soon  --  very soon . p. 12 BARKER Do n't talk that way , sir . MR . LEE I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ! My ! ( Grimly ) I wonder if you 'll look after me in the next world . BARKER ( Tenderly ) I hope I 've been good enough , sir . ( LEE smiles and pats him tenderly as DONNA re-enters with two long brass candlesticks . The door bell without is rung violently . ) DONNA LEE Remember , Barker , Daddy and I are not home to a single soul . BARKER ( Smiling quaintly ) I understand , Miss  --  not to a single soul . Goodnight . ( He exits . The wind outside blows , and the fire burns brighter . LEE crosses to fireplace , watching her as she places the candlesticks down . The door is flung violently open , and GILBERT STEELE enters hastily , out of breath , excited , throwing his snow-touched coat and hat down on chair . He is a clean-cut , very attractive fellow , about twenty-five , with a touch of boyish vivacity beneath the suggestion of reliable manliness . The two rush into other 's arms . ) DONNA LEE Gilbert ! GILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kisses her eagerly on the lips. ) p. 13 DONNA LEE Why , no , dearest , no . GILBERT STEELE It would break my heart if  --  ( He kisses her again . ) DONNA LEE I 'm so glad you 've come ; but  --  why did you ? MR . LEE I guess I 'm responsible . GILBERT STEELE ( Seeing him ) Oh ! I beg your pardon . ( They greet each other affectionately . ) MR . LEE One does n't always see things in the fire with angels in one 's arms . DONNA LEE Daddy ! GILBERT STEELE I was alone , thinking how  --  how unworthy I was to have such happiness  --  what a weak fellow I 'd been at times  --  and  --  then your note came . ( He gives it to DONNA . ) DONNA LEE ( Reading ) " Come at once . Donna wants to see you . " But I do n't want to see you , Gilbert . GILBERT STEELE Do n't you ? DONNA LEE ( Confused ) Oh , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , Mr. Lee ? I thought you 'd both wish to be alone . Is there something you want me to hear with her ? Nothing 's going to interfere ? p. 14 MR . LEE ( Crosses slowly , puts hand on GILBERT 'S shoulders . Starts to speak seriously , hesitates , and notes DONNA 'S intent look ) Where are you going on your wedding trip ? GILBERT STEELE ( Laughing ) Now , that was n't why  --  DONNA LEE Besides , that 's our little secret . MR . LEE Niagara Falls ? ( They vehemently deny it . ) Well , wherever you go , do n't be too polite to her , and do n't act as though you 'd never been married before . GILBERT STEELE I am afraid everybody 'll know I 'm an amateur . MR . LEE ( Musing ) I 'll never forget how I acted  --  and I was a good deal older than you . My ! how proud and foolish you feel . GILBERT STEELE ( Wisely ) Yes , sir . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She does so : GILBERT takes one , and only smokes it a moment nervously . ) Let me fix you something . GILBERT STEELE No , I 'm not thirsty . p. 15 MR . LEE ( Smiling ) Not thirsty ? That is n't a legitimate excuse ! ( There is a long pause . They look at one another in embarrassed silence . LEE has been smoking also . ) DONNA LEE Well , ca n't we sit down ? GILBERT STEELE Sure . MR . LEE Yes . ( They all keep standing , however . He finally knocks ashes from his pipe , and sits by fireside . ) Come here , the two of you . DONNA LEE Just like when you used to tell us fairy stories . Goodness ! how long ago ! MR . LEE Perhaps that 's what I 'm going to tell you now  --  a real fairy story  --  one I 've lived through and have not finished quite yet . Now a lot of people would laugh at me for talking this way to you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? Life has made me believe in " big " things . Perhaps I am wise and preachy to-night , but I always feel that way , Donna , when  --  when I think of your mother . DONNA LEE ( Reverently ) My mother ! GILBERT STEELE ( Same ) It 's about her you wish to speak to Donna ? ( LEE bows . GILBERT starts to rise . ) Then had n't I better go ? I know you 've always been silent about her . p. 16 MR . LEE No , boy . Stay ! It 's a father 's last words to you both , and a whisper from a memory . ( GILBERT sits beside the two . The clock strikes the half hour . The fire lights the group . The scene is full of poetry and suggestion . ) I had n't amounted to much before I met her : but somehow she believed in me and I felt she did . She made me want to do things , for her sake as well as my own . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to struggle along with me . We married , and she gave up many a better man . You must struggle together for a while . It will bring out the best in you  --  and perhaps I have n't altogether forgotten you  --  But it 's of your mother I was speaking . I brought her from the church here in this room . It has always been home to me all these years . ( Looking about ) It has n't changed much ; only when you grew up , Donna , I moved the bed into my little room off , and put some books in . ( Indicating books under picture of Madonna ) But the pictures and things are about as they were when we first came here together , alone . ( Reminiscently ) She was very beautiful , children , very beautiful , with her soft eyes and golden hair . How those months passed ! We often sat by that window during the long summer evenings : I , talking over my work with her , and she listening gravely and sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here , you know , you were born . I was with Barker in his room . ( Smiling . ) He seemed to think I only needed brandy  --  Ha ! how long it was till the late Mrs. B. came to tell me a little girl had come . They would n't let me speak to your mother that day ; but , at night , I tip-toed into the room and closed that door . We were alone . On the tiny crib a hand rested as though it warned all trespassers away . I could not move for a long while . I felt in some shrine , where no man should have entered . Her breath was calm and steady , like music in the silence . She moved and brushed a curl from her brow , and the moonbeams fell upon her golden hair which haloed everything ! I went nearer , like a thief , to steal a look at you . She did not hear me : she heard the breathing of our child , and only in her dreams . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't so pretty then . ( He smiles . ) And yet I do n't think you ever seemed more wonderful to me . Your mother never moved , even when I knelt beside her and kissed her hand and tried to think the things I felt . ( A long pause , as though he were lost in recollection . DONNA looks up . Puts her hand on his , recalling him . ) I do n't know how long I was there , only from your mother 's face the moonlight rose and threw its rays like fingers pointing to the picture above her bed . ( Indicating Madonna ) It was that same picture . ( Pause . ) Children , there are some things we lock in our hearts and throw away the key or save the key to use it once . You two alone must know I felt somehow that night as though I knew all the secrets of the world  --  for I understood then what love was  --  what marriage really meant to those who really loved . ( Tenderly ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a sense of awe present . ) As I sat there , Gilbert , I resolved to be worthy . We men never feel worthy , do we ? ( GILBERT lowers his head . ) Well , I 've tried to be . ( DONNA squeezes his hand . ) And to that little bit of breathing flesh , now grown so like her mother , I promised all the best that could be  --  so that she would be a worthy wife and mother to the man she loved  --  as her mother was to me . Gilbert , she 's the dearest thing I 'm leaving behind ( Correcting himself ) I have . Take good care of her . I know you will ' cause I know you are worthy , too . ( Long pause . ) Your mother never left her bed . I told her of my midnight visit before she  --  and she only pressed my hand  --  oh ! so faintly  --  and never said a word . But I knew she understood and was proud that her little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna  --  " Madonna " because somehow that night has always been a yesterday . ( He clears his throat . ) Children , never be ashamed of the biggest and best thoughts you feel . I wonder if you two understand the real big thing an old , foolish , sentimental father is trying to tell you this wedding eve ? ( Calmly and reverently DONNA rests her head upon her father 's bosom . He puts his arm about her and looks at GILBERT , who stretches out his hand in understanding and in reverence . GILBERT 's face is set and determined . LEE stands looking at them ; then places their hands in each others . They watch him go back , take a candle , and hold it high above him before the Madonna and her Child . They look reverently at it , too . Pause . He puts the candle on the table near the picture and comes down . ) Donna , go to your room . You 'll want to be all by yourself , now . Say good-night to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the church tomorrow . ( GILBERT reaches over to her , she lifts her lips to his but he gently lowers her head and kisses , with infinite reverence , her hair . She lifts her head , a wonderful smile of spiritual love lighting her eyes . They look at each other firmly . He turns to LEE , offers his hand . LEE hugs him . GILBERT tries to speak but can not . He turns , halts before the Madonna a second , and then exits . DONNA crosses to LEE . He takes her in his arms . She is very calm now . She leaves him , and with a look of emulation , proudly flung to the picture , she crosses and slowly goes off . LEE is alone . He staggers a moment as though seized with heart trouble . He recovers with effort . He puts out the lights , closes the door , fastens the windows , pulls down the shades , cutting out the moonlight and leaving only the firelight and a single candle to light the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Madonna . He half murmurs before it . The clock strikes ten slowly , and he stands there motionless , like some shadow , lost in memory. )
