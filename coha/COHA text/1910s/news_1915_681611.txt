txt The case of the former Hamburg-American steamer Dada , recently sold and transferred to American registry . has assumed a more I serious phase . . ' New circumstances have come to light tending to increase the suspicion that the sale was not bona fide , as understood in international law . and these may put those concerned in a position of having to defend themselves from a charge of bad faith . It is alleged that the Decia has been insured in Hamburg for $50,000 , and an investigation is under way to determine whether there is basis for an assertion that insurance for this amount was placed by the Hemburg-American Company . There appears to be no doubt in well-informed circles here that the vessel obtained $50.000 insurance in the German port , being . unable to obtain insurance on the hull from the Federal War Risk Insurance Bureau or an American company . The United States Government was willing to insure only her cargo or cotton . It is understood , that the British Government has information regarding the source of the insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . Should this be proved , it will be used as evidence before the Prize Court to show that the sale was not of that genuine character which both this Government and Great Britain hold to be required by international law to make bona fide a transfer of a belligerent merchant vessel to a. neutral flag during hostilities . Furthermore , it is asserted that documentary evidence exists that the Dacia was sold under the " stipulation that the steamer shoilld not be used be the new owners in trade with or between British end French ports . This , in itself , would rob the Dacia of all neutral character , and would , it is stated , justify the British Government in seizing and perhaps confiscating her . Formal Warning from England . While it has been made known that the British Government intends to seize the Dada and take her before a Prize Court , it was not until today that a formal warning to that effect was served on the United States Government . A note from Sir Cecil SpringRice , the British Ambassador , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel . The form of this note is as follows : ' They ( his Majesty 's Government ) are prepared either to purchase the cargo at the price which would have been realized by the shippers if it had proceeded to its foreign destination , or , if this course is preferred , to unload and-then reload the cargo to another vessel and forward it to Rotterdam at the cost of the British Government . While they ( the British Government ) are prepared to make these concessions on behalf of the cargo , the question of the ship itself must be regarded as in a different light . There can be no doubt , whatever may be said , that this voyage of the Dacia is being looked to as a test cash . It is quite avident that if the Dacia is allowed to proceed on her voyage and return without interference and without the question being raised as to the validity of the transfer , there would at once he a wholesale purchase of the ships now interned and a transfer of them to neutral flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . It is quite impossible for the British Government to concede without question a point which entails such important consequences , and , if the Dada is captured , they must submit the vessel , apart from her cargo , to the prize court . The Dada was bought by Edward N. Breitung for 5165.000 , which was considerably less than the value of the steamer . The vessel , it is ttated , has been insured for $50,000 in Hamburg . Separate insurance for an amount ' not disclosed was obtained from the Federal War Risk Insurance Bureau on the 11,000 bales of cotton , put on board the vessel at Galveston through Rotterdam for ultimate deliveery to customers in Germany . Stands to Make Big Profit . Information was obtained here tonight that the owners of the Dada were to be paid $190,000 for carrying the cotton to Rotterdam . Thus they would receive $25,000 more than the purchase , price of the vessel for this maiden , -. oyage under the American flag . The value of the cotton is understood to be about f750,000 . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HamburgAmerican Company had anything to do with obtaining insurance it Hamburg for the Dada and that there was an understanding that the steamer , when bought , should not be used in trade with British or French ports . serious consequences might follow , since good faith would be held to be lacking in the transfer if there was any reservation by the company that sould the steamer . In a written statement on ship transfers , Cone Johnson , Solicitor of the tSate Department , who handled negotiations with counsel for Mr. Breitung , when an attempt was made to reach an understanding with England for the Dada to make a single voyage to Rotterdam , gave this opinion : It is the bona fides of the sale Ithich is the essence of a good transfer , and it is not perceived that the ulterior motive , actuating the parties to the transfer , is to govern , though such motive may have been Ule natural advantages in having the shill fly the flag of a neutral . rather than that of a country at war . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of title or interest , without any understanding that the vessel should be re-transferred at the end of hostilities and without other indicia of a simulated or fictitious transfer , and not of a ship in a blockaded port or in transitu , the transfer is valid under international law , as it would be under the London Convention , though the ulterior motive of the vendor and vendee may have been the natura advantages of flying the flag of a country at peace . Conditions Nullify . It is asserted that if the HamburgAmerican Company had any understanding with the purchaser of the vessel , whereby It was not to be used in trade with England or France , this would be attaching conditions to the sale , in the interest of the German Government or nation , as a belligerent , that would nullify the transfer as being without reservation . In this connection it was pointed out in a high quarter tonight that Germany had taken the position and had so notified the United States , in response to inquiries made of the Berlin Foreign Office by Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel from British to American registry , if the transferred steamer was to engage in trade with British ports . The suggestion was further made here tonight that if vessels transferred from the British to the American flag Were not to be permitted to trade with British Ports , and that if German vessels were sold to Americans and put under the American flag with an understanding that they also must not engage in trade with England , the rule would be onesided . DENIAL BY LINE AND BROKERS . Story of Conditional Sale and In= durance Contradicted . All the persons who could be reached in New York yesterday in reference to the allegation that the Dacia was sold under an agreement that she would be used in trade with France or England denied the statement outr'ght , or said that they had no knowledge on the sub ject . William G. Sickel , one of the representatives of the Hamburg-American Line in New York , stated positively that , as far as he knew , no agreement had been made by any one , in which the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain or France . He also denied without qualification that the ' Hamburg-American Line had placed $50,000 insurance on the Dada in Hamburg . When the reports of the agreement and the insurance were repeated to Karl Buenz , another of the Hamburg-American representatives in the city , he said : " I know nothing about it . " Egon von Novelly and Sidney Hoey , the brokers who negotiated the sale of the Dada , say they had no knowledge of any stipulations as to the use to which the Dacia was to be put . They reasserted their statements of last Saturday that the sale was bona fide in every respect . " I was not present at all of the conferences with the Hamburg-American officials , " said Mr. Hoey , " but I d:d of hear any such stipulations discussed when I was present . ' " I am positive , " said Mr. Novelly , " that there is nothing in the contract about not using the Dacia for trading with countries which are at war with Germany . " E. N. Breitung , who bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or home but William A. Ham'iton . Secretary of the Breitung Mines Corporation , said last night : " No one is at liberty to say anything about the Dada except Mr. Breitung himself . I can only say that the purchase of the Dada was bona fide and I upeon tional , as it was accepted at shirgton . " A- member of the Breitung family said that Mr. Breitung was at first anxious ' to explain his reasons for buying the Dada , but since to much had been publ'shed about it he had decided to say nothing . That " package of important panel 's " which delayed the sailing of the Dacia , as stated in a dispatch from Galveston printed in yesterday 's TIMES , will figure prominently in case of the Dada 's seizure on the high seas . The package contains copies or photographs of all of the checks and papers which wer epassed in the sale of the ship by the HamburgAmerican Line to Mr. Breitung . The original papers and the checks accepted by the Hamburg-American Line were sent to Secretary Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel , it is understood , will ask for immediate release and will show the copies of the checks and letters as proof of bona fide American registry . If the boat is taken to port in spite of this display of documents , the package , according to the plans , will accompany the vessel and will be offered in the prize court as proof of unlawful seizure . This plan to equip the master of the Dacia with a duplicate set of documents , it was stated yesterday , was adopted upon suggestions from Washington . The documents were sent from here Friday and should have reached the Dacia 's Captain yesterday . Mr. l3reitung 's lawyer Is Henry S. Hooker , 52 Wall Street , who is a law partner of Franklin D. Roosevelt , Assistant Secretary of the Navy . He refused to be interviewed yesterday , but it was said on good authority that he would act for Mr. Breitung in case the Dacia reached a foreign prize court . A man conversant with the Dacia sale said yesterday that the transfer of this ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of its ships interned in outlying ports . Other ships of that line lying in New Orleans and Cuba have been offered for sale , and another freighter which was interned in San Francisco has been sold . The Hamburg-American Line . It was said , was anxious to keep the vessels now lying in the Ports of Boston . New York . and Philadelphia . and that none of the large new liners had been offered for sale .
