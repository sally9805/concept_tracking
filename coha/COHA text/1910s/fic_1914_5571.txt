PONTEACH By ROBERT ROGERS Illustration : MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS ( 1727-1795 ) Robert Rogers , a soldier of fortune , is the Davy Crockett of Colonial times . Born at Dumbarton , New Hampshire , on November 17th ( some authorities say 1730 , another 1731 , while the Dictionary of National Biography says 1727 ) , he was the son of James Rogers , a farmer living in a frontier cabin at Methuen , in upper Massachusetts . Robert 's boyhood was spent in an atmosphere characteristic of pioneer life . He had scarcely passed his fifteenth year ( Nevins claims in 1746 ) , when he helped withstand an attack of Indians near his home , and this may be considered his first active experience with the Red Man . From this time on , the history of the career of Robert Rogers is the history of the efforts of the Colonists against the Indians as far west as Detroit , and as far south as South Carolina . The necessity which confronted all of the Colonists made of young Rogers one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection he was associated with the famous John Stark , of Green Mountain Boys reputation . In the latter 's Memoir , written by Caleb Stark , we have as graphic a pen-picture of Rogers , the hunter , at twenty-two , as we have actual likenesses of Rogers in the pictures of the time. 1 Evidently Rogers flourished financially at this period , for we find him buying land in Massachusetts in 1753 . His activity as a soldier in the French and Indian War put him in command of a company , known as " Rogers ' Rangers , " and he participated in the Siege of Detroit against Pontiac and the French . This experience of his must have fired Rogers with the desire , after careful consideration of the condition of the Indian , to put his special plea for the cause of the Red Man in some permanent literary form , for " Ponteach " was published in 1766 , after Rogers had left America , had gone to London , and thence had taken vessel for Algiers , where he fought under Dey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing that he could afford to turn his attention to family affairs . We find him visiting Portsmouth , New Hampshire , where Elizabeth , daughter of the Reverend Arthur Browne , lived . The two were married on June 30th of that year ; but evidently there was about Robert Rogers something his father-in-law did not quite relish . For , in 1763 , a dispute arose between the two , because of Rogers ' increasing dissipation . That they did not reach , however , any immediate open rupture , may have been due very largely to the fact that Rogers was becoming quite a land-owner in New York and New Hampshire . It was not until March 4 , 1778 , after Rogers had gone through many and varied experiences , not the least of which was serving a term in the Debtors ' Prison in England , that his wife was granted , by the New Hampshire Legislature , a decree of divorce . She thereupon married Captain John Poach . Naturally , most of the interest attached to Rogers is historical , not literary . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his " Journal of the French and Indian War , " which was published in London in 1765 ; his activity in the Cherokee War in South Carolina ; 2 his association with William Bird , when he had an opportunity of studying the methods of Indian guides ; his political ambitions when he returned to England in 1765  --  all of these are matters for the historian , and have received adequate consideration by Francis Parkman and other writers . During these activities , Rogers was not idle with his pen . He kept his Journals , and they clearly reveal how much of a ranger he was . After the fashion of the times , when he returned to England , anxious to let his friends know of the conditions in America , he not only published his Journals ( 1769 ) , but also a concise account of North America ( 1770 ) . But there must have been something about Rogers as a soldier of fortune that was not as straight or as honest as Davy Crockett . We find him , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducting affairs so illy that he was tried for treason . He may have advanced as a soldier through the successive ranks to Major , but it would seem that the higher up he advanced in position the more unscrupulous he became . After serving his term in the Debtors ' Prison , which began on June 14 , 1773 , he returned to America , at the beginning of the Revolution . Among his Colonial friends , he not only counted John Stark , the ranger , but Israel Putnam as well , both of them ardent patriots and upholders of the American cause . It would seem , in 1775 , that Rogers , to all outward appearance , was himself in sympathy with America . He professed being the staunch lover of those principles which America was upholding . But General Washington soon had cause to doubt his loyalty , and he was watched . With the result that his arrest was ordered , and thereupon he confessed his adherence to the Crown . Rogers then joined the forces of General Howe , bringing with him an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and adjacent territory . He was put in command of a company , known as the " Queen 's Rangers , " and throughout the Revolution fought bravely on the opposing side . After returning to England , he battled for further recognition , but never received the full honours he courted . He died on May 18 , 1795 , in South London . " Ponteach " was probably never given in Rogers 's time . There is no record of its even having been considered by any of the theatrical companies . It was published in 1766 , with a London imprint on the title-page. 3 There is some slight probability that it was given an amateur production at Lake George by the summer residents there  --  certainly an appropriate spot to present a play by Rogers , inasmuch as the Ranger was known in that neighbourhood , and there is now familiar to all visitors a place called " Rogers 's Slide , " marking one of his escapades with the Indians . In the present collection , the editor has followed the text of the 1766 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allan Nevins in his edition of the play which , with an Introduction , Biography , and invaluable historical notes , was published in 1914 by the Caxton Club of Chicago. 4 This piece is one which is not only interesting as representative of the early type of Indian drama in America , but it is also interesting as reflective of the attitude of a dramatist with a problem to propound . " Ponteach " is our first American problem play . Parkman claims that at least part of it was written by Rogers , thus throwing doubt on his entire claim to authorship . There is not only a dignity displayed in the drawing of the main character of the Indian , but there is a very naive attempt at subtle humour in the characters of the Englishmen . There is no distinct excellence in depicting Indian character as such , after the romantic manner of Cooper , although Rogers , with his English tradition , has been able to lend to his dialogue a certain dignity of diction which is striking , and which gives the play a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document  --  and Mr. Nevins does this  --  one can trace in " Ponteach " the whole range of Rogers 's experience as an Indian fighter . There are constant allusions in the text to matters which Mr. Nevins has found necessary to explain in copious footnotes , and therefore to the student I would recommend this single edition of the play . " Ponteach " is published here , not from a scholarly standpoint , but simply as an example of early Indian drama . Of these Indian dramas , there are many examples in the early history of American playwriting . Laurence Hutton has an entertaining chapter on the subject in his " Curiosities of the American Stage , " in which he enumerates such titles as " Oroloosa , " " Oroonoka , " " Miautoumah , " to say nothing of " Hiawatha . " " Metamora ; or , The Last of the Wampanoags " was brought to success through the powerful acting of Edwin Forrest , December 15 , 1829 .

PONTEACH : OR THE SAVAGES OF AMERICA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'DOLE and MURPHEY , two Indian Traders , and their Servants . M'DOLE . So , Murphey , you are come to try your Fortune Among the Savages in this wild Desart ? MURPHEY . Ay , any Thing to get an honest Living , Which ' faith I find it hard enough to do ; Times are so dull , and Traders are so plenty , That Gains are small , and Profits come but slow . M'DOLE . Are you experienc 'd in this kind of Trade ? Know you the Principles by which it prospers , And how to make it lucrative and safe ? If not , you 're like a Ship without a Rudder , That drives at random , and must surely sink . MURPHEY . I 'm unacquainted with your Indian Commerce , And gladly would I learn the Arts from you , Who 're old , and practis 'd in them many Years . M'DOLE . That is the curst Misfortune of our Traders , A thousand Fools attempt to live this Way , Who might as well turn Ministers of State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform you Of all the secret Arts by which we thrive , Which if all practis 'd , we might all grow rich , Nor circumvent each other in our Gains . What have you got to part with to the Indians ? MURPHEY . I 've Rum and Blankets , Wampum , Powder , Bells , And such-like Trifles as they 're wont to prize . M'DOLE . ' T is very well : your Articles are good : But now the Thing 's to make a Profit from them , Worth all your Toil and Pains of coming hither . Our fundamental Maxim is this , That it 's no Crime to cheat and gull an Indian . MURPHEY . How ! Not a Sin to cheat an Indian , say you ? Are they not Men ? hav' n't they a Right to Justice As well as we , though savage in their Manners ? M'DOLE . Ah ! If you boggle here , I say no more ; This is the very Quintessence of Trade , And ev'ry Hope of Gain depends upon it ; None who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or can by Indian Commerce . By this old Ogden built his stately House , Purchas 'd Estates , and grew a little King . He , like an honest Man , bought all by Weight , And made the ign'rant Savages believe That his Right Foot exactly weigh 'd a Pound : By this for many Years he bought their Furs , And died in Quiet like an honest Dealer . MURPHEY . Well , I 'll not stick at what is necessary : But his Device is now grown old and stale , Nor could I manage such a barefac 'd Fraud . M'DOLE . A thousand Opportunities present To take Advantage of their Ignorance ; But the great Engine I employ is Rum , More pow'rful made by certain strength'ning Drugs . This I distribute with a lib'ral Hand , Urge them to drink till they grow mad and valiant ; Which makes them think me generous and just , And gives full Scope to practise all my Art . I then begin my Trade with water 'd Rum , The cooling Draught well suits their scorching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : My Scales are honest , but so well contriv 'd , That one small Slip will turn Three Pounds to One ; Which they , poor silly Souls ! ignorant of Weights And Rules of Balancing , do not perceive . But here they come ; you 'll see how I proceed . Jack , is the Rum prepar 'd as I commanded ? JACK . Yes , sir , all 's ready when you please to call . M'DOLE . Bring here the Scales and Weights immediately . You see the Trick is easy and conceal 'd . Shewing how to slip the scales . MURPHEY . By Jupiter , it 's artfully contriv 'd ; And was I King , I swear I 'd knight th ' Inventor.  --  Tom , mind the Part that you will have to act . TOM . Ah , never fear , I 'll do as well as Jack . But then , you know , an honest Servant 's Pains Deserve Reward . MURPHEY . O ! I 'll take care of that . Enter a number of INDIANS with packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indians here to-day ? M'DOLE . Yes , if my Goods will suit , and we agree . 2ND INDIAN . ' T is Rum we want , we 're tired , hot , and thirsty . 3RD INDIAN . You , Mr. Englishman , have you got Rum ? M'DOLE . Jack , bring a Bottle , pour them each a Gill . You know which Cask contains the Rum . The Rum ? 1ST INDIAN . It 's good strong Rum , I feel it very soon . M'DOLE . Give me a Glass . Here 's Honesty in Trade ; We English always drink before we deal . 2ND INDIAN . Good Way enough ; it makes one sharp and cunning . M'DOLE . Hand round another Gill . You 're very welcome . 3RD INDIAN . Some say you Englishmen are sometimes Rogues ; You make poor Indians drunk , and then you cheat . 1ST INDIAN . No , English good . The Frenchmen give no Rum . 2ND INDIAN . I think it 's best to trade with Englishmen . M'DOLE . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much you ask per Quart for this strong Rum ? M'DOLE . Five Pounds of Beaver for One Quart of Rum . 1ST INDIAN . Five Pounds ? Too much . Which is ' t you call Five Pound ? M'DOLE . This little Weight . I can not give you more . 1ST INDIAN . Well , take ' em ; weigh ' em . Do n't you cheat us now . M'DOLE . No : He that cheats an Indian should be hang 'd . Weighing the packs . There 's Thirty Pounds precisely of the Whole ; Five times Six is Thirty . Six Quarts of Rum . Jack , measure it to them : you know the Cask . This Rum is sold . You draw it off the best . Exeunt INDIANS to receive their rum . MURPHEY . By Jove , you 've gain 'd more in a single Hour Than ever I have done in Half a Year ; Curse on my Honesty ! I might have been A little King , and liv 'd without Concern , Had I but known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's the Way , my honest Friend , to live . Clapping his shoulder . There 's Ninety Weight of Sterling Beaver for you , Worth all the Rum and Trinkets in my Store ; And , would my Conscience let me to the Thing , I might enhance my Price , and lessen theirs , And raise my Profits to an higher Pitch . MURPHEY . I ca n't but thank you for your kind Instructions , As from them I expect to reap Advantage . But should the Dogs detect me in the Fraud , They are malicious , and would have Revenge . M'DOLE . Ca n't you avoid them ? Let their Vengeance light On others ' Heads , no matter whose , if you Are but secure , and have the Cain in Hand : For they 're indiff'rent where they take Revenge , Whether on him that cheated , or his Friend , Or on a Stranger whom they never saw , Perhaps an honest Peasant , who ne'er dreamt Of Fraud or Villainy in all his life ; Such let them murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while we secure the Gain , Nor shall we feel the bleeding Victims Pain . Exeunt . SCENE II . A Desart . Enter ORSBOURN and HONNYMAN , two English Hunters . ORSBOURN . Long have we toil 'd , and rang 'd the Woods in vain , No Game , nor Track , nor Sign of any Kind Is to be seen ; I swear I am discourag 'd And weary 'd out with this long fruitless Hunt . No Life on Earth besides is half so hard , So full of Disappointments , as a Hunter 's : Each Morn he wakes he views the destin 'd Prey , And counts the Profits of th ' ensuing Day ; Each Ev'ning at his curs 'd ill Fortune pines , And till next Day his Hope of Gain resigns . By Jove , I 'll from these Desarts hasten home , And swear that never more I 'll touch a Gun . HONNYMAN . These hateful Indians kidnap all the Game . Curse their black Heads ! they fright the Deer and Bear , And ev'ry Animal that haunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No Englishman can get a single Shot , While they go loaded home with Skins and Furs . ' T were to be wish 'd not one of them survived , Thus to infest the World , and plague Mankind . Curs 'd Heathen Infidels ! mere savage Beasts ! They do n't deserve to breathe in Christian Air , And should be hunted down like other Brutes . ORSBOURN . I only wish the Laws permitted us To hunt the savage Herd where e'er they 're found ; I 'd never leave the Trade of Hunting then , While one remain 'd to tread and range the Wood . HONNYMAN . Curse on the Law , I say , that makes it Death To kill an Indian , more than to kill a Snake . What if ' t is Peace ? these Dogs deserve no Mercy ; Cursed revengeful , cruel , faithless Devils ! They kill 'd my Father and my eldest Brother . Since which I hate their very Looks and Name . ORSBOURN . And I , since they betray 'd and kill 'd my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tho ' these are not the same , ' t would ease my Heart To cleave their painted Heads , and spill their Blood . I abhor , detest , and hate them all , And now cou 'd eat an Indian 's Heart with Pleasure . HONNYMAN . I 'd join you , and soop his savage Brains for Sauce ; I lose all Patience when I think of them , And , if you will , we 'll quickly have Amends For our long Travel and successless Hunt , And the sweet Pleasure of Revenge to boot . ORSBOURN . What will you do ? Present , and pop one down ? HONNYMAN . Yes , faith , the first we meet well fraught with Furs ; Or if there 's Two , and we can make sure Work , By Jove , we 'll ease the Rascals of their Packs , And send them empty home to their own Country . But then observe , that what we do is secret , Or the Hangman will come in for Snacks . ORSBOURN . Trust me for that ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nicer Aim , or steadier Hand , Would shoot a Tyger than I would an Indian . There is a Couple stalking now this Way With lusty Packs ; Heav'n favour our Design . HONNYMAN . Silence ; conceal yourself , and mind your Eye . ORSBOURN . Are you well charg 'd ? HONNYMAN . I am . Take you the nearest , And mind to fire exactly when I do . ORSBOURN . A charming Chance ! HONNYMAN . Hush , let them still come nearer . They shoot , and run to rifle the INDIANS . They 're down , old Boy , a Brace of noble Bucks ! ORSBOURN . Well tallow 'd , faith , and noble Hides upon ' em . Taking up a pack . We might have hunted all the Season thro ' For Half this Game , and thought ourselves well paid . HONNYMAN . By Jove , we might , and been at great Expence For Lead and Powder , here 's a single Shot . ORSBOURN . I swear I 've got as much as I can carry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack is heavy . But stop ; we must conceal the tawny Dogs , Or their blood-thirsty Countrymen will find them , And then we 're bit . There 'll be the Devil to pay , They 'll murder us , and cheat the Hangman too . ORSBOURN . Right . We 'll prevent all Mischief of this Kind . Where shall we hide their savage Carcases ? HONNYMAN . There they will lie conceal 'd and snug enough  --  They cover them . But stay  --  perhaps ere long there 'll be a War , And then their Scalps will sell for ready Cash Two Hundred Crowns at least , and that 's worth saving . ORSBOURN . Well ! that is true , no sooner said than done  --  Drawing his knife . I 'll strip this Fellow 's painted greasy Skull . Strips off the scalp . HONNYMAN . A damn 'd tough Hide , or my Knife 's devilish dull  --  Takes the other scalp . Now let them sleep to-night without their Caps , And pleasant Dreams attend their long Repose . ORSBOURN . Their Guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need them on their present Journey . HONNYMAN . The Devil hates Arms , and dreads the Smell of Powder ; He 'll not allow such Instruments about him , They 're free from training now , they 're in his Clutches . ORSBOURN . But , Honnyman , d'ye think this is not Murder ? I vow I 'm shock 'd a little to see them scalp 'd , And fear their Ghosts will haunt us in the Dark . HONNYMAN . It 's no more Murder than to crack a Louse , That is , if you 've the Wit to keep it private . And as to Haunting , Indians have no Ghosts , But as they live like Beasts , like Beasts they die . I 've kill 'd a Dozen in this self-same Way , And never yet was troubled with their Spirits . ORSBOURN . Then I 'm content ; my Scruples are remov 'd . And what I 've done , my Conscience justifies . But we must have these Guns and Hatchets alter 'd , Or they 'll detect th ' Affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly done  --  Let us with Speed return , And think no more of being hang 'd or haunted ; But turn our Fur to Gold , our Gold to Wine , Thus gaily spend what we 've so slily won , And bless the first Inventor of a Gun . Exeunt . SCENE III . An English Fort . Enter Colonel COCKUM and Captain FRISK . COCKUM . What shall we do with these damn 'd bawling Indians ? They 're swarming every Day with their Complaints Of Wrongs and Injuries , and God knows what  --  I wish the Devil would take them to himself . FRISK . Your Honour 's right to wish the Devil his Due . I 'd send the noisy Hellhounds packing hence , Nor spend a Moment in debating with them . The more you give Attention to their Murmurs , The more they 'll plague and haunt you every Day , Besides , their old King Ponteach grows damn 'd saucy , Talks of his Power , and threatens what he 'll do . Perdition to their faithless sooty Souls , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COCKUM . Captain , You 're right ; their Insolence is such As beats my Patience ; cursed Miscreants ! They are encroaching ; fain would be familiar : I 'll send their painted Heads to Hell with Thunder ! I swear I 'll blow ' em hence with Cannon Ball , And give the Devil an Hundred for his Supper . FRISK . They 're coming here ; you see they scent your Track , And while you 'll listen , they will ne'er be silent , But every Day improve in Insolence . COCKUM . I 'll soon dispatch and storm them from my Presence . Enter PONTEACH , and other Indian CHIEFS . PONTEACH . Well , Mr. Colonel Cockum , what d ' they call you ? You give no Answer yet to my Complaint ; Your Men give my Men always too much Rum , Then trade and cheat ' em . What ! d ' ye think this right ? COCKUM . Tush ! Silence ! hold your noisy cursed Nonsense ; I 've heard enough of it ; what is it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not command your Men ? Let ev'ry one be a Rogue that has a Mind to ' t . COCKUM . Why , curse your Men , I suppose they wanted Rum ; They 'll rarely be content , I know , without it . PONTEACH . What then ? If Indians are such Fools , I think White Men like you should stop and teach them better . COCKUM . I 'm not a Pedagogue to your curs 'd Indians . Aside . PONTEACH . Colonel , I hope that you 'll consider this . FRISK . Why , do n't you see the Colonel will not hear you ? You 'd better go and watch your Men yourself , Nor plague us with your cursed endless Noise ; We 've something else to do of more Importance . PONTEACH . Hah ! Captain Frisk , what ! you a great man too ? My Bus'ness here is only with your Colonel ; And I 'll be heard , or know the Reason why . 1ST CHIEF . I thought the English had been better Men . 2ND CHIEF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , and make good Promises . COCKUM . You may be d  --   --  d , and all your Frenchmen too . PONTEACH . Be d  --   --  d ! what 's that ? I do not understand . COCKUM . The Devil teach you ; he 'll do it without a Fee . PONTEACH . The Devil teach ! I think you one great Fool . Did your King tell you thus to treat the Indians ? Had he been such a Dunce he ne'er had conquer 'd , And made the running French for Quarter cry . I always mind that such proud Fools are Cowards , And never do aught that is great or good . COCKUM . Forbear your Impudence , you curs 'd old Thief ; This Moment leave my Fort , and to your Country . Let me hear no more of your hellish Clamour , Or to D  --   --  n I will blow you all , And feast the Devil with one hearty Meal . PONTEACH . So ho ! Know you whose Country you are in ? Think you , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now become your Slaves ? This Country 's mine , and here I reign as King ; I value not your Threats , nor Forts , nor Guns ; I have got Warriors , Courage , Strength , and Skill . Colonel , take care ; the Wound is very deep , Consider well , for it is hard to cure . Exeunt INDIANS . FRISK . Vile Infidels ! observe their Insolence ; Old Ponteach puts on a mighty Air . COCKUM . They 'll always be a Torment till destroy 'd , And sent all headlong to the Devil 's Kitchen . This curs 'd old Thief , no doubt , will give us Trouble , Provok 'd and madded at his cool Reception . FRISK . Oh ! Colonel , they are never worth our minding , What can they do against our Bombs and Cannon ? True , they may skulk , and kill and scalp a few , But , Heav'n be thank 'd , we 're safe within these Walls : Besides , I think the Governors are coming , To make them Presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appease their bloody Minds , And keep them quiet for some little Term . God send the Day that puts them all to sleep , Come , will you crack a Bottle at my Tent ? FRISK . With all my Heart , and drink D  --   --  n to them . COCKUM . I can in nothing more sincerely join . Exeunt . SCENE IV . An Apartment in the Fort . Enter Governors SHARP , GRIPE , and CATCHUM . SHARP . Here are we met to represent our King , And by his royal Bounties to conciliate These Indians ' Minds to Friendship , Peace , and Love . But he that would an honest Living get In Times so hard and difficult as these , Must mind that good old Rule , Take care of One . GRIPE . Ay , Christian Charity begins at home ; I think it 's in the Bible , I know I 've read it . CATCHUM . I join with Paul , that he 's an Infidel Who does not for himself and Friends provide . SHARP . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as well as most . All good and wise Men certainly take care To help themselves and Families the first ; Thus dictates Nature , Instinct , and Religion , Whose easy Precepts ought to be obey 'd . GRIPE . But how does this affect our present Purpose ? We 've heard the Doctrine ; what 's the Application ? SHARP . We are intrusted with these Indian Presents . A Thousand Pound was granted by the King , To satisfy them of his Royal Goodness , His constant Disposition to their Welfare , And reconcile their savage Minds to Peace . Five hundred 's gone ; you know our late Division , Our great Expence , Et cetera , no Matter : The other Half was laid out for these Goods , To be distributed as we think proper ; And whether Half ( I only put the Question ) Of these said Goods , wo n't answer every End , And bring about as long a lasting Peace As tho ' the Whole were lavishly bestow 'd ? CATCHUM . I 'm clear upon ' t they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent them by the King . GRIPE . There is no doubt but that One Third wou 'd answer , For they , poor Souls ! are ign'rant of the Worth Of single Things , nor know they how to add Or calculate , and cast the whole Amount . SHARP . Why , Want of Learning is a great Misfortune . How thankful should we be that we have Schools , And better taught and bred than these poor Heathen . CATCHUM . Yes , only these Two simple easy Rules , Addition and Subtraction , are great Helps , And much contribute to our happiness . SHARP . ' T is these I mean to put in Practice now ; Subtraction from these Royal Presents makes Addition to our Gains without a Fraction . But let us overhaul and take the best , Things may be given that wo n't do to sell . They overhaul the goods , &amp;c . CATCHUM . Lay these aside ; they 'll fetch a noble Price . GRIPE . And these are very saleable , I think . SHARP . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Half , think you ? GRIPE . It 's thereabouts . CATCHUM . This bag of Wampum may be added yet . SHARP . Here , Lads , convey these Goods to our Apartment . SERVANT . The Indians , sir , are waiting at the Gate . GRIPE . Conduct them in when you 've disposed of these . CATCHUM . This should have been new-drawn before they enter 'd . Pulling out an inventory of the whole goods . GRIPE . What matters that ? They can not read , you know , And you can read to them in gen'ral Terms . Enter PONTEACH , with several of his Chieftains . SHARP . Welcome , my Brothers , we are glad to meet you , And hope that you will not repent our coming . PONTEACH . We 're glad to see our Brothers here the English . If honourable Peace be your Desire , We 'd always have the Hatchet buried deep , While Sun and Moon , Rivers and Lakes endure , And Trees and Herbs within our Country grow . But then you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Reproach , Contempt , and Scorn ; Else we will raise the Hatchet to the Sky , And let it never touch the Earth again , Sharpen its Edge , and keep it bright as Silver , Or stain it red with Murder and with Blood . Mind what I say , I do not tell you Lies . SHARP . We hope you have no Reason to complain That Englishmen conduct to you amiss ; We 're griev 'd if they have given you Offence , And fain would heal the Wound while it is fresh , Lest it should spread , grow painful , and severe . PONTEACH . Your Men make Indians drunk , and then they cheat ' em . Your Officers , your Colonels , and your Captains Are proud , morose , ill-natur 'd , churlish Men , Treat us with Disrespect , Contempt , and Scorn . I tell you plainly this will never do , We never thus were treated by the French , Them we thought bad enough , but think you worse . SHARP . There 's good and bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good Indians , some are the reverse , Whom you ca n't govern , and restrain from ill ; So there 's some Englishmen that will be bad . You must not mind the Conduct of a few , Nor judge the rest by what you see of them . PONTEACH . If you 've some good , why do n't you send them here ? These every one are Rogues , and Knaves , and Fools , And think no more of Indians than of Dogs . Your King had better send his good Men hither , And keep his bad ones in some other Country ; Then you would find that Indians would do well , Be peaceable , and honest in their Trade ; We 'd love you , treat you , as our Friends and Brothers , And Raise the Hatchet only in your Cause . SHARP . Our King is very anxious for your Welfare , And greatly wishes for your Love and Friendship ; He would not have the Hatchet ever raised , But buried deep , stamp 'd down and cover 'd o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this he sent us to your distant Country , Bid us deliver you these friendly Belts , Holding out belts of wampum . All cover 'd over with his Love and Kindness . He like a Father loves you as his Children ; And like a Brother wishes you all Good ; We 'll let him know the Wounds that you complain of , And he 'll be speedy to apply the Cure , And clear the Path to Friendship , Peace , and Trade . PONTEACH . Your King , I hear ' s a good and upright Man , True to his word , and friendly in his Heart ; Not proud and insolent , morose and sour , Like these his petty Officers and Servants : I want to see your King , and let him know What must be done to keep the Hatchet dull , And how the Path of Friendship , Peace , and Trade May be kept clean and solid as a Rock . SHARP . Our King is distant over the great Lake , But we can quickly send him your Requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And act as tho ' you told him with your Tongue . PONTEACH . Let him know then his People here are Rogues , And cheat and wrong and use the Indians ill . Tell him to send good Officers , and call These proud ill-natur 'd Fellows from my Country , And keep his Hunters from my hunting Ground . He must do this , and do it quickly too , Or he will find the Path between us bloody . SHARP . Of this we will acquaint our gracious King , And hope you and your Chiefs will now confirm A solid Peace as if our King was present ; We 're his Ambassadors , and represent him , And bring these Tokens of his Royal Friendship To you , your Captains , Chiefs , and valiant Men . Read , Mr. Catchum , you 've the Inventory . CATCHUM . The British King , of his great Bounty , sends To Ponteach , King upon the Lakes , and his Chiefs , Two hundred , No Aside a Number of fine Blankets , Six hundred Aside Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bag of Wampum , A Parcel too of Pans , and Knives , and Kettles . SHARP . This rich and royal Bounty you 'll accept , And as you please distribute to your Chiefs , And let them know they come from England 's King , As Tokens to them of his Love and Favour . We 've taken this long Journey at great Charge , To see and hold with you this friendly Talk ; We hope your Minds are all disposed to Peace , And that you like our Sovereign 's Bounty well . 1ST CHIEF . We think it very small , we heard of more . Most of our Chiefs and Warriors are not here , They all expect to share a Part with us. 2ND CHIEF . These wo n't reach round to more than half our Tribes , Few of our Chiefs will have a single Token Of your King 's Bounty , that you speak so much of . 3RD CHIEF . And those who have n't will be dissatisfied , Think themselves slighted , think your King is stingy , Or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master 's Bounty for yourselves . 4TH CHIEF . We hear such Tricks are sometimes play 'd with Indians . King Astenaco , the great Southern Chief , Who 's been in England , and has seen your King , Told me that he was generous , kind , and true , But that his Officers were Rogues and Knaves , And cheated Indians out of what he gave . GRIPE . The Devil 's in ' t , I fear that we 're detected . Aside . PONTEACH . Indians a' n't Fools , if White Men think us so ; We see , we hear , we think as well as you ; We know there ' re Lies , and Mischiefs in the World ; We do n't know whom to trust , nor when to fear ; Men are uncertain , changing as the Wind , Inconstant as the Waters of the Lakes , Some smooth and fair , and pleasant as the Sun , Some rough and boist'rous , like the Winter Storm ; Some are Insidious as the subtle Snake , Some innocent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruel , fierce , Some like the Lamb , humble , submissive , mild , And scarcely one is every Day the same ; But I call no Man bad , till such he 's found , Then I condemn and cast him from my Sight ; And no more trust him as a Friend and Brother . I hope to find you honest Men and true . SHARP . Indeed you may depend upon our Honours , We 're faithful Servants of the best of Kings ; We scorn an Imposition on your Ignorance , Abhor the Arts of Falsehood and Deceit . These are the Presents our great Monarch sent , He 's of a bounteous , noble , princely Mind And had he known the Numbers of your Chiefs , Each would have largely shar 'd his Royal Goodness ; But these are rich and worthy your Acceptance , Few Kings on Earth can such as these bestow , For Goodness , Beauty , Excellence , and Worth . PONTEACH . The Presents from your Sovereign I accept , His friendly Belts to us shall be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belts and furs . Which let him know our Mind , and what we wish , That we dislike his crusty Officers , And wish the Path of Peace was made more plain , The Calumet I do not choose to smoke , Till I see further , and my other Chiefs Have been consulted . Tell your King from me , That first or last a Rogue will be detected , That I have Warriors , am myself a King , And will be honour 'd and obey 'd as such ; Tell him my Subjects shall not be oppress 'd , But I will seek Redress and take Revenge ; Tell your King this ; I have no more to say . SHARP . To our great King your Gifts we will convey , And let him know the Talk we 've had with you ; We 're griev 'd we can not smoke the Pipe of Peace , And part with stronger Proofs of Love and Friendship ; Meantime we hope you 'll so consider Matters , As still to keep the Hatchet dull and buried , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we may walk without a Blunder . Exeunt INDIANS . GRIPE . Th ' appear not fully satisfied , I think . CATCHUM . I do not like old Ponteach 's Talk and Air , He seems suspicious , and inclin 'd to war . SHARP . They 're always jealous , bloody , and revengeful , You see that they distrust our Word and Honour ; No wonder then if they suspect the Traders , And often charge them with downright Injustice . GRIPE . True , when even we that come to make them Presents , Can not escape their Fears and Jealousies . CATCHUM . Well , we have this , at least , to comfort us ; Their good Opinion is no Commendation , Nor their foul Slanders any Stain to Honour . I think we 've done whatever Men could do To reconcile their savage Minds to Peace . If they 're displeas 'd , our Honour is acquitted , And we have not been wanting in our Duty To them , our King , our Country , and our Friends . GRIPE . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belts are valuable , and neatly wrought . CATCHUM . This Pack of Furs is very weighty too ; The Skins are pick 'd , and of the choicest Kind . SHARP . By Jove , they 're worth more Money than their Presents . GRIPE . Indeed they are ; the King will be no Loser . SHARP . The King ! who ever sent such Trumpery to him ? CATCHUM . What would the King of England do with Wampum ? Or Beaver Skins , d'ye think ? He 's not a Hatter ! GRIPE . Then it 's a Perquisite belongs to us ? SHARP . Yes , they 're become our lawful Goods and Chattels , By all the Rules and Laws of Indian Treaties . The King would scorn to take a Gift from Indians , And think us Madmen , should we send them to him . CATCHUM . I understand we make a fair Division , And have no Words nor Fraud among ourselves . SHARP . We throw the whole into one common Stock , And go Copartners in the Loss and Gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to make the better Half their own ; And , to your better Judgments with Submission , The self Neglecter 's a poor Politician . These Gifts , you see will all Expences pay ; Heav'n send an Indian Treaty every Day ; We dearly love to serve our King this way . The End of the First Act . ACT II . SCENE I. An Indian House . Enter PHILIP and CHEKITAN from hunting , loaded with venison . PHILIP . The Day 's Toil 's ended , and the Ev'ning smiles With all the Joy and Pleasantness of Plenty . Our good Success and Fortune in the Chace Will make us Mirth and Pastime for the Night . How will the old King and his Hunters smile To see us loaded with the fatt'ning Prey , And joyously relate their own Adventures ? Not the brave Victor 's Shout , or Spoils of War , Would give such Pleasure to their gladden 'd Hearts . CHEKITAN . These , Philip , are the unstain 'd Fruits of Peace , Effected by the conqu'ring British Troops . Now may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Food and Clothing by the Chace , While Ease and Plenty thro ' our Country reign . PHILIP . Happy Effects indeed ! long may they last ! But I suspect the Term will be but short , Ere this our happy Realm is curs 'd afresh With all the Noise and Miseries of War , And Blood and Murder stain our Land again . CHEKITAN . What hast thou heard that seems to threaten this , Or is it idle Fancy and Conjectures ? PHILIP . Our Father 's late Behaviour and Discourse Unite to raise Suspicions in my Mind Of his Designs ? Hast thou not yet observ 'd , That tho ' at first he favour 'd England 's Troops , When they late landed on our fertile Shore , Proclaim 'd his Approbation of their March , Convoy 'd their Stores , protected them from Harm , Nay , put them in Possession of Detroit ; And join 'd to fill the Air with loud Huzzas When England 's Flag was planted on its Walls ? Yet , since , he seems displeas 'd at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Commanders , as of no Account , As one subdu 'd and conquer 'd with the French , As one , whose Right to Empire now is lost , And he become a Vassal of their Power , Instead of an Ally . At this he 's mov 'd , And in his Royal Bosom glows Revenge , Which I suspect will sudden burst and spread Like Lightning from the Summer 's burning Cloud , That instant sets whole Forests in a Blaze . CHEKITAN . Something like this I have indeed perceiv 'd ; And this explains what I but now beheld , Returning from the Chace , myself concealed , Our Royal Father basking in the Shade , His Looks severe , Revenge was in his Eyes , All his great Soul seem 'd mounted in his Face , And bent on something hazardous and great . With pensive Air he view 'd the Forest round ; Smote on his Breast as if oppress 'd with Wrongs , With Indignation stamp 'd upon the Ground ; Extended then and shook his mighty Arm , As in Defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward sprung , As tho ' to trample his Assailants down . The broken Accents murmur 'd from his Tongue , As rumbling Thunder from a distant Cloud , Distinct I heard , " ' T is fix 'd , I 'll be reveng 'd ; I will make War ; I 'll drown this Land in Blood . " He disappear 'd like the fresh-started Roe Pursu 'd by Hounds o'er rocky Hills and Dales , That instant leaves the anxious Hunter 's Eye ; Such was his Speed towards the other Chiefs . PHILIP . He 's gone to sound their Minds to Peace and War , And learn who 'll join the Hazards in his Cause . The Fox , the Bear , the Eagle , Otter , Wolf , And other valiant Princes of the Empire , Have late resorted hither for some End Of common Import . Time will soon reveal Their secret Counsels and their fix 'd Decrees . Peace has its Charms for those who love their Ease , But active Souls like mine delight in Blood . CHEKITAN . Should War be wag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powerful Mohawk King Will ne'er consent to fight against the English , Nay , more , will join them as firm Ally , And influence other Chiefs by his Example , To muster all their Strength against our Father . Fathers perhaps will fight against their Sons , And nearest Friends pursue each other 's Lives ; Blood , Murder , Death , and Horror will be rife , Where Peace and Love , and Friendship triumph now . PHILIP . Such stale Conjectures smell of Cowardice . Our Father 's Temper shews us the reverse : All Danger he defies , and , once resolv 'd , No Arguments will move him to relent , No Motives change his Purpose of Revenge , No Prayers prevail upon him to delay The Execution of his fix 'd Design : Like the starv 'd Tyger in Pursuit of Prey , No Opposition will retard his Course ; Like the wing 'd Eagle that looks down on Clouds , All Hindrances are little in his Eye , And his great Mind knows not the Pain of Fear . CHEKITAN . Such Hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End , And tumble blindfold on their own Disgrace . True Valour 's slow , deliberate , and cool , Considers well the End , the Way , the Means , And weighs each Circumstance attending them . Imaginary Dangers it detects , And guards itself against all real Evils . But here Tenesco comes with Speed important ; His Looks and Face presage us something new . TENESCO . Hail , noble Youth ! The News of your Return And great Success has reach 'd your Father 's Ears . Great is his Joy ; but something more important Seems to rest heavy on his anxious Mind , And he commands your Presence at his Cabin . PHILIP . We will attend his Call with utmost Speed , Nor wait Refreshment after our Day 's Toil . Exeunt . SCENE II . PONTEACH 'S Cabin . PONTEACH , PHILIP , CHEKITAN , and TENESCO . PONTEACH . My Sons , and trusty Counsellor Tenesco , As the sweet smelling Rose , when yet a Bud , Lies close conceal 'd , till Time and the Sun 's Warmth Hath swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View , So these my Purposes I now reveal Are to be kept with You , on pain of Death , Till Time hath ripen 'd my aspiring Plan , And Fortune 's Sunshine shall disclose the Whole ; Or should we fail , and Fortune prove perverse , Let it be never known how far we fail 'd , Lest Fools shou 'd triumph , or our Foes rejoice . TENESCO . The Life of Great Designs is Secrecy , And in Affairs of State ' t is Honour 's Guard ; For Wisdom can not form a Scheme so well , But Fools will laugh if it should prove abortive ; And our Designs once known , our Honour 's made Dependent on the Fickleness of Fortune . PHILIP . What may your great and secret Purpose be , That thus requires Concealment in its Birth ? PONTEACH . To raise the Hatchet from its short Repose , Brighten its Edge , and stain it deep with Blood ; To scourge my proud , insulting , haughty Foes , To enlarge my Empire , which will soon be yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And therefore hope with Vigour you 'll pursue And execute whatever I command . CHEKITAN . When we refuse Obedience to your Will , We are not worthy to be call 'd your Sons . PHILIP . If we inherit not our Father 's Valour , We never can deserve to share his Empire . TENESCO . Spoke like yourselves , the Sons of Ponteach ; Strength , Courage , and Obedience form the Soldier , And the firm Base of all true Greatness lay . PONTEACH . Our Empire now is large , our Forces strong , Our Chiefs are wise , our Warriors valiant Men ; We all are furnish 'd with the best of Arms , And all things requisite to curb a Foe ; And now 's our Time , if ever , to secure Our Country , Kindred , Empire , all that 's dear , From these Invaders of our Rights , the English , And set their Bounds towards the rising Sun . Long have I seen with a suspicious Eye The Strength and growing Numbers of the French ; Their Forts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bound by the Winter Frost , Which in some future warm reviving Day Would stir and hiss , and spit their Poison forth , And spread Destruction through our happy Land . Where are we now ? The French are all subdued , But who are in their Stead become our Lords ? A proud , imperious , churlish , haughty Band . The French familiarized themselves with us , Studied our Tongue , and Manners , wore our Dress , Married our Daughters , and our Sons their Maids , Dealt honestly , and well supplied our Wants , Used no One ill , and treated with Respect Our Kings , our Captains , and our aged Men ; Call 'd us their Friends , nay , what is more , their Children , And seem 'd like Fathers anxious for our Welfare . Whom see we now ? their haughty Conquerors Possess 'd of every Fort , and Lake , and Pass , Big with their Victories so often gain 'd ; On us they look with deep Contempt and Scorn , Are false , deceitful , knavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Country theirs , Without a Purchase , or ev'n asking for it . With Pleasure I wou 'd call their King my Friend , Yea , honour and obey him as my Father ; I 'd be content , would he keep his own Sea , And leave these distant Lakes and Streams to us ; Nay , I would pay him Homage , if requested , And furnish Warriors to support his Cause . But thus to lose my Country and my Empire , To be a Vassal to his low Commanders , Treated with disrespect and public Scorn By Knaves , by Miscreants , Creatures of his Power ; Can this become a King like Ponteach , Whose Empire 's measured only by the Sun ? No , I 'll assert my Right , the Hatchet raise , And drive these Britons hence like frighted Deer , Destroy their Forts , and make them rue the Day That to our fertile Land they found the Way . TENESCO . No Contradiction to your great Design ; But will not such Proceeding injure us ? Where is our Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess 'd of all the Country round , Or whence Supplies of Implements for War ? PONTEACH . Whence ? Take them from our conquered running Foes . Their Fortresses are Magazines of Death , Which we can quickly turn against themselves ; And when they 're driven to their destin 'd Bounds , Their Love of Gain will soon renew their Trade . The heartless French , whene'er they see us conquer , Will join their little Force to help us on . Nay , many of their own brave trusty Soldiers , In Hope of Gain , will give us their Assistance ; For Gain 's their great Commander , and will lead them Where their brave Generals can not force their March : Some have engag 'd , when they see hope of Plunder , In sly Disguise to kill their Countrymen . CHEKITAN . These Things indeed are promising and fair , And seem a Prelude to our full Success . But will not many Indian Chiefs refuse To join the Lists , and hold themselves oblig 'd T ' assist the Foe when hardly press 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minds ; there 's but a few That are not warm and hearty in our Cause , And those faint Hearts we 'll punish at our Leisure : For hither tends my Purpose ; to subdue The Tribes who now their annual Homage pay To the imperious haughty Mohawk Chief , Whose Pride and Insolence ' t is Time to curb . He ever boasts the Greatness of his Empire , The Swiftness , Skill and Valour of his Warriors , His former Conquests , and his fresh Exploits , The Terror of his Arms in distant Lands , And on a Footing puts himself with me , For Wisdom to contrive , and Power to do . Such a proud Rival must not breathe the Air ; I 'll die in fighting , or I 'll reign alone O'er every Indian Nation , Tribe , and Chief . But this in solemn Silence we conceal , Till they 're drawn in to fight the common Foe , Then from my Face , the sly Disguise I 'll cast , And shew them Ponteach to their Surprise . TENESCO . Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May all the warlike numerous Tribes unite , Nor cease to conquer while thou hast a Foe ! Then may they join and own thee for their Sovereign , Pay full Submission to thy scepter 'd Arm , And universal Empire by thy own ! CHEKITAN . Would you the Mohawk Emperor displease , And wage a bloody War , by which you made Him and his num'rous Tribes your certain Foes ? PONTEACH . Most of his Tribes will welcome the Proposal ; For long their galled Necks have felt the Yoke , Long wish 'd for Freedom from his partial Sway , In favour of the proud incroaching Britons . Nay , they have oft , in spite of his Displeasure , Rush 'd forth like Wolves upon their naked Borders , And now , like Tygers broken from their Chains , they 'll glut themselves , and revel in their Blood . PHILIP . Myself will undertake to make even Hendrick Our zealous Friend against the common Foe ; His strong Attachment to them I 'll dissolve , And make him rage , and thirst for Vengeance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyself , And make thee worthy of thy Father 's Crown . The secret Means I will not now inquire , Nor doubt but thus engag 'd you will perform . The Chiefs in part are knowing to my Purpose , And think of nought but War , and Blood , and Plunder , Till in full Council we declare our Pleasure . But first my last Night 's Dream I will relate , Which much disturb 'd my weary anxious Mind , And must portend some signal grand Event Of Good or Evil both to me or mine . On yonder Plain I saw the lordly Elk Snuffing the empty Air in seeming Sport , Tossing his Head aloft , as if in Pride Of his great Bulk and nervous active Limbs , And Scorn of every Beast that haunts the Wood . With mighty Stride he travelled to and fro , And as he mov 'd his Size was still increas 'd , Till his wide Branches reached above the Trees , And his extended Trunk across the Plain . The other Beasts beheld with wild Amaze , Stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce Tyger yell 'd the loud Alarm , When Bears , Cats , Wolves , Panthers , and Porcupines , And other Beasts of Prey , with Force united And savage Rage , attack 'd the common Foe . But as the busking Bull , when Summer Flies , With keenest Sting disturb the grazing Herd , Stands careless in some shady cool Retreat , And from his Sides sweeps the envenom 'd Mites , Or shakes them with a Stamp into the Dust ; So he unmov 'd amidst their Clamours stood , Trampled and spurn 'd them with his Hoofs and Horns , Till all dispers 'd in wild Disorder fled , And left him Master of th ' extended Plain . TENESCO . This Dream no doubt is full of some great Meaning , And in it bears the Fate of your Design , But whether good or ill , to me ' s a Secret . PHILIP . It ne'er was counted ill to dream of Elks , But always thought portentous of Success , Of happy Life , and Victories in War , Or fortune good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common Say ; but here the Size And all the Circumstances are uncommon , And therefore can contain no common Meaning : I fear these Things portend no Good to us , That Mischiefs lurk like Serpents in the Grass , Whose pois'nous deadly Bite precedes all Warning . That this Design will end in mighty Ruin To us and ours , Discord among our Friends , And Triumph to our Foes . PHILIP . A valiant Hero ! Thou always wast a Coward , and hated War , And lov'st to loll on the soft Lap of Peace . Thou art a very Woman in thy Heart , And talk'st of Snakes and Bugbears in the Dark , Till all is Horror and Amaze about thee , And even thy own Shadow makes thee tremble . CHEKITAN . Is there no Courage in delib'rate Wisdom ? Is all rank Cowardice but Fire and Fury ? Is it all womanish to re-consider And weigh the Consequences of our Actions , Before we desperately rush upon them ? Let me then be the Coward , a mere Woman , Mine be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peace , Peace , my Sons , nor let this casual Strife divide your Hearts ; both mean the common Good ; Go Hand in Hand to conquer and promote it . I 'll to our worthy Doctor and the Priest , Who for our Souls ' Salvation come from France ; They sure can solve the Mysteries of Fate , And all the Secrets of a Dream explain ; Mean while , Tenesco , warn the other Chiefs That they attend my Call within an Hour . Exeunt PONTEACH and TENESCO . PHILIP . My Warmth perhaps has carried me too far , But it 's not in me to be cool and backward To act or speak when Kingdoms are the Prize . My Blood runs high at the sweet Sound of Empire , Such as our Father 's Plan ensures to us , And I 'm impatient of the least Delay . CHEKITAN . Thy Fire thou hast a Right to style a Virtue ; Heat is our Friend when kept within due Bounds , But if unbridled and allowed to rage , It burns and blisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Comfort by . Think if our Father 's Plan should prove abortive , Our Troops repuls 'd , or in th ' Encounter slain , Where are our conquer 'd Kingdoms then to share , Where are our Vict'ries , Trophies , Triumphs , Crowns , That dazzle in thy Eye , and swell thy Heart ; That nerve thy Arm , and wing thy Feet to War With this impetuous Violence and Speed ? Crest-fallen then , our native Empire lost , In captive Chains we drag a wretched Life , Or fly inglorious from the conquering Foe To barren Mountains from this fertile Land , There to repent our Folly when too late , In Anguish mourn , and curse our wretched Fate . PHILIP . But why so much of Mischiefs that may happen ? These are mere Possibilities at most ; Creatures of Thought , which ne'er can be Objections , In valiant Minds , to any great Attempt ; They 're empty Echoes of a tim'rous Soul , Like Bubbles driv'n by the tempestuous Storm , The Breath of Resolution sweeps them off . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the secret Motive in thy Breast , Thus to oppose our Father 's great Design , And from an Undertaking to dissuade , In which thou'lt share the Profit and the Glory . Hendrick , the King of Mohawks , hath a Daughter , With whom I saw you dallying in the Shade , And thought you then a Captive to her Charms . The bright Monelia hangs upon thy Heart , And softens all the Passions of thy Soul ; Her thou think'st lost should we proclaim a War , In which the King her Father will not join . CHEKITAN . What if I have a Value for Monelia , Is it a Crime ? Does she not merit Love From all who see her move , or hear her speak ? PHILIP . True , she is engaging , has a charming Air ; And if thy Love is fix 'd , I will assist it , And put thee in Possession of the Joy That thou desirest more than Crowns and Empire . CHEKITAN . As how , dear Philip ? Should we wage a War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Empires then could make Monelia mine ; All Hopes are dash 'd upon that fatal Rock ; Nor Gold , nor Prayers , nor Tears , nor Promises , Nor all the Engin'ry of Love at Work , Could save a single Moment of my Joy . PHILIP . Yes , I will save it all and make her thine , Act but thy Part , and do as I prescribe , In Peace or War thou shalt possess the Prize . CHEKITAN . Thy Words revive my half-despairing Heart . What must I act ? or which Way must I turn ? I 'll brave all Dangers , every Ill defy , Risk Life itself , to call Monelia mine . Help me , my Philip , and I 'll be thy Slave , Resign my Share of Empire to thy Hand , And lay a Claim to nothing but Monelia . PHILIP . Rewards I do not ask ; I am thy Brother , And hold my Kindness to thee as a Debt . Thou know'st I have engag 'd to bring King Hendrick To join the Lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Revenge , and Rage , and War , And make him zealous in the common Cause . Nay , with uncommon Fury he shall rave , And urge his Warriors on to Blood and Murder . When this is done , Monelia may be thine , Hendrick will court Alliance to our Tribe , And joy to call great Ponteach 's Son his own . CHEKITAN . But should you fail in these Attempts , and he Prove obstinately fix 'd against the War , Where 's then Monelia ? where is Chekitan ? My Hopes are blasted , all my Joys are fled , Like the vain Phantoms of a Midnight Dream , Are scattered like the Dust before a Whirlwind , And all my Soul is left a Void for Pain , Vexation , Madness , Frenzy , and Despair , And all the Pains of disappointed Love . Better I ne'er had flattered my fond Heart , Nor sooth 'd my Mind with Prospects of my Joy , Than thus to perish on the Point of Hope . PHILIP . Leave all to me ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint me . Exert thyself , and to Monelia go , Before th ' assembled Chiefs in Council meet ; Urge it to her , and to her Brother Torax , That should their Father prove refractory , Withdraw himself , and order his Domestics To hasten home at News of our Design ; Urge it , I say , to them ; Torax loves War ; To linger here in Hopes of his Return , Which tell them I 'll effect ere twice the Sun Has run the Circuit of his daily Race . Here they may loiter careless , range the Woods , As tho ' the Noise of War had not been heard . This will give full Success to both our Wishes : Thou'lt gain the Prize of Love , and I of Wrath , In favour to our Family and State . Thou'lt tame the Turtle , I shall rouse the Tyger ; The one will soothe thy Soul to soft Repose , The other prove a Terror to our Foes . CHEKITAN . I see the subtle Argument thou'lt use , And how thou'lt work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong Affection for his Children At War against his Kindness for our Foes , By urging their Attachment to our Cause , That they 'll endure ev'n Banishment and Death , Rather than cease to be our steadfast Friends . PHILIP . All this I 'll urge , nay , more , I will convince him , These Foes to us can be no Friends to him ; I 'll thunder in his Ears their growing Power , Their Villainies and Cheats upon his Subjects : That their fair Shew of Love is foul Disguise ; That in their Hearts they hate the Name of Indians , And court his Friendship only for their Profit ; That when no longer he subserves their Ends , He may go whistle up some other Friends . CHEKITAN . This must alarm and bring him to our Mind . I 'll hasten to my Charge with utmost Speed , Strain every Nerve , and every Power exert ; Plead , promise , swear like any Christian Trader ; But I 'll detain them till our Ends are answer 'd , And you have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ! what a wretched Thing is a Man in Love ! All Fear  --  all Hope  --  all Diffidence  --  all Faith  --  Distrusts the greatest Strength , depends on Straws  --  Soften 'd , unprovident , disarm 'd , unman 'd , Led blindfold ; every Power denies its Aid , And every Passion 's but a Slave to this ; Honour , Revenge , Ambition , Interest , all Upon its Altar bleed  --  Kingdoms and Crowns Are slighted and condemn 'd , and all the Ties Of Nature are dissolv 'd by this poor Passion : Once have I felt its Poison in my Heart , When this same Chekitan a Captive led The fair Donanta from the Illinois ; I saw , admir 'd , and lov 'd the charming Maid , And as a Favour ask 'd her from his Hands , But he refus 'd and sold her for a Slave . My Love is dead , but my Resentment lives , And now 's my Time to let the Flame break forth , For while I pay this ancient Debt of Vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loves Monelia  --  Hendrick must be won  --  Monelia and her Brother both must bleed  --  This is my Vengeance on her Lover 's Head  --  Then I 'll affirm , ' t was done by Englishmen  --  And to gain Credit both with Friends and Foes , I 'll wound myself , and say that I receiv 'd it By striving to assist them in the Combat . This will rouse Hendrick 's Wrath , and arm his Troops To Blood and Vengeance on the common Foe . And further still my Profit may extend ; My Brother 's Rage will lead him into Danger , And , he cut off , the Empire 's all my own . Thus am I fix 'd ; my Scheme of Goodness laid , And I 'll effect it , tho ' thro ' Blood I wade , To desperate Wounds apply a desperate Cure , And to tall Structures lay Foundations sure ; To Fame and Empire hence my Course I bend , And every Step I take shall thither tend . End of the Second Act . ACT III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MONELIA , coming towards them . As the young Hunter , anxious in the Chace , With beating Heart and quivering Hand espies The wish 'd for Game , and trembles for th ' Event , So I behold the bright Monelia 's Steps , Whom anxiously I 've sought , approach this way  --  What shall I say ? or how shall I accost her ? It is a fatal Minute to mistake in . The Joy or Grief of Life depends upon ' t ; It is the important Crisis of my Fate . I 've thought a thousand things to say and do , But know not which to say or do the first . Shall I begin with my old Tale of Love ? Or shall I shock her with the News of War ? Must I put on the Face of Joy or Grief ? Seem unconcern 'd or full of Doubts and Fears ? How unprepar 'd I am for the Encounter ! I 'd rather stand against an Host of Foes  --  But she draws near , and Fate must guide me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such an Air of Joy ? TORAX . To view the Beauties of th ' extended Lake , And on its mossy Bank recline at Ease , While we behold the Sports of Fish and Fowl , Which in this Calm no doubt will be diverting . And these are new Amusements to Monelia , She never saw the Sea or Lakes before . CHEKITAN . I 'm glad our Country 's aught to give such Pleasure To one deservedly so welcome in it . MONELIA . That I am welcome you have oft assur 'd me , That I deserve it you may be mistaken , The outside Shew , the Form , the Dress , the Air , That please at first Acquaintance , oft deceive us , And prove more Mimickers of true Desert , Which always brightens by a further Trial , Appears more lovely as we know it better , At least can never suffer by Acquaintance . Perhaps then you To-morrow will despise What you esteem To-day , and call deserving . CHEKITAN . My Love to you , Monelia , can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleases , And like the Earth , my Love can never move . MONELIA . The Earth itself is sometimes known to shake , And the bright Sun by Clouds is oft conceal 'd , And gloomy Night succeeds the Smiles of Day ; So Beauty oft by foulest Faults is veil 'd , And after one short Blaze admir 'd no more , Loses its Lustre , drops its sparkling Charms , The Lover sickens , and his Passion dies . Nay , worse , he hates what he so doted on . Time only proves the Truth of Worth and Love , The one may be a Cheat , the other change , And Fears , and Jealousies , and mortal Hate , Succeed the Sunshine of the warmest Passion . CHEKITAN . Have I not vow 'd my Love to you , Monelia , And open 'd all the Weakness of my Heart ? You can not think me false and insincere , When I repeat my Vows to love you still ; Each time I see you move , or hear you speak , It adds fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising Sun , whose Beams increase As he advances upward to our View ; We gaze with growing Wonder till we 're blind , And every Beauty fades and dies but his . Thus shall I always view your growing Charm , And every Day and Hour with fresh Delight . Witness thou Sun and Moon , and Stars above , Witness ye purling Streams and quivering Lakes , Witness ye Groves and Hills , and Springs and Plains , Witness ye Shades , and the cool Fountain , where I first espied the Image of her Charms , And starting saw her on th ' adjacent Bank , If I to my Monelia prove untrue . MONELIA . Hoh ! now your Talk is so much like a Christian 's , That I must be excus 'd if I distrust you , And think your fair Pretences all designing . I once was courted by a spruce young Blade , A lac 'd Coat Captain , warlike , active , gay , Cockaded Hat and Medal on his Breast , And every thing was clever but his Tongue ; He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lov 'd , Call 'd on his God and Stars to witness for him , Wish 'd he might die , be blown to Hell and damn 'd , If ever he lov 'd woman so before : Call 'd me his Princess , Charmer , Angel , Goddess , Swore nothing else was ever half so pretty , So dear , so sweet , so much to please his Taste , He kiss 'd , he squeez 'd , and press 'd me to his Bosom , Vow 'd nothing could abate his ardent Passion , Swore he should die , should drown , or hang himself , Could not exist if I denied his Suit , And said a thousand Things I can not Name : My simple Heart , made soft by so much Heat , Half gave Consent , meaning to be his Bride . The Moment thus unguarded , he embrac 'd , And impudently ask 'd to stain my Virtue . With just Disdain I push 'd him from my Arms , And let him know he 'd kindled my Resentment ; The Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! then he curs 'd , and swore , and damn 'd , and sunk , Call 'd me proud Bitch , pray 'd Heav'n to blast my Soul , Wish 'd Furies , Hell , and Devils had my Body , To say no more ; bid me begone in Haste Without the smallest Mark of his Affection . This was an Englishman , a Christian Lover . CHEKITAN . Would you compare an Indian Prince to those Whose Trade it is to cheat , deceive , and flatter ? Who rarely speak the Meaning of their Hearts ? Whose Tongues are full of Promises and Vows ? Whose very Language is a downright Lie ? Who swear and call on Gods when they mean nothing ? Who call it complaisant , polite good Breeding , To say Ten thousand things they do n't intend , And tell their nearest Friends the basest Falsehood ? I know you can not think me so perverse , Such Baseness dwells not in an Indian 's Heart , And I 'll convince you that I am no Christian . MONELIA . Then do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An honest Heart needs none of this Parade ; Its Sense steals softly to the list'ning Ear , And Love , like a rich Jewel we most value , When we ourselves by Chance espy its Blaze And none proclaims where we may find the Prize . Mistake me not , I do n't impeach your Honour , Nor think you undeserving my Esteem ; When our Hands join you may repeat your Love , But save these Repetitions from the Tongue . CHEKITAN . Forgive me , if my Fondness is too pressing , ' T is Fear , ' t is anxious Fear , that makes it so . MONELIA . What do you fear ? have I not said enough ? Or would you have me swear some Christian Oath ? CHEKITAN . No , but I fear our Love will be oppos 'd , Your Father will forbid our Hands to join . MONELIA . I can not think it ; you are Ponteach 's Son , Heir to an Empire large and rich as his . CHEKITAN . True ; but your Father is a Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fix 'd on War , Immediate War : This Day the Chiefs assemble , To raise the Hatchet , and to arm the Troops . MONELIA . Then I must leave your Realm , and bid Adieu , In spite of your fond Passion , or my own ; For I can never disoblige my Father , Though by it I were sure to gain an Empire . CHEKITAN . Then Chekitan 's undone , undone for ever . Unless your Father by kind Fate is mov 'd To be our Friend , and join the Lists with mine . TORAX . Nothing would please me better ; I love War , And think it time to curb the English Pride , And give a check to their increasing Power . The Land is ravag 'd by their numerous Bands , And every Day they 're growing more our Lords . CHEKITAN . Are you sincere , or do you feign this Speech ? TORAX . Indeed my Tongue does not bely my Heart ; And but my Father 's wrong-turn 'd Policy Forbids , I 'd instant join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their Power . CHEKITAN . ' T is plain , if they proceed , nor you nor I Shall rule an Empire , or possess a Crown , Our Countries all will soon become a Prey To Strangers ; we perhaps shall be their Slaves . But will your Father be convinc 'd of this ? TORAX . I doubt he 'll not . The good old Man esteems And dotes upon them as most worthy Friends ; I 've told him often that he cherish 'd Serpents , To bite his Children , and destroy his Friends . But this he calls the Folly of my Youth , Bids me be silent , show Respect to Age , Nor sow Sedition in my Father 's Empire . CHEKITAN . Stiff as he is , he yet may be subdued ; And I 've a Power prepar 'd that will attack him . Should he refuse his Aid to our Design , Retire himself , and bid his Troops to follow , Yet Philip stands engag 'd for his Return , Ere twice the Sun has ris'n and blest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He can not fail to bend him to our Purpose . You and Monelia have a Part to act ; To linger here , should he in Haste retreat Till Philip follows and employs his Force . Your Stay will add new Life to the Design , And be of mighty Weight to gain Success . MONELIA . How shall we tarry midst the Noise of War , In Danger of our Lives from Friends and Foes ; This will be deem 'd a Madness by our Father , And will deserve his most severe Rebuke . CHEKITAN . Myself will be a Sponsor for your Safety ; And should your Father baffle our Attempts , Conduct you home from all the Noise of War , Where may you long in Peace and Plenty smile , While I return to mourn my hapless Fate . But should Success attend on Philip 's Purpose . Your Father will not discommend your Stay , But smiling give new Vigour to the War ; Which being ended , and our Foes subdu 'd , The happy Fruits of Peace succeed to all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TORAX . The Purport of our Stay is hid from me ; But Philip 's subtle , crafty as the Fox . We 'll give full Scope to his enticing Art , And help him what we can to take the Prey . MONELIA . In your Protection then I trust myself , Nor will delay beyond th ' appointed Term , Lest anxious Fears possess our Father 's Heart , Or Mischiefs happen that incur his Anger . TORAX . It is agreed ; we now pursue our Walk ; Mean time consult what else may be of Use , You 're pain 'd with Love , and I 'm in Pain for War . Exeunt . CHEKITAN solus . The Game is sure  --  Her Brother 's on my Side  --  Her Brother and my own  --  My Force is strong  --  But could her Father now be rous 'd to War , How should I triumph and defy even Fate ? But Fortune favours all advent'rous Souls : I 'll now to Philip ; tell him my Success , And rouse up every Spark of Vigour in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealous . SCENE II . PONTEACH 'S Cabin . PONTEACH , an Indian CONJURER , and French PRIEST . PONTEACH . Well ! have you found the Secret of my Dream , By all your Cries , and Howls , and Sweats , and Prayers ? Or is the Meaning still conceal 'd from Man , And only known to Genii and the Gods ? CONJURER . Two Hours I 've lain within the sultry Stove , While Floods of Sweat ran trickling from my Skin ; With Howls and Cries and all the Force of Sound Have I invok 'd your Genius and my own , Smote on my Breast , and beat against my Head , To move an Answer , and the Secret learn . But all in vain , no Answer can I have , Till I first learn what secret Purposes And great Designs are brooding in your Mind . PRIEST . At our pure Virgin 's Shrine I 've bowed my Knees , And there in fervent Prayer pour 'd out my Soul ; Call 'd on Saint Peter , call 'd on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And can reveal what Gods themselves can do : I 've us 'd the Arts of our most holy Mother , Which I receiv 'd when I forsook the World , And gave myself to Holiness and Heaven ; But ca n't obtain the Secret of your Dream , Till I first know the Secrets of your Heart , Or what you hope or wish to be effected . ' T is on these Terms we learn the Will of God , What Good or Ill awaits on Kings or Kingdoms ; And without this , St. Peter 's Self ca n't tell , But at a Dream like yours would be confounded . PONTEACH . You 're well agreed  --  Our Gods are much alike  --  And I suspect both Rogues  --  What ! wo n't they tell ! Should they betray my Scheme , the whole is blown . And yet I fain would know . I 'll charge them first . Look here ; if I disclose a Secret to you , Tell it to none but silent honest Gods ; Death to you both , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will , the Gods alone shall know . PONTEACH . Know then that I have fix 'd on speedy War , To drive these new Encroachers from my Country . For this I meant t ' engage our several Tribes , And when our Foes are driven to their Bounds , That we may stand and hold our Rights secure , Unite our Strength under one common Head , Whom all these Petty Kings must own their Lord , Not even Hendrick 's self shall be excused . This is my Purpose . Learn if it shall prosper , Or will it end in Infamy and Shame ? CONJURER . Smiting on his breast , groaning , and muttering in his cloak or blanket , falls down upon the ground , beats his head against it , and pretends to listen : then rises , and says with a rumbling hideous voice : Success and Victory shall attend your Arms ; You are the mighty Elk that none can conquer , And all the Tribes shall own you for their King . Thus , say the Genii , does your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a praying posture for a small space , says : Had I but known you was resolv 'd on War , And War against those Heretics the English , I need not to have ask 'd a God or Saint To signify the Import of your Dream . Your great Design shall have a prosperous End , ' T is by the Gods approv 'd , and must succeed . Angels and Saints are dancing now in Heaven : Your Enemies are theirs , are hated by them , And they 'll protect and help you as their Champion , Aside . That fights their Battles , and defends their Cause . Our great St. Peter is himself a Warrior ; He drew his Sword against such Infidels , And now , like him , you 'll gain immortal Honour , And Gods in Heaven and Saints on Earth will praise you . PONTEACH . The Gods and Genii do as you have said . I 'll to the Chiefs , and hasten them to Arms . Exeunt PONTEACH and CONJURER . PRIEST solus . This , by St. Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to pump him , Or else deny to solve his dubious Vision : But , that we 've so agreed in our Responses , Is all mere Providence , and rul 'd by Heaven , To give us further Credit with this Indian . Now he is fix 'd  --  will wage immediate War  --  This will be joyful News in France and Rome , That Ponteach is in Arms , and wo n't allow The English to possess their new-gain 'd Empire : That he has slain their Troops , destroy 'd their Forts , Expell 'd them from the Lakes to their old Limits : That he prefers the French , and will assist To repossess them of this fertile Land . By all the Saints , of this I 'll make a Merit , Declare myself to be the wise Projector ; This may advance me towards St. Peter 's Chair , And these blind Infidels by Accident May have a Hand in making me a Pope  --  But stop  --  Wo n't this defeat my other Purpose ? To gain the Mohawk Princess to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll surprise her , And have one hearty Revel in her Charms . But now I 'll hasten to this Indian Council ; I may do something there that 's apropos . Exit . SCENE III . An Indian Senate-House . PONTEACH , TENESCO , PHILIP , ASTINACO , BEAR , WOLF , and French PRIEST . PONTEACH . Are all the Chiefs and Warriors here assembled , That we expect to honour this Day 's Council ? TENESCO . All are conven 'd except the Mohawk King , Who , as we are inform 'd , denies his Presence . PHILIP . I 've half succeeded with the stubborn Chief . He will not join in Council , but hath promised , Till further Notice , not to be our Foe : He 'll see how we unite , and what Success Attends our Arms ; in short , he gives strong Hints That he will soon befriend the common Cause . PONTEACH . Do what he will , ' t is this explains my Meaning ; Taking up the hatchet . You all are well appris 'd of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Heart 's pain 'd while I withhold my Hand From Blood and Vengeance on our hated Foes . Tho ' I should stand alone , I 'll try my Power To punish their Encroachments , Frauds , and Pride ; Yet tho ' I die , it is my Country 's Cause , ' T is better thus to die than be despis 'd ; Better to die than be a Slave to Cowards , Better to die than see my Friends abus 'd ; The Aged scorn 'd , the Young despis 'd and spurn 'd . Better to die than see my Country ruin 'd , Myself , my Sons , my Friends reduc 'd to Famine , Expell 'd from hence to barren Rocks and Mountains , To curse our wretched Fate and pine in Want ; Our pleasant Lakes and Fertile Lands usurp 'd By Strangers , Ravagers , rapacious Christians . Who is it do n't prefer a Death in War To this impending Wretchedness and Shame ? Who is it loves his Country , Friends , or Self , And does not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing Strength and Power , And how we waste and fail by swift Degrees , That does not think it Time to rouse and arm , And kill the Serpent ere we feel it sting , And fall the Victims of its painful Poison ? Oh ! could our Fathers from their Country see Their ancient Rights encroach 'd upon and ravag 'd , And we their Children slow , supine , and careless To keep the Liberty and Land they left us , And tamely fall a Sacrifice to Knaves ! How would their Bosoms glow with patriot Shame , To see their Offspring so unlike themselves ? They dared all Dangers to defend their Rights , Nor tamely bore an Insult from a Foe . Their plain rough Souls were brave and full of Fire , Lovers of War , nor knew the Pain of Fear . Rouse , then , ye Sons of ancient Heroes , rouse , Put on your Arms , and let us act a Part Worthy the Sons of such renowned Chiefs . Nor urge I you to Dangers that I shun , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hand shall wield the Hatchet in the Cause , These Feet pursue the frighted running Foe , This Body rush into the hottest Battle ; There should I fall , I shall secure my Honour , And , dying , urge my Countrymen to Vengeance With more Success than all the Force of Words . Should I survive , I 'll shed the foremost Tear O'er my brave Countrymen that chance to fall ; I 'll be the foremost to revenge their Blood , And , while I live , honour both them and theirs , I add no more , but wait to hear your Minds . TENESCO . Tho ' I 'm a Warrior , and delight in Arms , Have oft with Pleasure heard the Sound of Battle , And oft return 'd with Victory and Triumph ; Yet I 'm not fond to fight without just Cause , Or shed the Blood of Men for my Diversion ; But I have seen , with my own Eyes I 've seen , High Provocations from our present Foes , Their Pride and Insults , Knavery and Frauds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day increase , are seen by all , And grown so common , they are disregarded . What calls on us more loudly for Revenge , Is their Contempt and Breach of public Faith . When we complain , they sometimes promise fair ; When we grow restless , Treaties are propos 'd , And Promises are gilded then with Presents . What is the End ? Still the old Trade goes on ; Their Colonels , Governors , and mighty Men , Cheat , lie , and break their solemn Promises , And take no care to have our Wrongs redress 'd . Their King is distant , would he hear our Prayers : Still we 've no other Way to come at Justice , But by our Arms to punish Wrongs like these , And Wrongs like these are national and public , Concern us all , and call for public Vengeance . And Wrongs like these are recent in our Minds . PHILIP . Public or private Wrongs , no matter which . I think our Hunters ought to be reveng 'd ; Their Bodies are found torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd by Englishmen ? Their Heads are scalp 'd , their Arms and Jewels gone , And Beasts of Prey can have no Use for these . No , they were murdered , slyly , basely shot , And who that has a Heart does not resent it ? Oh ! how I long to tear their mangled Limbs ! Yes , I could eat their Hearts , and drink their Blood , And revel in their Torments , Pains , and Tortures ; And , though I go alone , I 'll seek Revenge . ASTINACO . This is the Fire and Madness of your Youth , And must be curb 'd to do your Country Service . Facts are not always what they seem to be , And this perhaps may be the Fault of One Whom their Laws punish if you once detect him . Shall we then , to revenge your Countrymen , To recompense a Wrong by one committed , Rouse all to Arms , and make a general Slaughter ? ' T is higher Motives move my Mind to War , And make me zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is no Trifle we 're upon  --  If we have Wisdom , it must now be used ; If we have Numbers , they must be united ; If we have Strength , it must be all exerted ; If we have Courage it must be inflamed , And every Art and Stratagem be practis 'd : We 've more to do than fright a Pigeon Roost , Or start a timorous Flock of running Deer ; Yes , we 've a strong , a warlike stubborn Foe , Unus 'd to be repuls 'd and quit the Field , Nay , flush 'd with Victories and long Success , Their Numbers , Strength , and Courage all renown 'd , ' T is little of them that you see or know . I 've seen their Capital , their Troops and Stores , Their Ships , their Magazines of Death and Vengeance , And , what is more , I 've seen their potent King , Who like a God sits over all the World , And thunders forth his Vengeance thro ' the Earth . When he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodness flows in Rivers at his Feet ; When he 's provok 'd , ' t is like a fiery Tempest , All 's Terror and Amazement in his Presence , And frighted Heroes trembling flee his Wrath . What then is to be done ? what may we hope ? At most , by secret , sly , and subtle Means To curb these vagrant Outcasts of his Subjects , Secure our Countries from their further Ravage , And make ourselves of more Importance to them , Perhaps procure a Peace to our Advantage . In this I 'll join and head my valiant Troops , Who will not fail to act a valiant Part . THE BEAR . What is the Greatness of their King to us ? What of his Strength or Wisdom ? Shall we fear A Lion chain 'd , or in another World ? Or what avails his flowing Goodness to us ? Does not the ravenous Tyger feed her Young ? And the fierce Panther fawn upon his Mate ? Do not the Wolves defend and help their Fellows , The poisonous Serpent feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Protection ? So this good King shows Kindness to his own , And favours them , to make a Prey of others ; But at his Hands we may expect no Favour , Look back , my Friends , to our Forefathers ' Time , Where is their Country ? where their pleasant Haunts ? The running Streams and shady Forests where ? They chas 'd the flying Game , and liv 'd in Plenty . Lo , these proud Strangers now possess the Whole ; Their Cities , Towns , and Villages arise , Forests are spoil 'd , the Haunts of Game destroy 'd , And all the Sea Coasts made one general Waste ; Between the Rivers Torrent-like they sweep , And drive our Tribes toward the setting Sun . They who once liv 'd on yon delightful Plains Are now no more , their very Name is lost . The Sons of potent Kings , subdu 'd and murder 'd , Are Vagrants , and unknown among their Neighbours . Where will the Ravage stop ? the Ruin where ? Does not the Torrent rush with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End ? Let us grow wise then by our Fathers ' Folly , Unite our Strength , too long it 's been divided , And mutual Fears and Jealousies obtain 'd : This has encourag 'd our encroaching Foes , But we 'll convince them , once , we dare oppose them . THE WOLF . Yet we have Strength by which we may oppose , But every Day this Strength declines and fails . Our great Forefathers , ere these Strangers came , Liv 'd by the Chace , with Nature 's Gifts content , The cooling Fountain quench 'd their raging Thirst . Doctors , and Drugs , and Med'cines were unknown , Even Age itself was free from Pain and Sickness . Swift as the Wind , o'er Rocks and Hills they chas 'd The flying Game , the bounding Stag outwinded , And tir 'd the savage Bear , and tam 'd the Tyger ; At Evening feasted on the past Day 's Toil , Nor then fatigu 'd ; the merry Dance and Song Succeeded ; still with every rising Sun The Sport renew 'd ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bent the hostile Bow , Nor waited his Approach , but rush 'd with Speed , Fearless of Hunger , Thirst , Fatigue , or Death . But we their soften 'd Sons , a puny Race , Are weak in Youth , fear Dangers where they 're not ; Are weary 'd with what was to them a Sport , Panting and breathless in One short Hour 's Chace ; And every Effort of our Strength is feeble . We 're poison 'd with the Infection of our Foes , Their very Looks and Actions are infectious , And in deep Silence spread Destruction round them . Bethink yourselves while any Strength remains ; Dare to be like your Fathers , brave and strong , Nor further let the growing Poison spread . And would you stop it , you must resolve to conquer , Destroy their Forts and Bulwarks , burn their Towns , And keep them at a greater Distance from us . Oh ! ' t is a Day I long have wish 'd to see , And , aged as I am , my Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , you shall see the old Wolf will not fail To head his Troops , and urge them on to Battle . PONTEACH . Your Minds are all for War , we 'll not delay ; Nor doubt but others gladly will comply , When they behold our Union and Success . TENESCO . This Holy Priest has something to propose That may excite us all to greater Zeal . PONTEACH . Let him be heard : ' T is something from his Gods , And may import the common Interest much . PRIEST . Coming from one side , where he hath stood listening . ' T is not to shew my Eloquence of Speech , Or drown your Senses with unmeaning Sound , That I desire Admittance to your Council ; It is an Impulse from the Gods that moves me , That what I say will be to your Advantage . Oh ! With what secret Pleasure I behold So many wise and valiant Kings unite , And in a Cause by Gods and Saints espous 'd . Heaven smiles on your Design , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ; Rebels and Traitors to the King of Kings ; Nay , those who once betray 'd and kill 'd his Son , Who came to save you Indians from Damnation  --  He was an Indian , therefore they destroy 'd him ; He rose again and took his flight to Heaven ; But when his Foes are slain he 'll quick return ; And be your kind Protector , Friend , and King . Be therefore brave and fight his Battles for him ; Spare not his Enemies , where-e'r you find ' em : The more you murder them , the more you please him ; Kill all you captivate , both old and young , Mothers and Children , let them feel your Tortures ; He that shall kill a Briton , merits Heaven . And should you chance to fall , you 'll be convey 'd By flying Angels to your King that 's there Where these your hated Foes can never come . Doubt you the Truth of this my Declaration ? I have a Witness here that can not lie . Pulling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your great Saviour 's Hand , And after left in holy Peter 's Care ; When I command , it brings down Fire from Heaven , To witness for me that I tell no Lie . The INDIANS gather round and gaze . Behold  --  Great God , send Fire , convince these Indian Kings That I 'm thy Servant , and report the Truth , In a very praying posture and solemn canting tone . Am sent to teach them what they ought to do , To kill and scalp , to torture and torment Thy murderous treacherous Foes , the hateful English . It takes fire ; the INDIANS are amaz 'd , and retreat from it . PONTEACH . Who now can doubt the Justice of our Cause , Or this Man 's Mission from the King above , And that we ought to follow his Commands ? ASTINACO . ' T is wonderful indeed  --  It must be so  --  TENESCO . This can not be a Cheat  --  It is from Heaven  --  ALL . We are convinc 'd and ready to obey ; We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloody hatchet and flourishes it round . Thus do I raise the Hatchet from the Ground , Sharpen 'd and bright may it be stain 'd with Blood , And never dull 'd nor rusted till we 've conquer 'd , And taught proud Englishmen to dread its Edge . ALL . Flourishing their hatchets , and striking them upon a block . Thus will we hew and carve their mangled Bodies , And give them to the Beasts and Birds for Food . PONTEACH . And thus our Names and Honours will maintain While Sun and Moon , Rivers and Trees remain ; Our unborn Children shall rejoice to hear How we their Fathers made the English fear . THE WAR SONG . To the tune of " Over the Hills and far away , " sung by TENESCO , the head warrior .

Be ' t known that we this War begin With proud insulting Englishmen ; The Hatchet we have lifted high , Holding up their hatchets . And them we 'll conquer or we 'll die .  --  Chorus . The Edge is keen , the Blade is bright , Nothing saves them but their Flight ; And then like Heroes we 'll pursue , Over the Hills and Valleys through .  --  Chorus . They 'll like frighted Women quake , When they behold a hissing Snake ; Or like timorous Deer away , And leave both Goods and Arms a Prey .  --  Chorus . Pain 'd with Hunger , Cold , or Heat , In Haste they 'll from our Land retreat ; While we 'll employ our scalping Knives  --  Drawing and flourishing their scalping knives .

No pointing Foe shall ever say ' T was there the vanquish 'd Indian lay ; Or boasting to his Friends relate The Tale of our unhappy Fate .  --  Chorus . Let us with Courage then away To hunt and seize the frighted Prey ; Nor think of Children , Friend , or Wife , While there 's an Englishman alive .  --  Chorus . In Heat and Cold , thro ' Wet and Dry , Will we pursue , and they shall fly To Seas which they a Refuge think , And there in wretched Crowds they 'll sink .  --  Chorus . Exeunt omnes singing . The End of the Third Act . ACT IV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PHILIP and CHEKITAN . TENESCO . The Troops are all assembled , some have march 'd , Perhaps are now engag 'd , and warm in Battle ; The rest have Orders where to bend their Course . Each Tribe is headed by a valiant Chief , Except the Bulls which fall to one of you ; The other stays to serve the State at home , Or back us , should our Forces prove too weak . PHILIP . The Bulls are brave , had they a brave Commander , They 'd push the Battle home with sure Success . I 'd choose of all the Troops to be their Leader ; For tho ' I 'd neither Courage , Skill , nor Strength , Honour attends the Man who heads the Brave ; Many are dubb 'd for Heroes in these Times , Who owe their Fame to those whom they commanded . TENESCO . But we shall ne'er suspect your Title false ; Already you 've confirm 'd your Fame and Courage , And prov 'd your Skill and Strength as a Commander . PHILIP . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay the Honour you propose . CHEKITAN . But this will interfere with your Design , And oversets the Scheme of winning Hendrick . PHILIP . Ah true  --  and kills your Hope  --  This Man ' s in Love . To TENESCO . TENESCO . Indeed ! In Love with whom ? King Hendrick 's Daughter ? PHILIP . The same ; and I 've engag 'd to win her Father . TENESCO . This may induce him to espouse our Cause , Which likewise you engag 'd should be effected . PHILIP . But then I ca n't command as was propos 'd , I must resign that Honour to this Lover , While I conduct and form this double Treaty . TENESCO . I am content if you but please yourselves By Means and Ways not hurtful to the Public . CHEKITAN . Was not the Public serv 'd , no private Ends Would tempt me to detain him from the Field , Or in his stead propose myself a Leader ; But every Power I have shall be exerted : And if in Strength or Wisdom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me faithful . TENESCO . I doubt it not  --  You 'll not delay your Charge ; The Troops are all impatient for the Battle . Exeunt TENESCO and PHILIP . CHEKITAN solus . This is not to my Mind  --  But I must do it  --  If Philip heads the Troops , my Hopes are blown  --  I must prepare , and leave the Event to Fate And him  --  ' T is fix 'd  --  There is no other Choice ; Monelia I must leave , and think of Battles  --  She will be safe  --  But , Oh ! the Chance of War  --  Perhaps I fall  --  and never see her more  --  This shocks my Soul in spite of Resolution  --  The bare Perhaps is more than Daggers to me  --  To part for ever ! I 'd rather stand against Embattled Troops than meet this single Thought ; A Thought in Poison dipp 'd and pointed round ; Oh ! how it pains my doubting trembling Heart ! I must not harbour it  --  My Word is gone  --  My Honour calls  --  and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving behind the scene . What Sound is that ?  --  It is Monelia 's Voice ; And in Distress  --  What Monster gives her Pain ? Going towards the sound , the Scene opens and discovers the PRIEST with her . SCENE II . MONELIA and PRIEST . CHEKITAN . What do I see ? The holy Priest is with her . MONELIA . Struggling with the PRIEST , and trying to disengage herself . No , I would sooner die than be dishonour 'd  --  Cut my own Throat , or drown me in the Lake . PRIEST . Do you love Indians better than us white Men ? MONELIA . Nay , should an Indian make the foul Attempt , I 'd murder him , or kill my wretched Self . PRIEST . I must I can , and will enjoy you now . MONELIA . You must ! You sha' n't , you cruel , barbarous Christian . CHEKITAN . Hold , thou mad Tyger  --  What Attempt is this ? Seizing him . Are you a Christian Priest ? What do you here ? Pushes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb . MONELIA . May he be dumb and blind , and senseless quite , That had such brutal Baseness in his Mind . CHEKITAN . Base false Deceiver , what could you intend ? Making towards him . MONELIA . Oh I am faint  --  You have preserv 'd my Honour , Which he , foul Christian , thirsted to destroy . PRIEST attempts to go . CHEKITAN . Stay ; leave your Life to expiate your Crime : Your heated Blood shall pay for your Presumption . Offering to strike him with a hatchet . PRIEST . Good Prince , forbear your pious Hand from Blood ; I did not know you was this Maiden 's Lover , I took her for a Stranger , half your Foe . CHEKITAN . Did you not know she was King Hendrick 's Daughter ? Did you not know that she was not your Wife ? Have you not told us , holy Men like you Are by the Gods forbid all fleshly Converse ? Have you not told us , Death , and Fire , and Hell Await those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That your God 's Mother liv 'd and died a Virgin , And thereby set Example to her Sex ? What means all this ? Say you such Things to us , That you alone may revel in these Pleasures ? PRIEST . I have a Dispensation from St. Peter To quench the Fire of Love when it grows painful . This makes it innocent like Marriage Vows ; And all our holy Priests , and she herself , Commit no Sin in this Relief of Nature : For , being holy , there is no Pollution Communicated from us as from others ; Nay , Maids are holy after we 've enjoy 'd them , And , should the Seed take Root , the Fruit is pure . CHEKITAN . Oh vain Pretense ! Falsehood and foul Deception ! None but a Christian could devise such Lies ! Did I not fear it might provoke your Gods , Your Tongue should never frame Deceit again . If there are Gods , and such as you have told us , They must abhor all Baseness and Deceit , And will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leave you  --  But avoid my Presence , Nor let me ever see your hated Head , Or hear your lying Tongue within this Country . PRIEST . Now by St. Peter I must go  --  He 's raging . Aside . CHEKITAN . That Day I do , by your great dreadful God , This Hand shall cleave your Head , and spill your Blood , Not all your Prayers , and Lies , and Saints shall save you . PRIEST . I 've got his Father 's Secret , and will use it . Such Disappointment ought to be reveng 'd . Aside . CHEKITAN . Do n't mutter here , and conjure up your Saints , I value not their Curses , or your Prayers . Stepping towards the PRIEST to hurry him . PRIEST . By all the Saints , young Man , thou shalt repent it . Exit . MONELIA . Base , false Dissembler  --  Tyger , Snake , a Christian ! I hate the Sight ; I fear the very Name . O Prince , what has not your kind Presence sav 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than my Father 's Empire ; Far more than Crowns and Worlds  --  It sav 'd Monelia , The Hope of whom is more than the Creation . In this I feel the Triumph of an Hero , And glory more than if I 'd conquer 'd Kingdoms . MONELIA . Oh , I am thine , I 'm more than ever thine ; I am your Captive now , your lawful Prize : You 've taken me in War , a dreadful War ! And snatch 'd me from the hungry Tyger 's Jaw . More than my Life and Service is your Due , And had I more I would devote it to you . CHEKITAN . O my Monelia ! rich is my Reward , Had I lost Life itself in the Encounter ; But still I fear that Fate will snatch you from me . Where is your Brother ? Why was you alone ? Enter TORAX , from listening to their discourse . TORAX . Here am I : What would you of me ? MONELIA . Torax ! I 've been assaulted by a barbarous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TORAX . What Foe is here ? The English are not come ? MONELIA . No : But a Christian lurk 'd within the Grove , And every Christian is a Foe to Virtue ; Insidious , subtle , cruel , base , and false ! Like Snakes , their very Eyes are full of Poison ; And where they are not , Innocence is safe . TORAX . The holy Priest ! Is he so vile a Man ? I heard him mutter Threat'nings as I past him . CHEKITAN . I spar 'd his guilty Life , but drove him hence , On Pain of Death and Tortures , never more To tread the Earth , or breathe the Air with me . Be warn 'd by this to better tend your Charge . You see how Mischiefs lie conceal 'd about us , We tread on Serpents ere we hear them hiss , And Tygers lurk to seize the incautious Prey . I must this Hour lead forth my Troops to Battle , They 're now in Arms , and waiting my Command . MONELIA . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not , can not , will not longer tarry , Lest other Christians , or some other Foe , Attempt my Ruin . CHEKITAN . Torax will be your Guard . My Honour suffers , should I now decline ; It is my Country 's Cause ; I 've pawn 'd my Word , Prevented Philip , to make sure of you . He stays . ' T is all in favour to our Love ; We must at present please ourselves with Hopes . MONELIA . Oh ! my fond Heart no more conceals its Flame ; I fear , my Prince , I fear our Fates are cruel : There 's something whispers in my anxious Breast , That if you go , I ne'er shall see you more . CHEKITAN . Oh ! how her Words unman and melt my Soul ! As if her Fears were Prophecies of Fate . Aside . I will not go and leave you thus in Fears ; I 'll frame Excuses  --  Philip shall command  --  I 'll find some other Means to turn the King ; I 'll venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than trust you from my Sight again . For what avails all that the World can give ? If you 're withheld , all other Gifts are Curses , And Fame and Fortune serve to make me wretched . MONELIA . Now you grow wild  --  You must not think of staying ; Our only Hope , you know , depends on Philip . I will not fear , but hope for his Success , And your Return with Victory and Triumph , That Love and Honour both may crown our Joy . CHEKITAN . Now this is kind ; I am myself again . You had unman 'd and soften 'd all my Soul , Disarm 'd my Hand , and cowardiz 'd my Heart : But now in every Vein I feel an Hero , Defy the thickest Tempest of the War : Yes , like a Lion conscious of his Strength , Fearless of Death I 'll rush into the Battle ; I 'll fight , I 'll conquer , triumph and return ; Laurels I 'll gain and lay them at your Feet . MONELIA . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Scheme of Happiness succeed ! May our next Meeting put an End to Fear , And Fortune shine upon us in full Blaze ! CHEKITAN . May Fate preserve you as her Darling Charge ! May all the Gods and Goddesses , and Saints , If conscious of our Love , turn your Protectors ! And the great thundering God with Lightning burn Him that but means to interrupt your Peace . Exeunt . SCENE III . Indian Senate-House . PONTEACH and PHILIP . PONTEACH . Say you that Torax then is fond of War ? PHILIP . He is , and waits impatient my Return . PONTEACH . ' T is friendly in you thus to help your Brother ; But I suspect his Courage in the Field ; A love-sick Boy makes but a cow'rdly Captain . PHILIP . His Love may spur him on with greater Courage ; He thinks he 's fighting for a double Prize ; And but for this , and Hopes of greater Service In forwarding the Treaty with the Mohawk , I now had been in Arms and warm in Battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prepare yourself , and hasten to his Quarters ; You can not make th ' Attempt with too much Speed . Urge ev'ry Argument with Force upon him , Urge my strong Friendship , urge your Brother 's Love , His Daughter 's Happiness , the common Good ; The general Sense of all the Indian Chiefs , The Baseness of our Foes , our Hope of Conquest ; The Richness of the Plunder if we speed ; That we 'll divide and share it as he pleases ; That our Success is certain if he joins us . Urge these , and what besides to you occurs ; All can not fail , I think , to change his Purpose . PHILIP . You 'd think so more if you knew all my Plan . Aside . I 'm all prepar 'd now I 've receiv 'd your Orders , But first must speak t ' his Children ere I part , I am to meet them in the further Grove . PONTEACH . Hark ! there 's a Shout  --  We 've News of some Success ; It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MESSENGER . MESSENGER . Huzza ! for our brave Warriors are return 'd Loaded with Plunder and the Scalps of Christians . Enter WARRIORS . PONTEACH . What have you done ? Why all this Noise and Shouting ? 1ST WARRIOR . Three Forts are taken , all consum 'd and plunder 'd ; The English in them all destroy 'd by Fire , Except some few escap 'd to die with Hunger . 2ND WARRIOR . We 've smok 'd the Bear in spite of all his Craft , Burnt up their Den , and made them take the Field : The mighty Colonel Cockum and his Captain Have dull 'd our Tomhocks ; here are both their Scalps : Holding out the two scalps . Their Heads are split , our Dogs have eat their Brains . PHILIP . If that be all they 've eat , the Hounds will starve . 3RD WARRIOR . These are the scalps of those two famous Cheats Who bought our Furs for Rum , and sold us Water . Holding out the scalps , which PONTEACH takes . Our Men are loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villains ' Stores . PONTEACH . All this is brave ! Tossing up the scalps , which others catch , and toss and throw them about . This Way we 'll serve them all . PHILIP . We 'll cover all our Cabins with their Scalps . WARRIORS . We 'll fat our Dogs upon their Brains and Blood . PONTEACH . Ere long we 'll have their Governors in Play . PHILIP . And knock their grey-wig 'd Scalps about this Way . PONTEACH . The Game is started ; Warriors , hunt away , Nor let them find a Place to shun your Hatchets . ALL WARRIORS . We will : We will soon shew you other Scalps . PHILIP . Bring some alive ; I long to see them dance In Fire and Flames , it us 'd to make them caper . WARRIORS . Such Sport enough you 'll have before we 've done . Exeunt . PONTEACH . This still will help to move the Mohawk King . Spare not to make the most of our Success . PHILIP . Trust me for that  --  Hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shout for Prisoners  --  Now I have my Sport . PONTEACH . It is indeed ; and there 's a Number too . Enter WARRIORS. 1ST WARRIOR . We 've broke the Barrier , burnt their Magazines , Slew Hundreds of them , and pursu 'd the rest Quite to their Settlements . 2ND WARRIOR . There we took Their famous Hunters Honnyman and Orsbourn : The last is slain , this is his bloody Scalp . Tossing it up . With them we found the Guns of our lost Hunters , And other Proofs that they 're the Murderers ; Nay , Honnyman confesses the base Deed , And , boasting , says , he 's kill 'd a Score of Indians . 3RD WARRIOR . This is the bloody Hunter : This his Wife ; Leading them forward , pinioned and tied together . With two young Brats that will be like their Father . We took them in their Nest , and spoil 'd their Dreams . PHILIP . Oh I could eat their Hearts , and drink their Blood , Were they not Poison , and unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost your Feeling ? You Tygress Bitch ! You Breeder up of Serpents ! Slapping HONNYMAN in the face , and kicking his wife . PONTEACH . Stop  --  We must first consult which way to torture . And whether all shall die  --  We will retire . PHILIP going . Take care they do n't escape . WARRIOR . They 're bound secure . Exeunt INDIANS ; manent PRISONERS . SCENE IV . MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , Honnyman , how desperate is our Case ! There 's not a single Hope of Mercy left : How savage , cruel , bloody did they look ! Rage and Revenge appear 'd in every Face . HONNYMAN . You may depend upon ' t , we all must die , I 've made such Havoc , they 'll have no Compassion ; They only wait to study out new Torments : All that can be inflicted or endur 'd , We may expect from their relentless Hands . Their brutal Eyes ne'er shed a pitying Tear ; Their savage Hearts ne'er had a Thought of Mercy ; Their Bosoms swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others ' Plagues , Love Torments , Torture , Anguish , Fire , and Pain , The deep-fetch 'd Groan , the melancholy Sigh , And all the Terrors and Distress of Death , These are their Music , and enhance their Joy . In Silence then submit yourself to Fate : Make no Complaint , nor ask for their Compassion ; This will confound and half destroy their Mirth ; Nay , this may put a stop to many Tortures , To which our Prayers and Tears and Plaints would move them . MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , dreadful Scene ! Support me , mighty God , To pass the Terrors of this dismal Hour , All dark with Horrors , Torments , Pains , and Death ! Oh , let me not despair of thy kind Help ; Give Courage to my wretched , groaning Heart ! HONNYMAN . Tush , Silence ! You 'll be overheard . MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , my dear Husband ! ' T is an Hour for Prayer , An Infidel would pray in our Distress : An Atheist would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great . HONNYMAN . If there 's a God , he knows our secret Wishes ; This Noise can be no Sacrifice to him ; It opens all the Springs of our weak Passions . Besides , it will be Mirth to our Tormentors ; They 'll laugh , and call this Cowardice in Christians And say Religion makes us all mere Women . MRS . HONNYMAN . I will suppress my Grief in Silence then , And secretly implore the Aid of Heaven . Forbid to pray ! Oh , dreadful Hour indeed ! Pausing . Think you they will not spare our dear sweet Babes ? Must these dear Innocents be put to Tortures , Or dash 'd to Death , and share our wretched Fate ? Must this dear Babe that hangs upon my Breast Looking upon her infant . Be snatch 'd by savage Hands and torn in Pieces ! Oh , how it rends my Heart ! It is too much ! Tygers would kindly soothe a Grief like mine ; Unconscious Rocks would melt , and flow in Tears At this last Anguish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child again . Sweet Innocent ! It smiles at this Distress , And fondly draws this final Comfort from me : Dear Babe , no more : Dear Tommy too must die , Looking at her other child . Oh , my sweet First-born ! Oh , I 'm overpower 'd . Pausing . HONNYMAN . I had determin 'd not to shed a Tear ; Weeping . But you have all unman 'd my Resolution ; You 've call 'd up all the Father in my Soul ; Why have you nam 'd my Children ? Oh , my Son ! Looking upon him . My only Son  --  My Image  --  Other Self ! How have I doted on the charming Boy , And fondly plann 'd his Happiness in Life ! Now his Life ends : Oh , the Soul-bursting Thought ! He falls a Victim for his Father 's Folly . Had I not kill 'd their Friends , they might have spar 'd My Wife , my Children , and perhaps myself , And this sad , dreadful Scene had never happen 'd . But ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Heaven forgive , ' t is all I dare to hope for . MRS . HONNYMAN . What ! have you been a Murderer indeed ! And kill 'd the Indians for Revenge and Plunder ? I thought you rash to tempt their brutal Rage , But did not dream you guilty as you said . HONNYMAN . I am indeed . I murder 'd many of them , And thought it not amiss , but now I fear . MRS . HONNYMAN . O shocking Thought ! Why have you let me know Yourself thus guilty in the Eye of Heaven ? That I and my dear Babes were by you brought To this Extreme of Wretchedness and Woe ? Why have you let me know the solemn Weight Of horrid Guilt that lies upon us all ? To have died innocent , and seen these Babes By savage Hands dash 'd to immortal Rest , This had been light , for this implies no Crime : But now we die as guilty Murderers , Not savage Indians , but just Heaven 's Vengeance Pursues our Lives with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points the keenest Sorrow , And leaves no Room for Anguish to be heighten 'd . HONNYMAN . Upbraid me not , nor lay my Guilt to Heart ; You and these Fruits of our past Morning Love Are innocent . I feel the Smart and Anguish , The Stings of Conscience , and my Soul on Fire . There 's not a Hell more painful than my Bosom , Nor Torments for the Damn 'd more keenly pointed . How could I think to murder was no Sin ? Oh , my lost Neighbour ! I seduc 'd him too . Now death with all its Terrors disappears , And all I fear ' s a dreadful Something-after ; My Mind forebodes a horrid , woful Scene , Where Guilt is chain 'd and tortur 'd with Despair . MRS . HONNYMAN . The Mind oppress 'd with Guilt may find Relief . HONNYMAN . Oh , could I reach the pitying Ear of Heaven , And all my Soul evaporate in Sound , ' T would ask Forgiveness ! but I fear too late ; And next I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part in my just Punishment . Who knows but by pathetic Prayers and Tears Their savage Bosoms may relent towards you , And fix their Vengeance where just Heaven points it ? I still will hope , and every Motive urge . Should I succeed , and melt their rocky Hearts , I 'd take it as a Presage of my Pardon , And die with Comfort when I see you live . Death halloo is heard without . MRS . HONNYMAN . Hark ! they are coming  --  Hear that dreadful Halloo . HONNYMAN . It is Death 's solemn Sentence to us all ; They are resolv 'd , and all Entreaty 's vain . Oh horrid Scene ! how shall I act my Part ? Was it but simple Death to me alone ! But all your Deaths are mine , and mine the Guilt . Enter INDIANS with stakes , hatchets , and firebrands . Oh , horrid Preparation , more than Death ! PONTEACH . Plant down the Stakes , and let them be confin 'd : They loose them from each other . First kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Brat is in our Way , I will dispatch it . Offering to snatch the sucking infant . MRS . HONNYMAN . No , my dear Babe shall in my Bosom die ; There is its Nourishment , and there its End . PHILIP . Die both together then , ' twill mend the Sport ; Tie the other to his Father , make a Pair ; Then each will have a Consort in their Pains ; Their sweet Brats with them , to increase the Dance . They are tied down , facing each other upon their knees , and their backs to the stakes . WARRIOR . All now is ready ; they are bound secure . PHILIP . Whene'er you please , their jovial Dance begins . To PONTEACH . MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , my dear Husband ! What a Sight is this ! Could ever fabling Poet draw Distress To such Perfection ! Sad Catastrophe ! There are not Colours for such deep-dyed Woe , Nor words expressive of such heighten 'd Anguish . Ourselves , our Babes , O cruel , cruel Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrors . HONNYMAN . Is there no secret Pity in your Minds ? Can you not feel some tender Passion move , When you behold the Innocent distress 'd ? True , I am guilty , and will bear your Tortures : Take your Revenge by all the Arts of Torment ; Invent new Torments , lengthen out my Woe , And let me feel the keenest Edge of Pain : But spare this innocent afflicted Woman , Those smiling Babes who never yet thought Ill , They never did nor ever will offend you . PHILIP . It can not be : They are akin to you . Well learnt to hunt and murder , kill and rob . PONTEACH . Who ever spar 'd a Serpent in the Egg ? Or left young Tygers quiet in their Den ? WARRIOR . Or cherishes young Vipers in his Bosom ? PHILIP . Begin , begin ; I 'll lead the merry Dance . Offering at the woman with a firebrand . PONTEACH . Stop : Are we not unwise to kill this Woman ? Or Sacrifice her Children to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do present Mischief . I know her Friends ; they 're rich and powerful , And in their Turn will take severe Revenge : But if we spare , they 'll hold themselves oblig 'd , And purchase their Redemption with rich Presents . Is not this better than an Hour 's Diversion , To hear their Groans , and Plaints , and piteous Cries ? WARRIORS . Your Counsel 's wise , and much deserves our Praise ; They shall be spar 'd . PONTEACH . Untie , and take them hence ; They untie the woman and the oldest child from HONNYMAN , and retire a little to consult his death . When the War ends her Friends shall pay us for it . PHILIP . I 'd rather have the Sport than all the Pay . HONNYMAN . O , now , kind Heaven , thou hast heard my Prayer , And what 's to follow I can meet with Patience . MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , my dear husband , could you too be freed ! Weeping . Yet must I stay and suffer Torments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not leave you in this Scene of Woe , ' T is easier far to stay and die together ! HONNYMAN . Ah ! but regard our Children 's Preservation : Conduct their Youth , and form their Minds to Virtue ; Nor let them know their Father 's wretched End , Lest lawless Vengeance should betray them too . MRS . HONNYMAN . If I must live , I must retire from hence , Nor see your fearful Agonies in Death ; This would be more than all the Train of Torments . The horrid Sight would sink me to the Dust ; These helpless Infants would become a Prey To worse than Beasts , to savage , bloody Men . HONNYMAN . Leave me  --  They are prepar 'd , and coming on  --  Heav'n save you all ! Oh , ' t is the last dear Sight ! MRS . HONNYMAN . Oh , may we meet where Fear and Grief are banish 'd ! Dearest of Men , adieu  --  Adieu till then . Exit , weeping with her children . PHILIP . Bring Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the old Hunter feel the Smart of Pain .

This is fine fat Game ! PHILIP . Make him caper . Striking him with a club , kicking , &amp;c . HONNYMAN . O ye eternal Powers , that rule on high , If in your Minds be Sense of human Woe , Hear my Complaints , and pity my Distress ! PHILIP . Ah , call upon your Gods , you faint-heart Coward ! HONNYMAN . Oh , dreadful Racks ! When will this Torment end ? Oh , for a Respite from all Sense of Pain ! ' T is come  --  I go  --  You can  --  no more torment . Dies . PHILIP .

Go , tell our Countrymen , whose Blood you shed , That the great Hunter Honnyman is dead : That we 're alive , we 'll make the English know , Whene'er they dare to serve us Indians so : This will be joyful News to Friends from France , We 'll join the Chorus then , and have a Dance . Exeunt omnes , dancing , and singing the last two lines . End of the Fourth Act . ACT V. SCENE I. The Border of a Grove , in which MONELIA and TORAX are asleep . Enter PHILIP speaking to himself .

Are they not here ? Have I delay 'd too long ? He espies them asleep . Yes , in a Posture too beyond my Hopes , Asleep ! This is the Providence of Fate , And proves she patronizes my Design , And I 'll show her that Philip is no Coward . Taking up his hatchet in one hand , and scalping knife in the other , towards them . A Moment now is more than Years to come : Intrepid as I am , the Work is shocking . He retreats from them . Is it their Innocence that shakes my Purpose ? No ; I can tear the Suckling from the Breast , And drink their Blood who never knew a Crime . Is it because my Brother 's Charmer dies ? That can not be , for that is my Revenge . Is it because Monelia is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Enchantments . Is it because I take them thus unguarded ? No ; though I act the Coward , it 's a Secret . What is it shakes my firm and fix 'd Resolve ? ' T is childish Weakness : I 'll not be unman 'd . Approaches and retreats again . There 's something awful in the Face of Princes , And he that sheds their Blood , assaults the Gods : But I 'm a Prince , and ' t is by me they die ; Advances arm 'd as before . Each Hand contains the Fate of future Kings , And , were they Gods , I would not balk my Purpose . Stabs MONELIA with the knife . TORAX . Hah ! Philip , are you come ? What can you mean ? TORAX starts and cries out . PHILIP . Go learn my Meaning in the World of Spirits ; Knocks him down with his hatchet , &amp;c . ' T is now too late to make a Question of it .

Behold this flowing Blood ; a desperate Wound ! Shewing his wound . And there 's a Deed that shakes the Root of Empires . Pointing to the bodies. 2ND INDIAN . Oh , fatal Sight ! the Mohawk Prince is murder'd. 3RD INDIAN . The Princess too is weltering in her Blood . PHILIP . Both , both are gone ; ' t is well that I escap 'd . Enter PONTEACH . PONTEACH . What means this Outcry , Noise , and Tumult here ? PHILIP . Oh see , my Father ! see the Blood of Princes , A Sight that might provoke the Gods to weep , And drown the Country in a Flood of Tears . Great was my Haste , but could not stop the Deed ; I rush 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I receiv 'd this Wound . Shewing his wound to PONTEACH . PONTEACH . Who , what were they ? or where did they escape ? PHILIP . A Band of English Warriors , bloody Dogs ! This Way they ran from my vindictive Arm , Pointing , &amp;c . Which but for this base Wound would sure have stopp 'd them . PONTEACH . Pursue , pursue , with utmost Speed pursue , To the WARRIORS present . Outfly the Wind till you revenge this Blood ; ' T is royal Blood , we count it as our own . Exeunt WARRIORS in haste . This Scene is dark , and doubtful the Event ; Some great Decree of Fate depends upon it , And mighty Good or Ill awaits Mankind . The Blood of Princes can not flow in vain , The Gods must be in Council to permit it : It is the Harbinger of their Designs , To change , new-mould , and alter Things on Earth : And much I fear , ' t is ominous of Ill , To me and mine ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will swell into a Torrent  --  They were my Guests  --  His Wrath will centre here ; Our guilty Land hath drunk his Children 's Blood . PHILIP . Had I not seen the flying Murderers , Myself been wounded to revenge their Crime , Had you not hasten 'd to pursue the assassins , He might have thought us treacherous and false , Or wanting in our hospitable Care : But now it can not but engage his Friendship , Rouse him to Arms , and with a Father 's Rage He 'll point his Vengeance where it ought to fall ; And thus this Deed , though vile and dark as Night , In its Events will open Day upon us , And prove of great Advantage to our State . PONTEACH . Haste then ; declare our Innocence and Grief ; Tell the old King we mourn as for our own , And are determin 'd to revenge his Wrongs ; Assure him that our Enemies are his , And rouse him like a Tyger to the Prey . PHILIP . I will with Speed ; but first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me too . Exit , to have his wound dress 'd . PONTEACH solus . Pale , breathless Youths ! Your Dignity still lives : Viewing the bodies . Your Murderers were blind , or they 'd have trembled , Nor dar 'd to wound such Majesty and Worth ; It would have tam 'd the savage running Bear , And made the raging Tyger fondly fawn ; But your more savage Murderers were Christians . Oh , the distress 'd good King ! I feel for him , And wish to comfort his desponding Heart ; But your last Rites require my present Care . Exit . SCENE II . The Senate-House . PONTEACH , TENESCO , and others . PONTEACH . Let all be worthy of the royal Dead ; Spare no Expense to grace th ' unhappy Scene , And aggrandize the solemn , gloomy Pomp With all our mournful , melancholy Rites . TENESCO .

Never were Funeral Rites bestow 'd more just ; Who knew them living , must lament them dead ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tombs With all the sad Respect of Grief and Tears . TENESCO . The Mourning is as general as the News ; Grief sits on every Face , in every Eye , And gloomy Melancholy in Silence reigns : Nothing is heard but Sighs and sad Complaints , As if the First-born of the Realm were slain . PONTEACH . Thus would I have it ; let no Eye be dry No Heart unmov 'd , let every Bosom swell With Sighs and Groans . What Shouting do I hear ? A shouting without , repeated several times . TENESCO . It is the Shout of Warriors from the Battle ; The Sound of Victory and great Success . He goes to listen to it . PONTEACH . Such is the State of Men and human Things ; We weep , we smile , we mourn , and laugh thro ' Life , Here falls a Blessing , there alights a Curse , As the good Genius or the evil reigns . It 's right it should be so . Should either conquer , The World would cease , and Mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This constant Mixture makes the Potion safe , And keeps the sickly Mind of Man in Health . Enter CHEKITAN .

These smother 'd Groans and stifled half-drawn Sighs ; Does it offend that I 've return 'd in Triumph ? PONTEACH . I fear to name  --  And yet it must be known . Aside .

I know you 're shock 'd  --  The Scene has shock 'd us all , And what we could , we 've done to wipe the Stain From us , our Family , our Land and State ; And now prepare due Honours for the Dead , With all the solemn Pomp of public Grief , To shew Respect as if they were our own . CHEKITAN . Is this my Triumph after Victory ? A solemn , dreadful pompous Shew : Why have I ' scap 'd their Swords and liv 'd to see it ? Aside . Monelia dead ! aught else I could have borne : I 'm stupefy 'd : I ca n't believe it true ; Shew me the Dead ; I will believe my Eyes , But can not mourn or drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to them  --  Follow me  --  Exeunt TENESCO and CHEKITAN . PONTEACH . This is a sad Reception from a Conquest , And puts an awful Gloom upon our Joy ; I fear his Grief will overtop his Reason ; A Lover weeps with more than common Pain . Nor flows his greatest Sorrow at his Eyes : His Grief is inward , and his Heart sheds Tears , And in his Soul he feels the pointed Woe , When he beholds the lovely Object lost . The deep-felt Wound admits no sudden Cure ; The festering Humour will not be dispers 'd , It gathers on the Mind , and Time alone , That buries all Things , puts an End to this . Exeunt omnes . SCENE III . The Grove , with the dead bodies ; TENESCO pointing CHEKITAN to them . TENESCO . There lie the Bodies , Prince , a wretched Sight ! Breathless and pale . CHEKITAN . A wretched Sight indeed ; Going towards them . Oh , my Monelia ; has thy Spirit fled ? Art thou no more ? a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd with Hopes of Joy , With all the Honours Victory can give , To see thee thus ? Is this , is this my Welcome ? Is this our Wedding ? Wilt thou not return ? Oh , charming Princess , art thou gone for ever ? Is this the fatal Period of our Love ? Oh ! had I never seen thy Beauty bloom , I had not now been griev 'd to see it pale : Had I not known such Excellence had liv 'd , I should not now be curs 'd to see it dead : Had not my Heart been melted by thy Charms , It would not now have bled to see them lost . Oh , wherefore , wherefore , wherefore do I live : Monelia is not  --  What 's the World to me ? All dark and gloomy , horrid , waste , and void : The Light of the Creation is put out !  --  The Blessings of the Gods are all withdrawn ! Nothing remains but Wretchedness and Woe ; Monelia 's gone ; Monelia is no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : The Earth is curs 'd , for it hath drunk her Blood ; The Air is Poison , for she breathes no more : Why fell I not by the base Briton 's Sword ? Why press 'd I not upon the fatal Point ? Then had I never seen this worse than Death , But dying said , ' t is well  --  Monelia lives . TENESCO . Comfort , my Prince , nor let your Passion swell To such a Torrent , it o'erwhelms your Reason , And preys upon the Vitals of your Soul . You do but feed the Viper by this View ; Retire , and drive the Image from your Thought , And Time will soon replace your every Joy . CHEKITAN . O my Tenesco , had you ever felt The gilded Sweets , or pointed Pains of Love , You 'd not attempt to sooth a Grief like mine . Why did you point me to the painful Sight ? Why have you shown this Shipwreck of my Hopes , And plac 'd me in this beating Storm of Woe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why wa' n't the wretched Ruin all conceal 'd Under some fair Pretence  --  That she had fled  --  Was made a Captive , or had chang 'd her Love  --  Why wa' n't I left to guess her wretched End ? Or have some slender Hope that she still liv 'd ? You 've all been cruel ; she died to torment me ; To raise my Pain , and blot out every Joy .  --  TENESCO . I fear 'd as much : His Passion makes him wild  --  Aside . I wish it may not end in perfect Frenzy . CHEKITAN . Who were the Murderers ? Where did they fly ? Where was my Brother , not to take Revenge ? Show me their Tracks , I 'll trace them round the Globe ; I 'll fly like Lightning , ravage the whole Earth  --  Kill every thing I meet , or hear , or see . Depopulate the World of Men and Beasts , ' T is all too little for that single Death . Pointing to MONELIA 'S corpse . I 'll tear the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Plants , and every springing Flower : Nothing shall grow , nothing shall be alive , Nothing shall move ; I 'll try to stop the Sun , And make all dark and barren , dead and sad ; From his tall Sphere down to the lowest Centre , There I 'll descend , and hide my wretched Self , And reign sole Monarch in a World of Ruin . TENESCO . This is deep Madness , it hath seiz 'd his Brain . Aside . CHEKITAN . But first I 'll snatch a parting last Embrace . He touches and goes to embrace the corpse . Thou dear cold Clay ! forgive the daring Touch ; It is thy Chekitan , thy wounded Lover . ' T is ; and he hastens to revenge thy Death . TORAX groans and attempts to speak . TORAX . Oh , oh , I did not  --  Philip  --  Philip  --  Oh . CHEKITAN starts . CHEKITAN . What  --  did I not hear a Groan ? and Philip call 'd ? TENESCO . It was , it was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaks again . TORAX . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Philip  --  help . Oh ! Oh ! TENESCO . He is alive  --  We 'll raise him from the Ground . They lift him up , and speak to him . Torax , are you alive ? or are our Ears deceiv 'd ? TORAX . Oh . Philip , do not  --  do not  --  be so cruel . CHEKITAN . He is bewilder 'd , and not yet himself . Pour this into his Lips  --  it will revive him . They give him something . TENESCO . This is a Joy unhop 'd for in Distress . TORAX revives more . TORAX . Oh ! Philip , Philip !  --  Where is Philip gone ? TENESCO . The Murderers are pursued  --  He will go soon . And now can carry Tidings of your Life . TORAX . He carry Tidings ! he 's the Murderer . TENESCO . He is not murder 'd ; he was slightly wounded , And hastens now to see the King your Father . TORAX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A Murderer , a base disguis 'd Assassin . CHEKITAN . He still is maz 'd , and knows not whom he 's with TORAX . Yes , you are Chekitan , and that 's Monelia . Pointing to the corpse . This is Tenesco  --  Philip stabb 'd my Sister , And struck at me ; here was the stunning Blow . Pointing to his head . He took us sleeping in this silent Grove ; There by Appointment from himself we waited . I saw him draw the bloody Knife from her , And , starting , ask 'd him , Why , or what he meant ? He answered with the Hatchet on my Skull , And doubtless thought me dead and bound in Silence . I am myself , and what I say is Fact . TENESCO . The English ' t was beset you ; Philip ran For your Assistance , and himself is wounded . TORAX . He may be wounded , but he wounded me ; No Englishman was there , he was alone . I dare confront him with his Villainy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bloody . CHEKITAN . May we believe , or is this all a Dream ? Are we awake ? Is Torax yet alive ? Or is it Juggling , Fascination all ? TENESCO . ' T is most surprising ! What to judge I know not . I 'll lead him hence ; perhaps he 's still confus 'd . TORAX . I gladly will go hence for some Relief , But shall not change , from what I 've now aver 'd . TENESCO . Then this sad Storm of Ruin ' s but begun . Aside . Philip must fly , or next it lights on him . Exeunt TENESCO and TORAX led by him . CHEKITAN . And can this be  --  Can Philip be so false ? Dwells there such Baseness in a Brother 's Heart ? So much Dissimulation in the Earth ? Is there such Perfidy among Mankind ? It shocks my Faith  --  But yet it must be so  --  Yes , it was he , Monelia , shed thy Blood . This made him forward to commence our Friend , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this so cheerful he resign 'd To me the Honour of Command in War ; The English Troops would never come so near ; The Wounds were not inflicted by their Arms . All , all confirms the Guilt on Philip 's Head . You died , Monelia , by my Brother 's Hand ; A Brother too intrusted with our Love . I 'm stupify 'd and senseless at the Thought ; My Head , my very Heart is petrify 'd . This adds a Mountain to my Weight of Woe . It now is swell 'd too high to be lamented ; Complaints , and Sighs , and Tears are thrown away , Revenge is all the Remedy that 's left ; But what Revenge is equal to the Crime ? His Life for her 's ! An Atom for the Earth  --  A Single Fly  --  a Mite for the Creation : Turn where I will I find myself confounded : But I must seek and study out new Means . Help me , ye Powers of Vengeance ! grant your Aid , Ye that delight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arts of Cruelty and Wrath , Till I have Vengeance equal to my Love , And my Monelia 's Shade is satisfied . Exit . SCENE IV . PHILIP solus . His Grief no Doubt will rise into a Rage , To see his Charmer rolling in her Blood , I choose to see him not till my Return ; By then the Fierceness of the Flame may cease ; Nay , he 'll grow cool , and quite forget his Love , When I report her Father 's kindled Wrath , And all the Vengeance he intends to take . CHEKITAN comes in sight . But this is he , I can not now avoid him ; How shall I soothe his Grief  --  He looks distracted  --  I 'm such a Stranger grown to Tears and Pity , I fear he will not think I sympathize . Enter CHEKITAN . CHEKITAN . Have I then found thee , thou false hearted Traitor ? Thou Tyger , Viper , Snake , thou worse than Christian ; Bloodthirsty Butcher , more than Murderer ! Thou every Thing but what Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see the Sun ? And face me with your savage guilty Eye ? PHILIP . I fear 'd , alas , you would run mad and rave . Why do you blame me that I am not dead ? I risk 'd my Life , was wounded for your Sake , Did all I could for your Monelia 's Safety , And to revenge you on her Murderers . Your Grief distracts you , or you 'd thank me for ' t . CHEKITAN . Would you still tempt my Rage , and fire my Soul , Already bent to spill your treacherous Blood ? You base Dissembler ! know you are detected , Torax still lives , and has discover 'd all . PHILIP starts and trembles . PHILIP . Torax alive !  --  It can not  --  must not be . Aside . CHEKITAN . Well may you shake  --  You can not mend your Blow . He lived to see , what none but you could think of , The bloody Knife drawn from Monelia 's Breast . Had you a thousand Lives , they 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t would be too small To wash away your deep-dy 'd Stain of Guilt . Now you shall die ; and Oh , if there be Powers That after Death take Vengeance on such Crimes , May they pursue you with their Flames of Wrath , Till all their Magazines of Pain are spent . He attacks PHILIP with his hatchet . PHILIP . I must defend myself Drawing his hatchet , the Case is desperate . Fights ; PHILIP falls . Fate is too hard ; and I 'm oblig 'd to yield . ' T was well begun  --  but has a wretched End  --  Yet I 'm reveng 'd  --  She can not live again . You can not boast to ' ve shed more Blood than I  --  Oh , had I  --  had I  --  struck but one Blow more ! Dies . CHEKITAN . What have I done ! this is my Brother 's Blood ! A guilty Murderer 's Blood ! He was no Brother . All Nature 's Laws and Ties are hence dissolv 'd ; There is no Kindred , Friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead  --  The World Is all unhing 'd  --  There 's universal War  --  She was the Tie , the Centre of the Whole ; And she remov 'd , all is one general Jar . Where next , Monelia , shall I bend my Arm To heal this Discord , this Disorder still , And bring the Chaos Universe to Form ? Blood still must flow and float the scatter 'd Limbs Till thy much injur 'd love in Peace subsides . Then every jarring Discord once will cease , And a new World from these rude Ruins rise . Pauses . Here then I point the Edge , from hence shall flow Pointing his knife to his heart . The raging crimson Flood , this is the Fountain Whose swift Day 's Stream shall waft me to thy Arms , Lest Philip 's Ghost should injure thy Repose . Stabs himself . I come , I come  --  Monelia , now I come  --  Philip  --  away  --  She 's mine in spite of Death . Dies . Enter TENESCO . TENESCO . Oh ! I 'm too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this your wretched End ; Your Country 's Hopes and your fond Father 's Joy ; Are you no more ? Slain by each other 's Hands , Or what is worse ; or by the Air you breath 'd ? For all is Murder , Death , and Blood about us : Nothing safe ; it is contagious all : The Earth , and Air , and Skies are full of Treason ! The Evil Genius rules the Universe , And on Mankind rains Tempests of Destruction . Where will the Slaughter of the Species end ? When it begins with Kings and with their Sons , A general Ruin threatens all below . How will the good King hear the sad Report ? I fear th ' Event ; but as it ca n't be hid , I 'll bear it to him in the softest Terms , And summon every Power to soothe his Grief , And slack the Torrent of his Royal Passion . Exit . SCENE V. Senate-House . PONTEACH solus . The Torrent rises , and the Tempest blows ; Where will this rough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to drench the Earth ? What new-form 'd Mischiefs hover in the Air , And point their Stings at this devoted Head ? Has Fate exhausted all her Stores of Wrath , Or has she other Vengeance in reserve ? What can she more ? My Sons , my Name is gone ; My Hopes all blasted , my Delights all fled ; Nothing remains but an afflicted King , That might be pitied by Earth 's greatest Wretch . My Friends ; my Sons , ignobly , basely slain , Are more than murder 'd , more than lost by Death . Had they died fighting in their Country 's Cause , I should have smil 'd and gloried in their Fall ; Yes , boasting that I had such Sons to lose , I would have rode in Triumph o'er their Tombs . But thus to die , the Martyrs of their Folly , Involv 'd in all the complicated Guilt Of Treason , Murder , Falsehood , and Deceit , Unbridled Passion , Cowardice , Revenge , And every Thing that can debase the Man , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foulest Stain of Infamy , Beyond the Power of Time to blot it out ; This is too much ; and my griev 'd Spirit sinks Beneath the Weight of such gigantic Woe . Ye that would see a piteous , wretched King , Look on a Father griev 'd and curs 'd like me ; Look on a King whose Sons have died like mine ! Then you 'll confess that these are dangerous Names , And put it in the Power of Fate to curse us ; It is on such she shews her highest Spite . But I 'm too far  --  ' T is not a Time to grieve For private Losses , when the Public calls . Enter TENESCO , looking sorrowful . What are your Tidings ?  --  I have no more Sons . TENESCO . But you have Subjects , and regard their Safety . The treacherous Priest , intrusted with your Councils , Has publish 'd all , and added his own Falsehoods ; The Chiefs have all revolted from your Cause , Patch 'd up a Peace , and lend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? we must defend ourselves , Supply the Place of Numbers with our Courage , And learn to conquer with our very Looks : This is a Time that tries the Truth of Valour ; He shows his Courage that dares stem the Storm , And live in spite of Violence and Fate . Shall holy Perfidy and seeming Lies Destroy our Purpose , sink us into Cowards ? TENESCO . May your Hopes prosper ! I 'll excite the Troops By your Example still to keep the Field . Exit . PONTEACH . ' T is coming on . Thus Wave succeeds to Wave , Till the Storm 's spent , then all subsides again  --  The Chiefs revolted :  --  My Design betray 'd :  --  May he that trusts a Christian meet the same ; They have no Faith , no Honesty , no God , And can not merit Confidence from Men . Were I alone the boist'rous Tempest 's Sport , I 'd quickly move my shatter 'd , trembling Bark , And follow my departed Sons to Rest . But my brave Countrymen , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not desert the Helm , Nor leave a dang'rous Station in Distress ; Yes , I will live , in spite of Fate I 'll live ; Was I not Ponteach , was I not a King , Such Giant Mischiefs would not gather round me . And since I 'm Ponteach , since I am a King , I 'll shew myself Superior to them all ; I 'll rise above this Hurricane of Fate , And shew my Courage to the Gods themselves . Enter TENESCO , surprised and pausing . I am prepar 'd , be not afraid to tell ; You can not speak what Ponteach dare not hear . TENESCO . Our bravest Troops are slain , the rest pursu 'd ; All is Disorder , Tumult , and Rebellion . Those that remain insist on speedy Flight ; You must attend them , or be left alone Unto the Fury of a conquering Foe , Nor will they long expect your Royal Pleasure . PONTEACH . Will they desert their King in such an Hour , When Pity might induce them to protect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , When Men expect their Bounties in Return , Place them in Want , destroy the giving Power , All Sacrifices and Regards will cease . Go , tell my Friends that I 'll attend their Call . Rising . Exit TENESCO . I will not fear  --  but must obey my Stars : Looking round . Ye fertile Fields and glad'ning Streams , adieu ; Ye Fountains that have quench 'd my scorching Thirst , Ye Shades that hid the Sun-beams from my Head , Ye Groves and Hills that yielded me the Chace , Ye flow'ry Meads , and Banks , and bending Trees , And thou proud Earth , made drunk with Royal Blood , I am no more your Owner and your King . But witness for me to your new base Lords , That my unconquer 'd Mind defies them still ; And though I fly , ' t is on the Wings of Hope . Yes , I will hence where there 's no British Foe , And wait a Respite from this Storm of Woe ; Beget more Sons , fresh Troops collect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britons may boast , the Gods may have their Will , Ponteach I am , and shall be Ponteach still .
