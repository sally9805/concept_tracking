Time : 1860  --  an afternoon in late summer . The Scene is a corner of Angie 's garden showing the front of the small one story house with its front door and the small stoop . There is a low stone wall , at back , with several stone steps at center , leading up from the garden to the road . The steps are broken and sunken and over them is a rustic arch covered with bridal wreath  --  now in full blossom . Old-fashioned flowers , with hollyhocks predominating , border the wall and the house , and a round bed of pansies is at right center . A narrow gravel path leads from the door stoop to the stone steps . A crude rustic bench stands above the path . Grass covers the rest of the garden and extends off stage at right  --  with groups of trees and shrubs . It is a peaceful well ordered little spot . At curtain , the stage is empty . After a moment Abe comes slowly out of the front door , carrying a small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps onto the road and puts the trunk on the child 's wagon which is there . Abe is sixty-five  --  sturdy and stocky , having been once a fine figure of a sea-captain , but now bent and stiffened . He stands looking about at the house and garden , wiping his head with his bandanna handkerchief . His old blue reefer and cap and his white trousers still suggest his brave days on the sea . p. 3 Angie comes on to the stoop , an alert small woman of sixty with a face which has not lost its sweetness . Her quaint bonnet and black silk dress and mantle are still well preserved and exquisitely neat , and the curls which show themselves about her face are softening and charming . She puts her shabby old traveling bag on the step . ANGIE It 's just three o'clock , Abe , we got plenty o ' time . I told folks we was n't goin ' till tomorro ' mornin ' , so 's there would n't be nobody hangin ' ' round to see us go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take just one last look ' fore we lock it up . ABE No  --  I do n't want ter . I 've looked my last . Shut it up . ANGIE ( Looking back through the open door ) The clock 's still tickin ' like it was goin ' on fer us just the same . I hope it 'll allers be wound reg'lar . But nobody 'll ever be as good hand at that as you , Abe . ABE Maybe not . Lock it up , mother . Lock it up , and let 's git through with it . ( Abe comes down to sit on the bench . Angie slowly closes the door and locks it . Her head goes forward on the door casing . After a moment she puts the key under the door mat . Abe goes on in a husky voice. ) p. 4 I ai n't bin a good husband ter you , Angie , or you would n't be lockin ' yourself out o ' your own hum forever . ANGIE ( Hurrying down to sit beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so . ( They look away from each other a moment  --  each choking back the tears . ) Look a here , Abe . ' Tai n't too late to change our plans . We 'll take our hundred dollars for a good tomb stone and I 'll go to the poor farm with you  --  ' stead of to the Old Ladies ' Home , an ' we 'll both be together . ABE You wo n't do nothin ' of the kind . I ai n't goin ' to have folks say I could n't even put you in the Hum . ' Tai n't as ef I was goin ' fer away  --  we 'll only be five mile apart . ANGIE I been thinkin ' , father , now we 're goin ' to part we seem ter be gettin ' closer together than ever . We got a lot to be thankful fer . ABE I d'know as we hev . I brung you ter this , Angie . Ef I had n't made so many bad investments and if I 'd put what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to hev you talkin ' that way . It was yours , was n't it  --  to do with as you saw fit ? You might a giv ' me all the riches in the world an ' still we might a bin separated further'n we 'll ever be now . I 'd ruther be saying goodbye for the poor farm an ' loving you , Abe , than sittin ' with you in luxury an ' not caring whether you was settin ' with me or not . ( He turns away . She puts her hand on his. ) p. 5 Ef I kin say that , after all these years , we got somethin ' priceless  --  ai n't we  --  that can never be took away from us  --  auction sale or no auction sale . ABE We might a got two hundred  --  stid of one , ef you 'd let me advertise the sale a little sooner , Angie . ANGIE ( Going up to her flowers by the wall ) You would n't a wanted folks comin ' here buyin ' our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is , everything was bought by somebody as needed it , and got good value . My tea strainer thet went for the extry three cents over the hundred was the biggest bargain of all . But the tea strainer wo n't be no good to me now and the three cents will . I kin keep that fer my own pocket money . ABE What good will three cents do in your pocket ? Could n't even burn a hole . ANGIE It 'll buy a postage stamp , wo n't it  --  so 's I kin write to you ? ABE So ' twill  --  so ' twill . You be awful thrifty , Angie  --  more'n I be . ANGIE Men was n't meant to be careful in little things like women . ' Tai n't manly . Do you think  --  There would n't be nothin ' wrong or dishonest ' bout my pickin ' a few flowers to take with me , would there ? ABE Certainly not . Ai n't they yourn ? ANGIE No , they ai n't . They was sold yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick all you please an ' ef any complaints is made , I 'll hev my say to the sheriff . ANGIE ( Going about  --  picking flowers here and there ) p. 6 I 'll take ' em to Abigail at the Home . She loves flowers . ( Kneeling by the pansy bed ) ' Tai n't as ef I was goin ' among entire strangers . They 's three gals there I used to go to school with  --  Abigail , Blossy and Nancy Smith . It 's really goin ' to friends  --  an ' I 'll just feel like I was visitin '  --  for a long while I reckon . ABE Them there gals is three old maids . The Hum is a natural ' nough endin ' fer them thet ai n't never had no man to take keer of ' em . It 's different with you . It reflects on me to have you go . ANGIE ( Picking the pansies ) I guess of the two they 'd rather hev hed some kind of a man  --  an be goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hev hed no man at all . ABE You could n't git a ole maid to own up to thet . They 'll twit you  --  sure as sunrise  --  ' bout your old man not bein ' able to take keer o ' you in yer last days . ANGIE If they do I 'll hev plenty to say to them ' bout all the years he did take keer of me . ( Picking a sprig of forget-me-not ) Here , you must go away with a sprig of your forget-me-not in your button-hole . It would feel you was fergittin ' your favorite ef you did n't . Ai n't the pansies sweet today  --  liftin ' up their little faces like they was speakin ' to us ? Law me  --  the things I 've told to them ! You never knowed it , Abe  --  but whenever you and me hed a sharp word or two , I allers come out to talk it over with them  --  an ' somehow they allers took your part , an ' sent me back ashamed o ' myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANGIE No , we ai n't , Abe  --  an ' that 's what the pansies understand . They know that as soon as they could make me blame myself , I did n't have nothin ' agin you , and thet was peace . ABE Thet reasonin 's no good to me . It 's cause I 'm blamin ' myself now thet I got such hell inside o ' me . Ef I could find somebody else to put it on  --  somebody to kick the very entrails out of , it would be a heap sight more soothin ' to me than settin ' here acceptin ' it . ANGIE Why , Abe dear , you ai n't got the right idea about it at all . You 're bitter-like and resentin ' it  --  stid o ' lookin ' at it as one of the strange ways of Providence you do n't understand . ABE I ai n't got no use for a Providence thet knocks you flat  --  an ' tells you thet 's something you do n't understand . It 's just plain blasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money an ' he s good luck an ' some do n't , an ' I 'm one o ' the ones that do n't an ' there ai n't no other way about it . ANGIE Why , Abe Rose ! You ai n't goin ' to get sacriligeous and profane . Where 's your character ? Has money got anything to do with thet ? Just ' cause we 've been a little unfortunate so far as dollars an ' cents is concerned does that change you ? You 're the same man I married an ' loved an ' honored all these years an ' I ruther be standin ' here with you now , turned out , than anybody else on earth . What makes you act like an ordinary man an ' talk about money ? You 're my man  --  an ' you 're jest the way I want you . Do n't hevin ' me mean anything ter you ? ( Going to him she puts her hand on his shoulder . He leans his head on her arm. ) p. 7 ABE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer shoe strings , mother , I ai n't . ( Angie puts the sprig of forget-me-not in his button-hole . ) ANGIE Come , now , get the bag up the steps on to the road while I finish my bouquet and we 'll start along so 's we kin take our time an ' not be hurried gittin ' there . We can go easy and set down once in a while . I got some crackers in here . ( Touching her reticule ) And a surprise fer you  --  tobacco . ABE ( Crossly as he gets Angie 's bag ) It 's all gone . ANGIE No , ' tai n't . I bin scrimpin ' you , ' long ever day fer a week , holdin ' back a pinch so 's you could have a fine pipeful fer this long walk . ABE You beat all , mother . There ai n't nobody like you . ANGIE ( Going to him and putting her head on his arm for a moment ) There ai n't nobody like you nuther . ( She gets her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied it do n't matter a hill o ' beans what other folks thinks . ABE ( Going up onto the road ) p. 8 Awful hot . Should n't wonder ef we 'd have a shower ' fore night . ANGIE Think so ? You always was a better weather prophet than me . ( She turns to look at the house and all of her flowers , saying goodbye to them in silent agony . ) ABE Come along , mother . ANGIE Yes  --  I 'm comin ' . The smoke 's still comin ' out of the kitchen chimbly . I 'm glad . It makes it seem alive an ' expectin ' us back . ABE ( Speaking harshly to hide his emotion ) Come along , mother  --  let 's git through with it . ANGIE Yes , Abe , but let 's do it gentle , so we wo n't have no regrets . We 're goin ' to remember this minute  --  the rest of our lives . ABE I reckon so . ANGIE ( Going up to stand in the arch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' carried me over thet door sill . I used to think little feet would be patterin ' over it and stumblin ' through the flowers as the years came along  --  but it was n't to be . All I kin say is  --  I would n't change an hour we 've spent here  --  not one . Would you ? ( She slips her arm through his and leans against him limply as they stand under the arch of the bridal wreath. ) p. 9 ABE Not one  --  mother  --  not one . ( She sobs  --  hiding her face on his shoulder . His arms close about her . ) Do n't Angie . Do n't . ANGIE I ai n't a goin ' to . I ai n't a goin ' to do thet again . Besides , I got to keep my handky folded neat when I git there . Let me hev  --  a corner of yourn , Abe . ( Taking his handkerchief from his pocket to wipe her eyes ) My , you look awful nice today , father . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushes his sleeve . ) You remember the mornin ' we planted this  --  the bridal wreath ? ABE I reckon I do . ( She reaches up and breaks two sprays . ) ANGIE You press thet in your Bible when you go to bed tonight  --  an I 'll do the same . My bridal wreath ai n't never withered for me  --  and thet 's what I want you to keep on thinkin ' . Oh , Abe , I can give up all the rest  --  it 's you I ca n't do without . Let me go with you . ' Tai n't too late yit  --  let me . ABE No , mother  --  no ! Am I the head o ' the house or not ? ANGIE Yes , you be , Abe  --  you be . ABE Then do n't never say thet again . This is all I kin do fer you , Angie , fer God 's sake let me do it . ( He strides off pulling the wagon after him ) p. 10 ANGIE You 're awful good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they be proud to hev such a good lookin ' man as you at the poor farm ! I always loved the way that coat fitted  --  ( Trying to keep up her bravery she breaks  --  bending over the gate as she closes it . ) ABE ( From the road ) Come , mother  --  come . ANGIE Yes , I 'm comin '  --  I 'm comin ' . ( She puts out a shaking hand in goodbye to her home and goes slowly out of sight . ) CURTAIN @x Scene : The veranda of " The Home " fills the stage at back . There is a double door at center leading into the hall and steps at front going down to the grass . Time : Two hours later . At Curtain : Nancy is rocking vigorously in a low chair , crocheting a shawl . Mrs. Homans , sitting at the other end of the porch , is reading a dull looking book . SMITH ( Who is small and quick and sharp ) There 's many a one comes to it thet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible fine thing for herself when she married young Captain Abe Rose and give herself awful airs at the weddin ' , when she hoped the rest of us would git a good man too . Much good it done her . This is what she 's come to . MRS . HOMANS ( A widow in respectable widow 's weeds . A very small woman with very black hair and a most impressive dignity ) Pride does n't protect us . We suffer through other people 's iniquities . What could have been more unforeseen than that I should be an inmate of an old woman 's home ? SMITH ( Still rocking ) That 's what I say . If anybody hed ever told me that I  --  p. 12 MRS . HOMANS My case is very different . The wife of a successful physician is particularly out of place here . I hope all his children suffer as I am suffering before they die . I was as good to them as their own mother and this is what they 've done to me . SMITH You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I was always agin marryin ' a widower . I 've hed many a chance and refused ' em all  --  and I ca n't see but what I 'm just as well off as the rest of you . Angie 's comin ' to it now . MRS . HOMANS This is a very good place for some people , but when a woman 's had what I 've had . . . . SMITH Blossy says you ai n't any better'n the rest of us and it 's time you settled down and made the best of it and stop actin ' as if you was a outsider  --  which you ai n't . MRS . HOMANS Blossy 's little empty , addle-pated , feather-brained head will never comprehend what I 've gone through , nor what I suffer in being here . She could n't suffer as I do . She has n't the intellect to do it . SMITH Yes , Blossy is cheerful an ' empty , but I must say I like her . ( Sarah Jane enters from C. door carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives . Sarah Jane is tall and square and spare . She wears a calico wrapper and a small woolen shoulder shawl. ) p. 13 SARAH JANE The newcomer do n't seem to be hurtin ' herself to git here . Ef I 'd been in her place I 'd a got here bright an ' early this mornin ' an ' sort o ' took hold and felt acquainted by night  --  ' specially since it 's Saturday . ( Sitting on the top step and leaning against a pillar , she starts to peel the apples ) MRS . HOMANS We are n't all as anxious to get to this place as you evidently were . SARAH JANE Some folks ought ter be so thankful to git here they 'd go down on their knees to it and crawl up the front steps , stid o ' settin ' like a spinks afraid to move for fear folks wo n't know how grand they be . I 've been a good worker in my time , thank God , and I ai n't afeerd to own up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work keeps folks sane an ' sound and keeps ' em from gettin ' all stove up both in mind an ' body  --  ef they only knowed it . SMITH ( With acid sweetness ) I was jist a sayin ' what a good worker you was , Sarah Jane . SARAH JANE I bet you said thet an ' a plenty more . I never knew you to stop with one remark , Nancy Smith . You an ' Mis ' Homans hev plenty o ' time for conversation an ' back bitin ' . . . . MRS . HOMANS On the contrary , I 've had no conversation since I came . You can only converse with your equals . p. 14 SARAH JANE Why do n't you talk to yourself , then ? ( Abigail comes onto the veranda fanning herself with her apron . ) ABIGAIL What 's keepin ' Angie , I wonder . Time she turned up , ai n't it ? ( Abigail is the matron of the home generously large in body and heart , a mother to all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawdlin ' along . Angie never was so terrible swift . ABIGAIL She 's puttin ' off sayin ' goodbye to Abe , I guess . My heart aches for her . He 's the salt o ' the earth to Angie . MRS . HOMANS Poor salt to let her come to this . ABIGAIL ( In a gentle drawling voice ) Well I d'know , Mis ' Homans . Some people think a roof over their head is somethin ' to be thankful for . Now , I know Angie 's thankful in her heart and she wo n't come to us with no hard feelin 's , but it 's goin ' to be an awful pull to her to say goodbye to Abe  --  an awful pull  --  an ' he goin ' five miles away to the poor house . I declare I must manage to let her see him once in a while . Poor little Angie ! SARAH JANE What you " poorin ' " Angie fer ? She 's got to stand it  --  same as the rest o ' us. p. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the last to come . I 'm always sorry for the last . Besides their little roof has been sold right over their heads . Captain Rose has been a shiftless soul all his life  --  dabblin ' in this and that ever since he give up his boat  --  stid o ' saltin ' it away . SMITH An ' Angie treatin ' him as if he was God a'mighty . ABIGAIL ( Laughing ) Why not ? You women that never had a man ca n't understand . You do n't marry a man to cure his faults  --  but just because he is a man , an different to you . SARAH JANE Ketch me ! They ai n't worth worshipin ' . ( Peeling her apples violently . ) ABIGAIL Of course they ai n't . Nobody worships a man because he 's worth it  --  but jist for the comfort and pleasure o ' doin ' it . You 're countin ' on a little extra sass for supper , are you , Sarah Jane , for Angie ? SARAH JANE ( Looking at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be  --  and I brought out a extry knife for parin '  --  case anybody should feel inclined to soil their hands a little , stid o ' bein ' glued to books and crochet hooks . p. 16 MRS .

SMITH ( Never stopping her rocking ) I 'm terrible busy gittin ' this shawl done , for I need it over my shoulders evenings . I ai n't goin ' to git rheumatism for nobody . SARAH JANE You bet you ai n't . You 'll look out for your own shoulder blades . Ef it was anybody else 's rheumatiz you would n't be so spry gittin ' it done .

ABIGAIL Oh , she 's used to him an ' she 's too old to take on new habits . SMITH Ketch me grievin ' after any man thet could n't take care of me . SARAH JANE Every time a married woman comes to jine us , I say to myself " I told you so ! Where 's the good o ' men when it comes to a pinch ? " p. 17 MRS . HOMANS ( With haughty curiosity ) A  --  sea captain you say he was , Abigail ? ABIGAIL Yes , has been . MRS . HOMANS A very low grade of people they must be . I wonder the board passed to let her come . ( Resenting this they all talk at Mrs. Homans for a moment . ) SMITH ( Making herself heard above the rest ) She 's as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good a woman  --  as ever stepped over this door sill . All I hope is , Abigail , that you wo n't never let the Captain be hangin ' round here comin ' to see Angie . Ef there 's any visitin ' to be done betwixt them , let her go to the poor farm to see him . MRS . HOMANS Well , I should hope so . We could n't have him coming here . SARAH JANE No sirree  --  no man comin ' ' round this place . Thet 's one thing we 're kinda symbol of . Every woman here either had sense enough never to take a man or else has come to see the one she did take failed her when she needed him most . MRS . HOMANS I do n't agree with you at all , Sarah Jane . SARAH JANE You do n't ? Well , what good are they  --  dead or alive ? You did n't even git your life insurance outer yourn , did you ? p. 18 ABIGAIL ( Laughing ) You 're awful hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim lost every cent he had and used up mine , but if I had it to do all over again  --  I 'd take him . SMITH Shucks ! You 're weak-minded , on the man question , Abigail , that 's what you are  --  jist downright weak-minded . SARAH JANE Some women never does git over it . Look at Blossy , still makin ' a fool of herself over Sam'l Darby . MRS . HOMANS She 's a silly old woman  --  that 's what she is  --  expecting that man to marry her . SMITH ( Stopping her rocking for a moment ) Do n't you think he ever will ? SARAH JANE Never  --  never in this world . SMITH But she says he proposes to her regular once a year , when he comes . MRS . HOMANS Abigail , you ought to stop his coming here . Blossy 's got no business having him come here once a year . It gives The Home a bad look . ABIGAIL ( Chuckling ) Oh , I do n't know . It looks like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch from the hall . She is the spoiled darling of the group , a faded rose with much of the charm and coquetry of her youth still left .

ABIGAIL Come an ' set down , Blossy . SARAH JANE Cool enough most anywheres ef you let your blood chill settin ' still . BLOSSY Has n't Angie come yet ? ABIGAIL Not yet . I 'm gettin ' kinda worried about her . I wish now I 'd planned to send Mike with the horse an ' wagon for her . BLOSSY All I 'm afraid of , is that she 's so heartbroken she 's sick and ca n't come at all . SMITH Fiddlesticks ! We 've all been through it and managed to live .

But my  --  my , the worst was shutting the door for the last time , when you 'd looked and looked till your eyes was  --  ( Her voice breaks. ) p. 20 MRS . HOMANS ( After a long pause in which memory surges over them all ) You do n't need to recall it to me , I had a home that would have broken any woman 's heart to leave . SARAH JANE You talk like the rest of us must o ' lived in a hay mow . I guess I can see my father 's house plain enough without shuttin ' my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contortions . It 's the milk-house that gits me the most , where I done my churnin ' in the cool of the evenin ' with father settin ' near on the back porch smokin ' his pipe  --  and the cows stretchin ' their necks over the meader fence to us , with that low sweet bawlin ' they do towards night , when the shaders begin to git longer and everything 's kind o ' still . SMITH ( Sniffing , but still crocheting and rocking ) I guess I got as much to remember as anybody , if it comes to thet , but it ai n't no use talkin ' about it . I try to fergit it . Our house was always full  --  weddin 's an ' funerals an ' babies bein ' born  --  an ' life  --  life goin ' on .

( Turning fiercely to Blossy . ) Talk about shuttin ' things up an ' sayin ' goodbye  --  why I ai n't done nothin ' but say goodbye to people an ' things for the last twenty years .  --  My life was so full I ai n't got used to the emptiness , not even yet .

BLOSSY There 's everything in it , and I 've been thinking all day today about Angie and how much worse her coming is than any of ours ,  --  because she 's got to say goodbye today , not only to her home , but to her husband  --  and I thought all of a sudden what a selfish old thing I was to be living here in the best room , just because I happened to have a little extra to pay  --  when the little room at the head of the back stairs that Angie was going to have would do for me just as well as not  --  and that if all thirty of us would consent to it we could take Abe in with Angie and they could have my big room .

I have n't any use for this wild idea , and I 'm certain the board of managers will never consent . ABIGAIL ( Rising and taking the bowl of apples ) Let 's go in and ask the other girls what they think . MRS . HOMANS But you must state the case . No pleading . ( She follows Abigail into the house . ) SMITH I 'm a goin ' to speak out my mind plain against it . BLOSSY ( Patting Nancy 's face ) Now Nancy , do n't say too much .

RIDGEWAY It 's the most wonderful one that ever was . I did it myself . SMITH Let 's see , Mary . You 're always doin ' somethin ' fine for us . RIDGEWAY ( Opening the basket ) It 's a ham and I boiled it . SARAH JANE Well , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . HOMANS How did you make it boil ? You 're just a baby . RIDGEWAY Nobody helped me . I got a cook book and did it myself . Hello Aunt Abigail . I brought you a cold ham for your supper . ( As Abigail comes onto the porch again. ) p. 25 ABIGAIL What did I tell you ? Ef we take him in the Lord will provide . RIDGEWAY ( Sitting on the steps ) Take who ? BLOSSY ( Going down to sit R. of Mary ) A man  --  Angie 's husband . We 're going to put it to a vote so 's he wo n't have to go to the poor farm . RIDGEWAY Oh do ! I passed them  --  they 're trudging along the road with a little wagon . Oh do ! It would be the most beautiful thing in the world . SARAH JANE You 're young , child . You ai n't hed enough experience of life to know that one man to thirty women is a terrible poor arrangement . ABIGAIL ( Taking the basket ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . Thank you , honey . ( She goes back into the house .  --  Sarah , Nancy , and Mrs. Homans follow her . ) BLOSSY Excuse us , wo n't you lovey ? ( John a handsome boy of twenty darts in and seeing Blossy hides behind the rain barrel at right of porch . He is tanned and ruddy  --  bareheaded and wearing overalls . He has a shingle in his hand. ) p. 26 RIDGEWAY Make them do it , Aunt Blossy . Be your very sweetest . BLOSSY Not much use being sweet to women . ( John tosses the shingle on the grass . ) What was that ? RIDGEWAY ( Seeing John who peeks around the barrel ) Only a shingle . BLOSSY ( Not seeing John ) John is shingling the other side of the roof . They 're flying around thick . ( She goes into the house . ) JOHN ( Coming slowly to Mary ) I saw you galloping down the road . ( Sprawling on the step beside Mary . ) RIDGEWAY How 's the roof ? JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of mending them . JOHN Uh huh . RIDGEWAY Have you drawn any new ones ? JOHN One  --  last night  --  the best of all . RIDGEWAY What 's it like ? p. 27 JOHN ( Looking at her warmly ) A little one  --  for two . RIDGEWAY Oh , everything you do is just for two . Why do n't you do big ones  --  and churches  --  with great steeples stretching into the sky ? JOHN If I drew all the things I see , chair by the door he puts it near the post and stands on it ) Come up and see it . RIDGEWAY Ca n't . JOHN Yes you can . Get a chair and stand on it . RIDGEWAY Ca n't . JOHN It 's a blue bird 's . There 's three little eggs in it . RIDGEWAY ( Getting up from the steps quickly ) There are not . JOHN Honest . RIDGEWAY Hold them up . Let me see . JOHN You got to come up . They might break . RIDGEWAY ( Jumping on the porch she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on it ) I ca n't see them . p. 28 JOHN Put your hand in . RIDGEWAY ( Reaching into the nest ) Do n't let me squash them . JOHN You wo n't . ( Taking out two eggs he puts them in her hands  --  keeping the other one ) RIDGEWAY Are n't they darling ? Little delicate , fragile things ! Is n't it wonderful ? Gracious , are n't they the most beautiful things you ever saw ? JOHN ( Looking at her ) Not so beautiful as something else . RIDGEWAY What ? ( Shutting her eyes and turning her head away ) Silly ! JOHN Open your eyes . RIDGEWAY No . JOHN Please . RIDGEWAY No . Put them back . JOHN No . RIDGEWAY Please , John . ( She gives John the eggs  --  flushed and shy from her closeness to him . ) It 's warm is n't it ? I must be going . ( Mary jumps down from the chair to the porch ) Oh , do you know what they 're doing , the old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN What ? ( Throwing himself down beside her ) RIDGEWAY Voting on taking in an old man so he can be with his wife . JOHN What ? To live here ? RIDGEWAY Is n't it sweet ? ( John rolls over laughing . ) Well , I do n't see anything so funny about it  --  I must say . Ssh ! They 'll hear you . JOHN I 'll give him about a week to cut his throat or run away . RIDGEWAY You 're horrid ! It 's a beautiful thing for them to do . JOHN ( Still chuckling ) Why even old Mike lives in a shack as far away from the house as he can get  --  to get away from the women . He wo n't let one of them go near the garden and wo n't even go into the kitchen . Just dumps the vegetables on the back porch . I do n't blame him . RIDGEWAY Poor old things ! They 've all had beaus and sweethearts sometime , I suppose . JOHN Hard to believe . RIDGEWAY No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all young once , really young like us  --  dancing and laughing and having fun . Funny , is n't it ? p. 30 JOHN Pretty funny . I can imagine Blossy may have had her little fling , but not Sarah Jane . RIDGEWAY Yes , even Sarah Jane . Everybody loves somebody , sometime , I suppose . JOHN Do they ? ( Looking at her again deeply and wistfully and lowering his head near her shoulder ) RIDGEWAY ( Pulling his hair ) Goodness , but your hair is thick , John . I wonder if you 'll ever be bald and grey . JOHN ( Looking up at her ) You wo n't . RIDGEWAY Oh yes , I will . JOHN No you wo n't , you 'll always be just as you are . ( They look at each other  --  John kisses her cheek .  --  Blossy calls from the house " Oh Mary ! Mary ! " John jumps up . Mary motions him to go . He runs off . Mary rises  --  Blossy comes onto the porch . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BLOSSY Oh Mary , it went wrong . That is  --  I could have persuaded them , but Nancy and Sarah Jane , and Mrs. Homans were so opposed to it  --  they just behaved dreadful . p. 31 RIDGEWAY What a shame ! BLOSSY You see , they 're the kind of women that ai n't got a man theirselves and do n't want nobody else to have one . I 'm not that way . I like one around  --  most any kind . ( Giggling and dimpling and fluttering ) ( Abigail , Sarah Jane , Mrs. Homans , Nancy , Elizabeth and Minerva come back onto the porch talking as they enter . ) ABIGAIL ( Speaking above the others and going down the steps ) I 'm a goin ' down the road to meet them , and not let Abe come up with Angie . If you 're all so set agin ' him , I do n't want the poor old thing to come up to the house at all . SMITH Neither do we . I would n't speak to him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in the first place that he ai n't to be coming here to see Angie . ABIGAIL ( Seeing Abe and Angie ) Ssh ! Ssh ! ( There is a sudden hush  --  Abe and Angie come in  --  Abe dragging the little wagon  --  Angie carrying the flowers she picked ) Howdy , Angie , howdy . ( Abigail embraces Angie warmly . ) I 'm mighty glad to see you , and you too , Abe . ( Going to him to put her hand on his shoulder ) p. 32 ANGIE Howdy everybody . Why , Blossy . ( Embracing her and turning to the others ) My , but it 's nice to see old friends ! And there 's Nancy Smith . Well , well ! ( Abe slowly takes the trunk off of the wagon , placing it at the end of porch , leaving the grip on the wagon ) SMITH How do , Angie . ( Acidly ) BLOSSY Angie  --  this is Sarah Jane . SARAH JANE Welcome . ( Giving Angie her hand stiffly and solemnly ) BLOSSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homans , our last sister but you to come . MRS . HOMANS ( With great elegance ) How do you do . ANGIE ( Dropping a curtsy ) I 'm proud to know you . ABIGAIL You 'll git acquainted with all soon enough . ANGIE Of course I will . And this is my husband , Captain Abe Rose . I made him come up with me because I knew you 'd all be so glad to see him . ( There is a self-conscious moment for them all ) He picked these flowers for you ladies , though when he done it , he did n't know he 'd have the honor of presenting them to you in person . ( Giving the flowers to Blossy and seeing Mary ) And who 's this lovely young thing ? ( Mary moves eagerly towards Angie. ) p. 33 ABIGAIL That 's our Mary  --  Squire Ridgeway 's daughter . Her pa 's President of our Board . ANGIE You do n't say . Howdy , Mary . RIDGEWAY How do you do . I hope you 'll let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If you only would ! There ai n't nothing could be so sweet . Ai n't it nice to have something so young about the place ? Abe , this is Squire Ridgeway 's daughter . RIDGEWAY How do you do . ANGIE Ai n't she sweet , Abe ? ABE She certain air . SMITH ( Addressing the air in her niftiest way ) Men always does like young faces . ABE Hello , that you , Nancy ? I like all kinds . As fer thet , I do n't know as I ever see a cleverer or more amiable set o ' gals than these here ' pears to be . ( A flutter of pleasure passes over them all . ) I know now it 's all lies the talk about the way you gals quarrel an ' fight amongst yourselves . Do n't see how any such yarn ever got started . They 've even went so fer as to say you  --  ( Angie turns to Abe and coughs  --  he takes the hint ) And here you be as gentle as suckin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all  --  once he saw you . ABE Do n't take more'n one squint to do thet . But I 'll be jogging along now , mother . ( Turning to go and slowly picking up the grip ) ANGIE ( Taking his arm ) I 'll go down to the gate with you , father . ABIGAIL ( Quickly ) Girls  --  do n't you think we might ask Abe to stay to supper ? BLOSSY Oh yes  --  oh yes  --  do  --  do . ABIGAIL What say  --  Mrs. Homans ? MRS . HOMANS Whatever the other ladies think . I do n't wish to appear inhospitable . ANGIE Ai n't they kind , Abe ? ABE They certain air . Thank you kindly fer your hospitality , ladies  --  but I  --  I 'm kinda busy this evenin '  --  I 'll be joggin ' along . ( He takes the tongue of the wagon and starts to go ) ANGIE ( Clinging to him ) I 'll walk a piece with you , father . You see he 'd like to stay ladies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll jist walk down the road a little way . ( They go off ) p. 35 SARAH JANE ( After an eloquent pause ) I ai n't so sartain we 're doin ' the right thing . Angie clings to him with her soul . BLOSSY ( In tears ) Her heart 's broke . ABIGAIL You all do n't know what she 's goin ' through . SMITH I guess I got feelings ef I ai n't married . I ai n't agin takin ' him at all . In fact  --  come to think of it  --  I think we ought  --  as Christian women . MRS . HOMANS I thought you were making a hasty decision . RIDGEWAY Oh , do take him . I 'll get father to make the Board agree and they will if he says so . BLOSSY Oh girls , ' tai n't too late yet . Ca n't we call him back , ca n't we ? SARAH JANE Why not ? We ai n't tongue-tied . BLOSSY Run , Abigail , you do it . Bring ' em back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reward you for this , girls . ( Abigail runs off calling " Angie  --  Angie  --  Abe  --  Abe . " Mary follows her ) p. 36 SARAH JANE Ef you 'll all hold back a mite on the apple sass , they 'll be a heapin ' dishful for Abe . BLOSSY Ought n't we to call him " Brother Abe " ? SMITH Of course . We must make him to home , now that we 're doin ' it . Makes me think , I 've got a hand-painted mustache cup ai n't doin ' no good to nobody . I 'll just run an ' fetch it an ' give it to him as a kind o ' welcome . ( She hurries into the house . ) BLOSSY You are sweet , Nancy . I 'll just look around my room and leave as many things as I can spare to make ' em comfortable . MRS . HOMANS I have a number of things that belonged to my late husband that the Captain might as well have . SARAH JANE I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to put in extry work . And a man makes it  --  let me tell you . MRS . HOMANS Here they come . ABIGAIL ( Coming back out of breath ) Girls , girls , I give Captain Rose your message and him and Angie has consented to stay . ( Angie and Abe come back with the wagon . ) ANGIE We  --  we jist ca n't say nothin ' . p. 37 BLOSSY ' Tai n't necessary . The ladies has elected me to speak a word of welcome to Brother Abe , and tell him we hope he will be one of us in the same spirit of friendliness in which we invite you . SMITH ( Coming back with the mustache cup  --  which she holds out to Abe ) And as a memento o ' the occasion an ' an auspicious beginning , I present you this here mustache cup with our compliments . ANGIE ( Taking the cup and giving it to Abe ) You see ladies , Abe ai n't used to makin ' speeches , an ' he 's overcome with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a great honor you have conferred upon him . To lay down tonight  --  together  --  among friends is  --  well , I guess you all know  --  that 's why you done it . All Abe an ' me can say is , we hope you wo n't never be sorry you took us in together  --  an ' God bless you . ( Turning to Abe  --  she unfolds her handkerchief ) You see , Abe , I 'm glad I kept it folded . ABIGAIL ( Choking back her tears ) Well , I must go at the supper . Sarah Jane , you an ' me must go in . ( She goes into the house followed by Sarah . ) SMITH I 'll come an ' lay the table  --  an ' Abe , I 'll put you at the head . ( Beaming at Abe she goes in. ) p. 38 MRS . HOMANS You may have heard of my late husband , Captain . You remind me somewhat of him . ABE Thank you ma'am . Thank you . ( With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLOSSY I 'll get your room ready and have Mike come and bring your trunk up the back way . ( She goes . Abe sits on the steps , putting the cup on the porch . ) ANGIE Abe , it 's nothing short of a miracle thet we 're here . Ai n't they kind an ' friendly though ? They could n't be more so , could they ? ABE No  --  they could n't , but they 's an awful lot of ' em  --  an ' I ai n't seen half yit . ANGIE ( Going up onto the porch ) Well , you like gals , an ' you need n't pretend you do n't . ABE Yes , but I like ' em one at a time . ANGIE See what a pretty stretch o ' medder over yonder . You do n't know what it means to me to know thet you 're settin ' right there on them steps and thet I kin reach out an ' touch you . Oh , the blessed Lord he s been good to us this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit for supper . Come on . ( Tapping his shoulder ) p. 39 ABE I ca n't do it , Angie . ANGIE Ca n't ? ABE I ca n't do it . ANGIE Ca n't walk up ? ABE Ca n't face them females . It 's come over me like a terrible ignominy . Me , a sea-captain  --  used to bein ' obeyed by the cussedest dogs o ' men . I ca n't do anything so weak an ' womanish as this . ANGIE ( Bending down to him ) Do n't you think I know how you feel ? Do it for my sake . Ca n't you think jist o ' the blessed peace o ' bein ' together  --  an ' fergit everything else ? Come on . Come . ( He rises  --  going up onto the porch .  --  She takes his arm .  --  They stand facing the door . ) ABE I do n't know now whether I 'm a man or a woman , Angie . ANGIE I 'll lean on you . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( They go through the door as the curtain falls. ) @x Time : Three months later . An afternoon in late autumn . Scene : The sitting room at " the Home . " A wide deep room in an old Colonial house with large fireplace at C. back . A window is at R. of fireplace , two windows in L. side of room . A single door at L. of fireplace leading into hall . Double doors at R. leading into the dining room . The furniture is all old-fashioned and much worn . The general effect that of cleanliness and comfort . The stairway is seen in the hall , when the door is open . As the Curtain Rises : Blossy and Abe are seated by the fireplace . Abe is wearing a quilted dressing jacket ornamented with bright tassels , obviously a gift . Blossy is looking fresh and alluring with a gay jacket over her faded frock . BLOSSY ( Holding a letter in her hand ) He do n't use many words but he writes a beautiful letter and they come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as doomsday . ABE Yes  --  Sam'l Darby was allers a man o ' few words . When we was togither at the life savin ' station , one word from him was worth fifty from anybody else fer keepin ' the men in line . Why did n't you take him long ago , Blossy , and git done with it ? p. 41 BLOSSY Maybe I am too fastidious  --  but his wig being always over one ear and the mole on the end of his nose just fidgets me so  --  somehow I never got myself to the point where I could decide to face it forever . Forever is an awful long time to live with a man 's faults . ABE An ' a mole on the end of a man 's nose is a very small matter . You hev to look deeper'n thet . BLOSSY I know , I know , but oh sakes , Abe , if men only knew what nice little ways meant to a woman ! ABE That 's what a man 's got a right to expect in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look fer more important things in a man . BLOSSY ( Taking another letter from the old leather writing case she holds on her lap ) You wo n't think I 'm bold , Abe , if I read this to you ? I 'm not betraying Samuel 's confidence  --  I 'm just seeking your masculine advice . I 've lived with women so long I 've kind o ' got all milk and watery and ca n't make up my mind to nothing . ABE ( Complacently ) I understand . Fire away . BLOSSY ( Reading the letter . ) " Dear Blossy : If you 'll marry me , I 'll make you a good husband and you wo n't never have no cause to complain of my conduct . Yours truly , Samuel Darby . " Here 's another one : " Dear Blossy : I 'll make you a awful good husband if you 'd only make up your mind to marry me and my conduct would always be above complaint . Yours truly , Samuel Darby . " I 'm takin ' them just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's made up to one thing ; I 'd make you a terrible good husband if you could only see it , and as to conduct you would n't never have no cause to complain of mine . Yours truly , Samuel Darby . " And here 's  --  p. 42 ABE So fer as I kin see you do n't need to go no further . Them letters shows a fine character  --  stickin ' to the p'int an ' never deviatin ' from it . What more could you ask fer ? BLOSSY Samuel has been faithful , I must say that for him . Thirty years he 's been courtin ' me . ABE Well  --  I should call thet more habit than faithfulness  --  but you 'd be an awful fool not to take him . The only fight me an ' Sam'l ever hed was over speculatin ' . I put a lot of money in Tenafly gold stocks an ' he salted his away . I wish now I 'd a took his advice . He 's got a tidy little sum put by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . BLOSSY He says he built that house for me . ABE Then either say " yes " and git in it , or say " no " an ' let him git somebody else . BLOSSY I  --  I  --  I 'm just comin ' to the principal part . His regular letter did n't come last time , so I wrote an ' asked him if he was n't feelin ' well , and this is his answer . " Dear Blossy : I never felt better in my life . Ai n't been sick a minute . Just made up my mind I was an old fool and was going to quit . If you change your intentions at any time just drop me a line . Samuel Darby , Esquire . " ( She is dissolved in tears. ) p. 43 ABE Good fer Sam'l ! I like his spunk . Serves you right  --  foolin ' with a honest man . ( Blossy sobs . ) There  --  there  --  churk up and send him the line . He 's woke up . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he 's goin ' to hev somebody . You snap him up quick . BLOSSY ( Drying her eyes ) You wo n't say anything to the girls about this ? ABE Do n't worry . I ai n't bin here three months without learnin ' to know nothing about nothing . BLOSSY ( Leaning forward and lowering her voice ) Not even Angie . ABE There 's some things a man  --  SMITH ( Opening the hall door wide enough to put her head in ) Who 's in here ? Land sakes  --  you two here all alone ? Where 's Angie ? ( Nancy comes in and Blossy , much flustered , quickly puts her apron over the letter case . Nancy eyes it suspiciously and goes to sit in a low rocker . ) ABE Angy 's outside , knockin ' about somewheres . SMITH ( Beginning to rock and taking out of her bag a pair of wristlets which she is knitting ) Oh , is she ? I should a thought you 'd a bin with her . p. 44 ABE ( Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart ) I 'm purty comfortable . It 's a little nippy outside . SMITH Yes and Blossy bein ' such good company time passes fast . I ' spose you ai n't got an idee what time it is , Blossy . BLOSSY ( Beaming at Abe ) Not when I 'm with Brother Abe . SMITH You got your work under your apern ? Why do n't you go ahead with it ? BLOSSY It 's a secret . I 'm keepin ' it from everybody but Abe . SMITH I ai n't no hand fer hidin ' things . Whatever I do is open and above board . Now , I 'm knittin ' these wristlets fer Brother Abe and I do n't keer who knows it . ABE ( Winking at Nancy ) You hai n't tried ' em on fer some time . Do n't you think you orter ? SMITH ( A little mollified ) No  --  not now ! BLOSSY Is that a hint for me to go ? MRS . HOMANS ( Coming in from the hall  --  carrying a man 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , Brother Abe . I saw Angy go down the path all alone and I wondered why . p. 45 SMITH ( Insinuating as much as possible ) Yes , he 's here . ABE Come in Mis ' Homans . This is a good settin ' chair . MRS . HOMANS Oh thank you , Brother Abe . It is nice to be considered a little . ( Taking Abe 's chair  --  much flattered by this gallant attention ) ABE Are you all warm enough ladies ? Becus ef you ai n't , I 'll go right out an ' git a armful of  --  SMITH Oh no  --  no ! We 're plenty warm . BLOSSY ' Tai n't your place at all to do that , Abe . SMITH It 's thet ornery old Mike 's business to keep the box full . MRS . HOMANS ( Beginning to hem the handkerchief ) Where 's your work , Blossy ? SMITH She 's hidin ' it under her apern . Do n't seem to want us to see it . That 's quite a sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? MRS . HOMANS No , it is n't . I just thought in some of my idle moments I might hem a few for Brother Abe here . p. 46 BLOSSY Dear me ! He is gettin ' lots of nice things , is n't he ? SMITH You any objections ? BLOSSY ( Boldly caressing Abe with her smile ) Not a bit . I want him to be treated the best in the land . ABE ( Monopolizing the fire and spreading himself comfortably ) No man was ever treated handsomer , girls . I will say that fer you . SMITH ( With a testy glance towards Blossy ) Some folks act like they was the only woman knew how to treat a man . ABE Well , you 've each one got your own special p'ints . Now take you Mis ' Homans  --  you  --  SARAH JANE ( Coming in from the hall carrying a large darning basket filled with woolen socks ) I thought likely  --  ( Looking insinuatingly from Abe to the women . ) BLOSSY Come in , Sarah Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Now ai n't that nice ? SARAH JANE Ai n't nothin ' very fancy ' bout my work . ( Holding up a sock  --  showing a large hole in the heel ) I see these when they come out o ' the wash . p. 47 BLOSSY Ai n't you well took care of , Brother Abe ? SARAH JANE I do n't notice thet you 're doin much . SMITH Do n't ask questions . Blossy 's hidin ' hern under her apern . It 's a secret . BLOSSY ( Laughing with pleased excitement at the jealousy ) Yes  --  it is . SARAH &amp;MDASH ; NANCY &amp;MDASH ; MRS . HOMANS I do n't believe in secrets among friends . Why should n't you show us ? ( The three women talk at once growing garrulous , as Angie comes in from the hall . She looks like a little autumn berry with her red cheeks and her snuff brown dress and her red cape . She carries a bunch of red and brown flowers and a small basket . Her dress is tucked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nice and cosey you look ! I knew Abe would n't be lonely . See here , ai n't they lovely ? ( She goes to let Blossy sniff the flowers and then to Nancy . Blossy nervously clutches the apron covering the letters . ) They come so late it makes me love ' em ' specially . Somehow they always make me think of us  --  autumn you know  --  almost nipped by the winter , but blossomin ' away as cheery as can be . Well Abe , is the girls too warm ? You ' pear to be actin ' as a fire screen for ' em . Could I jist git a little nibble fer the tips o ' my fingers ? ( She laughs and pushes Abe to one side , stretching her fingers to the fire. ) p. 48 ABE I offered to git more wood . ANGIE I declare it looks like every one of ' em was makin ' somethin ' fer a man . Blossy , what 's the matter ? What you doin ' ? SMITH I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to go up to my room a minute . I forgot something  --  but I declare I ca n't open the door . ANGIE Abe 'll do thet for you . ABE I reckon I kin . ( Abe goes to open the door for Blossy , the women all watching with curiosity and jealousy , except Angie , who beams contentedly . Blossy drops a letter  --  Abe picks it up . ) BLOSSY I never see a man with better manners . Thank you , Abe , thank you . ABE You kinda bring out a feller 's manners , Blossy . BLOSSY You could n't a said nothin ' prettier . ( She stands on her tiptoes and whispers something in Abe 's ear  --  he bends towards her listening and then chuckles . She flutters out . Abe closes the door and goes back to spread himself before the fire . ) SARAH JANE ( Shivering ) Blossy always could keep a door open longer goin ' out than any woman I ever see . p. 49 SMITH Talk about manners  --  she ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANGIE ( Arranging the flowers in the water jug on the table ) You can always be sure Blossy 's whisperin ' ai n't no harm though . MRS . HOMANS Can you ? SMITH Just to prove it , Brother Abe , you might tell us what she said . ABE W-e-ll  --  now , Nancy , ef you was a whisperin ' somethin ' in my ear , there ai n't no power on earth 'd make me divulge it . SMITH ( Tittering ) Oh you go on ! ABIGAIL ( Entering from the dining room with a note  --  Her face flushed and her sleeves rolled up ) Look a here ! Thet blessed angel Mary has sent a note sayin ' she 's comin ' over this afternoon to give us a tea party . SMITH She 's a lamb . SARAH JANE Always up to somethin ' . MRS . HOMANS She 's a good girl . ABIGAIL I run in to warn you so 's you could all git into your best bib an ' tucker an ' do yourselves proud . p. 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little dignity wo n't hurt us . ( She goes into the hall and up the stairs . ) SMITH I ai n't hed out my best silk this year . I reckon this is about the best chance I 'll git to wear it . ( Following Mrs. Homans . ) SARAH JANE I do n't know as I 've got time to more'n slick my hair . ( Going out after Nancy . ) ABIGAIL I must run . I left my bread in the oven . ( Hurrying into the dining room . ) ANGIE You better put on your best coat , Abe . ( Getting a skein of bright yarn from the piano . ) ABE I 'll be glad to git this thing off . ( Pulling at his jacket . ) ANGIE ( Putting her yarn over the back of a chair to wind it ) You must wear it often though , dearie . That 's the greatest honor Mrs. Homans could have conferred upon you  --  giving you somethin ' that belonged to her late husband . ABE I got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gol darn tassels . p. 51 ANGIE I 've had a nice little tramp around looking at this and that , making plans for the garden next spring . You ought to a bin out with me trampin ' ' round . You stay in the house more than you used to and it ai n't good for you . Thet ai n't the way to keep young . ABE Blossy wanted to ask my advice about a little somethin ' , so I stayed in jist to please her . ANGIE That was right  --  but do n't please one any more than you do t' other . ABE Huh ? ANGIE They 're all a little bit nettled now ' bout them letters o ' Blossy 's . ABE Now , mother , there was n't nothin ' fer you to mind . ANGIE Me mind ? O ' course not . I mean the others . Let me put this little flea in your ear . Women kin be the wisest and most Christian about everything under the sun , and be plumb fools and wildcats about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em all . You 're a hero now , Abe . But it 's an awful dangerous thing to be a hero  --  fer nine cases out of ten they fall down an ' never git up again . History an ' daily life teaches us thet . ABE Do n't you fret , mother . Ef I ca n't take keer o ' myself amongst a passel o ' women , I might 's well lay down an ' die . p. 52 ANGIE I know you mean to , dearie , but dreadful big squalls comes out of mighty small clouds . I 'll trot along now and put on my silk dress , too . I ai n't wore it sence I bin here . You come up in time so 's I kin make your hair lay smooth in the back . Do n't dawdle now .

ANGIE ( Putting the basket on the table and looking at the cakes ) Take off your coat , Mary dear , and Abe 'll hang it in the hall fer you . ABE ( Taking the cape ) I ai n't much fer tea parties but I guess I 'll hev to come to this one , bein ' as it 's Mary 's . ( He goes out  --  closing the door . Mary grasps Angie excitedly by the arms and whirls her about . ) RIDGEWAY Does anybody know ? ANGIE Nary a soul of ' em 's guessed or got the least suspicion . Abe do n't even remember hisself it 's his birthday . ( Turning to look at the window as John appears outside measuring the sash with a rule . ) Oh , it 's John measurin ' something . What are you doin ' , John , out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window ) What are you doing out there ? JOHN ( From outside ) Measuring for the new storm-windows you 're going to have for winter . ANGIE My , ai n't that nice ? Here 's Mary inside . She 's come to give us a tea party . If you 'd climb in an ' do a little measurin ' on the inside , you might git invited . Might n't he , Mary ? RIDGEWAY ( With icy dignity ) No . ANGIE ( Looking at her in surprise ) Why not ? One man 's a comin '  --  might as well hev two . Leastways , you might git a cake . Here  --  ( Opening the basket and putting a cake on the table ) The feller that 's got the courage gits this cake . I must reach down the blue cups and saucers and get the silver cake basket out . Do n't look so scared . When she 's the spunkiest she 's carin ' the most . ( She goes into dining room with the basket . ) JOHN Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . p. 54 JOHN I ca n't come in  --  my boots are muddy . RIDGEWAY You 'd better close the window , then . JOHN Do you hate me now ? RIDGEWAY Why did n't you come to my party last night ? JOHN I could n't . RIDGEWAY You mean you did n't want to . JOHN Oh , if you do n't understand , I  --  RIDGEWAY I asked you to come to my house to meet my father and my mother . JOHN I could n't . You know why . RIDGEWAY I shall never ask you again . JOHN I 'll never come till I can come as good as anybody . I 'll never come while folks wonder why you asked me . I 'm going to clear out and get away  --  ( She turns slowly to look at him ) and I 'm going to stay till I can  --  till you  --  till I 've done something to make you  --  ( He lowers his eyes  --  she goes quickly to the window . ) RIDGEWAY To make me what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm ) Is that why you did n't come ? ( He nods his head . ) You do n't need to go away to make me know you 're better than all the rest . But do it  --  do it and come back  --  and make them know it , too . p. 55 JOHN Do you believe I can ? RIDGEWAY Yes . JOHN And make your father  --  believe , too ? RIDGEWAY Yes . JOHN And  --  will it  --  mean  --  anything  --  to you ? RIDGEWAY It will mean everything in the world . JOHN I can do it  --  now . ( Catching her to him . Angie comes back suddenly . John and Mary start guiltily apart . ) ANGIE ( Looking at the cake which is still on the table ) You did n't get it . JOHN She would n't give it to me . RIDGEWAY He would n't come in . He did n't have the courage after all . ANGIE Then I 'll give it to him . ( Taking the cake to John ) You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've got over makin ' folks deserve everything they git . JOHN ( Devouring the cake ) Thanks Aunt Angie . ANGIE You 're welcome . God bless you , boy ! Life 's callin ' to you . Do n't be afraid of it . p. 56 JOHN Goodbye , Goodbye . ( Angie waves her hand to him and closes the window . ) ANGIE My ! the girl that gets that boy is goin ' to be lucky . Do n't you think so ? Law , do n't hang your head  --  hold it up . You ai n't ashamed of his kiss , are you ? RIDGEWAY ( Hiding her face on Angie 's shoulder ) How did you know ? ANGIE I seen it in your faces . ' Tai n't like no other look on earth . It 's love . RIDGEWAY Mother and father think he 's only a carpenter  --  but he 's going to be a great architect . He 's proud because he 's so  --  so  --  ANGIE So poor . Bless you , child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harder and faster to git you . RIDGEWAY He dreams the most wonderful things  --  about houses and things . It sounds foolish to other people . ANGIE Foolish ? Sometimes I think the dreamin ' is more important than the facts . What we fall short of , is not livin ' up to ' em . You dream high fer him , dearie , and keep your faith . RIDGEWAY Oh ! I wish my mother were like you . She only believes in what she sees . p. 57 ANGIE When I look at you I seem to see the little heads that never laid on my breast . Oh , my dear  --  my dear  --  ( Taking Mary 's face in her hands ) How sweet you are ! ( She kisses her with passionate tenderness . Abe enters from the hall with his hair-brush . ) Gracious , here 's father a'ready an ' I ai n't moved . You see that the kettle 's boilin ' , dearie . ( Mary hurries into the dining room . ) ABE I brung the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks ) They 're awful stubborn . Never hev got broke in all these years I been at ' em . But I kinda like ' em somehow . If they was to take a notion to lay down , I 'd miss ' em dreadful . ( Pointing through the window ) There 's that darlin ' boy again  --  workin ' away . He ai n't got neither father nor mother , Abe . ABE I watch him every day and wish he was my boy . If things hed bin different , Angie , we might of adopted him . ANGIE But it was n't to be , Father  --  it was n't to be . ( Mike looks in at the hall door . Mike is old and gnarled like a tough little pine knot . He is very deaf and a relentless hater of women . He draws back quickly when he sees Angie . ) Come in  --  Mike  --  come in . I 'm goin ' . He must a bin nipped terrible hard by some petticoat . ( She goes into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with an armful of wood which he puts in the woodbox by the fireplace ) These old hens burns more wood than they 're worth . ABE ( Standing with his back to fireplace and shouting to Mike ) You have to keep women-folks warm . MIKE ( Poking the fire ) If I hed my way they 'd all be drowned in the middle of the sea . How you 're still out of your grave at all , here with the thirty of ' em , is what I do n't understand . ( Mike speaks with a rich Irish brogue . ) ABE What I do n't understand is , how one of ' em ai n't married you . MIKE I make ' em keep their distance . It 's the only way a man can live . If I did n't , they be after tellin ' me how to chew me own food . They 'll make a damned softy out o ' you if you do n't mind . ABE ( Raising his voice ) I think one o ' them 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yit . MIKE What 's that you 're sayin ' ? ABE ( Shouting ) One o ' them will git you yit. p. 59 MIKE Like hell ! Not while I 've got my two legs to run with . ( Mike reaches the door  --  Nancy opens it  --  he dodges towards dining room  --  meets Mary  --  turns helplessly from one door to the other  --  darts past Nancy and comes face to face with Mrs. Homans in the hall  --  evading her he manages to escape . ) ABE ( Enjoying the situation immensely ) You got him scared , Nancy . He thinks you 're after him . ( There is a great chattering and clattering as the women pour down the stairs and into the room  --  their voices shrill with an unusual happy expectancy and excitement . They have all donned their best frocks  --  the remains of bygone finery , and the strong bright colors make a bouquet of old-fashioned garden flowers . Their caps , their bits of jewelry and lace , all their best possessions are flaunted proudly for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and most proper form . Mrs. Homans in her stiff black with its voluminous skirt is an imposing and awe-inspiring figure in spite of her small stature . Sarah Jane 's drabness and austerity are adorned in a stiff silk of wide stripes in red and green , and the brooch which fastens the collar is like a breastplate of defense . Blossy is more a quaint and faded rose than ever . She wears a ball gown of creamy lace , ruffled in billowy flounces up to the tiny bodice which displays her plump and dimpled shoulders . They pay each other pretty compliments as they admire each other 's appearance with pride and gratified vanity  --  but they pay especial tribute to Angie who comes down a trifle late and whose best frock they have never seen before . They turn her round and round to see and admire its soft blue luster . She has made a stiff little bouquet which she holds tightly as she bows and smiles acknowledging their praise with happy tears in her eyes .

RIDGEWAY That 's nice . I 'll give them their tea first . ( Mary runs into the dining room . ) ANGIE Well , girls , has n't Mary given us a lovely tea party ? But you do n't know what a important occasion it is yet . It 's no less a one , than your Brother Abe 's birthday . An ' I know it 's goin ' to be one o ' the very happiest he ever had . Ai n't it Abe ! ( Courtesying low before Abe and presenting the bouquet . ) ABE ( Radiantly rising to the occasion ) How could it be otherwise  --  surrounded as I am by this beevy o ' beauty . BLOSSY It 's the most lovely thing I ever heard of . Abe , I 'm jist going to give you a birthday kiss for that . ( Blossy gives Abe 's cheek a loud smack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sudden chill and shock in the room . ) ABE ( Transported with delight ) Ai n't there any more to foller ? MRS . HOMANS I think a little dignity becomes us. p. 61 SMITH I ai n't so bold-minded as some . ABIGAIL Angie , why did n't you tell us , so a body could give him a remembrance ? ( Trying to restore the gaiety . ) ANGIE As if you was n't all a givin ' him somethin ' every day . I 'm jist watchin ' to see how much he can stand an ' keep his equilibrium . ( Angie and Abigail go into the dining room to help Mary prepare the feast . ) BLOSSY ( Enjoying the jealousy of the others ) I declare , it 's real cheery to look forward to havin ' you here the whole winter through , Abe  --  when we 're snowed in for so long . ABE Well , I 'm goin ' to do my best to make you all happy . ANGIE ( Coming back with a tray holding the teacups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the girls a little . They want to congratulate you too . BLOSSY Of course they do . We must n't monopolize him . Come along , Abe . ( Rising , she takes Abe 's arm and marches him into the dining room . ) ABE ( As he goes out ) I was allus dead set agin the Mormons , but I declare I begin to see a good deal in it . p. 62 SMITH I call that an immoral illusion . ANGIE ( Passing the tea tray ) Law me , Nancy , ca n't you take a joke ? SMITH ( Taking her cup with a sniff ) Not that one . MRS . HOMANS ( Condescending to take her tea ) I blame Blossy rather than Abe . She provoked him to it . SARAH JANE They 's some women allus he s thet effect on a man . ANGIE Oh , do n't hold it up agin Blossy . All men 's got that side to ' em . They ca n't help it . Have some tea , Elizabeth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to git any , is to go out where it is . ( Trotting into the dining room . ) GRANNY Where 's Abe ? MINERVA He 's gone to get some tea . GRANNY Well , I want to go where Abe is . ( She hobbles into the dining room with Harriette ) ANGIE ( Laughing ) Granny 's jist as young as the rest of us . I 'll git your cream an ' sugar . I guess Mary 's kind a flustered with so many . ( Angie goes into the dinning room . Voices and the clinking of china is heard. ) p. 63 SMITH Girls , let me tell you something . Angie 's as blind as a bat . Somebody ought to open her eyes . ( The three women lean towards each other with zest  --  scenting a scandal . ) SARAH JANE It 's gone too far . Blossy 's carryin ' on with Abe right under our noses , as if the rest of us did n't count at all . Gits my dander up . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nancy , I should certainly tell her that Blossy is a dangerous woman , and that a scandal is going on right under this roof . SARAH JANE Go ahead , Nancy . It 's your place to . You 've knowed her the longest . SMITH Well  --  ef you think I ought  --  I will . I ai n't no shirker . The way Blossy hangs on to him an ' owns him is enough to turn my stomach . I never throwed myself at a man in my life . SARAH JANE Nor me nuther . MRS . HOMANS He 'll get tired of her . They always do of women who make advances . ANGIE ( Coming back with the cakes in the silver dish ) You 're jist sweet and good to set here so patient .

( Passing the cakes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Homans ? MRS . HOMANS Never sugar . RIDGEWAY How much sugar , Aunt Nancy ? SMITH ( Her appetite not at all dulled by her anger ) You might give me three teaspoonsful today , seein ' as it 's a party . We do have to scrimp awful on sugar . SARAH JANE I 'll help myself . RIDGEWAY Sit down , Aunt Angie , you 've been waiting on everybody else . How do you take your tea , dear ? ANGIE ( Sitting in the small rocker at C. ) Oh , most any way , jist so it 's tea , an ' hot . I 'm so happy over Abe havin ' such a beautiful birthday , I do n't care whether I have any tea or not . SMITH ( With her mouthful of cake ) This is tasty , I must say . ABIGAIL ( Coming back with her cup of tea and seating herself by the fire with a sigh of content ) Ai n't this lovely , girls ?

ABIGAIL I told you the horn o ' plenty would flow if we took Abe in , an ' it ai n't stopped yit . Grand , ai n't it ? ( There is an ominous silence ) What 's the matter ? What 's took you all ? MRS . HOMANS Nancy has a painful duty to perform . SMITH You 've got such a trustin ' nature , Angie , for all you 're married  --  thet you 've let Blossy pull the wool over your eyes somethin ' terrible . ANGIE Oh ! SARAH JANE She ai n't fooled me . Not for a minute . ABIGAIL What are you talkin ' about ? Speak out , Nancy , for goodness sake . SMITH It 's Blossy  --  the way she 's goin ' on with thet man . ANGIE Oh ! MRS . HOMANS This is indelicate , but it must be done . SARAH JANE Go ahead , Nancy . ABIGAIL What on earth do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see nothin ' , or else you 'd see that Blossy is carryin ' on with Abe like  --  well , like no decent woman ever done . p. 66 ABIGAIL What ? ANGIE Oh , you 've misunderstood her . Dear little Blossy . Why , she 's as innocent as a  --  ( The ladies sniff emphatically ) Yes , she is . Oh , do n't you see she 's jist like a little purrin ' white kitten that ca n't help it . She 's got a lovin ' heart thet will spill over . Why Abe loves everyone o ' you alike . ABIGAIL O ' course he does . ANGIE Like his own sisters . SMITH Well , there ai n't no sister business in this . I 've spoke . I 've done my duty . I kin do no more . ANGIE An ' I ' preciate it , Nancy . I know the noble spirit in which you done it . But I know Abe , too . SMITH Humph ! MRS . HOMANS He 's a MAN . SARAH JANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rushing in ) Aunt Blossy 's going to sing for us . Is n't it lovely ? ( Abe enters with Elizabeth and Minerva on either side of him .

Red flannel makes a nice one . MINERVA You need n't trouble yourself , Elizabeth . I 'm jest like chain lightnin ' with my knittin ' needles . I can turn one off in no time .

The song I 'm goin ' to sing must be sung to a man . MRS . HOMANS There you are ! ABE ( Standing by the piano ) Go ahead . I wo n't budge .

There wo n't be a tree left in the country when they git through . Where 's the old man this day or two ? I ai n't seen ' im a-tall  --  a-tall . JOHN ( Gesticulating to Mike . ) Upstairs , sick . ( Angie comes in from the hall and seeing Mike slips behind the door to listen ) MIKE What ? Sick is it ? I do n't wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' ! It 's a damned shame , it is , fer any man that 's got his two legs to go on , fer to set down here and leave these females take the life out of him . It 's a shame , it is . ( He starts to the hall door  --  Angie steps in front of him . He turns to go the other way but she gets hold of his arm ) ANGIE Mike  --  Mike  --  wait . Go up and see Abe . MIKE ( Appealing to John ) What is it a-tall ? Sure is she gone daft entirely ? ANGIE ( Shouting in Mike 's ear ) You 're right . He needs a man . Will you go up and see him ? MIKE No. p. 80 ANGIE ( To John ) Run up . Shoo them all out and tell them Mike 's comin ' . ( John goes . Angie still clutches Mike ) He 's awful lonely , Mike . MIKE Then fer God 's sake why do n't he git out ? ANGIE Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always drags a man down . ANGIE Was n't there ever a woman you 'd a done this fer , Mike ? MIKE Never . Divil a woman ever got her claws in me . ANGIE Then you 're so strong you 're just what Abe needs . Tell him the house ca n't run without him . Tell him I 'm ailin ' . You understand ? MIKE ( Dragging his cap off his head slowly ) You 're the first I ever see with the brains you could put on your thumb nail . I been dispisin ' ' im  --  and it 's damned sorry I am fer ' im . Think o ' chokin ' down his victuals with thirty of ' em starin ' him in the face three times a day . God o ' mighty ! he done good to last this while . JOHN ( Coming back ) Coast 's clear . Go on , Mike . Go on up . p. 81 ANGIE Help him . Help him , Mike . MIKE It 's the first trip ever I made to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hobbles out and John closes the door laughing ) ANGIE It 's no laughing matter , boy . His heart 's broke an ' I 've got nothin ' to mend it with . JOHN ( Going to her with quick sympathy ) Oh , he 'll be all right , Aunt Angie . ANGIE No he wo n't , boy . It 's gone deep . When are you goin ' away , dear ? JOHN Next week . ANGIE Boston ! Think of it ! That 's an awful big place . I 've never bin there , but I 've seen pictures . The street 's full o ' people you never seen  --  do n't know ' em an ' do n't care . Just no neighbors or friendliness at all . Oh , if I could only speak words that would give you the wisdom to know . But you 're beginnin ' an ' I 'm endin ' . And thet 's what life is , ai n't it , the findin ' out . You 've got to come along the long road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just one . Put by a little as you go  --  if it 's ever so little . Oh , the power that 's in the pennies if they 're only yours ! Keep the rainy day ahead o ' you , and the little house that 's goin ' to be yours  --  safe an ' tight , that no law nor debt kin take away . And when you 're old  --  well  --  Put a little by  --  put a little by . p. 82 JOHN I wish I had enough now to send you back  --  to your little house . ANGIE Thank you , dearie . We 're all right . ( Seeing his cuff ) If you 'd cut your cuffs off when they 're frayed like that it makes ' em look like new . RIDGEWAY ( Coming in quickly from hall ) I ran away . JOHN Oh ! RIDGEWAY Mother 's found out that I see John over here , and she 's forbidden me to ever come again . ANGIE Oh  --  oh ! Did n't she know it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother . RIDGEWAY Yes , I do . ANGIE Not ef you put yourself in her place an ' had a girl o ' your own . No , you would n't . Would she , John ? You do n't want her to be sneakin ' to see you , do you ? JOHN No , I do n't . But what are we going to do ? RIDGEWAY Mother and father are all wrong . Old people have such queer ideas . What does money matter ? It 's John I want  --  p. 83 ANGIE ( Smiling tolerantly at Mary ) Might as well tell the spring to stop bloomin ' . If her father and mother are wrong , John , you must prove it . I 'm goin ' to leave you together jest a minute , but you 'll have to talk fast becus somebody 'll be a comin ' in . I 'll stand outside the door an ' give the warnin ' . ( Going out she closes the door . ) RIDGEWAY I 'm going to tell father what a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it all yourself , and maybe he 'll melt a tiny little bit . He is n't quite so bad as mother . JOHN After I 'm gone your mother will let you come here again , and I 'm going to write to Aunt Angie with letters inside for you . RIDGEWAY Oh , I did n't think of that . JOHN Did n't you ? RIDGEWAY Of course I did  --  but I thought you never were going to . You were so long about it . JOHN You 've got to come once more  --  any way  --  to say good-bye . Will you ? RIDGEWAY How can I ? JOHN Will you ? RIDGEWAY I daren't. p. 84 JOHN Will you ? RIDGEWAY Of course  --  the morning of the day you go . JOHN Monday . And you 'll have to come terribly early . ANGIE ( Opening the door ) Oh  --  oh  --  oh ! He 's bringin ' him down . Mike 's bringin ' Abe down . Oh , ai n't it wonderful ? Oh , ai n't it grand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike wo n't stay if he sees a woman . ( She scuttles them out into the dining room , closing the door behind her as Abe and Mike come in from the hall . Abe is looking very seedy and Mike holds him by the arm . ) MIKE It 's a drop o ' liquor you 're needin ' . The next time I 'm comin ' in I 'll be after bringin ' it . ABE ( With a groan ) Oh , I do n't know as I could swaller it now . ( Starting to the fire . ) MIKE Do n't be makin ' fer the fire . Come away , man . Come away . Set in a man 's chair an ' lean on your own spine  --  not on thim damned things . ( Throwing a cushion out of the chair and putting Abe into the chair . ) ABE ( As he sits ) Go easy ! Go easy ! I ai n't no young gazelle . p. 85 MIKE ( Thumping Abe on the back ) You 're as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it . Keep a goin ' , man , keep a goin ' . ABE I ai n't got no reason to keep goin ' . It 's all been tuk out o ' me . MIKE Huh ? ( Bending down to Abe . ) ABE ( Shouting with an effort ) I ai n't got nothin ' to go fer . MIKE ( Remembering Angie 's words ) Well  --  she says the house ca n't run widout you down here to run it . They need a man a drivin ' ' em . ABE Oh , I 'm sick to death a tryin ' to fool myself with thinkin ' that . MIKE You got a right to git  --  God ! Here they come . ( Nancy hurries in from the hall followed by Mrs. Homans , Sarah Jane and Abigail all carrying the thing they went upstairs with . They file in to Abe chattering . Mike escapes . ) MRS . HOMANS Look at him sitting way off from the fire . You 'll have a chill , man . Come right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms  --  marching him back to the fire  --  putting him into the armchair . Sarah Jane and Nancy draw the chair closer to the fire. ) p. 86 ABIGAIL ( Getting the quilt which is on the sofa ) We 'll jest wrap this ' round his legs  --  case he does take a chill . SMITH ( As Sarah Jane and Abigail wrap the quilt round Abe 's legs ) Ef you 'd a took this catnip tea you 'd a bin well by this time . You jest swaller it down now an ' no di-dos about it . ( Holding the cup to Abe 's lips until he takes it , choking . ) MRS . HOMANS Now just hold this in your lap and keep your hands on it . ( Putting the water jug in Abe 's lap . ) ANGIE ( Coming back from the dining room innocently ) Why , Abe , you down here ? Ai n't thet jest splendid ! SMITH No , ' tai n't . You let thet onery Mike come up an ' hawl him down an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a done it , Angie . MRS . HOMANS Not without consulting me . ABIGAIL It 's kind a dangerous bringin ' him down . ANGIE ( Going to Abe ) How do you feel , now , father ? p. 87 ABE ( Groaning ) Oh , I 'm awful sick , mother . SMITH Of course you are . SARAH JANE Anybody kin see thet . ANGIE Where do you feel bad , dearie ? ABE Oh , all over , mother , all over . ABIGAIL Had n't we better carry him right up again ? ALL Yes , yes . ( They start for him . ) ABE No , siree  --  I 'm here now I 'm goin ' to stay a spell . SARAH JANE A man 's always a mule when he 's ailin ' . ANGIE Would you like to be real quiet awhile , Abe , and set here alone ? ABE Lord , mother , I bin quiet so long I think a good loud noise would cure me . ANGIE I wish I could think o ' somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . MRS . HOMANS Does your head ache , Abe ? ABE Oh , awful bad ! MRS . HOMANS Then it would be better to leave him alone awhile . ( She takes one of the handkerchiefs which she has made from Abe 's pocket and ties it over his eyes. ) p. 88 SARAH JANE ( Pouring some liniment on her red flannel and wrapping it around his throat ) Your throat must be terrible sore  --  or ef it ai n't this will stave it off . It blisters fine . MRS . HOMANS Come along now , all of you , and let him be quiet . He must n't talk . ( She holds the door open and follows Nancy and Sarah Jane out . ) ABIGAIL ( Wiping her eyes and touching Angie 's arm ) It 's awful sad , Angie . ( She tiptoes heavily out of the room , closing the door carefully . Angie drops into a chair , wringing her hands . ) ABE ( Blindfolded and not certain who is in the room ) Mother ! ( Angie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mother , are you there ? She goes to him , putting her hand on his knees . ) Oh , mother , I 'm afraid I 'm goin ' to die . There do n't seem ter be nothin ' else to do . ANGIE That 's jest it . Ef you had somethin ' to do you 'd be all right . Would you like to play a game o ' checkers , father ? ABE Law , child , I know I 'm goin ' ter beat you before we begin . p. 89 ANGIE I know  --  I know . Somethin ' entertainin ' , that 's what you want . But oh , Abe , dear , ' tai n't very likely to happen . Could n't you jest cheer yourself thinkin ' ' bout all the good times you have hed ? ABE Oh ! I wore thet out long ago . ANGIE Could n't you play this house is your boat and that I 'm a furriner you got on board ? A heathern Chinee or somethin ' ? ABE I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathern Chinee . ANGIE Well , there ai n't nothin ' so terrible divertin ' ' bout nothin ' less you help it along some . You kin git awful tired o ' your own nose if you once let yourself go . BLOSSY ( Opening the hall door and fluttering in , followed by her Captain ) Here we are ! We 've come to see you . ANGIE Blossy ! ( Abe pushes the hankerchief up from his eyes and smiles . ) Blossy ! An angel from Heaven could n't be so welcome . ( They are folded in each other 's arms with tender kisses  --  Blossy shakes hands with Abe . ) And Captain Darby , I 'm just as glad to see you . Abe , Abe ! ai n't it wonderful ? It 's a miracle that they are here . ( Abe is speechless with delight as Blossy and the Captain shake hands with him . Blossy is looking very stylish in entirely new furbelows. ) p. 90 DARBY ( Looking curiously at Abe ) What 's the matter with you ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm awful sick . DARBY You do n't look it . BLOSSY ' Tai n't anything ketchin ' , is it ? I would n't a brought Sam'l if  --  ANGIE No  --  no  --  ' tai n't at all . ( Drawing Blossy away ) Jest a little low in his spirits , thet 's all . DARBY Mebbe you got growin ' pains . Thet 's the only thing thet ails me . I 've tuk a new lease on life . ( Turning to exhibit his new suit . ) BLOSSY ( Lowering her voice ) Do n't Sam'l look spruce ? ANGIE He 's made over . I knowed you could do it . BLOSSY I found a way to keep his wig straight and it works just beautiful . ANGIE How ? BLOSSY Put a little glue on the crown of his head . ANGIE ( Laughing ) An ' he 's as brushed an ' tidy as a new pin . An ' you 're a shinin ' like a star . My ! Marriage is wonderful , ai n't it ? p. 91 BLOSSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You an ' Abe has got to come and visit an ' see my house . ANGIE Do you hear that , Abe ? DARBY Oh I kin recommend her strong as a wife , an ' so fer I ai n't heard no complaints o ' my own conduct . ABE You kin thank me fer her , Sam'l . I done it . She tuk my advice . ANGIE ( Speaking low to Blossy ) Let 's leave ' em together . He looks brighter a'ready . It 's a man he needed . The girls will be awful jealous ef I keep Blossy down here any longer , Abe . ( Taking Blossy to the door . ) BLOSSY You do n't mind ef I leave you a little while , do you , Sam'l ? I must see the girls . DARBY Run along  --  run along . We kin spare you . ANGIE You take keer o ' Abe , Cap'n . He 's been needin ' somethin ' spicy like you the worst way . ( She goes out with Blossy . ) DARBY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headache ? ABE No  --  I du n no as I hev . p. 92 DARBY Well , you will hev with thet rag tied round . Take it off , man , take it off . You look like you was lashed to the mast . ( Darby throws the handkerchief to the floor . ) ABE Thet 's jest what I feel like , an ' lashed good an ' tight . DARBY You ai n't sick . ABE Well , I du n no . I 'm sweatin ' awful hard . Thet 's a bad sign . DARBY Why would n't you sweat , bundled up like a papoose ? Peel ' em off . Peel ' em off . ( Pulling the quilt he throws it into the middle of the room . ) An ' hitch thet red rag off your neck . You ai n't flaggin ' no train . Lord , what 's thet ? A hot jug ? Sweat ? I should a thought you 'd a flowed away by this time . ( Putting the jug on a chair ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Who 's been rollin ' you up like this ? ABE The gals done it . DARBY Hev you come to that ! ( Laughing in loud derision ) Well , I never thought I 'd see the day that Abe Rose 'd let women make a molly-coddle of ' im . ABE You try livin ' with thirty of ' em an ' see if  --  p. 93 MIKE ( Looking in from the hall ) Whist ! ( He comes in cautiously  --  nods to Darby and takes from under his coat a flask with a little whiskey in it ) It 's the last drop , and a small one  --  but better'n nothin ' . ABE You think I better , Sam'l ? DARBY What ? Git it down , man  --  git it down . ( Abe drains the flask , smacking his lips . ) MIKE That 'll put blood instead o ' water in his veins . It 's a pity we ai n't got a pep-mint drop fer ' im , so 's the ladies wo n't smell it on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Remembering to shout to Mike ) Do ' em good . It would do the old gals good to hev a drop themselves . ( The three chuckle at Darby 's joke . ) I 'd like to see ' em steppin ' high . Git up , Abe , an ' shake it down . Shake it down . ( Abe rises and shakes his legs with deep satisfaction . ) There ai n't nothin ' the matter with you . MIKE ( With great pride in his cure ) That done the trick . A drop o ' good liquor will do more fer a man 's legs than all the doctors goin ' . p. 94 DARBY Certainly  --  certainly . ( Giving Abe a resounding slap on the back ) You 're as good as ever now . MIKE ( Digging Abe in the ribs from the other side ) What did I tell you ! Where 's your tobaccy ? ( Abe motions to mantel . ) DARBY That 's what . ( Mike gets Abe 's pipe and tobacco jar from the mantel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain . ) No , thank you . I 'll stick to my own . ( He takes out pipe and pouch . The three men draw long breaths of comfort . A long pause as they smoke . ) ABE A man gets awful low in his mind at times . Much obleeged , Mike . ( Shouting ) Much obleeged . MIKE Well , I 'll be goin before the old hens gits in this time . ( He hobbles out through the hall . ) ABE Mike 's in a lowly station , but he 's a man and I treat ' im like a equal . DARBY What you need is a good spree , Abe . ABE Lord ! It 's poor pickin ' fer spreein ' round here . p. 95 DARBY Thet 's what I say . You must git out an ' git at it . You heard Blossy talkin ' ' bout a visit to us . We 'll jest carry thet out . We 'll send the two women on hum an ' you an ' me 'll take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hev a look at it fer old time 's sake . ABE Could such a thing be done ? DARBY Certainly it could . Why could n't it ? Ai n't you got legs to git on to the railroad thet 'll carry you ! The same old life savin ' station 's still there  --  same old ocean poundin ' away  --  an ' plenty o ' the boys thet will remember you . Done ? We wo n't lose no time . Look a here . So 's to avoid any arguin ' or the women puttin ' a spoke in the wheel , we 'll jest go on ahead now an ' catch the noon train over . We kin do it slick . ABE Lord ! Lord ! It sounds good . But could we ? DARBY Could we ? Ai n't you got no liver left ? What 's the matter with you ? You talk like you got one foot in the grave . Look a here . Git a pen an ' write . Is they one ? ( Abe goes to bookrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  opens it  --  sits , takes paper and envelope and pen . ) Jest give orders for Angie to pack up your duds an ' come with Blossy this evenin ' to our house an ' thet we 're a goin ' to the life savin ' station to stay over night an ' wo n't be hum till tomorrer . The boys 'll give us a welcome an ' a mess o ' chowder thet 'll warm your gizzard . Come along , git at it . p. 96 ABE I ai n't stayed away from Angie a night sence I give up my boat , but she 's a awful sensible woman  --  she knows a man likes to git away once in a while . DARBY Well , I 'm a beginnin ' early with Blossy . It 'll do ' er good . She 'll ' preciate me all the more when I git back . ( Abe is scratching away laboriously with the pen . ) Make it short an ' let 's git out before they  --  Where 's your hat ? We kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shet it up an ' lick it . ABE ( Obeying instructions ) I 'll jest put " Angie " on it an ' put it right here in plain sight . I tell you , Sam'l , women 's all right in their own way but when it comes to nothin ' but women night an ' day , it 's kind a belittlin ' . It do n't keep a man up to the times like . Kind a takes away his ambition an '  --  an '  --  ( Going after his hat . ) DARBY An ' makes a mother 's boy o ' him . ABE Lord , Sam'l , once I git fer enough down the road I 'm a goin ' to let out a yell thet 'll raise the dead . Gol durn it , I 'm goin ' to raise hell  --  thet 's what I 'm a goin ' ter do . DARBY You 'll be made over when you git away . p. 97 ABE ( His spirits falling again ) Yes , but I hev to come back  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARBY All the more reason why you ought ter git off now . ABE You go on an ' I 'll meet you outside  --  down by the gate . I jest want to add a word to Angie . DARBY All right , old man , but you hurry up . ( Darby goes out and Abe goes back to the table  --  opening his letter he adds a postscript . Sealing the letter again he starts to the door  --  but hesitates , looks back at the letter , tempted to open it once more . There is a struggle of indecision and his rugged old face shows a tragic grief as he decides not to open the letter . He looks about the room saying good-bye to it and goes out brokenly but with determination . The slam of a door is heard . A moment of silence and Angie comes back into the room  --  swiftly and anxiously . ) ANGIE I heard the front door shut . Bless my soul  --  Sam'l 's got Abe to go out fer a little walk . Ai n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Look a here , Blossy , he 's shook his quilt an ' jug an ' jest got up an ' walked . Sam'l done it . He needed a man . That 's all he needed . Poor old Abe , my heart aches fer ' im. p. 98 BLOSSY Heavens to Betsy ! How it smells in here . Nasty old pipes . I do hate ' em so . I make Sam'l smoke in the barn . ANGIE ( Folding the quilt ) I would n't care ef Abe set the house afire . I 'm so glad to hev him smoke again . Set down , Blossy , it 's awful nice to hev you back . I 'll pull the sofie out so he kin lay on it facin ' the fire when he comes back . RIDGEWAY Well , I must go . Good-bye , Aunt Blossy . I 'm so glad to see you . BLOSSY Good-bye , honey love . ANGIE Good-bye , baby .  --  Ef you see Uncle Abey out there , tell him not to stay too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . ) Is this yours , Mary ? Why , it looks like Abe 's handwriting . ( She reads the letter . ) RIDGEWAY ( After a pause ) What is it , Aunt Angie ? BLOSSY What ails you ? ANGIE ( Speaking with great difficulty ) It 's all right . Jest a note from Abe . Him an ' the Cap'n 's goin ' over to the life savin ' station tonight and is goin ' to your house tomorrer an ' expects you an ' me to meet them there . p. 99 BLOSSY Well , I never . Ai n't they gettin ' gay ? But do n't you mind , Angie . I tell you I ai n't goin ' back to that house tonight . You and me 'll jest stay here till they come fer us . I 'm going to tell Abigail I 'm going to stay all night . ( Blossy goes out . Angie sits rigidly  --  Mary shuts the door and goes to her quickly . ) RIDGEWAY What is it , Aunt Angie ? Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says at the end he ai n't comin ' back , he ca n't stand it . Oh , Mary , where 's he goin ' ? What 's he goin ' to do ? RIDGEWAY He 's got to come back  --  we 'll find him . ANGIE No , I ai n't goin ' to drag him back . Oh , Abe , I could tramp the roads with you . We 've got nothin ' left but love . Do n't yer know it 's the only thing worth savin ' ? It 's all there is . It 's all there is . ( She falls helplessly against Mary and gives up to her grief in deep dry sobs. ) p. 100 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT III SCENE II Scene : The sitting room . Time : Two days later . Five o'clock in the morning . A heavy storm is raging with wind , rain , thunder and lightning . At Curtain : Angie is seated at the window at back with a lighted candle on the sill . She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , staring out into the darkness . ABIGAIL ( Coming in from the hall ) Law , honey ! You give me a turn . I thought I seen a spook fer sure . What you doin ' down here ? Are you skeered of the storm ? ( She puts her lighted candle on the piano and draws her wrapper together over her nightgown . ) Awful bad , ai n't it ? I ai n't seen a storm like this sence the year Jim broke his collar bone . I 'm afraid the north chimbly 's blowed over . ANGIE It would be awful for a body to be out in this . ABIGAIL Now , Angie , you know as well as you 're settin ' there he 's made hisself comf'table somewheres . ANGIE No , I do n't , and I 'm awful worried about that letter thet came for Abe last night . We have n't hed a letter fer three years . p. 101 ABIGAIL Now , you git to bed an ' I 'll git you a cup o ' tea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her candle . ) BLOSSY ( Running in in her nightgown ) Why did n't you tell a body you were comin ' down , Abigail ? I 've spent the whole night pokin ' my head under the clothes to keep from seein ' the roof blow off , and pokin ' it out again to see if it had . If Sam'l ever goes away from home again he need n't come back at all . I 'll jest come here to live . ABIGAIL Do n't be a simpleton , Blossy . BLOSSY Do n't it make you mad , Angie , every time you think of them strollin ' off ? Are you ever goin ' to forgive Abe ? ANGIE The only thing I 'm afraid of , is thet he 'll come back too soon an ' not git his visit out . I want him to stay long enough to hev a real good change . ( The outer door is heard  --  opened and slammed . ) He 's come ! He 's come ! Abe , Abe ! Here I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in , Abe . ( Samuel Darby enters wet and sheepish , generally disheveled , his wig over one ear in the old way . ) Where 's Abe ? DARBY Ai n't he here ? p. 102 ANGIE No . DARBY Then I do n't know . He give me the slip . ANGIE When ? Where ? ABIGAIL AND BLOSSY How ? Where 'd he go ? DARBY He give me the slip yisterday when we was takin ' the train . I went on home , Blossy , an ' expected to find you there . BLOSSY ( With icy dignity ) You did ? ( Angie goes to the sofa  --  she sits with her hands tightly clasped . ) DARBY An ' when you did n't come , I took the mornin ' train over here . BLOSSY Sam'l Darby , you 're a sight , after three months of my workin ' to tidy you up . You march right upstairs . DARBY All right , Blossy , jest as you say . ( Blossy goes up the stairs . ) ANGIE Sam'l  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? DARBY ( In the doorway ) Nary a word  --  jest disappeared . ( He follows Blossy . ) ABIGAIL ( Closing the hall door ) Tomfool folks ! Now , Angie , do n't listen to a word they 've said  --  p. 103 ANGIE ( Rising and beginning to walk nervously ) Oh , I 've thought of all they 've said an ' a million things more . I 've seen him dead an ' everything else . ABIGAIL No  --  no  --  he ai n't . ANGIE I 've got to find him  --  no matter what . I 'll go an ' pack his old bag with some clean things an ' go to the poor farm an ' wait . ABIGAIL Ef that 'll give you peace o ' mind , I 'll hev Mike hitch up Dobbin ' an ' drive you over . ( Abigail goes out through the dining room . Angie starts to the hall door as John opens it . ) ANGIE ( Clinging to him ) John , have you found him ? JOHN No . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and again this morning . I 've asked everywhere in town and everybody I met on the road . ANGIE Has n't he been there at all ? JOHN Not yet . ANGIE Then I 'm goin ' there to wait fer him . RIDGEWAY ( Coming from the hall ) What 's the matter ? Have you found Uncle Abe ? p. 104 ANGIE Not yet . I 'm goin ' to find him myself . ( Rushing by Mary and going up the stairs . ) RIDGEWAY Poor Aunt Angie ! When do you have to leave , John ? JOHN I 'm not going today . RIDGEWAY What ? JOHN I ca n't have the place . A letter came last night . The man 's own son is going to take it . RIDGEWAY Oh no ! He promised you . JOHN I been thinking hard all night  --  since that letter came , and it 's made things look different  --  like they really are . RIDGEWAY What do you mean ? JOHN I 'm going to take you home and tell your father I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day he wo n't mind letting me have you . And tomorrow I 'm going to Boston anyway and stay as long as my money lasts , and if I have n't got something by that time , I 'll come back here and peg away and save some more and go again and keep on doing it till I get what I want , and , Jerusalem , I 'm going to have it . RIDGEWAY ( Throwing her arms around John ) John , I never loved you so much before . But father wo n't listen . p. 105 JOHN He 's got to . RIDGEWAY He wo n't . JOHN I 'm going home with you and tell him this morning . RIDGEWAY No , you must n't . Yes , you must . But do n't come with me now . Old Peter brought me over in the carry-all and I have to get back before anybody is awake . JOHN Then I 'll come pretty soon . RIDGEWAY Yes . I 'll go and help Aunt Angie . I 'm selfish to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh dear  --  I do n't know what Father will do to you  --  but come , wo n't you ? JOHN Of course . ( They kiss each other with a long embrace . Mary goes . John blows out the light  --  raises the window shades  --  makes up the fire and goes out through the dining-room . After a moment Abe peers through one of the windows and comes in from the hall . He is wet and disheveled and miserable and walks with great difficulty because of a stiff back . Going to the fire he takes off his shoes and coat and manages to lie down on the sofa drawing the quilt over his full length and covering his head . With a long sigh he goes to sleep .
