Speaker Clark , facing the prospect of a Congress that will have to work hard to go home early next March , vents the irritation that preceding sessions have bred by offering some radical suggestions . No one but a Speaker could so summarily throw out proposals for reducing the membership to 300 , clearing the galleries , and cutting down the Congressional Record to the merest journal that shall conform to Constitutional demands . None but a Speaker  --  who can not speak  --  knows what it is to listen to hours of oratory addressed to distant constituents alone . None knows so well what it is to face the confusion of 435 members in general manifesting indifference to the national business . The House galleries contain 2,500 people , and on occasion may afford no little vexation to a presiding officer . Even if it were possible to overlook the difficulties before real debate , and to regard the House as a panel for the selection of committees and a body chiefly interested In voting , the inefficient conduct of balloting and roll-call is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines to concentrate chief attention . He knows his other plans are impracticable , but he has hope of voting-machines . ' There ought to be the strongest possible protest by the press of the country against the censorship declared by the navy in Santo Domingo . Last week there was set up in that island an American military dictatorship headed by Capt . Harry S. Knapp  --  as mix-American a procedure as one could well Imagine . Right on top of that comes the news that the whole island is to be shrouded in a veil of silence , to be lifted only as the naval officers see fit . Now , with all possible respect for the fidelity to duty of our navy men , there recurs to us that saying of Abraham Lincoln 's to the effect that no man is good enough to govern others without their consent . If it is now absolutely necessary for us temporarily to govern Santo Domingo , let us do it in the open , so that the whole world , and particularly the Pan-American world , may judge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a state of war with Santo Domingo , so that it is inconceivable that any criticism of what the navy is doing could harm those in occupation . But even if it did , there is not a single sound reason why the press of this country should not have the freest knowledge of what is going on in that unhappy island . Every one can recall what took place in certain portions of the Philippines behind the censorship . We confess that to our minds things have gone from bad to worse in Santo Domingo since our intervention . First we were merely to administer the customs houses . Then we stepped in to enforce peace and were assured that all went well . Next we take over the whole island , and this not even by civilians . Is it not a profound cause for uneasiness to read that Capt . Knapp is going to respect only those laws which do not " conflict with the object of the occupation " ? But who is to be the judge of this ? Capt . Knapp or Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the censorship continues , and the American public will have no basis for any opinion whatever . As for Mr. Wilson , it is safe to say that he knows nothing of what is going on . When it is brought to his attention and he realizes how completely this high-handed procedure in Santo Domingo gives the lie to all his assertions as to what we should do in Mexico , we believe he will act , and act quickly . Congress , too , ought to investigate the whole situation and find out why all these years of benevolent supervision and interference in Santo Domingo have resulted only in the complete collapse of the Government there . Now is the time for Carranza 's Government to make good its long-delayed promise of an active campaign against the Villistas . The operations of the de-facto generals should not stop with the reoccupation of Chihuahua . They are in a more favorable position to conduct a pursuit of the Villista bands than they have been since Pershing 's entry into Mexico . Gen. Murguia 's advance upon Chihuahua after his decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift and energetic as to indicate that Carranza has found a much more capable leader than the slothful Trevino . With Murguia coming up from the south , Gonzalez moving down from Juarez , and our own forces in northern Chihuahua to be counted upon , the round-up of the Villista raiders , if seriously undertaken , ought to bring permanent results . In Gen. Bell 's reports the statement is explicitly made that no one as yet has succeeded in identifying the form ! dable Poncho as among those present in the fighting at Chihuahua . It is still possible that Villa is dead and that minor leaders have capitalized his reputation for a final effort which , in spite of its temporary success at Chihuahua , only shows that they are incapable of offering permanent and organized resistance to the de-facto Government . It is a campaign of banditry and loot that Carranza must deal with ; a species of warfare that calls less for large armies than for resolute action . Mr. Roosevelt 's disappointment with the outcome of the election is keen but not overwhelming . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brief r  --  sum ? the more cheerful he gets to be . In the beginning he is inclined to think that the trouble is with the nation 's moral fibre . Later it occurs to him that we are not really wicked , but only asleep . Towards the end it turns out that we are not asleep at all , but , on the contrary , very wide awake . So awake were we that the ordinary preelection gold brick of the professional politician utterly failed to deceive . In developing this argument Mr. Roosevelt makes confession of his own errors , in very subtle form , to be sure , but still a confession : When public men are readily pardoned for making any promise which they think will secure public favor before election , and for repudiating any promise which they think it inconvenient to keep after election , it is impossible to expect that the voters will not finally grow skeptical about all promises , prophecies , and statements made during the course of a campaign . Now , this at first sight would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically it can not be . It would be absurd to argue that the people , disgusted with Mr. Wilson 's violated pledges , showed their resentment by reelecting him . The reference is really to Mr. Roosevelt himself . The people , wide awake to the emptiness of predlection pledges and conversions , refused to vote for Roosevelt , the ally of Perkins and Penrose , and voted for the real Roosevelt as embodied in the ideas which Mr. Wilson stole . Thus while the outcome of the election is to Mr. Roosevelt a sorrow , yet it is a sweet sorrow . A movement to reorganize the Progressive party was revealed last Friday by the publication of a circular letter , It calls for a gathering of Progressives in various States , with the possibility of a national meeting in St. Louis , in a month or two , to draw up " new articles of faith . " The letter argues that the one thing clearly " shown " by the Presidential election was the burning desire of the people that the Progressive party should continue to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Anyhow , a body of brave resurrectionists are going to do their best to remove the Progressive corpse from the tomb in which Roosevelt tenderly laid . it . Is the Colonel himself to be asked to join the revivified Progressives ? Well , it is vaguely explained that he will be more interested for a time in the Fiji Islanders . But the astounding thing is the frank statement that Mr. George W. Perkins will not even be invited to meet with his former fellow-Progressives . They state brutally that they want neither him nor his check-book . But the reorganization of a wrecked party and Perkins not in it ? Incredible ! Our Government 's first official action in regard to the German enslavement of Belgian workingmen was limited to the transmittal of a protest in the name of Belgium . Now , it is stated , the Washington Administration Is acting direct . It will inform the German Government that the Belgian deportations are making a very bad impression in this country . ' This is to put it mildly . A stronger representation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be also by mass meetings to voice indignation , such as the one which , we are glad to see , is soon to be held in New York . German authorities have defiantly said that the lawless and cruel process in Belgium will go on , " no matter what the outside world may think . " The only thing to be considered is the " security " of Germany . This sort of repellent egoism is , as M. Gabriel Hanotaux has been pointing out , the constant feature in all of the official talk of peace in Germany . Chancellor and press continually prate of the " guarantees " which Germany must have ; what other nations are to do or suffer does not matter . But it is impossible to persist in such an attitude . Germany can not forever affect to have no regard for the opinion of mankind . And her responsible rulers , as they see the moral judgment of the world shaping itself so sollemnly against them , will in time cry out : " Our punishment is greater than we can bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet " crisis " was not so serious an affair as at first reported . It appears now to be only one more in the list of crises which Mr. Asquith has successfully got over . There will probably be a few readjustments . It is understood that the War Council within the Cabinet will be made over  --  authority to make swift decisions being placed in the hands of a smaller number of men than at present . The aim of the whole , and of whatever new Cabinet arrangements are made , was declared by the Prime Minister to be the most vigorous prosecution of the war . This has already drawn the fangs of the critics . The Coalition Government has not been popular . One never is in England , according to the historic tradition . But the certain thing about the Coalition Government of to-day is that it can not be upset against its will . Its assured majority in the House of Commons is immense . And as the life of the present Parliament has been extended  --  and probably will be extended until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting at the Ministry through a general election . If the Cabinet were disposed to show a cavalier disregard for adverse public opinion , it is so powerfully intrenched that it could do so . Moreover , a good and desired alternative to the existing Ministry is not to be found in England . The first-class men of both parties are already in it . Doubtless a few public men of talent and energy can be pointed to outside , but they are neither numerous enough nor weigh enough to be thought of as capable of making an acceptable Cabinet by themselves . Indeed , all the talk has been , not of expelling the Cabinet , but of re-making it . The old cards were to remain ; they were merely to be re-shuffied . By this process , the more the Cabinet is changed the more it remains the same thing . With all these political certainties and impossibilities clearly before the British people , how are we to account for the attacks upon the Cabinet ? That they have had some force is established by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . It is plain that , quite apart from partisan motives or journalistic ambitions , there must be a good deal of dissatisfaction with the Government in England . It arises out of the war . There is a general feeling that not sufficient foresight and energy and rapidity of action have been displayed . The British do not expect their rulers to exhibit the autocratic efficiency of a militarized German Government , but they do look for fewer delays in deciding important matters , for a more concentrated intensity in the counsels of the nation , and for a fuller and wiser exertion of the naval and military power of the Empire . The dashing of the hopes centred on Rumania 's entering into the war must have made a deep and unhappy impression in England . And the renewal of submarine devastation can not fail to have fostered discontent with the Government . Professional alarmists like Admiral Beresford and S. L. Garvin and the cheap newspapers exaggerate the facts , of course ; but they must be speaking for many who are disquieted . This sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but everything will come back , in the end , to the outlook of the war . That this is not rosy for the Allies just at present is the main reason why we are having the flurry in the British Cabinet . While Vice-Admiral Beatty seems extraordinarily young to have the entire responsibility of the naval defence of Great Britain placed upon his shoulders at forty-five , as a matter of fact the distinguished English admirals of history have usually assumed their highest functions at a comparatively early age . Nelson was but forty-seven in the hour of his victory at Trafalgar , while Hawke was forty-two when he defeated the French at Belle-Isle ; twelve years later he won his second great victory at Quiberon . Hood became commander-in-chief on the American coast at forty-three , and Drake began his long career of freebooting at the age of thirty-two . Yet the rule has not always held , Rodney winning his great victory off Cape St. Vincent at sixty-two , while Sir John Hawkins played a valiant part in the defeat of the Spanish Armada at fifty-six . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily debar them from displaying the highest qualities . Thus , Farragut was sixty-one when he took New Orleans , and Porter fifty-one when he took Fort Fish- , er . Dewey defeated the Spaniards in his sixty-first year , and Sampson commanded the fleet off Cuba at fifty-eight . Jellicoe himself , whom Vice-Admiral Beatty has now relieved , is fifty-seven years old . On the land side of this war it has been a battling of comparatively old men , notably on the Ger , , man side , many of the leading generals being well beyond the age-retirement limit of the United States army . But Sir Douglas Haig , commanding the British army in France , is in his fifty-sixth year . Constantinople and the Dardanelles have been guaranteed to Russia by the Allies " in the most definite manner . " An arrangement that has been assumed from the beginning of the war , that has been more than hinted at by Sir ? Edward Grey , that was announce &; with greater certainty by Professor Milyukoff , leader of the Liberal majority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Premier . The stated reason for making announcement at the present moment is that Russians may know " for what cause they are shedding their blood . " In other words , it is an exhortation to increased energy and greater sacrifices at a moment when Rumania has cast a bleak aspect over the Allied cause . But Premier Trepoff 's words are addressed not only to the Russian people , but to Germany and Russia 's own allies . It is explicit notification that all possibility of a separate peace with Germany is dead . By appealing to the ancient Russian sentiment that clusters about Byzantium , . Premier Trepoff would give notice that the pro-German intrigues of the Stiirmer Cabinet are at an end . To Berlin 's announcement of a restablished Polish kingdom , the Russian Government retorts , not merely that it is determined to keep Poland out of Teutonic hands , but that it still holds fast to the proudest purpose of Russian policy  --  the acquisition of Constantinople . Far from considering herself beaten , Russia sees no reason why she should yield anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good fortune that always comes to the help of the Allies whenever the Allies are engaged in a regrettable bit of war business . This good fortune inevitably takes the form of the appearance of Germany on the scene . Germany is the dens as machino upon whom the Allies can count whenever they are in. a moral fix . There are obvious distinctions between Allied coercion in Greece and Germany 's course in Belgium . But the fact that the Allies came into Greece by invitation of Venizelos , and are now backed by that leader and a majority of the Greek nation , need not be rehearsed . When all apologies for Allied policy in Greece are made it Is still true that the situation brings a bitter taste into the mouth . Left to itself , the conscience of the world might ultimately revolt against the high-handed treatment of Greece by the Allies . But neutral conscience is not left to itself . At the right moment Germany steps in and by protesting solemnly against the Allied violation of international law in Greece , wins public approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the fearful handicap which the German Government has imposed on itself and the worst degradation it has inflicted on the German people : that no violation of law and humanity is henceforth conceivable which the conscience of the world will not palliate by the thought of Germany in Belgium . Fresh evidence that one of the prices Georgia is paying for the exploits of her mobs is an alarming emigration of negroes East and North , appears in the Atlanta Con- ' stitution , ' s report of a concerted movement to check it for industrial reasons . The heaviest migration , runs a dispatch to the Constitution , has been from those counties in which there have been the worst out-breaks : It is developed by investigation that where there have been lynchings the negroes have been most eager to believe what the emigration agents have told them of plots for the removal or extermination of the race . Com , . paratively few negroes have left Dougherty County , which is considered significant , in. view of the fact that this is one of the counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . Georgia 's Legislature has several times moved against emigration agents , and put heavy license taxes upon them , but such work in checking their activities is destroyed when the negroes are driven into their very arms . The State is losing much of its best labor , while the negro is thrown from the home environment that ought to be best for him . It is not strange that the Constitution declares that " mob activity has . . . grown from bad to worse until it has become not only , a social and moral , but a serious business problem . It is imperative that we get back to a basis of law and order , not half-heartedly , not half-way , but wholly and determinedly . " According to press reports , the Rev. Dr. Joseph H. McMahon , in a lecture on " Catholics in Public Life ; Their Responsibilities and Failures , " is going out of his way to ' characterize Joseph P. Tumulty , President Wilson 's secretary , and Mayor Mitchel as Catholics who have betrayed their church , Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who proclaimed himself a co-religionist and an exponent of the church betrayed it . " This lecture is being delivered before associations of a kind to make it appear that the highest dignitaries of the church are not displeased by Dr. McMahon 's activities . Now , we have free speech in this country on religious as well as other subjects . But the public surely has a right to protest against + judging public men from the point ? of view of their relationship to a given church . If Catholics take such a position , their church must expect to encounter a good deal of severe criticism and rouse intense feeling . Dr. McMahon may criticise the public judgments and acts of Messrs . Tumults , and Mitchel as much as he pleases , but to base that criticism on the ground of disloyalty to their church is a different matter ; it is bad for that church and is a very poor brand of Americanism . No discussion of the " movies " as the art of the future can be complete without taking cognizance of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in - the evening and only five cents at other times . The reason , of course , is the child . To busy mothers in crowded city sections Charlie Chaplin has come in the role of governess and traffic policeman . For the price of a nickel the nine-year-old Is kept off the streets for an hour or two in the afternoon ; and the afternoon audiences in poor or moderately comfortable neighborhoods are made up largely of little ones unattended . From this situation have arisen all sorts of evils with which child-welfare agencies are now contending . But it is the comparatively rare mother who stops to weigh such dangers against the usefulness of the " nickelodeon " in the way of taking the child off her hands , giving him amusement , and , most of . all , keeping him out of the danger of street traffic . The small coin which formerly was devoted to candy to keep the child happy and give the mother freedom for her work , now goes to contribute to the support of an industry which ranks in importance with steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience in the movie business is recognized , it becomes plain that the art of the movies must in large measure be shaped by that factor . The public , to which must be given what it Wants , is now drawn from the primary school ages with a fair sprinkling of kindergarten upper-classmen . Obviously , the scenario writers are now busy upon an art that ' is democratic with a vengeance . They must cater to an appeal infinitely broader than the playwright must keep in mind when he sets out to please at the same time Broadway and Kankakee . He solves the problem by going in for the elemental emotions which are the same on both sides of the Hudson , by appealing , as the phrase goes , to the child that is in all of us . The movie writer must go - further . He must appeal to the infant that is in all of us . That the trick can be done is attested by the present state of the new art . It is all very simple .
