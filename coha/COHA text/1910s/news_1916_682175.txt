txt With the arrival today of the vanguard of the Progressive National Committee this city , awoke to the fact that this Is a Presidential year , and that from now on and until the holding of the Republican and Progressive National Conventions next June polities will hold the Centre of the stage with the European war . For the first time since 1912 , the name of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt as a Presidential possibility became the absorbing topic of conversation . The fact that his Secretary , John , is here with a large delegation of New York Progressives , to take an active part in tomorrow 's deliberations of the National Committee ; is regarded as extremely significant and as relegating to the background the Colonel 's insistence that he is in no sense a candidate for the nomination . Notwithstanding ** Progressive who cm/fie ' to town today insisted  --  and-voeiferouslY at that  --  that Coronet Roosevelt was ' the Only logical candidate , not alone of the Progressives , but also of the Republicans , and that unless the ' Republicans nominited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party leaders have made reservations for 800 hotel rooms and have options on the Agditorium Theatre , Orchestra Hall , and t i Florentine room in the Congress Hotel for the week of Jima 7 . This was disclosed today in connection with the plan to hold the party 's National Convention simultaneously with the Republican Convention . The Progressive National Committee will fix the date definitely and authorize the closing of . the options at its/meeting tomorrow at the Congress Hotel . It is considered probable that the Progressive Convention will be held at the Auditorium Theatre . The Florentine Room will be used for auxiliary meetings .. - Orchestra Hall probably will not be needed if the . Auditorium Theatre is selected for the convention . One hundred and fifty Progressives iron all parts of the country will be present at the committee meeting and conference tomorrow . Most of them arrived yesterday . The Twentieth Century Limited this morning looked like a Progressive special , being crowded with the delegates from New York and other Easter States . ' The New York delegation was headed by George W. Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jahn private secretary to Cdlonel Roosevelt . It was announced that Mr. would act as Secretary of the committee meeting . ' Perking is Noncommittal . ' Mr. Perkins was conservative in his statements , refusing to express any opinion as to the time of the Progressive National Convention , the place- or its action regarding the indorsement of any possible candidate of any . other party . " Would it be possible , " Mr. Perkins . ' was asked , " for the Republicans to nominate any man who is acceptable to . the Progressive Party ? " " That is only another way of asking if the Progressives will have a ticket in the field , " he countered . " T have already said many a time that the Progressives will have a ticket . " " Will the Progressives have their convention here at the same time as the Republican Convention ? " he was asked . " That will be decided tomorrow , at , the meeting of the National Committee . That Is what we are here for . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of sentiment among the National Committeemen against holding the convention here ' when the Republicans- meet , the objectors believing that , such action would link the party up ao closely with the Republicans . At ' the same time , Mr. Perkins . admitted that , if it was decided to hold the convention here at that time , the delegates would ' not be found without hotel facilities . " Naturally , some of our members ' have taken options on hotel rooms , " he said , " and it is more than likely that the Florentine Room of the Congress 1 Hotel is One of those on which we have options . " The Florentine Room is familiar as the headmiarters of Colonel Roosevelt in past conventions . Do you bring a message from Colonel Roosevelt lo the National Committee ? " Mr. Perkins was asked . " No , T do not , " he replied . No Message from the Colonel . Mr. was then appealed to with the same question . .. " Colonel ? Roosevelt merely- sent his friendly regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no formal or written message . " Asked ' what brought him to the meeting . said he came out just to look over the situation and report to his chief . " The Colonel is at Oyster Bay , " he said , " and plans to stay there for some time . He will leave for the West Indies Feb. to be gone for six weeks . He is going because of Mrs. Roosevelt 's health . You ' know she underwent an operation some time ago , , and it is thought she will recuperate faster if she is taken to the warmer climate . " Mr. said that whether Colonel Roosevelt came to the Chicago Convention would depend upon the circumstances at the time . However . " Roosevelt for President " was the slogan of nearly all the Prominent Progressives . On all Sides was heard the statement that the Republicans could best insure the return of the Progressives to the fold , as well as the defeat of President Wilson , through the nomination of Colonel Roosevelt . The Progressive Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go so far as to announce that the Progressives will support-the Republican nominee and platform in case both are satisfactory , but it will at least be possible to read this between the lines . While G. W. Perkins declared emphatically that the Progressives would have a ticket in the field , the statement was construed as meaning that the Progressives would indorse a ticket , either that of the Republicans or one of their own ( ' olonel Cecil Lyon of Texas . who has been a familiar figure at many Republican conventions and whn followed Colonel Roosevett Into the Progressive Party , was emphatic in the assertion that the Republicans must nominate Colonel Roosevelt . Much Discussion of Hughes . " How about ** he was asked . " Well , for my part . Hughes would n't , satisfyme . Ile has been out of politics for a long time , and we do not know how he stands on many matters . And . besides that , 1 do n't believe the Republicans will nominate him , or , that he would accept the nomination if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered him he would reject it . perhaps in sonic spectacular manner , so as to set a precedent , that once for all , would take the Supreme Court of the United States out of polities. - General C. D. Elliott of West Virginia here took issue with Colonel Lyon , saying that Hughes might be acceptable to many of the Progressives , though he did I not believe he would be nominated . William Flinn or Pittsburgh , one of the most active Rull Moosers of 1912 . I also insisted that the Republicans must nominate Roosevelt if they desired to win the election , but in discussing candidates other than Colonel Roosevelt who might be acceptable to the Progressives , he mentioned Governor S. W. MeCall of Massachusetts . The mane of Justice Charles E. Hughes was heard frequently in conversations with various Progressives as one who would he supported by the Progressives if nominated in the Republican Convention . Senator A. R. Cummins of Iowa was another whose name was mentioned favorably . Mr. Perkins was the host at a banmet given , to 125 Progressives tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York were the speakers , " A lelight to the Last Trench . " In the course of his after-dinner address Mr. Perkins said : " Finding , as we do , at this hour of crisis in the affair of the world , the so-called leaders of the Democratic and Republican Pdrties utterly unable to rise to the occasion , it behooves us to deliberate earnestly . unselfishly , patriotically , and by our action tomorrow show the people Of this country that we are thinking of the needs of the people . The course we tam must be constructive , not destructive . And when we announce the result of our deliberations. whatever it may be , we must announce it In no Uncertain manner , and after we have announced it we must be prepared to back it ti the Very last trench . " Mr. Colby elect naturally used military Illustrations in developing his thesis . which was that the Wilson Administration has Palled to protect the American people and the American flag against lawless acts Of belligerents . " Better , " lie exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , tor the certification of the obvious , and proof of the conceded in matters there the lives of Americans are involved , and in which our power and disposition to avenge insults upon our nationality are openly derided ; better . I say , in tone and substance , is the policy reflected In the famous message sent from the Treasury Department on Jan. 29 , ISQL signed by John A. Dix , Secretary of the Treasury of the United States : ? " ' If any one attempts to haul down the American flag , shoot hith on the spot . ' "
