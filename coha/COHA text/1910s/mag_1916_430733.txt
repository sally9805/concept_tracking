 | YOU have asked me , Mr. Editor , to write an article on the pending presidential campaign , and I comply with your request . The Executive head of the government and those who act for him in the Cabinet exercise more power in reference to our foreign policy , unhampered by the legislative branch , than in any other field of national administration . The particular person through whom this is conducted is the Secretary of State . Mr. Wilson selected for this office Mr. Bryan . He did not do this because Mr. Bryan had the slightest preparation in professional or official experience to conduct that department . Mr. Bryan is a member of the bar , but I presume no friend of his would contend that either his practice or study of the law would justify his appointment to the head of a great legal department of government . The State Department is the department of international law . Mr. Bryan was not appointed because of his qualifications to act as Secretary of State and to determine the foreign policy of our government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in support of the legislation which Mr. Wilson was seeking and with a view to domestic politics . It would have been difficult to select a man of prominence whose  | experience and the bent of whose mind fitted him less to conduct our relations with other countries . It showed on the part of the President the disposition to exalt the importance of domestic politics over our foreign policy , and I regret to say that this furnishes the clue to the record of mistakes that can be fairly charged to the present Administration in that branch of our national affairs which the world war has made the most important . After the sinking of the Lusitania and the unlawful drowning of one hundred and fifty Americans , the delay of the Administration in bringing the sharp issue with Germany to a head has exposed this country to the charge of weakness and vacillation . It was the duty of the President to withhold action until a reasonable time was given for a clear perception of the issue by the American people . His allowing the discussion to drag along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional humiliation in the sinking of other ships and the drowning of other Americans . If within one month after the Lusitania tragedy , avowal or disavowal had been exacted from Germany , as it was later , by a threat of severance of diplomatic relations in case of avowal , we should have been in a much better position than we are to-day . The proneness of the Administration to write a note well and appropriately phrased , and to deem the incident closed , has exposed the nation to ridicule . The Administration can not say that it has thus kept us out of war , for it has itself demonstrated by the result of its ultimate demand that it might earlier have secured the same result without the loss of prestige and the actual loss of lives which the delay has entailed . I may notice here the suggestion that the criticism of the foreign policy of the Administration is unpatriotic , because we all should stand behind our President when he faces foreign issues . In the last three years , I have squared my conduct to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our just national demands in favor of our rights , we should forget  | party and support the President in a critical juncture , and should restrain criticism of his course which would weaken its weight with other nations by making it appear that our people were divided in their views of our rights or their determination to maintain them . This was the case in respect to the first note in regard to the Lusitania , and to the final demand made so long afterwards , which resulted in an acquiescence by Germany in our position . But it is absurd to say that when the question is whether we shall continue the President as the guide of our international policies , we may not properly discuss and criticise in all its details his conduct of our foreign relations . The next feature of Mr. Wilson 's foreign policy , the consideration of which forces itself upon the electorate , is that pursued in Mexico . Twelve days before the close of the last Administration , through a coup d'etat , Huerta had become the constitutional provisional President of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jure exercising any real power in Mexico for law and order . Madero and the Vice-President had resigned under duress ; and Lascurain , a Cabinet officer , became by law provisional President . Lascurain appointed Huerta Secretary of Government and then resigned , and by law Huerta succeeded to the provisional presidency . All this was before the death of Madero . The complicity of Huerta in the killing of Madero has not been established . Huerta himself denied it , and there were reasons for attributing the act to others who had sufficient motives to make it a matter of doubt at least . It was amateur diplomacy and statesmanship which led Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bryan to assume the right to convict Huerta and declare him ineligible to become the President of Mexico . It is difficult in the history of any country to find in the short space of three years such a series of blunders , and of breaches of international law in dealing with a weaker government as this Administration has exhibited in its treatment  | of Mexico . No matter what Huerta had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to prescribe who should not become the head of that independent state . In order to prevent the United States from being made the feeding ground for revolutions in Mexico , Congress had passed in 1912 a resolution empowering the President to forbid all exportation of arms into Mexico and countries similarly situated . The last Administration , exercising this power , put an embargo in force . The present Administration , after much vacillation , finally lifted the embargo , avowedly for the purpose of enabling Carranza and Villa , then in partnership , to destroy such power as Huerta had . This was done in the face of the record of Villa as a criminal and murderer . The Administration permitted itself to think that in Villa was the savior of Mexico , although his hands were bloody with his personal homicides , and his life was one long catalogue of robberies and other crimes . We coddled him . We had a personal representative with him . We led him to believe that we would recognize him . On the other hand , we seized every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Mr. Lind , a man of ability and high moral character , but utterly without diplomatic experience , whose chief qualification for appointment was the fact that he had been a Republican , who shared Mr. Bryan 's views as to the wisdom of the free coinage of silver , and became a supporter of Mr. Bryan thereafter . Mr. Lind had no official status . He was entirely unacquainted with the character of the people with whom he was to deal . He had no knowledge of the language . He was sent there with prepared hostility to Huerta . He found what he was sent there to find ? he urged the lifting of the embargo on arms so as to help Carranza and Villa . Then followed the Tampico incident , in which the arrest of some American sailors and a detention of them for a few hours was made the ground for the demand for an apology and a salute of our flag . Huerta apologized but did not  | salute . This mere punctilio was made an excuse for seizing Vera Cruz in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the landing of arms from other countries . In the face of this , Mr. Wilson announced in his Indianapolis speech that the fighting of the factions in Mexico was none of our business and he did not propose to make it our business . The boldness of this statement , in view of his course , is startling . Attempt is made to avoid responsibility for the palpable blunders in Mexico by saying that the situation was " an inheritance " from the last Administration . The slightest consideration of the facts and dates shows the lack of weight in such a defense . The last Administration in 1911 had massed 15,000 troops on the Mexican border to prevent disturbances and to strengthen the prestige of our government in Mexico as one with power to protect American interests . It had recognized Madero , and , treating him as the lawful head of the government , had pressed upon him the protection of Americans and their lawful interests . It had sought the settlement of long standing disputes over the boundary near El Paso , and over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the mouth of the Colorado river , which is indispensable to the very life of the wonderful Imperial Valley in California . It had suspended the exportation of arms to aid the existing government of Madero . It was pressing claims of Americans for damages for outrages to life and property due to Madero 's weakness . It sought through Ambassador Nilson to preserve life and protect Americans and other foreigners in the coup d'etat in the City of Mexico ; and Mr. Wilson rendered most effective service in this regard . Twelve days elapsed between Huerta 's accession to the presidency and the inauguration of President Wilson . Ambassador Wilson advised recognition of Huerta after securing from him action upon the rightful claims of the United States in matters of dispute , and of her citizens for injuries sustained by them .  | Had the Republican Administration continued , it would have recognized Huerta . I am surprised that Secretary Baker seeks to justify President ' Wilson 's refusal to recognize Huerta by saying that I refused to do so . This is very far from the fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short delay and with less than a fortnight before the coming into power of a new President , it would have been not only hasty and premature , but it would have been lacking in proper consideration for me to determine an important policy for him . The great European powers recognized Huerta but not until a month after President Wilson came into office . The last Administration went out of power , having done nothing to embarrass the situation with which President Wilson had to deal . It had not intervened as between contending factions . It had merely prevented the United States from being used as a basis for operation against the government it had recognized . It had dealt with that government as vigorously as it could , without waging war upon it or invading its territory , to secure protection to American lives and property . So far as our government 's previous action was concerned , President Wilson had a clean slate upon which to write . I have said that the last Administration but for the shortness of its tenure would have recognized Huerta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority exercising power to maintain law and order and to protect American rights in Mexico , and because he manifested a purpose to do so . We had nothing to do with his character , if he was de facto the head of the only government there was . We had no right to sit in judgment upon his guilt or innocence as to Madero 's death . But if there was doubt of his power to maintain himself , it was not necessary to recognize him . We could merely have waited to see whether his power would be confirmed . This is the course Mr. Evarts as Secretary of State in Mr. Hayes 's Administration pursued with Diaz . He waited a year . We might have done the same thing .  | Had we recognized Huerta or had we recognized no one , we should not have been responsible for any result . As it was , we made it our policy to do everything possible to drive Huerta out of power , and we waged war upon him at Vera Cruz at a cost of valuable American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We drove Huerta out of power and then we became responsible for Mexican anarchy . We became responsible for Villa ; we became responsible for Carranza . We have recognized Carranza when his power in Mexico is far less confirmed than was Huerta 's and after a record of murder and anarchy by his forces that equals anything Mexico has suffered from Villa . We have incurred the enmity of the Mexican people . We have brought on ourselves the invasion of the criminal bandit and murderer Villa by a course that even that outlaw has much ground for claiming to be lacking in good faith . After the Columbus raid , we sent a punitive expedition to capture Villa ; and having punished many of his followers , we allowed our troops to remain in Mexico , though all hope of capturing Villa had passed . Because the Administration did not have the moral courage to meet political criticism and withdraw our troops , they were exposed to the slaughter at Carrizal by Carranza 's troops . And after all this , we are parleying with Carranza by commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems to this Administration , has saved it from the natural consequences of its most serious mistakes . The European powers who had recognized Huerta and then deferred to our policy of management of Mexican affairs and the destruction of Huerta , would have held us , but for the great war , to an accountability for the ruthless sacrifice of lives and property interests of their nationals . When the European war closes , we are likely to hear of this again . Indeed , in a large way the immense damage Mr. Wilson has done to this country by his course in Mexico is to make general intervention by the United States in that country a  | probable necessity . Carranza 's position is very far from secure . Neither by his character nor by his sense nor by his courage , does he create confidence that he can control his ambitious lieutenants , or that we shall not have between him and them a recurrence of the fight for spoils which we witnessed between him and Villa . If so , then the pressure upon the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to continue , will be irresistible . Then we shall have a war which Mr. Wilson will not avoid , and for which he will be directly responsible . Intervention in Mexico will require 250,000 troops , the expenditure of immense treasure , and a two years ' campaign to tranquillize the country . After that we shall have thrust on us the problem of dealing with the Mexican people , a problem which experiments by this Democratic Administration in the Philippines show us that it is unfitted to solve . Mr. Hughes 's overwhelming arraignment of Mr. Wilson 's Mexican policy , his opponents have sought to meet by the criticism that he offers no constructive policy for dealing with Mexico suited to the present situation . Because he does not go into details as to what should be done to get out of the " mess " into which Mr. Wilson has got us , Mr. Nilson should be permitted to continue to deal with the " mess " of his own making . Surely such a plea is a confession of judgment . The policy of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same lack of perception . The last Administration , after four years ' effort , had succeeded in securing a place upon which to stand in exercising its influence to help China and to maintain the open door in our trade with that country . This was done through what was called the Six Power loan . China was not at first disposed to grant us the right to share in the guidance which a syndicate of foreign bankers was to be given in the development of the wonderful resources of China and in the organization of capital and the vast army of efficient laborers drawn from her four hundred teeming millions . We succeeded in having awarded to  | American bankers a one-sixth part of the syndicate . Mr. Knox solicited the assistance of American bankers having to do with foreign loans . J. P. Morgan and Company , Kuhn , Loeb , and Company , the National City Bank , George F. Baker , and others finally consented to undertake the part assigned to the United States in this assistance to China . It involved a very considerable outlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to profits in the future . It was undertaken by these banking firms through a patriotic willingness to aid the government in establishing a relation that would enable the United States to have an equal voice with the five other great powers in guiding the development of China . It was a leverage by which the United States could prevent the acquisition of undue power over that people by any of the European nations , and could secure justice to China and the maintenance of its integrity . This was the hope of the last Administration . Immediately upon the accession of the new Administration , the bankers of the American group consulted Mr. Bryan as to whether their services were requested , so that they might count on the co-operation of the Administration in the protection of their lawful interests . Because they came from Wall Street , because the attitude of the Administration at that time was announced to be against Wall Street and against " dollar diplomacy , " they were told that the Administration had no desire to have them continue and could not offer them any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so the bankers withdrew . Now after three years , these same bankers are being solicited to enter into a similar arrangement in China , and they have declined because of the action of the government in the previous instance . It has become apparent what an error was made in not accepting the opportunity which the previous Administration had used every effort to create . In this and other instances , the Administration has returned , when too late , to the much criticised " dollar diplomacy , " a policy directed to the encour-  | agement and legitimate protection of American enterprise in foreign trade . Again in San Domingo , where we had been attempting to carry out a policy which had been vigorously fought by the Democrats in the Senate and in the House , of aiding San Domingo to get on her feet , by lending her financial agents to collect the revenue and to meet any obligations of the Dominican government to European creditors , we had appointed competent experts . We sent Mr. George Colton , Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with people of a similar character , and then , when Mr. Colton was made Governor of Porto Rico , we sent Mr. Pulliam , who was an expert in revenue collections and who had spent several years in a similar task in the Philippines . Without regard to his fitness , without regard to the peculiar exigencies of the situation , Mr. Pulliam was removed , and a Mr. Vick , with no experience except as a New Jersey politician , was substituted in his place ; and one Sullivan , a man of no fitness so far as his training was concerned , a politician from New York and Connecticut , replaced a trained diplomat . It was to Mr. Sullivan that Mr. Bryan , the Secretary of State , wrote that he hoped places could be found for " deserving Democrats " in this peculiarly expert service that the United States was carrying on for another nation . Mr. Sullivan had to be investigated and removed for numerous improprieties and demonstrated unfitness . Certainly " dollar diplomacy " of this kind deserves condemnation . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less justified than where we were administering a sacred trust needing the most skilled service for another country . We assumed this duty only on the ground that our agents would be peculiarly efficient in doing the work which was to be done . The Philippines , though not technically under the State Department , or a part of our foreign policy , are , however , so remote from our domestic issues as to be quasi-foreign at  | least . The course of the Administration in the Philippines has just as dangerous a tendency as the Mexican policy to involve us in future difficulty . When Mr. Harrison went to the islands , he found a government which had done for the Philippine people a service of inestimable benefit . It had produced law and order . It had given them health where they had had disease . It had founded an educational system which was teaching the youth English , and which in the course of two generations would have made them an Englishspeaking people , with a knowledge of free institutions . It had given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon justice . It had increased their total business many fold . It had given them a prosperity never before known in the islands . It had encouraged them to learn the difficult business of self-government by extending , as far as was safe , partial autonomy , but it had retained partial initiation and control of legislation by appointments of Americans to fill one branch of the legislature , and of the executive administration by keeping at the head of the departments and bureaus trained American civil servants who knew the language , who knew the people , and who were inspired by an ambition to do good for the Philippine people and to organize and conduct the Philippine government for the benefit of the Philippine people . Mr. Wilson and Mr. Harrison have deliberately destroyed the American civil service , without which this benefit could not have been conferred upon the Philippine people , and without which it can not be maintained . They have removed or forced out or discouraged , by a reduction of salary , the heads of all the important bureaus of the Philippine government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law which offers a bonus to every American official who has served six years in the government and who leaves the service within a year . The disastrous result of the elimination of all American civil servants can not be known in the United States immediately . A short time , however , will show its dire effect in the lack of  | efficiency , in the introduction of corruption , and in the halt of progress towards better things . Moreover , the President urged upon Congress the passage of a bill to abandon the Philippines in four years . This was defeated by a defection in the Democratic vote in the House . A bill has just been passed , however , by which additional power is given to the Filipino politicians , by substituting for an appointed Commission an elective Senate , and by giving to that Senate the power to reject the appointees of the American Governor . In other words , the plan is to leave the government to an American chief executive , with a Filipino elective legislature of two branches and exclusively Filipino department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to produce a conflict between the American executive and the whole legislative and executive departments . Factions and contests for spoils will appear among the Filipinos , and the government will become a humiliating disgrace to a nation which , though retaining its control and responsibility , can not exercise that power which is absolutely necessary to make a Filipino government useful to its people . The emasculation of all the departments of the Philippine government has been complete except that of education . Now the invasion of the educational department has begun . An efficient chief has resigned after having been overruled by Mr. Harrison in the selection of a competent Filipino assistant . A Filipino of experience in the schools and of aptitude was turned down at the behest of Mr. Osmena , the speaker of the House , and the chief of Filipino politicians ; and an Assistant District-Attorney with no experience whatever was appointed because he is a friend of Osmena . We shall now have the same failure of efficiency in the educational department which we have seen in other departments , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in the Philippines is continued , we shall have again to do the work which we once did in restoring peace and tranquillity  | to the islands . The Philippines will otherwise become another Mexico . But how about our domestic policy ? The Administration which at first laughed at the necessity for preparedness has hearkened to political exigency , and now has rushed pell-mell into legislation to increase our army and navy . It has done this without having provided the income upon which such preparation must be based and which should really be the first consideration presenting itself to wise statesmen and legislators . The Democratic Party has been in the throes of discussion and effort to devise a means by which the taxes can be imposed upon a very small class of the people to meet the cost of adequate defense and avoid the odium attaching in a political way to a wider and juster distribution of the burden . The main attack by the Democratic Party upon the last Republican Administration was directed against the Payne tariff bill , on the ground that it was enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high as greatly to increase the cost of living . As a matter of fact , under that tariff bill , the ordinary receipts of the treasury , in the fiscal year of 1913 , were 8724,000,000 . In this were included receipts from customs of 8319,000,000 , and from corporations of 835,000 , - 000 . The ordinary expenses of the government were 8683 , - 000,000 , and the resulting surplus was 841,000,000 . It was a good healthy financial condition , not only for the treasury but for the people as well . Prosperity reigned throughout the land . Everybody was busy , and no man lacked work who wanted it . The average rate of duty on importations was about eighteen per cent , and about fifty-five per cent of non-competitive importations came into our ports free of any tax whatever . Under the Payne law the natural increase of imports for four years had been $256,000,000 and of exports 720,000,000 . In April , 1913 , there were but 67,000 surplus railroad cars . In June , 1913 , there was an available cash balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and passed the Underwood tariff bill . They eliminated every protection feature from the bill . The difference between the cost of production in this country and the production in foreign countries was entirely ignored as a basis for fixing duties . The gentleman whose name the bill bears , Mr. Underwood , said that it would accomplish four things : It would reduce the cost of living ; it would not disturb the business of the country ; it would increase our foreign trade ; and it would collect revenues sufficient to run the government . This prophecy has not been sustained . The cost of living from October 4 , 1913 , when the Underwood bill went into effect , until August 1 , 1914 , when the present war began , did not decrease in any way . Business was greatly disturbed . The average rate of duty on importations was reduced in that ten months from 17.69 per cent to 13.62 per cent , with a prospect of reductions to below ten per cent to follow . Imports in that ten months as compared with ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S159,000,000 . In a year , from April , 1913 , to April , 1914 , the surplus railroad cars had increased to 213,000 , more than three times those of the year before , and a year later , in April , 1915 , to 313,000 , or nearly five times the number in 1913 . Many of the railroads of the country were in receivers ' hands , and it is estimated that 4,000,000 wage-earners in American industries were unemployed . Societies for the relief of the unemployed were organized all over the country . A loss in revenue led to the passage of the miscalled War Revenue Act , which was really an Act to make up for the deficit created by the Underwood bill and not by the war . The Administration claimed that its request for its passage was due to a falling off of importations caused by the war , when the fact was that importations had increased in that period . For the fiscal years of 1914 , 1915 , and 1916 , there was a loss of $240,000,000 in revenue from customs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts , the supporters of the Administration have the  | audacity to claim credit for the present prosperity , though it was clearly caused by the protection that the war has afforded to our industries by neutralizing the injurious effect which the Underwood bill would have had in normal times . In the face of the necessity for additional taxes and a bond issue to meet the cost of adequate national defenses , and the Mexican campaign , the Administration has increased the civil expenses of the government by the greatest appropriations in our history . The course taken suggests that the excuse furnished by the necessity of adequate defense has been seized as an opportunity for wild extravagance in many other directions besides military preparedness . The Democratic Party while out of power for sixteen years never failed to assail the Republican Party for its excessive waste of public funds . The Democratic platform of 1912 contains the following : We denounce the profligate waste of the money wrung from the people by oppressive taxation through lavish appropriations of recent Republican Congresses which have kept taxes high and reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a return to that simplicity and economy which befit a Democratic government , and a reduction in the number of useless offices , the salaries of which drain the substance of the people . The total of appropriations , exclusive of those for national defense , will show with damning force the difference between the Democratic promise and the Democratic performance . The specific demand for " a reduction in the number of useless offices , the salaries of which drain the substance of the people , " is a bit humorous in the light of the increase of offices provided for by the Sixty-third Congress in the appropriations for 1915 . There was a net increase in that Congress of 6,000 specific new offices , with salaries amounting to $7,000,000 ; and in addition to this , other new offices were created in which the number and the amount of the salaries were not specified in the Act , involving an additional outlay of $8,400,000 annually , or a total increase in the annual  | expenditures for new offices of $15,400,000 . In the present Congress , the Sixty-fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additions to the offices in this Administration , as reported by Senator Smoot , is upwards of 31,000 with a proportionate increased expenditure . No previous Administration , Democratic or Republican , had failed to extend the operation of the Civil Service law . The present Administration alone has taken retrograde steps towards the spoils system . Thousands of new and old offices have by direct legislation been taken out of the operation of that law . Ingenious devices , the operation of which is contained in the records of the Civil Service Commission , have given an opportunity to evade the principle of the Civil Service law and permit a recurrence to selection for political purposes of the thousands of fourth-class postmasters , who by an order of the last Republican Administration were placed under the Civil Service law . This order with respect to fourth-class postmasters was made as to half the country in 1908 , by way of experiment ; and after a sufficient test it was extended in October , 1912 , to the whole country . Instead of repealing the order as the Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its demand , and the effect of which we may reasonably conjecture from the circumstances . By an order of the Postmaster-General , the fourth-class postmasters in office were subjected to a competitive examination with all others who applied , and then from an eligible list of three , new fourthclass postmasters were selected after consultation with the interested Democratic Congressmen . It has been charged that this practically resulted in the selection of Democratic postmasters for every office . The National Civil Service Reform League applied to the Civil Service Commission for permission to investigate the records and the results of these examinations . The Civil Service Commission , re-organized by the President with a Democratic majority , declined to permit an examination of the record for various alleged  | reasons , one of which was that the facts shown by such an investigation might be distorted to embarrass the Administration . The President formally sustains the Commission in this refusal . What is the record of this Administration concerning labor organizations ? Has it considered the public interest , or has it ignored that and deferred to the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great public advantage in organization and combination of capital and of wage-earners we all recognize . The one vastly increases the product of human enterprise and energy . The other puts the wage-earner on an equality with his employer in dealing with wages and the terms of his employment . Corporations and trades unions are , therefore , institutions of modern economic society that are permanent and necessary . The power they acquire may become so great as to tempt to serious abuse and public injury . Hence we had the anti-trust law and the interstate commerce law directed chiefly against combinations of capital but affecting in some measure combinations of labor . Labor leaders have sought exemption from such laws as a privileged class and in some cases they have been successful . Mr. Wilson , while avowing his opposition to this class legislation , has united with the Democratic Congress in passing , at the demand of the unions , the Clayton Act . This Act , the labor leaders claim , takes unions out of the limitations of the Trust Act and denies to employers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . This unwise subserviency to the demands of labor leaders finds its crowning instance , however , in the dealing of Mr. Wilson with the threatened strike of the railway orders of conductors , engineers , trainmen , and switchmen . These orders control , or claim to control , 400,000 men who run the freight and passenger trains of the country . Should they all strike at once , they would , for a time certainly , stop the arterial circulation of commerce necessary not only to the  | business but to the health and life of the people . In the interdependence of groups on each other for subsistence in our modern society , such a combination has the greatest power for public injury . The legality of strikes rests on the proposition that the economic inconvenience they cause their employer is a legitimate weapon in the inevitable controversy over the division of the joint product of labor and capital . In ordinary strikes the injury to the public at large is incidental and negligible . When , however , the strike threatens to reach such proportions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury to the public dwarfs other considerations and justifies legislation to limit and restrain concert of action having such effect . Thus Canada has a law declaring such a strike unlawful if entered upon before a submission of the issue to arbitration . After arbitration , when the public have learned the merits , then the strike may proceed , and public opinion is counted on to defeat a disregard of the judgment . The main issue between the four railway orders and the companies in the present case was whether their demand for an eight-hour law , with ten hours ' pay , involving an increase of at least twenty-five per cent labor cost to the railways , should be heard and decided by arbitration as contemplated by a Federal statute signed by Mr. Wilson , or whether it should be enforced by a strike and great loss to the country 's business and much suffering inflicted on the people . The railroad presidents were willing to grant the eight-hour day , but demanded arbitration as to the amount of pay for that day . Mr. Wilson promptly decided against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with forcing the strike and all its disastrous consequences . Could there be a more complete illustration of Senator Lodge 's remark that the first step which the President takes in the investigation and consideration of an important issue , before evidence or argument , is " to make up his mind . " Mr. Wilson having found the railway presidents uncon-  | vinced by the bare statement of his final conclusion , then went to Congress and pressed upon it the passage of a law compelling an eight-hour day with ten hours ' pay , and another law enforcing the Canadian system of arbitration . If these measures had been combined , the public would at least have secured some machinery for preventing a recurrence of " the pistol-at-the-head " method pursued by the railway orders . The heads of the orders , however , contemptuously rejected any attempt to limit their future use of the same weapon which was now proving so effective . And so the Democratic Congress and the President humbly bowed to the will of the heads of the orders . Within two days there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple compliance with the full demand of the heads of the orders . Little or no consideration was given to the other recommendations of the President ; and he abandoned them so quickly in pressing for the Act which was passed that it is difficult to believe that they were more than formally made . Was this not an abdication of President Wilson in favor of President Garretson ? We might concede the advantage of an eight-hour day . We might concede that real impartial investigation will show that the conductors , engineers , trainmen , and switchmen should have twenty-five per cent increase per hour in their wages . These concessions would be wholly aside from the great issue here presented for the consideration of the public . That is , whether we shall abandon arbitration as a means of settling disputes between employers and employees where a. strike entails untold loss and suffering upon society . Even if the averting of the strike and its burdens is an excuse in the minds of many for the abject submission to an abuse of power , can the public also condone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to secure the public in future against such " hold ups " by insisting on the Canadian system of arbitration ? The whole episode is one of the most humiliating in the nation 's history , and is fraught with far-reaching evil consequences . In the end , the injury  | done by the force of this example will be far greater than the losses following a strike , great as they would be . The effectiveness of the bludgeon method will constitute a dangerous precedent , for which Mr. Wilson is responsible . The question which the American people have to answer is whether they are willing to continue in power an Administration with such a record and depend upon it to meet the economic exigencies and responsibilities that must confront a government after this war shall have ceased . Are they likely to forget the benumbing and paralyzing effect of the Underwood bill upon the business and the industries of the country for the short ten months it had full operation ? Thereafter the war stopped its effect and created the protection to our business and industries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy . Can it be that the present feverish and unhealthy prosperity , with its exceptional increases in wages , will blind an intelligent people to its temporary character or to the strain of the re-adjustment to falling prices and a lower wage-scale which the end of the war must precipitate ? Are they willing to continue an Administration sure to be charged with maintaining law and order in difficult times , and with seeking a peaceful settlement of labor controversies after the war , when it has already shown palpable unfairness and weak subserviency to political considerations in all such matters ? Has there been in the Democratic executive control of the government such an exhibition of courage and capacity as to justify entrusting it with the great work of preparing our national defenses ? Is there ground to be found anywhere for thinking that the Democratic Party has changed its nature in this respect ? The Administration did enact a national banking and currency Act , which is a real step forward in improving our previous banking system . The features which are useful in that Act were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thorough investigation by a currency commission , of which Senator Aldrich was the chairman . In order to  | avoid the charge that this was the Aldrich bill , certain other features were introduced which will have to be eliminated before the bill becomes as useful as it should be . The advantage , however , of having the bill on the statute book so that it may be made good by amendments through a Republican Congress need not and ought not to be denied . Much of the legislation , however , claimed for the Administration is paternalistic in its character , intended to secure the support of various bodies of voters by the appropriation of money for their benefit , the value of which to the country at large is only a matter of experiment while it greatly increases the public burden of taxation at a time when heavy payments are demanded for adequate military and naval defenses . The character of the Democratic Party , which has been manifest through many decades , is itself a reason for relieving it from its responsibilities in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to present . It is not a constructive party . Its legislative leaders in a long period of opposition have acquired a habit of mind which looks to political success by criticism and destruction of constructive policies , instead of to the framing of measures for useful affirmative results . The consequence is that when they are thrust into power and devise legislation , they find themselves confronted by their own past arguments , and they injure all their measures by an attempt in each one to coddle some faction of voters and thus greatly impede the normal and legitimate object of the legislation . Their intense desire to retain political power , and their fear of the electorate is so great that in matters of raising revenue , for instance , they find it utterly impossible to hit upon a satisfactory source for the securing of income . One of the most obvious defects in the income tax , recognized by every person familiar with the principles that should govern taxation , is the exemption under the income-tax law of incomes of $3,000 and $4,000 . The government could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of taxation as it ought to be equalized if  | this exemption were reduced to $1,000 . It is not necessary to tax a man with $1,000 a year income at the same rate as one having over $3,000 or $4,000 ; but some tax should be imposed on the former so that he may have a due sense of responsibility for the government and may take an interest in the economy of public expenditure . The attempt to fasten the whole burden of government on one or two per cent of the population and upon a few of the States , is ultimately bound to fail , and at the same time to be demoralizing in withholding from a large and important part of the electorate the normal personal motive for insisting on economy , a motive which restrains us from national bankruptcy . A very important feature of this campaign is the personality of the candidates . The chief basis for choosing the head of the government is the declared convictions of the candidate in respect to public issues which shall actually guide his conduct of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this regard the Democratic candidate is singularly vulnerable . No one has written stronger arguments , and no one has taught more effectively the reasons for maintaining the representative system of government as distinguished from the initiative , the referendum , and the recall ; and yet in the campaign for the presidency he abandoned all those convictions and announced a radical change in view upon that subject . During his presidential term he recommended a general presidential primary established by a Congressional Act for the candidates for the presidency in each of the parties , entirely ignoring the constitutional limitations upon the method of selecting the President . Having addressed Congress on the subject and made the recommendation , the matter was dropped . In 1912 , Mr. Wilson approved the plank in the platform of the Democratic Party in favor of a law exempting our coastwise trade from Panama Canal tolls , and invited attention to this as a real definite offer to the people of something substantial and not something to serve as molasses to  | catch political flies . But at a critical time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , he made a speech in Congress in which he intimated that , for a reason which he did not then define and has never since defined , he wished the discrimination in favor of the American domestic trade repealed . Mr. Wilson flouted the necessity for military and naval preparedness as something that offered an opportunity for mental gymnastics , and referred to those who insisted on it as timid natures . He thus discouraged the reasonable preparation which might have been had in time to prevent the humiliating exposure of our lack of preparedness to meet the Mexican crisis . When , however , the strength of the movement became clear , he made a campaign through the country and called for the greatest navy in the world . Mr. Wilson vigorously upheld the principle of the merit system in the Civil Service in his campaign speeches , and yet when he was urged not to sign a bill taking out of that system all deputy collectors and all deputy marshals , he openly defended the change and signed the measure . Deputy collectors and deputy marshals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , was one of the greatest abuses in the Civil Service . He has since signed , without objection or protest , law after law creating new offices by hundreds and thousands with special exemption of the appointments from the Civil Service law . Mr. Wilson in his writings , as a publicist , criticised the idea that the Philippine people could be easily trained to self-government , and urged the pursuit of the exact policy which the Republican Administration had adopted , of retaining control of the government so that the Philippines be given a good government until the people should really be trained and acquire the character that self-government implies . In office he has urged legislation giving what he calls " liberty " to the Philippine people , which involves the elimination of Americans from the Civil Service , and is a  | direct reversal of the policy he advocated as a publicist . In a controversy with his Secretary of War , he admitted that the enactment of a law giving independence to the Philippines in four years was premature , and then he wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House , after it had passed the Senate , urging the adoption of the provision by which such an abandonment should take place . Mr. Wilson in his writings , as a publicist , attacked the enactment of a Federal Child Labor law as an absurd extravagance and a departure from constitutional limitations , and now within the last three months he has personally visited Congress to urge the adoption of exactly such a measure . Mr. Wilson , in his address to Congress and to the public , laughed to scorn the idea of the tariff commission to investigate the questions respecting the tariff , with a view to learning the facts upon which a tariff should be based , saying that there were a number of bureaus through which any necessary investigations could be made . Since then he has urged the adoption of a provision for a tariff commission . His views upon the " anti-dumping " provision and upon free sugar have also been subject to change . Indeed , after denouncing a tariff for protection as unconstitutional , we find Mr. Nilson and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having intervened by threat and force in the affairs of the Mexican people , Mr. Nilson in his Indianapolis speech denounced intervention and declared the Mexican situation not to be our business . In his memorandum attached to his first Sundry Civil bill , Mr. Wilson protested against the class legislation exempting farmers and labor organizations from the operation of the anti-trust Act . His opposition has since melted away ; and he is now claiming credit from those who are supposed to control the labor vote for having in subsequent legislation " taught " the courts something on this subject . He took pride in the new legislation for arbitration in labor dis-  | putes and now denounces arbitration as inapplicable to the greatest labor dispute in our history . Other instances might be cited but these are certainly enough to justify the conclusion that Mr. Wilson has few , if any , convictions on the issues of the day which exigency in the field of politics may not induce him to give up . Nor does Mr. Wilson waste time in explaining in argument the reason for his frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special importance his public utterances as a basis for supporting him as a candidate . On the other hand , Mr. Hughes is a man whose convictions have always been the guide of his action . I say what the people of the United States know when I say that the chief characteristic of Mr. Hughes is the courage of his convictions in meeting the embarrassment of political opposition . He gives the reasons for the faith that is in him . He argues out his propositions , and he does not depend upon mere facility of expression , mere happiness of epigrammatic statement , mere graceful phrasing of a platitude to support his opinion . He carries conviction by his speech to his audience and he carries his own conviction into action . His strength before the people and the importance to them of his utterances and promises grow out of their confidence that he is not an opportunist , but that no political expediency will prevent his hewing to the line and fighting to the last for his principles . It has been said that there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson has had the presidential experience . This is as far as possible from the fact . Having in view Mr. Wilson 's record on nearly every political question and Mr. Hughes 's course as Governor of New York , it would be difficult to find among the public men of the country , one who is less like Mr. Wilson than Mr. Hughes .
