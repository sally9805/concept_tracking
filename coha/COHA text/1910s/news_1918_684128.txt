txt A representative of a large electric company said : " The fact that Secretary . has expressed himself no an advocate of ' railroad electrification is pleasing news to electrical manufacturers . If a general movement looking toward railroad electrification is started not only electric companies , but other industries , including copper , will reap great benefits . Electrification of railroads would cost hundreds of millions of dollars . and there would be an unprecedented demand for electrical apparatus , as well as copper . " The electric and copper companies are working to capacity as it is on war work , and I do not believe they could do much in the way of railroad electrification during the war . However , it is my opinion that a movement to electrify the railroads will be well under way soon after the end of the war , which will mean full operations of the electric and copper companies for many years .
