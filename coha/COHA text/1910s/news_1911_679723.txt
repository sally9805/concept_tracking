txt There is probably no man in public life more thoroughly informed as to the practical working of our system of representative government than Mr. SAMUEL MCCALL of Massachusetts . He has been for some twenty years in Congress . where he has had an active part in some of the most important and most difficult legislation . Previously he was a member for some years of the State Legislature of Massachusetts . He is a lawyer by profession , has had his experience in journalism , is a writer and student in political history , and is highly respected for the care and candor with which he forms his judgments and the independence with which he holds and discusses them . He contributes to the current number of The Atlantic Monthly an informing article on " Representative as Against Direct Government , " in which he examines the essential features and the practical working of the " initiative , " the " referendum , " and the " recall . " We shall not undertake to summarize his article . It should be read carefully by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so eagerly advocated in various parts of the country . We content ourselves with noting one or two interesting points . Mr. McCALL hits the nail on the head when he characterizes these measures as the reverse of " progressive , " and as , in fact , reactionary , in the sense that they are in essence old notions that have been tried and found wanting , and that belong to the earlier and simpler stages of democracy . In point of practical utility they compare with the truly representative system , very much as the oxcart compares with the railway train . They are clumsy ; they are costly ; they are unequal to the task imposed on them ; and the larger the task , the more sure they are to do more harm than good . The instance cited by Mr. ** in which the voters of Oregon approved at one election two inconsistent and mutually destructive modes of regulating the salmon fisheries , making illegal both modes of fishing previously used , is only an extreme one . The overloading of the attention and reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulling of all sense of responsibility , is the inevitable consequence of the extensive application of the idea of the initiative and the referendum . It is true that the present movement for " popular " government has Its origin in the abuses that have grown up in connection with the representative system . These abuses , for the most part , are due to the greed of some of those who make a business of politics , who have managed to seize the machinery of representation and pervert it to their own ends . But they have been able to do this largely because the voters have been confused and distracted by having too many names and too many claims submitted to their decision at the polls . The measures seeking " direct " government , so far from lessening this evil , greatly increase It . Instead of adding to the power of the people , they make it harder to use what power they have . Instead of simplifying the process of election , they muddle it . In place of voiding risks they multiply them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals in politics , they widen the field and make of politics a calling that the professionals alone can be expected to follow with success . It is to be remembered , also , that we now have in actual use all that can be regarded as practical In the proposed measures . The " initiative " is at the disposal of any body of citizens who think that their ideas , put in practice , would be of use to the State . And It has often been employed . The present civil service system , so far as it embraces the principle of fitness tested by competition , is the fruit of a purely voluntary organization of citizens of . various States , whose labors have been persistent and intelligent , and who brought public opinion to their support . The pure food and drug laws I are the fruit of similar effort . The resumption of specie payments and the I defeat of free silver and greenbackism were largely due to like agitation which passed beyond all party lines and embraced the majority of the Nation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Constitutions and to the assumption , in most States , of public indebtedness . And the recall exists only too widely , available at intervals of from one to four years , or , in the case of the judiciary , at longer periods . Would it not be far better to improve the use of the facilities we have for direct govern. ) ment , guarding them against error , qwq risks ?
