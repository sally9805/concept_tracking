txt " Roasted pigeons do not fly into one 's mouth , " thundered Daniel Guggenheim , head of the foremost . mining and smelting family in the world , in emphasizing how necessary it is for a man to toil and plan and sweat and sacrifice in order to attain success . SCHWAB A SCHOLAR I confess that I was a little taken aback the other day when Mr. Schwab dropped into Latin while talking with me . On other occasions apt quotations from Shakespeare as well as from the Bible had come dripping from his tongue . The public , I am sure , pictures Mr. Schwab as a wholly self-made man , educationally something of a rough diamond , a wrestler with big business problems , a captain of industry engrossed in steel and iron and shells and ships and munitions , but not in the classics . Yet I find that Mr. Schwab is steeped in the best literature , that he has not skimmed it but digested it , that he does not carry it I only on his bookshelves , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , he won his first important ' spurs by his nightly , painstaking experiments in chemistry ' at the time he was earning a dollar a day as a stake driver in the old Braddo steel mills . He analyzed ore and iron and steel ; he stucM their composition ; he learned how to test the tensile strength of bars and beams and plates . All this he did after the day 's toil . All day and every day he not only worked assiduously but kept his eyes and his ears wide open , learning something here , picking up a bit of useful knowledge there , studying the operation of this , that and the next piece of machinery and , above all , studying the human part of the plant , his co-workers and those who had advanced . HIS INTRODUCTION TO CARNEGIE " Andy , this man knows as much about this mill as I do . " was the terse speech made by the famous Captain Bill Jones on introducing to Andrew Carnegie a twentyone-year-old workman , by name Charlie Schwab . Carnegie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other practical steel maker of his day and generation . He was a grizzly veteran . It had taken him almost a lifetime to make his mark . How came ' Ads ** Bill in knesrledre of steel making ? Carnegie , ever on the alert for talent , immediately evinced interest in young Schwab . He told Captain Bill to give the young fellow " scouth , " the Scottish word for scope . Captain Bill did . And Captain Bill 's successor was Charlie Schwab . This is related to illustrate how the majority of our greatest men of affairs sot about qualifying for responsibilities . Hardly one of them who did not inherit immense wealth spent their youthful years in the average easygoing fashion . Nor , after success began to come , did they let up . The men who captain the industries of America are not eight-hour men . Many of them work nearer eighteen hours . No man can hold the guiding reins over a great industry without having it absorb his whole physical existence , and meals , sleep and exercise must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor once said to the elder Rothschild , " I hope your son will know something besides business ; " and the elder Rothschild , with the family and national responsibilities on his mind , instantly replied , " My boy must be a success , and I hope he will know nothing but business . " Baron Rothschild had his own pack of hounds , and the question may remain unanswered if his fox hunting was by physician 's prescription to maintain fresh blood in his veins and a fresh sheen on his bank account . E. H. Harriman rode horses at 5 A. M. , did a day 's work with cables and telegram messages over the world before 10 A. M. , and in the forenoon began a second day 's work with a rub-down on a massage table in a little room at the Union Pacific offices . On his yacht speeding up the Hudson , he might be doing a third day 's work in the late afternoon . But it was all work . CIRCUMSTANCES NO BAR TO SUCCESS Every effect has a cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the rise of each and every one of our industrial leaders . Birth , environment , scholastic education and such like fortuitous circumstances have had less to do with their success than have their mastery of circumstances , their individual effort , their special istudy , work , planning , their refusal to accept defeat . Circumstances , ready-made opportunity , or " luck " may have played a part in the shaping of many notable careers , yet my conviction is that had circumstances been different , had their been no ready-made opportunity , most of the men who have conspicuously succeeded , would have succeeded no matter where they had been placed had they exercised and developed the same qualities which they did exercise and develop . In other words , their rise depended less upon luck than upon pluck and work , upon perspicacity and perspiration . upon brain sweat and body sweat , upon insight and foresight , upon doing and daring , upon self-discipline and sacrifice , upon ambition and attainment . Could we know in detail the boyhood and early manhood records of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be found , I verily believe , that at least four hundred and fifty of them early developed traits which marked them as destined to rise above the rank and file , traits which stamped them as unmediocre , 1which revealed the possession in unusual degree of one or more qualities which ultimitely mean success . WOOLS% ( MTH 'S EARLY STRUGGLE Take Frank W. Woolworth , the largest retail merchant in the world . His father was an impecunious farmer rear Great Bend , N. Y. , and the family ordained that Frank must remain a farm hand . So determined was he , however , ; to get behind a counter that he used to go down to the little station where there was a tuppeny-ha'penny store in one corner of the shed and serve as an assistant there . He did not receive a cent for this work , but he knew that it would help him to get where he wanted . Finally he did land a job as an apprentice dry goods clerk ; the only ! reason he was able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful scraping for years , to save $50 which he used to eke out his pitiably small wage to pay his board bill . He was not a success behind the counter selling goods . and found himself back at farm work , somewhat crushed in health , but not crashed in spirit . He would try again . He did try again . And this time he made good , so good that his employer agreed to back him financially when the craze began for opening five and ten ' cent stores . The first store was a failure and had to be closed . Woolworth opened another , at Lancaster , Pa.  --  and it is still going . Of the first five stores three proved failures , but this did not deter the young man who as a boy elected to spend every hour possible helping the merchant-station-master without remuneration . Today Wool : worth has well over 1,000 stores under his control and his ambition is to establish a store in every city throughout the world . That boyhood incident accurately reflected the stuff of which Woolworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S CRAVING FOR KNOWLEDGE John D. Archbold , who was destined to become the closest and most confidential of all John D. Rockefeller 's ! partners , was reared in a rural neighborhood where the Hdeestrict " school taught no foreign languages . When only twelve he went to the schoolmaster and offered to do the chores around the school and the schoolmaster 's house if the schoolmaster would teach him Latin ! The schoolmaster was thunderstruck . Here was an unusual kind of a youngster , one who wanted to study more than was prescribed at school . The request caused the teacher to take special interest in him , and little John ? he was a very tiny fellow  --  absorbed not only Latin , but other special studies with avidity . He learned to think for himself . And when he was sixteen he made up his mind to quit the humble store to which he had been apprenticed ; he had gathered from the newspapers that the discovery of oil was making a sensation and making miniature millionaires in Pennsylvania , and he concluded that fortune lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office boy to a partnership in one of the largest oil dealing houses in the whole territory before he was nineteen , and he made such a name for himself that before long another John D. hooked him as a partner . When he died in December , 1916 , he left over $30,000,000 . The willingness to light the school fire , sweep the floor and fetch and carry for the schoolmaster in return for Latin lessons very clearly told the schoolmaster that here was a lad who would one day make his mark . Incidentally , when his duties , later , were supposed to be confined to the office of the oil firm he lost no opportunity to trudge knee-deep and sometimes waist-deep in mud and oil to inspect oil lands and to spot likely prospects . Here also he undertook to do more than was called for in the bond . HOW VAL/ . CAME TO THE FRONT When Theodore N. Vail was an obscure railway mail clerk out West , his train was stalled one day by a terrific snowstorm . It was found impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and train after train drew up at either side of it , unable to , prOeied farther . Orders were re -- ceived to transfer passengers , mail and all possible freight from the trains on one side of the blockade to those on the other , so that the trains could return and thus overcome the impasse . The mail clerks refused to carry or pull heavy sacks of mail over the deep snow ; they took the attitude that this was not any part of their job , that it was up to the railway hands to do such work . Young Vail tried to coax some of his co-workers to pitch in and get the job done so that the mail could go forward . They refused . Singlehandedly he undertook the freezing , trying task and did not quit until the last sack had been transferred . The incident was spotted by others and before long Vail was called to Washington , first as assistant superintendent and shortly . thereafter as general superintendent of mail service  --  although he was without exception the youngest official in the service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his associates needed a forceful , brainy practical hustler to put the telephone on the map they unanimously fixed upon young Vail . Today America has 10,000,000 telephone subscribers , 20,000,000 ; miles of telephone wire and uses the telephone 27,000,000 times every day , the business being several times greater than the combined telephone business of all the rest of the world , thsntrs in no small measure to the prophetic foresight , the indomitable determination and the titanic energy of Theodore N. Vail , the master mind of the whole telephone industry . Had it not been for that snowstorm incident , America telephonically , might have been no further advancgd than the leading countries of Europe . But without this incident it is safe to assume that Theodore N. Vail had in him qualities which were absolutely certain to force him to the front .
