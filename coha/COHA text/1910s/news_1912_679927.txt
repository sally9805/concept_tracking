Several of the jurors were also shot , one probably mortally , and the prisoner also was wounded .

Before the smoke of their rifles had cleared away the mountain outlaws had leaped into their saddles , and . putting spurs to their horses , galloped through the stunned little village .

Posse Pursuing Outlaws .

This morning soon after court convened the jury went out to consider the case . In Carroll County , from time immemorial , court has started at 8 o'clock , the earliest hour , perhaps , of any court in the State . A few minutes after 8 the Jury reported that It had agreed on a verdict , and soon afterward. under the direction of the Sheriff , the jurors came into the courtroom . Taking their seats in the chairs occupied by them throughout the trial , they were asked by the court if they had reached a verdict . Replying in the affirmative , the court directed them to make known their decision . The Foreman announced that the jury had found Allen guilty and fixed his punishment  --  at one year in the State penitentiary .

Floyd Allen , tall and gaunt , much the familiar type of mountaineer , waa in the dock . In his youth he was a fine figure of strength , and even at 50 now , when his reddish brown whiskers are turning to gray , he is no weakling . Before Judge Massie 's order had been uttered the fusillade began . Allen , with an oath that he would never go to prison , sprang out of the prisoner 's dock as Judge Massie collapsed upon the bench . Another roar of shots and Prosecutor Foster was on the floor in a help . Sheriff Webb was springing forward for his prisoner when the lead found him .
