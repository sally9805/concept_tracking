UPON the five Great Lakes there throbs a commerce that well might be the envy of any farreaching sea . To put the thing concreteIv , the freight portion of this commerce alone reached tremendous totals in 1912 . In the navigation months of this last year exactly 47,435,177 tons of iron ore and an even greater tonnage of coal moved upon the Lakes , while the enormous total of 1,4,000,000 bushels of grain were received at the port of Buffalo . In 1911 the shipping of the Lakes felt sharply the " poor grain crop " of 1910 and the slight reaction in both the steel and the copper markets ; whole fleets of vessels rusted their very hearts out in the harbors of Buffalo and the other great ports of the lower Lakes . But the business of the Lakes seems to increase at the rate of seven per cent annually , and 1912 more than held its own . Traffic grows fast upon the great water highways of the New World . Already the tonnage of Cleveland , Ohio , is comparable with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailormen upon the salt seas who have never even heard of Cleveland . Detroit boasts - that in the season of eight months of open navigation a tonnage ten times that which the full year gives to the Suez Canal passes her wharves on the narrow river that bears her name . If we start to go up the Lakes , we shall find that their passenger traffic , as well as that of the freight , breaks naturally at Buffalo . That is , most of the craft ascending the chain of the four upper lakes start either from Buffalo or points west of that port . Lake Ontario seems set by itself to be linked with the far lesser commerce of the St. Lawrence River . The traffic through the single Welland Canal , which binds Lakes Erie and Ontario , just west of the Niagara River , is a negligible factor . Nevertheless , Ontario is the first of the links in the giant chain , and to our Canadian cousins perhaps the most important of all the Lakes , for they have builded their second greatest city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link its traffic with that of the St. Lawrence River , which they practically monopolize . A night 's ride from New York will bring you to Cape Vincent , and Cape Vincent is the very point where the lowest of the Lakes Ontario ? is pouring its great self into the wideopened channel of the St. Lawrence . Here is a town that has had her day of commerce as well as her day of some historical importance . Her railroad station was once a big and busy place ; long trails of steamers were lined up at her docks . But those were the days when the Americans had not surrendered On/ tario to the Canadians . Nowadays the British flag floats upon the lake almost supreme , and the little ports all along the New York State shore have withered into mere shades of their former glories . Twenty-two miles across the head of the St. Lawrence ? a route made much longer than direct by the first of the Thousand Islands ? stands Kingston , a stolid British city , solidly built from its native limestone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Canadian war college . They line her harbor-front , and give the appearance of being sentinels of a much larger place . The most dominant of these are the old fort , for Kingston formerly ranked with Quebec and Halifax as an armed city , and the quaint martel towers , not unlike great pepper-casters , that dot the harbor . The towers and the fort are memories of a paw grandeur , for the freight traffic that passes the domes and spires of this Canadian city does not often halt in its harbor , save sometimes to take refuge from Ontario in one of her stormy moods . You might do worse than to pray for good weather when you cross in a stanch British mail steamer from Kingston to Charlotte , a long diagonal course to the south shore of the lake , which takes you well out of the sight of land for several hours . You are out of sight of passing craft as well , for Ontario seems singularly isolated from the great traffic that you will see after you are well out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter this state of affairs . The enormous political power and prestige of Buffalo have made it the terminus of the New York State barge canal that is now in rapid course of construction from the navigable Hudson through to the foot of Lake Erie . Oswego would have made the logical terminal of that canal ? the United States engineers who made a careful study of the situation a dozen years ago pronounced it such , ? but Oswego , despite its fine harbor , has neither political power nor prestige . So it must be content to see the grass grow in its streets , and sit silent at the remarkable spectacle of a great canal being built for one hundred and fifty miles parallel to a navigable lake . Charlotte is the port of Rochester , eight miles inland , and the one prosperous harbor upon the American shore of Lake Ontario . The big Canadian steamers all make it a port of call , and their trade from year to year shows a steady increase . Fifteen years ago this was a practically deserted port , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester has rejuvenated it into one of the busiest passenger points on the Great Lakes . Recently a coal railroad terminating at Rochester has sought to increase its transOntario traffic by installing a heavy carferry front Charlotte to Coburg on the north shore , and this stanch vessel , which plows the waters of Ontario even in the bitterness of her ugly winter moods , carries the American flag into waters where it has been practically extinct , save upon pleasure craft . From Charlotte the mail steamer pursues another long diagonal through the passing of a night , and some time in the early dawn ties up alongside her terminal dock at Toronto . From that city another vessel must be taken to Lewiston in the Niagara River , where a steam train connects for Buffalo and through steamers running ? the entire length of the other four lakes . A few hours in Toronto will not rob the man of " the States " of the impression that he is in one of our own bright and bustling cities ; only the unfamiliar uniforms of occasional policemen , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unicorn and G. R. , " dispel the illusion . The traveler who crosses the head of the Lakes will do well to take good notice of the craft upon which he makes his journey . If it is one of the older of these steamers , he may find that she has made a little history herself ? that she is one of the daring British craft that in the days of the Civil War used to run the tight blockades of the harbors of Charleston and Savannah , and then make the exploit a boast along the quays of Liverpool . You enter the Niagara River between Youngstown , New York , and Niagaraon-the-Lake , Ontario , two little towns whose bristling forts belie the friendship that has existed between them these  |p490  many years . And as if in token of that very friendship , the forts are slowly crumbling to pieces . They are themselves symbolic of an age of ninepounders and of field ordnance that could be turned out quickly in any ordinary , well - equipped foundry . Beyond the forts the river takes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchards by the tens of thousands of acres , and loses itself in a gash in the high bluff that geologists know as the Niagara escarpment . On the edge of that escarpment stands a sentinel shaft , visible for many miles roundabout , and the captain of your steamer may tell you of General Brock , whom it honors , and the battle of Lundy 's Lane . And in the gorge of the escarpment lie first the rapids and then the falls of Niagara ? still the lions among American attractions , and seemingly never losing their fascination . Buffalo is the eastern terminal of the tremendous traffic that pulsates upon the upper Lakes and makes the United States , despite the paucity of her ocean carriers , to-day one of the great and growing maritime nations of the world . Buffalo has seen herself develop in recent years from a sort of glorified railroad junction into one of the great ports of the world ; while her manufacturing thrives tremendously under the rapid growth of her marine interests . Already she is a competitor of Pittsburg in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . Its traffic is carried forth on half-hidden canals traversing the mud flats at its edge , and reaching great elevators and mills and long miles of railroad docks , with longer miles of railroad sidings to serve each of them . It is a tremendously utilitarian place in all of its smoky ugliness for eight months  |p491  of the year ; and then , from December until late in March , commerce breathes upon fingers and longs for the day to csme when the ice shall be out of the Lakes and traffic upon them resumed . You will make your first landing out of Buffalo at Erie , and if your steamer is one of the stout craft which successfully combine the highly profitable carrying of package freight with the less profitable summer-month passenger business , she will probably pause there three or four hours to fill her cargo deck . The harbor of Erie is one of the most picturesque on the ? Lakes . Nature was lavish there , bringing the long , protecting bow of Presque Isle , as delicate and as lovely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-haven . But man has not done nearly so much for the harbor of Erie . He has perfunctorily provided her with breakwaters and with guardian lights . But her wharves are dull , her water glory gone . Like Dunkirk , she has been robbed by her neighbors , Cleveland and Buffalo . Even those upstart Ohio towns Ashtabula and Conneaut are boastful of the fact that they are a few brief miles closer to the bituminous coal - fields and the steel mills of western Pennsylvania than Erie , and as gateway ports of the tremendous ore and soft-coal traffic of the Lakes they are worthy of notice . The coal and ore traffic , of itself , is worthy of consideration . You first take notice of it as your steamer lies in berth at Cleveland ? come to be the sixth city in the Union and the second in size upon these Lakes . Across the narrow slip a gaunt steel framework rises . It holds a cradle , large enough and strong enough to accommodate a single steel railroad " gondola , " which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cradle are clamped over time sides of a car that a seemingly tireless switch-engine has shunted into it . Slowly the cradle is raised to the top of the framework . A bell strikes , and it raises itself upon edge , three - quarters of the way over . The coal rushes out of the car in an uprising cloud of black dust , and drops through a funnel into the expansive hold of the vessel that is moored at the dock . The car is righted ; some remaining coal rattles to its bottom . Once again it is overturned and the remaining coal goes through the funnel . When it is righted the second time , it is entirely empty . The cradle returns to its low level , the car is unfastened and given a push . It makes a gravity movement , and returns to a string of its fellows that have been through a similar process . You take out your wateh . The process consumes just two minutes for each car . That means thirty cars an hour . In an hour fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavily laden train ,  |p492  have been placed in the hold of the waiting vessel . You are familiar , perhaps , with the craft that tie up along the wharves of New York and Boston , and you roughly estimate the capacity of this coal-carrier at some forty-five hundred tons . It is going to take but three hours to fill her great hold , and you find yourself astonished at the result of such computations . You confide that astonishment to the captain of the ship , who has come up behind you . He smiles at your enthusiasm . " That is really not very rapid work , " he says . " They put eleven thousand tons of ore into the Corey in thirtynine minutes up at Superior last year . " And that is the record loading of a vessel for all the world . When the British ship-owners heard of that feat at a port two thousand miles inland from salt water . they ceased to deride American docking facilities . The captain begins telling you something of the lake traffic in iron ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lakes . The workable iron deposits of America are to - day in greatest profusion within a comparatively few miles of the head of Lake Sul perior ? nothing has yet robbed western Pennsylvania and West Virginia of their supremacy as producers of bituminous coal . Also there is an ideal traffic condition . The great cost in handling freight upon the average railroad comes from the fact that it is generally what is known as " one-way business "  - -  that is , the volume of traffic moves in a single direction , necessitating an expensive and wasteful return haul of empty cars . There is no such traffic waste upon the Great Lakes . The ships that go up and down the long water lanes of Erie and Huron and Superior do not worry about their ballast for the return . They carry coal from Buffalo , Erie , Ashtabula , Conneaut , and Cleveland , to Duluth and Superior , and come back with their capacious holds filled with iron ore . There is your true economy in transportation , and the reflection of it comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .7S of a mill for a ton-mile , which ' is the lowest freight rate in the world . And in 1910 , 42,620 , - 201 tons of ore came down through the three lakes , ? a record-breaking achievement up to that time . If your steamer has been moored in the narrow twistings of the Cuyahoga at Cleveland , you will find your passage out of its harbor an impressive performance ? particularly after dusk has crept  |p493  over the land , and the great viaducts of the city are seemingly naught but long rows of twinkling lamps held high into the air . The start is a matter of some importance : a calling of hoarse-throated whistles , characteristic of the craft of the Great Lakes ; echoing shrieks from puffing and efficient tugs ; finally your bow headed straight into the silent blackness of the lake , finding a pathway out between warning signals of white and green and red , smaller craft making respectful signal , a trussed draw swinging silently open for you and showing , as you swish past , the glaring headlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And after that , the city astern , the unending clatter of locomotive bells growing fainter , the austere silence of the silent waters . In the morning you are done with Lake Erie ? past Sandusky and Put-in-Bay with all of their historic memories , steering into the mouth of the Detroit River . And here is where real navigation begins , and the best of the vessel 's staff stand alert upon her bridge . The passage of the Detroit River with a fivehundred-foot steamer is like trying to tool a four-in-hand through lower Broadway , New York , or Washington Street in Boston ? an opportunity for real steersmanship . The traffic in this narrow river is tremendous , a steamer every six minutes , on the average , day and night in each direction ; and the Detroit folk are fond of reminding you that this ceaseless water commerce past the front doors of their city in a year reaches ten times the volume of that which passes through the Suez Canal . And remember , the water year at Detroit is ended within 240 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic of 1912 bore a tonnage through the Detroit River far greater than that borne by all the ships that entered the harbors of Great Britain in a single year , a total that exceeded the total merchandise tonnage entering the harbors of New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Charleston , and Savannah combined . And if a big passenger steamer comes up to her pier while he is still talking he may also remind you that a total of more than 7,800,000 persons leave and arrive at this port in the course of the summer season . This is traffic as the young giant of the new century pours it upon the water lanes of the Great Lakes . The Livingstone Channels are being hewn in the narrow channels of the delta of the Detroit River southwest of the City of the Straits . When they are completed , together with the work at Sault Ste. Marie , the depth of channels through the difficult passages between the Lakes will be twenty-four feet , the ultimate for which the newest carriers are designed . Already a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these channels , and the government policy is to deepen the cutting at the rate of a foot each year . At Detroit , railroad ferries still transport the freight and passenger trains of four railroads over the swift river currents to and from the brisk little Canadian city of Windsor . A fifth railroad , the Michigan Central , has completed a long tunnel under the bed of the river within the past two years , and its ferries stand idle . But the steady traffic demands of the Grand Trunk , the Canadian Pacific , the Pere Marquette , and the Wabash still refuse to recognize the dangerous river as a traffic barrier , no matter what may be the season of the year . Summer and winter their powerful ferry-boats make the mile journey that is an important link in their various systems , and you begin to have respect for the January power of the river when they tell you that a transport with a fast passenger - train on board has been as long as ten hours making that one-mile journey . But the railroad ferries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . Across Ontario from Charlotte to Coburg , across Erie from Conneaut and from Cleveland . bridging the Strait of Mackinac , and again crossing Lake Michigan by four or five different routes , the great car-ferries ply twelve months of the year . What that means , only the crews of these vessels and the hardy passengers who choose to embark on them in the dead of a Northern winter know . The construction of the vessels themselves shows the hard usage to which they must be put . Their build differs  |p494  radically from that of the car - ferries in the Detroit River and at other places where the haul is comparatively short . In the car transfers that cross the Lakes the freeboard is uncommonly high , the giant bows built with the strength of battering - rams and with a prodigious overhang . The cars , from sixteen to thirty in number , are loaded in at the stern , the tracks disappearing under the upper decks and superstructure of the steamer like some mysterious subway . Now consider such a craft making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lake is certain to be frozen into a solid sheet of ice for twenty or twenty - five miles out from the shore , and this condition is frequently complicated by midwinter gales which break the ice up into huge floes . These , wind-driven , pile up into great banks , sometimes as high as the upper works of the transports . At such times these overhanging prows prove their worth . The vessel , by means of its powerful screws , is driven up over the edge of the ice . Its sheer weight then breaks down the ice , and by this slow means the crossing is made . The United States government has shown full appreciation of the importance of this traffic of the Lakes . It is constantly improving ' all of these channels , both widening them and making them passable for vessels of deeper draught . They give charm and infinite variety to a trip that would lose much of its novelty if the steamer were simply to plow her way through the centers of the great fresh-water seas . Your steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip through the interesting river portions of the journey in daylight hours , and so it is just dusk when you steam past the waterfronts of Port Huron and Sarnia ? connected underneath your keel by the tunnel of the Grand Trunk Railway ? and  |p495  out into the coolness of the night and the broad sweep of Huron . Throughout the day and now into the evening the procession is unending . There is not a time when there are fewer than six or eight steamers in sight ? lumber " hookers " come out from Saginaw Bay and bearing the last of the remnants of the once proud Michigan forests , and perhaps " wildcats " or " rabbits " bound from north Wisconsin ports . In their trail comes one of the big whalebacks , a faddish form of steamship which was abandoned almost as soon as adopted ; in its wake is the modern type of coal and ore carrier , and the captain bids you take a second look at her . " Some ship that , " he says ; " she 's six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cargo . The man who runs her came from a vessel which would take more than a year to haul what this vessel hauls in a single trip . " You have a second look at the red cargo-carrier . She is built , like all these new freighters , with a severity that shows the bluff utilitarianism of the shipbuilders of Detroit and Cleveland and Conneaut . None of the finicky traditions of the Clyde rule the minds of the men who are building the great merchant marine upon the Lakes . One deckhouse , with the navigating headquarters , is forward ; the other , with funnel and other externals of the ship 's propelling mechanism , is at the extreme stern . Amidships your Great Lakes carrier is cargo and nothing else . No tangle of lines or burden of trivials ; just a red-walled hull of thick steel plates and a steel-plate deck ? broken into thirty-six hatches , and of precisely the same shade of red ? for these ships are painted at one and the same time by a giant hosespray . They build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from keel-plates to launching . In another thirty days her simple fittings are finished , and her engines are ready to pound in her heart from down-Lakes to up-Lakes and back innumerable times . Again you are surprised at the rapidity of modern American enterprise , and you turn to the captain . saying : " Is a ship like that seaworthy in the worst of storms ? " " We do n't take off our hats even to the North Atlantic when Huron here begins to weather up , and crossing the mouth of Saginaw Bay is like corning around Hatteras in November . " Then he may tell you of what a single storm means to one of these freighters . There was one of them caught in a blow en this very Huron , without a cargo to give her rigidity , and after a dozen hours of fighting she reached port in a condition to go to the thy-dock . And there it was found that the workings of her plates had already cut a thousand or more rivets . Several hundred pounds of rivet-heads were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have bothered her , " says the captain . And then he tells you of a Clyde-built ship which sailed the oceans of the world for six years , only to come to Lake Erie , open her seams in the first bad autumn storm on that treacherous water , and sink . " They do n't make them of wood any more ? " you ask . " When the big Montezuma sailed brand-new out of Bay City about nine years ago , the day of the big wooden ships on the Lakes was at an end . The timber 's gone , and they 've made the building of steel ships cheap . " He points to a form of whaleback which your vessel is overhauling ? a dirty British coal-carrier , bearing the unmistakable sign of Clyde workmanship . " There 's one of the turret ships . We call them the ; side-walkers . ' They come over from Newcastle every summer to get the pickings on the Lakes before winter closes in , and then they 're hiking for the tramp business on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night boat , working her way toward Detroit , and back of her another steel ore-carrier south bound , and hack of her another boat and still other boats that fade into the mystery of the night . The procession seems endless , and the captain tells you that what it loses to Lake Michigan at Mackinac it will more than gain at the Sault by the accession of the Canadian steamers which come up from Collinwood and Owen Sound and the other ports in Georgian Bay .  |p496  " Where do you come from ? " he suddenly asks you . If you say Philadelphia , he will say that the Lakes are the Chestnut Street of the nation ; if you confess to New York , he will call them its Broadway ; while if you admit the soft impeachment of Boston , he will compare them to Tremont Street . Then , a moment later , he will confess to his own duplicity . " But , after all , I like my own name for them best , " he tells you , and when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway of the flashing lights . " Six hundred flashing lights they are , extending all the way from the graceful white shaft at Tibbit 's Point , near Cape Vincent , to the guardian of Duluth harbor , whose friendly twinkle assures the mariner of inland seas that his voyage is almost done . From April to December they mark his path for him ? by fixed glare or by the twinkling of red and white flashings , ? keep him away from shores hidden in the blackness of the night or from jutting reefs hidden from his sight by day as well , and make his course through the narrow channels of the Detroit and the St. Clair and the St. Mary 's rivers as clear and as safe as it would be to walk through a lighted city street . Sometimes these lights stand snugly upon the mainland ; at other times they seem to rise from the very bottoms of these Great Lakes ? like the familiar water-mark of White Shoal Light , which springs up from Lake Michigan , or- Spectacle Reef Light in Huron near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty miles . When the government finally gives up the battle ? which it rarely does ? and finds that some shoal is too storm-swept for even the stoutest sort of lighthouses , it will generally anchor a sturdy lightship , whose rigidity defies the crushing of the winter icefloes : In no case does it leave the danger point unmarked . Approaching the Strait of Mackinac ? a long night 's ride up from Port Huronthe west-bound traffic divides into two great streams , the one to find its way into Lake Michigan and south , the other making its course through the narrow channels of the St. Mary 's River and the locks at Sault Ste. Marie to the uppermost of the Lakes ? the majestic Superior . Along Superior 's southern shore are the rich copper deposits ;  |p498  her northern bank has the great Canadian ports for the despatching of the wheat that comes overland from the country of the Saskatchewan ; at her head-waters are a group of great docks for loading the rich iron from the Mesaba range into the carriers that are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trip into Lake Michigan is fascinating . Green Bay at the northeastern corner of Wisconsin is an exquisite sheet of water , all too little known and appreciated . Milwaukee has impressive entrance , with seven drawbridges silently opening , 1 i k e welcoming front doors , and taking you into the very heart of one of the bestordered cities in America . Your steamer moors within a stone'sthrow of the great city hall . You can sic upon ner uecn and watch the street life of Milwaukee 's busiest thoroughfare .. The entire scene seems foreign ? not American . It is strangely reminiscent of the well-ordered quays , of Hamburg . If the water-front line of Chicago is squat and unimpressive , her harbor , like that of Buffalo , hides its importance . It , too , is a place of mysterious passageways . You may ride for six miles through the closely built sections of Chicago , and then when your train emerges into the open prairie that surrounds the town you will see a fivehundred - foot steamer standing and receiving cargo from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that your respect for the commercial importance of Chicago harbor increases . But your steamer follows the Lake Superior route ? and you are going to stand by her . With a keen appreciation of the wishes of her passengers she will stop for an hour or more at Mackinac Island , and you will find yourself with your fellows of the ship 's company making a hurried inspection of this brilliant pearl of the inland seas . True it is that the picturesque fort of the guardian island of the strait has been deserted by regular troops an d its maintenance given to the State of Michigan , but there is not likely to be more fighting at Mackinac . Past centuries have given it more than its ordinary quota of battle , and now the stout blockhouses and t h e bristling batteries of old field-pieces are the delight of children and the interest of tourists . Mackinac streets have the quaintness of Nantucket , her illmounted fort the location of a Quebec , her own traditions the tender interest of the oldest of our towns along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . She is a great hub of traffic upon the Lakes , and a steamer docks at her wharves nearly every hour during the day . Tourists by the thousands land daily , and a great number of visitors sojourn among the hotels and cottages , her cottage colony being of such sort that the island has long called herself ' the Newport of the West . " Beyond Mackinac is Sault Ste. Marie ? the gateway to mighty Superior . The lakemen always know it as the " Soo , " and the fifty miles of twisting St. Mary 's River channels that precede it as " Middle Neebish " and " West Neebish " channels . For the St. Mary 's is so narrow that the government finds two channels a necessity , and operates them as it would a double-track railroad , sending  |p499  up - bound craft through the one and down - bound craft through the other . Nor does government supervision cease there . The narrow channels , with seemingly endless turns , a matter of difficult navigation even by day , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at six miles an hour or less . At the entrances and exits of these channels watchmen are stationed who make a written notation of passing craft , and woe betide the master of a steamship who shall exceed the funereal pace that the authorities at Washington have set for him . Even a captain of a vessel may not violate the navigation laws with impunity . At the " Soo " west - bound vessels " climb up-stairs " to the level of Superior , and away hack in 1S : 5 , when the first of the locks at that narrow gateway were completed , it was literally " climbing up-stairs , " for the process was through two locks , each with a nine-foot lift . These double locks have disappeared in the march of improvements , for the history of the " Soo " is a story of constant endeavor to keep pace with the growth of traffic . To-day three locks ? two American and one Canadian -- are at the free service of the ships of any nation , and the total number of lockages is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means one on an average of every twenty - five minutes , night and day . But unfortunately the vessels do not always come in regular sequence . There are clays when blockades of vessels await their chances in the basins of the locks , and wise captains wonder whether a quick run for the American or Canadian lock will give them the quickest passage through this neck of the Great Lakes bottle . So serious has this matter become that a third lock on the Michigan side is already almost completely excavated , while agitation has begun for a fourth American lock . With the constant increase of traffic at Sault Ste. Marie , it would seem that relief could not come too soon . At nightfall you may have cleared the locks of the " Soo. " with their noisy clatter of detail , and turned your stern squarely upon the two little towns of the same name which stand upon either hank of the turbulent St. Mary 's . The racket of the falls of that river dies away , the lights of the rival " cities " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel industry upon the Canadian side ? disappear , and you are upon the mysteries of Superior , threading the waterpassage of its entrance vestibule , Whitefish Bay . You are north now ; the clarity of water and of air , the sparse ruggedness of the hardy timber , the lingering afterglow of day that hangs in the heavens until after ten in the evening , all tell you that . And in the morning , when you are out on deck and facing the most majestic of all the inland seas of earth , you feel it again . Headlands stand out before , you in almost microscopic detail ; it seems as if you might almost toss a pebble over to that reddish sandstone cliff , and ye ' ( your friend the captain informs you that it is a mile away . He tells you that if he had you in a small boat you could see the bottom , and yet there is a hundred feet of water underneath the steamer 's keel . In hottest days of summer , in coldest days of winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and a few feet under the surface , does not vary from forty degrees . Superior does not belie its name . She does not quiver under summer suns or freeze under the bitter blasts that come down from the north . And the captain asserts that he can run for thirty hours in a direct course and never catch sight of land from either side of the ship . Here , then , is the great lake of the Great Lakes ? truly the reservoir of the continent . - You pass along its south shore through two long nights and a still longer clay : pausing at Marquette , threading the Portage Canal , browntinctured from the rich copper deposits that underlie its bunks ; stopping again at brisk little Houghton ; then still another canal , with the twinkling arcs of Calumet and Hecla showing astern ; then after a second night on Superior ? Duluth . Slowly , as dawn breaks , the north shore of the lake comes into sight , a high-hilled coast . And then , ahead , from out of the haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They take more definite form each minute , houses and  |p500  stores and elevators and churches , there under the half-day shadows of the hills . Now there are two towns ? Duluth to the north , Superior to the south ? and connecting them a stretch of sandy beach . The beach is broken by . a single waterpassage , and that water-passage spanned by a tall and spidery aerial bridge . Between the gaunt towers of that bridge your steamer passes , while land traffic halts impatiently . and you discover that the beach is nothing but a sandy spit making a natural breakwater for the most impressive harbor in America . Above the dock rise the steep hillside streets of Duluth , lined with buildings which proclaim it a fairly metropolitan sort of town . But the hills finally conquer the streets and the houses , and rise hare-breasted above all . Their crests look disdainfully down upon the tallest of the commercial towers that local pride has reared ; and the cars of the inclined railroads toil laboriously up their steep slopes . Duluth has accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of her park and boulevard system . " The zenith city of the unsalted seas , " Proctor Knott called this town , and you remind the Duluth man of that . " I do n't see anything funny about that , " he says , gravely . " We are a zenith city . The whole stretch of the Lakes is our servant ; railroads yearn hungrily for the privilege of entering our harbor-side with its ten solid miles of wharfage . We are the third port of the United States , and two thousand miles inland from soh water . In our county lies the iron which the nation is to use within the next century . " And so it goes . At Duhath the steamer stops . The high hills have closed in even upon the might of the greatest of the world 's in land seas . At Duluth commerce must lift herself from the dank holds of iron ships and go upon the creaking caravans of steel that are to carry her another two thousand miles to an unconquerable ocean .  |p501    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
