txt A young man , noticeable particularly for the big , slouch hat which he wore Dulled down over his eyes , entered the Jewelry shop of Harry Sigmund at 2a2 Central Avenue , Jersey City Heights , N. J. , shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday , and asked to see some diamond rings . Sigmund drew a tray from the shelves beneath his counter and stooped to get another . As he straightened up and looked over the counter at his customer he found himself gazing into the barrel of a re-volver , " Put up your hands , " commanded the young man who held the weapon pointing unwaveringly at Sigmund 's head . " Up with ' em in a hurry , if you do n't want to be shot . " The man 's manner and his words were convincing of his determination , but the jeweler , acting on first Impulse , snatched his own revolver from a nook beneath the counter , and thrusting it suddenly almost into the face of the youth across the counter , exclaimed : " Drop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot in an instant . " The words scarcely left the jeweler 's mouth when there was a report . The man had fired pointblank at Sigmund , but the bullet , missing the jeweler by a hair , lodged in the wall behind him . The report of Sigmund 's revolver was like an echo of the first shot and his bullet sped through the big hat of the man in front of him . So near had his gun been held that the powder filled the man 's eyes and he dropped his own revolver , clapping his hands to his eyes with a cry of pain . The reports and the cry brought Mrs. Bertha Sigmund running from a rear room . She saw her husband stilt holding his revolver in front of him . Across the counter crouched the hold-up man still holding his hands over his eyes . Mrs. Sigmund ran back to her room and got another revolver . Returning , she covered the man with it , telling her husband : " I 've got him covered . You get a policeman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He called to his twelve-year-old daughter Helen , who had stood terrified , in the doorway leading from the store to the rooms in the rear and told her to run to the Central Avenue Police Station , less than three quarters of a block away . While the child was gone , Sigmund and his wife both held their weapons covering the stranger who , however , made no attempt to escape . Helen returned with Capt . Cummings and Policemen Miller and Reilly , who grabbed the hold-up man . They led him to the station , where he said he was Charles Smith , but admitted later that his right name was Charles Myer of 1,623 Broadway , Williamsburg .
