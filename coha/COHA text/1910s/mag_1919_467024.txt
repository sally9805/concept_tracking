U. S. Military Aviator , Attached to the Thirty-Second Royal Flying Corps THE following account of the capture by the Germans of a young American aviator , his escape from prison , his recapture and second escape , constitutes one of those extraordinary narratives in which luck , misfortune , and persistent daring have been so artfully ordered by Fate as to seem almost incredible . The author , who is the son of Brigadier-General T. Q. Donaldson , of the Inspector-General 's Department at Tours , France , received his instruction in flying at the Ground School , ? Cornell University , then with the Royal Flying Corps at Toronto , with subsequent gunnery practice in Texas . In June , 1918 , as a member of the Thirty-second Royal Flying Corps , he was sent to France . During the following two months he brought down nine German planes , of which he was officially credited with five ( i.e. , witnessed by four observers ) . Lieutenant Donaldson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by Field-Marshal Haig , and has received two citations by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross . The following account , given in Lieutenant Donaldsun 's own words , without attempt at embellishment , describes his last flight and capture , and the extraordinary sequence of subsequent adventures and misadventures culminating in his escape through the electric-wire barrier into Holland. ? EnrroR.1 ON a bright but windy day , the ist of Septem-ber , about eleven o ' clock , while the squadron was yelling at the top of their voices , " Over There , " the major came in and said : " Well , chaps , the bombers have just taken off . We leave the ground in an hour , and escort them over to Solesnes " ( about ten kilometers east of Valenciennes ) . We filled ourselves up with ham and eggs , climbed into our " monkey suits " ( fur suits for high flying ) , and at two minutes before the hour were waiting to take off . When escorting bombers we generally fly in three flights of six each . The bombers usually fly all in one formation ( fourteen of them ) , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombers fly in terraces , above and behind the bombers , the first flight of six being 2,000 feet above the bomb-ers , the next flight z , boo feet above the first , and the third 2,000 feet above the second . This makes the top flight about 18,000 feet , nearly three and a half miles . This time my flight was top flight . We escorted the bombers over and watched them drop their " eggs . " Just as we turned to go home my engine air-pressure pump broke , and my machine started gliding down under the rest of the flight . 1 switched on ro my hand-pump and pumped for all I was worth . After a time I got tired of pumping , so I turned on my gravity tank , and the " old ' bus " picked up and went along as if nothing had happened . I had been losing height all this time and was now down to about nine thousand feet , and I suddenly saw between me and our lines three Fokker biplanes , the fastest machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a little long-range shooting , without inflicting any material harm on one another . Being outnumbered , I was at . s disadvantage , for no sooner would I get in a good position behind one of their " tails " than one of them would get on my tail . I finally grew disgusted at this , and , disregarding the first two , maneuvered into a good position behind and above the third , and let go with both guns . I could see the tracers entering the fusilage all ' round his seat , and suddenly the flames burst out and , as he fell , his whole face was illuminated . While I was shooting at this one the other two got a good burst into me . One burst went through my right wing , doing little damage ; the other , however , hit my engine , and the last my left-hand cylinder . I fell a mile and a half , righted my plane , and managed to volplane to earth , landing near my victim . By good fortune no Huns were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of time to destroy my machine . This we are ordered to do , so that our machines can not be copied or used . Then I went to the burning German machine and tried to pull the pilot out , but it was too late , as he was burned black . The Germans , who were running across the fields toward me , must have seen what I was trying to do , for when they reached me the Hun officer in charge saluted , asked me a few questions ( he could speak English ) , and said he was sorry , but that he would have to search me . He took my papers , maps , etc. , but let me keep my money and a couple of photographs . Then they tried my gun to see if it contained explosive bullets , and if it had I should have been shot on the spot . After registering , I was taken to a temporary prison in Douai . Here I was placed in a room with an English officer , Lieutenant Ham , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw on entering the prison was a bulletin-board on the wall , made by the prisoners , containing the names of several of my friends whom I thought had " gone west , " but who were , in reality , prisoners . About six o'clock ( German time ) supper was brought in . It consisted of one-half pound of black bread and coffee made of burnt acorns and barley , so the guard informed us . That night the English started shelling the city . One big shell knocked a few holes in our building . All the Hun guards " beat it " for the cellars , leaving us entirely unguarded . Luckily for them , we were all too tired to try to escape . Next morning directly after breakfast , which consisted of " coffee , " we built a fire in our room , using the table and bureau for firewood . ? Lunch , the main meal of the day , consisted of soup made of potato peelings , cabbage stalks , and water . It was very thin , but there was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were sent by train to Valenciennes , where we had the same supper as the night before ; then we walked to Conde , a walled town sixteen kilometers to the north . We got into our prison about II P.M. , were given two short blankets , full of " cooties , " and a stone floor for a bed . Next day I worked out a scheme for escaping and returning to my squadron , but , although there were sixteen English officers there , no one was willing to try it except a couple who were wounded and could not do so . The others said that it was impossible to get through the fighting-line . I was growing disgusted when another American , Lieutenant Mandel , aviator , was brought in , a prisoner . He was worrying about his violin , which he said he had willed to some one if he was killed , and he wanted to get back to his squadron in order to claim it . We went around among the other prisoners , looking for maps and compasses . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which I swapped my handsome fur-lined living-suit , but the only map we had was one cut from an English newspaper . A little after nine , while the streets were still full , we escaped by simply jumping out of the second-story window and walking away . I got a badly sprained ankle in landing . The guard , who was about twenty-five yards away , apparently did nor notice us , for no alarm was raised . We reached the edge of the city and there we struck the city wall , along the top of which we walked until we discovered we were going in a half-circle . Then we dropped of the wall ( a good thirty feet ) into the moat . The moat had only a little water in it , but plenty of mud ; every now and then we would sink up to our waists , then we would throw ourselves forward on our faces and pull ourselves out by hanging on to the rushes . Thus inch by inch we spluttered and floundered across and emerged , two dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud , we went by compass southwest . About two hours before dawn we stumbled on a German aerodrome . We looked it over , and , not seeing any guard , I suggested stealing ore of the machines and flying back to our lines . I had flown a captured German machine while in England , and , as most of the German engines are of the same type , I was sure that I could fly it . We now tried to wheel one out of the hangar , but the machine was so heavy that we had a very hard time doing it . After two hours we got it to the edge of the hangar , but , to our dismay , the tip of the left wing did not clear the post of the hangar . We then tried to back up the machine , but it was no use ; we could move it only in one direction . We were in despair until the idea came to us to take the whole hangar down . The hangars were small , made something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only this one had two machines dovetailed into it . After we had taken down the stays the tent flopped back , falling on the other machine , but clear of the one we had dragged forward . Mandel now went out in front and was turning the propeller-blades . I was getting into the machine when a voice behind me said , " Gwen Morgen . " I jumped as if I was shot . Mandel , however , kept his head and , speaking German fluently , asked the mechanic to help us . The German suddenly appeared to notice the color of our uniforms , and started yelling , " HiIfe ! " ( " Help ) , " HiIfe ! " I grabbed at him and a fight followed . He drew a small trench-bayonet and made a stab in my back . Mandel , who was on the other side of the machine , joined in , and with a long , heavy flash-light hit the Hun on the head , and when he fell like a log we " beat it . " Apparently no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later we found out that the Germans were not allowed to sleep near aerodromes , as they were afraid of bombing raids , and in this way protected their pilots . We asked to be put up at the first house we struck . They took us in , bandaged up my wound for me , and gave us food . They kept us for two days , and , at the end of that time , gave us a loaf of bread and said we must go , as some Germans were to be billeted in their house . They refused to take money , but we gave them some buttons from our uniforms and one of our lieutenant bars for souvenirs . On account of the trouble we had the first night crossing the moat , and because of my wound , which prevented me from swimming streams , we decided we would take greater risks and travel on railroad tracks . I was much annoyed by blood trickling down my back and sticking to my underwear . In the daytime when we rested the blood would congeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afresh , and my sprained ankle pained me a good deal . Finally , early in the morning we passed through Denain . While in the Denain freight-yards Mandel suggested that we should destroy something , so that in case we were caught our escape would not have been entirely in vain . We decided to open the oil-boxes that feed oil to the hubs of the car-wheels and fill them with sand and gravel . We did this to every fifth car on all the trains we met from Denain to Douai , about thirty miles . We hope this caused a number of " hot boxes " and delayed their traffic somewhat . We also discovered the situation of a Big Bertha and were able to give its location so that it was put out of commission by English artillery later . During the day we hid in some bushes between Denain and Somain , and , as usual , it rained most of the time . For breakfast and supper we had a slice of brown bread and some lard for butter . We did not take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread last as long as possible . On this night ( September 8th ) we were halted twice by sentinels , but they shut up as soon as Mandel started cussing them out in German . Speaking German perfectly , he impersonated a German officer every time we were halted , and , as they always halted us at such a distance that they could not see our clothes , after the first they cuss words they would shut up like clams and continue their beat . Dawn found us in a bad position . We were just able to get clear of the town of Dechy and hide in the first bushes we came to . By the time it had got quite bright we found we had picked out a rotten position , less than fifty yards from a motor-transport encampment , with a path between it and the road passing within ten feet of the bushes in which we were hiding . About half past ten in the morning a Hun soldier ( a lad about sixteen ) , while looking for berries , discovered Mandel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stolen away from the aerodrome for a nap and asked the Hun what he was doing . He said he was hungry and looking for berries , but was not finding many . Mandel told him to go away , as he wished to sleep , and the doggoned Hun went without the least idea that he had been speaking to an American . As we were near a German aerodrome , and Oscar had a leather coat and his helmet on , his uniform did not show and the Hun thought Mandel a German aviator . We were both scared out of our wits , and as soon as the soldier had left we crawled on our hands and knees about a hundred yards up the ditch , through the berry-bushes . When we finally got in our new position we were covered with cuts and scratches . We lay low all day , speaking only in whispers , and expecting any moment to see a squad of Huns corning for us , but apparently nobody had followed us . This day we- had only a slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next night we passed six trenches in the process of building , and eight completed but unoccupied trenches , each with two rows of barbed wire , fifteen feet thick , in front of them . We were continually passing batteries ; first the big guns , then the small guns and some large howitzers , and about two hours before dawn we began striking the field-guns and passing occupied trenches . Once we ran into a number of armored cars and passed within twenty feet of the sentinel , who appeared asleep . Huns were passing up and down the last three trenches all the time . We decided we had better get under shelter a good while before day broke , so about an hour before dawn we struck a nice-looking shell-hole and decided to stay there for the day . We were so excited we could hardly wait for dawn to find out where we were . When it was light we peeped carefully over the edge of our shell-hole . As well as we could make out , we were about midway between Roeux and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front a little stream that runs into the Scarpe , and at our back were the Hun lines . Soon we heard the rat-tat-tat of English machine-guns across the stream . An hour later we saw one of the English observation-balloons rise slowly two miles away . Soon we heard the whistle of shells passing directly over our heads and landing behind us near a German field-battery about two hundred yards away . The Hun battery replied . I do n't know how many hits the Huns made , but the English laid out three guns of the Hun battery . As each shell i screamed and whinnied as it passed over us , we 'd dig a little deeper into the mud of the shell-crater . At any time a shell might fall short and that would have been the end of us . We tried to sleep , but hunger , cold , and whistling shells were not conducive to pleasant dreams . We had no water , and though we ate the last of our bread ( we had only three-quarters of a loaf for five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our troubles over , for the English lines were in front and only a stream separated us from them . That night , September loth , we crawled up to the little stream that runs into the Scarpe and tried to wade across . It seems that the Huns had dammed up one end of it so as to make the water deep enough to keep the British tanks from crossing . When we tried to wade it we found it too deep , so we came back to the bank to take off our clothes and prepare to swim it . Suddenly we heard from three sides of us , " Halt ! " " Halt ! " " Halt ! " and the Germans ran up and grabbed us . A Hun patrol , while out repairing the barbed wire in front of their line destroyed by artillery fire had either seen our silhouettes in the starlight or heard us talking . Back we were marched , faint with hunger and with despair in our hearts . We would stumble and fall , only to be prodded on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer who could speakEnglish ( Mandel pretended he could not speak German , hoping to pick up information ) . The Hun officer seemed to think it quite a joke , and asked us why we were so foolish as to try to escape . He later asked for a button as a souvenir , but we told him that we should need them to give to the French people who would help us the the next time we escaped . He jeered at us and said we would never escape the long arm of Germany , and that the Americans were funny people and hard to understand . Starving , we asked for food , and he told his orderly to get us some food and coffee . Never did anything taste so good as this food , and it heartened us up a bit . When we had finished eating we were sent to battalion headquarters , where the officer in command said he would recommend the N. C. 0 . in charge of the wiring party for the iron cross , second class , as reward for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we reached at 2.30 A.M. Here we were questioned and given some " red ink " ( wine ) and black bread . Both Mandel and I were " dead beat " by this time , so we asked the captain if we could sleep there . He said if we promised nor to run away during the night we could sleep on the sofa in front of the fire . As we were too tired to run , we promised . At 6.30 A.m. a Hun orderly brought us in some black bread , margarine , and coffee , and at 7 A.M. we were on our way to corps headquarters in Leewards . Here we were given some soda-water , and asked the same questions we had been asked at the other headquarters . We registered in a village south of Douai and Tye were recognized by the Hun officials who had seen us before we made our escape . They cheered us up by telling us that we should never have another chance , but they gave us a good feed of horse-flesh , potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever received from the Germans . After " chow " we marched back to Denain , getting there about eight in the evening . We had been marched for twenty-three hours , stopping only for food and three hours at divisional headquarters , and had covered over forty kilometers . This is as much as we walked during the three days when we were alone . Next morning ( September 12th ) we took train to Valenciennes , and then on to Conde . At Conde the guard refused to take us . They said Americans were seditious and had a bad influence on the rest of the prisoners , and that the night after we escaped five more had tried it . They were , however , all caught again in two days . It ended up by our being put in a prison at Fresnes , about midway between Valenciennes and Conde , where we were left in solitary confinement for trying to escape , and were given only a small piece of moldy black bread and water . We were put in a little room directly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a little room to one side of us was a British N. C. 0. , placed there for hitting a German officer ; and on the other side was a small empty room without any windows . The door leading to this room was held in place by three iron bars bolted into the woodwork . The first four days we slept almost continuously , then the " cooties " got too active , and the pangs of hunger and craving for food began . Two days later a British Tommy smuggled up some " Bully beef " and tea , bribing one of the guards with cigarettes , and he brought us food thereafter . This camp was a permanent prison camp for British soldiers , but only a temporary one for officers . The soldiers were receiving packages from the Red Cross . Having recuperated , Mandel and I turned our thoughts to escaping again , determining . to be killed rather than tormented , half starved , and frozen . We decided we would get into the little room next to us and started to won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too strong , but next day , when we told the Tommy who brought us our fond , he smuggled up a pair of pincers , and with these we worked the bolts off . We thought we would try to escape that night , but when we got into the other room we found it had no windows , only a slanting roof . We removed the tiles on the roof , but it did not make things better , for the supports holding MY CAPTURE the tiles in place were just too close to allow us to slip through . Thoroughly disgusted , we replaced the bolts in the door loosely and went to bed . Next morning we told the Tommy our trouble again ; he said he would see what he could do for us . Just before the sun set he slipped us a rusty piece of a saw about eight inches long , and with it we sawed and sawed until we had made a hole large enough to climb through . Next day we had everything ready for our escape ; a compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About noon two other American prisoners were brought into camp , Lieutenants Robert Anderson and Theose Tillinghast . We asked the commanding officer to be allowed to see them , and he consented . We talked to them for a while , and after they had gone out in the courtyard we discussed them . We liked them , and , as they appeared to be typical Americans with plenty of grit , we asked them to join us , which they eagerly agreed to do . The British N. C. 0 . in the next cell was also asked to join us . He had been a prisoner for thirteen months , and as he was sentenced to tenyears ' solitary confinement for hitting a Hun officer , he was glad to join the party . He was in the next room and we just pulled out the staples holding the padlock , this taking only about fifteen minutes . We all gathered in my cell just before sunset . We decided to escape about nine o'clock , as the moon Caine up about ten . This was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard how Andy and VOL . CXXXIX. ? No. 830. - 52AND ESCAPE Tilly had been brought down . Andy jumped umped on by five Huns , and al-though he circled , half rolled , dove , spun , and did everything he could , he could not shake them off his " rail " and they brought him down , wounded in three places . In the last half-roll he did not have quite enough room to flatten out and he crashed into the German trenches . The Huns bandaged his wounds for him , but told him he would have to walk to the rear , as they were short of transportation . After the first mile he collapsed ; then the Hun guard stopped a wagon and placed him on board . This occurred on August 27th , just outside Arras , and from there he was carried in a cattle-car to Mons , where he was pl aced in a hospital . He was there four weeks when he was sent to Fresnes to wait to be sent to prison camp in Germany . This is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on September zzd and met a number of Huns , some of whom were above and some below . Tilly 's flight went down on the ones below , expecting the top flight to protect them . When Tilly finished with his Hun ( which later he found out he had crashed ) he was entirely surrounded byHuns . Flying a Sopwith camel , which can maneuver quickly , Tilly was gradually getting away when by a fluke one of the Huns hit his engine . There was nothing to do but land , and the Huns , although they saw he was landing . on their side of the line , kept firing on him , filling his machine full of bullet-holes , but missing him . He crashed into a Hun dugout . Usually the Hun aviators play fair , and this is the only exception I personally have known while on the front . This applies only to the airmen ; in the trenches nothing is too low or mean for them to do . The Huns crowded out of the dugout , came over , and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin of a church , where he slept that night . Next day he was put in a prison just across the street from us , and on the 26th he was transferred to our prison . Well , to continue the story , at exactly 9.55 we crawled carefully out on the roof . Just as we got on top of it a Hun came out to feed the horses , and we had to sit like statues in this most awkward position until he re-entered the house . Then we crawled to the edge of the roof and climbed down into the courtyard . We tiptoed across the courtyard , climbed the wall , and dropped down on the other side . We thought now we could set off across open country , but , to our bitter disappointment , we found ourselves facing another wall too high to climb . To our left was a street , but we could get to it only by going through houses . To our right was a canal . This appeared our only chance , so we took off our clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Englishman could not swim well , and we had to get on each side of him , and after much spluttering we finally got him across , put on our clothes , and " lit out " for open country . The ground was so marshy we thought we could make better time by following the railroad track to the east . In one place the track passed quite close to a large factory . As we passed it a German yelled to us to halt . We yelled , " Was ist ? " and kept on going , our hearts thumping painfully , but , so far as we know , we were not followed . We were walking in the general direction of Holland , but , due to the many canals , we had to go a number of miles out of our way . By morning we found that we had gone only about ten kilometers from the prison and that we were just across the French-Belgian border . During the day we saw some farmers to whom we told our situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it poured . We were so wet and miserahle that we took shelter in a freight-car , and later woke some people up in a lonely house and asked them to let us get dry . They built a big fire ( quite an extravagance in Belgium ) and dried our clothes while we slept on the floor . Both Tilly and Andy were pretty well laid out . Andy was just out of the hospital from his wounds and Tilly was just getting over the effects of the " flu , " and I had my bayonet wound and game ankle . Next day we were put up near Quevaucamps by a friendly Belgian whose name was August , the Miller . That was all he would tell us . We gave him our names and addresses and asked him to look us up after the war . After traveling all night , we stopped the next day outside of Maffle . Here we were fed . Mandel and George ( the British N. C. 0. ) were given suits of civilian clothes valued in Belgium at this time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our way For fifteen kilometers and would n't give us his name . He said he had been waiting for four years for a chance to do something for his country and his king , and that this was his chance . We shall always remember his kindness . He was large , broad-shouldered , about fifty-five years old , and had a good face . We made good time this night , going over thirty kilometers . Then we held council . George ( the N. C. 0. ) was for keeping on into Brussels ; I was for staying out . George said he was once in prison with some Belgians and that one of them had told him , if he ever wanted to escape , to look him up and he would help him . The address was Mr. Voghel , 24 rue de St. Augustin , Forest , Brussels . As we were in uniform and could n't ask for information and did not know the city , we thought it would be best for George and Mandel , who were in civilian clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , if all was 0 . K. They agreed to meet us next night at nine o'clock . We never saw them again , and we learned afterward they were shot , wounded , recaptured , and sent to the Dusseldorf prison . ( Since the armistice was signed I have talked to Mandel over the ' phone . He is well and in New York . ) We waited until eleven , then , thinking they had probably lost their way returning , we decided to hunt up the address ourselves . We tramped around all night and by luck located the house at dawn . After pounding , on the door , a woman asked us what we wanted . She told us Voghel was in prison for forging a passport , and that she was afraid to help us , that Mandel and George had been there the day before , but had gone on . By this time it was nearly dawn and it was imperative that we should get out of town and into shelter as soon as possible . United States officers ' uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In desperation we climbed over the first low wall we struck and found ourselves in the grounds of a large chiteau , where we hid in the bushes , but as it had rained for the last four days and we had hardly any food and were wet , cold , and starving , we took refuge in an unused summer-house . In it was a fireplace and we determined to get dry , so we gathered up driftwood and trellises and soon had a cheerful blaze . The French gardener , seeing the smoke , came out and thought we were German deserters and wanted to turn us over to the authorities . At last we got him to understand that we were Americans , so , greeting us as friends , he ran to get madame the countess . She and her two charming daughters appeared on the scene and welcomed us royally and we told some of our experiences . All could speak English very well . They brought us food , gave us clothes , maps , etc. , and , oh ! the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At dinner we had the first real meat since our capture . We gave them some United States buttons , and left that night with the chauffeur , who showed us the way to an aerodrome on the outskirts of Brussels . After the chauffeur left us we met a Belgian policeman who halted us and asked us what we were carrying and where were our passports . We thought our best chance was to tell him the truth . As soon as he found out we were Americans he became very friendly . We told him we wanted to steal a machine at Berchem . He advised us tocome home with him and go out and look it over in the daytime . We did so and slept on a mattress on the floor . Next morning we went out to the aerodrome at Berchem on the street-car . When the conductor asked for our fare we gave him a bill and said , " Berchem . " It worked like a charm . Alas ! when we reached the aerodrome we found the hangars were big Zeppelin-sheds used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open one of the enormous doors . Our ride on the trolley gave us confidence , so we went boldly into the first wine-shop , ordered beer , then took the train hack to town . In Brussels we went into a wine-shop which had " Estaminet " written on it instead of the word " Herborg . " We thought the proprietor must be French , which he was ; and as he seemed quite friendly , treated his do kindly , and charged less than usual for drinks , etc. , we decided to tell him who we were . When he heard the word " American " he came around the counter , grabbed me around the waist and kissed me on both cheeks , and at the same time said something about the Americans , " the saviors of Belgium and France . " He called in his wife and the whole thing was repeated again . After they had quieted down they brought us some lunch and let us stay there during the day . Just before we left the old man insisted on playing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a Bache came in and asked for a cigar ( which he took without paying full price for it ) , but he paid no attention to us or to the music . We went back to the Belgian policeman 's house to get our packs , in which we kept our maps , a little hread , extra clothing , and some soap the countess had given us . The policeman escorted us through the city , put us on another train , paid our fare , and told us to get out at the end of the line and we would be at Evere , where there was another Hun aerodrome . When we got there we could n't get a Hun machine , as it was well guarded . Here we had a close call . On the street-car I had pat the pack in the vestibule , trying to hide it in the darkness , as Belgians were not allowed to carry packs . A passenger , in getting off , kicked my pack out into the street . I stretched out flat on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing my foot flew up and struck a German officer . Fortunately for me , he was very much occupied by his conversation with a pretty Red Cross nurse , and contented himself by cursing me roundly . So once more we struck out for open country in the general direction of Holland . Next day we spent in the woods , which we reached after dawn . Some early workmen saw us go into the woods , and while we were crouched under the trees for shelter from the driving rain , a lot of farmers and farm-hands came out , armed with scythes , pitchforks , staves , etc. , to capture us as German deserters . They called us to come out , and looked a dangerous , angry mob . We tried to get them to understand that we were Americans and not Germans , but , as we spoke no Dutch and little French , it was hard . At last they understood and , throwing away their weapons , embraced us and took us to the village and gave us food for two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on carrots , turnips , cabbage , etc. , and he will find that after a while the stringy fibers make the mouth intensely sore and swell the lips . Therefore we got all the cooked food we could . All this time we had been going very slowly , on account of our-feet . Tilly ' s tendons were strained , Andy 's feet sore , and mine a mass of blisters . I had flying-boots , which were not made to walk in , and while I kept cutting them down till they were slippers , yet my feet were bloody and sore . Part of the time we were barefoot , so that our toe nails were worn to stubs . We tried to get shoes from the Belgians , but they did not have any but sabots , and these blistered the feet even worse . The third night we continued out journey to the northeast . Dawn found us northeast of Haecht , where we had another close call . While we were walking along we heard a sentinel putting bullets into a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we turned to go , three officers came out of a brightly lighted but and passed within two feet of us . They were blinded by the light , and we stood still , fearing even tobreathe lest they nab us , our hearts thumping so painfully it seemed to us they must hear them ; but they passed on and we put up in a barn at Inn . This was the first place they charged us for food , and four marks apiece did n't begin to pay for even one meal . At the next village we tried two or three houses . We were taken in by an old farmer and his son and slept in the stable , but had little food . The village pastor came to see us . At the next village Father Doxky spoke English , and for the second time we had a good bed to sleep in . He told us where the Huns were living and what part of the border it was best to try to cross , and a guide showed us part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers from Holland , but had a hard time getting a place to stay , and finally went to the priest of the village ; he took us in , fed us , and let us sleep in the church . The people told us it was impossible to cross the border here , and that only two weeks before a Belgian was shot for smuggling mail into the country , and that all other men in the employ of the Belgian government who could help us with wire-cutters , etc. , had gone . We were highly disgusted , for it was a problem how , with bare hands , we were to get through an electric fence which had from three thousand to five thousand volts running through it . The wire extended two feet underground , so we could n't dig under ; however , we were told by the priest that at Lommel we might get somehody to help us , and next morning he himself escorted us part of the way . This was only the second time we had traveled in the daytime ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town , Roul , about noon and , feeling hungry , went to the pastor 's house and asked for food . He gave us bread and coffee and directed us to a house where they could speak English . We went to the house and knocked . A Belgian came to the door . We asked him if he could speak English . He said , " Yes , " but would not talk much . We were in civilian clothes given us by the countess in Brussels , and the Belgians could not know whether we were Germans or not . After fifteen minutes ' talking on our side he was convinced that we were Americans , and said he had been in the good old U. S. A. for four years , and while there he saved enough to build the house he was living in . It was quite a big house as Belgian houses go . He gave us food and said he would look for somebody who could get us wire-cutters , and in the mean while we could sleep in the woods near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation he stopped and went out in the street . In a few minutes he returned with a man whom he introduced as his brother , Jan Hus . His own name was Gustaaf Hus . We talked to Jan quite a while before we convinced him we were not Germans . He finally said he knew a lot of Huns , but he had never seen one with a face like Tilly 's , which is long and thin , so we must be Americans . We stayed out in the woods that night , but it was too cold to sleep . A heavy frost added to our discomfort . We would walk up and down for an hour . and then lie down until the cold forced us to repeat the operation , and so on until morning . Then Jan brought us food , and a neighbor with him , a Mr. Emsems , the man who owned the factory that supplied the juice ( electricity ) for the electric fence.The Germans were using it against his will . There were three fences between Belgium and Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two outer fences were ordinary wire without any current ; the middle fence , which had a three-phase current , five thousand volts , was eight feet high , and consisted of nine strands of wire . After spending one more night in the rain , Jan took us in a dog-cart to his house , where we stayed for seven days . In the first two days we talked to the villagers whom Jan would bring in , and they would tell us all the different crimes the Huns had committed . When the Huns first entered a town they would shoot a few of the villagers and burn a couple of houses so the rest would be too cowed to disobey them later . They took all autos , horses , wagons , bicycles , coins , clothes , and even mattresses from them , also all copper , hrass , nickel , etc . Every farmer was taxed so many potatoes , so much grain , etc. , and he was not allowed to sell his products . If a hen did not lay two eggs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories in Germany , the women and old men in the fields . On the third day at Jan Hus 's house , which is at Baelen-sur-Nethe , about nine kilometers from the border , twenty soldiers and three officers were sent to collect copper , and were billeted in Jan 's house . We offered to take to the woods , but the peace rumors were lively at this time and Jan told us he was not afraid . We kept to our rooms as much as possible , but ran into the Hun officers a couple of times in the hallway . The Boches , however did not even appear to notice us . When they were searching the house for copper we went out into the barn and pretended to buy a cow , and when they had finished the house and started on the outhouses we walked past them into the house again . Of course , we had on the " cit " clothes and looked like Belgian peasants . They never suspected a thing . From my observation , the average Hun soldier is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly willing to let the N. C. O. 's and officers think for him . The N. C. O. 's and officers , on the other hand , are fairly bright and efficient . After three days the Huns went to the next village , and the day after we heard where we could get hold of some insulated wire-cutters through a secret-service agent . Tilly and I decided that , as Andy had taken electrical engineering at Cornell , it was up to him to cut the electric wire , and , after some arguing , Andy consented . The wire-cutters we obtained , although they had rubber handles , did not look as if they would keep out five thousand volts , so we got some rubber gloves also . We were shown the best place to cross , and on the night of the 23d of October we walked up to within one hundred and fifty yards of the border . Here we could hear the sentinels calling to one another . Down we got on our stomachs and crawled , and it took us three hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost full . We were sopping wet , cold , and very hungry . Within forty meters of the fences the brush had been cut away , leaving an open stretch between us and the fences . The sentinels ' beats were about two hundred yards each , so when the one nearest had passed us and was about one hundred yards away we made a break for the fences . We climbed through the first ; then Andy got busy with his cutters ? snap ! snap ! snap ! ? and the three lower strands of the electrical fence were severed . The sparks flew in every direction and frightened us to death , but we carefully crawled under . As soon as the wires were cut the lights on top of the fence went out , showing the current was broken . I do not know how we got through the third fence ; the barbed wires cut and scratched us , tearing our clothes to ribbons , but we got through and ran on and on across the half-mile neutral land between the countries till a swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentinel started yelling when we cut the fence , " Halt ! Halt ! " and fired . We did not answer , but ran like h to I lolland . The villagers gathered around and gave us a warm welcome , collecting money to pay our way to Rotterdam . Our whole journey across Belgium , a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles , took us twenty-eight days . We had to make so many detours around towns , crossing rivers , big canals , etc. , that I am sure we went two hundred and twenty-five miles , all afoot . On arrival at Rotterdam the Dutch authorities tried to hold us in a ward boarding-house , but we demanded to sec the American consul and they called him up on the ' phone , and when he vouched for us everything was all right . We were then sent to a first-class hotel . For our first meal we ordered five beefsteaks , and how good they were ! Next day we called on the consul-general , Colonel Listor , who was very kind and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally escorted to the military attache " ' at The Hague , where we had to write out miles and miles of reports , and then we went to the Legation , where the whole thing was repeated . Next the British attachi and Legation had us do the same thing for them . This took five days , and in between writing out reports we were taken out to dinner and given a royal time by every one . We got permission to leave for England on the first convoy , and on the 1st of November landed in England . We went to the American Officers ' Inn , London , and were about to be turned out as tramps , on account of our Dutch clothes , when A. Reese , who was in our squadron at the time I " went west , " recognized us , and then they all fell on our necks and rejoiced with us . Reese told me I had been reported by the bombers as having gone down in flames . It seems they had seen the Hun machine burning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and pals who had " gone west . " My roommate , Lieutenant Bowen , was killed about a week after I went down . Out of the seven American officers in this English squadron , six were casualties ; luckily , three of the six were not dead ; one was wounded and a prisoner , the other a prisoner , and the last ( myself ) wounded and an escaped prisoner . During the week in London King George invited us to Windsor for Iunch and we were royally entertained . was sent to France on some light duty . While there I saw my father ! Brigadier-General T. Q. Donaldson , at Tours . Needless to say , the meeting was a happy one . Shortly after this the armistice was signed and I received permission to go back to the good old U. S. A. , the country that no one can appreciate so well as those who have been away from it .
