txt ' After long delay , Holland has accepted the terms proposed by the War Trade Board and has granted to our Government by charter the use of eighty-two ships which have been lying idle for more than six months at our ports , where their expenses have exceeded $25,0(X),000 . The agreement was signed on the ** in London . Service under the charter is limited to one round trip . Five of the vessels will carry supplies for Switzerland to a French port , and the cargoes of two will be grain for Holland . Trips will be made to Australia and Argentina for wheat , and to Java for sugar . Probably these Dutch ships will bring to us the 100,01 ) 0 tons of Chilean nitrate which our Government has bought for American farmers . They will enter the coast service , and their transatlantic work will include the transportation of 150.000 tons of food for the Belgian Relief Commission . The action taken in London was foreshadowed a few days ago , when the Dutch Government decided to unload several cargoes of cottonseed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through the agency of our Food Administration ? . Only two of the eighty-four ships detained here so long because export licenses were withheld had been released previously . One went to South America . Another , the Nieuw Amsterdam . sailed with a cargo of corn for the Belgians , bound by agreement to return at once . With 2.000 passengers on board , she is now held at Rotterdam because Germany threatens to sink her at sea unless she promises to come back without delay . But if this ship remains abroad , our Government will have the use of all of the other eighty-two , and an addition of 350,00Q tons to the available supply of carriers at a time when all the ships that can be found are needed . It is not yet , publicly known how much grain Holland is to receive , or upon what conditions , concerning exports to Germany , the supplies will be given . Publication in Europe of the terms offered to Norway ' warrants an assumption that Holland was required to stop exporting food to our enemies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark . Holland was told , it is said , that she could have no American fodder for the herds from which Germany has been receiving dairy products and meat . In the negotiations she insisted upon a continuance of this export trade . She would not consent to withhold from Germany even the fish taken in her coast waters , although submarines occasionally sink her fishing boats and kill the men at work on them . Such has also been the fate of many Norwegians while they were catching fish for Germany , and Norway is now unwilling to " offend " our enemies by forbidding the sale of this food to them . Holland has export agreements or treaties with Germany . Our Government undoubtedly has required her to promise that no food received from the United States shall go to Germany in its original form , and , possibly , to stop selling meat and dairy products to that nation . This export trade can not now be defended , for the Dutch people have not enough food for themselves . ?       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
