Teachers and publishers are ready to welcome the effort of that scholar who shall produce an ideal history , in one volume , or at most two , of English literature from Beowulf  | down to the present time . Nor are signs altogether wanting that the appearance of the desired book is near at hand . Good models are to be had in works of the right proportion on other literatures both ancient and modern . One thinks of the " Abridged History of Greek Literature " by Alfred and Maurice Croiset , with its relation to their larger French work in five volumes , this latter being perhaps the best history of any literature in any language . Or one thinks of Mr. J. Wright Duff 's most admirable " Literary History of Rome , " marvellous for its fulness , accuracy , and condensation , and for a grace and interest that never fail ; or of Lanson 's " History of French Literature , " which merits a similar description . Indeed , we may recall the noble work of Ten Brink on English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revise the translation , and to complete the whole , in English , in the light of our present knowledge ? in which case the demand for an ideal book would be satisfied . Walker 's volume ( " Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur von den Aeltesten Zeiten bis zur Gegenwart " ) , so far as I am aware , is the only work on the subject , by a recognized scholar with a technical training , that is intended to be popular , and at the same time follows the entire course of English literature from the beginnings down to Tennyson and Browning . Walker was not an inspired literary critic , as Ten Brink was ; his illustrations , and his estimable motives , hardly make up for the lack of attractiveness in his pages ; nevertheless in scope his book supplies a model . In addition to models , the trained linguist and literary student , who alone could produce the desired work , would have a few literary histories of particular epochs to rest upon , among them the exceptionally good account of Middle English literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would have at his command the " Cambridge History of . English Literature " ( with its bibliographies ) , though the several parts of this must not be employed without discrimination . Nor should one forget Professor Northup 's forthcoming bibliography of bibliographies for the study of English , which will be indispensable to every scholar in this and related subjects . But the ideal historian of English literature will not possess every advantage enjoyed by Lanson , Duff , and the brothers Croiset : he will not find the wheat for his cake so thoroughly ground and bolted as are the materials for a literary history of France or Rome or Greece . Much scholarly attention , it is true , has of late been devoted to the period , or periods , subsequent to the accession of Elizabeth , which Ten Brink some twenty years ago felt unprepared to treat with precision , and so omitted from his plan . Yet from the Elizabethans on , the historian will find many serious gaps in our knowledge , and more than one well-nigh incredible defect in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , has never been properly edited ; and there is no satisfactory edition of Burke . Under these conditions , the historian must divine the hidden course of events through the force of a trained sympathetic insight ; an insight into the nature and genius of the English language and literature as a whole ; an insight nourished in the best traditions of English scholarship , and rigorously disciplined in those parts of the subject ? for example , in Old English ? where the need of precision is most obvious , if not also most attainable . To those who know , it is obvious that the first requisite in the way of external acquirement for the historian of English literature is a thorough knowledge of Old and Middle English . Mr. Mair 's book , in spite of more than one excellence , is not of the sort we have in mind . It is the outgrowth of his handy little volume , " English Literature : Modern , " in the " Home University Library , " which followed a superior work in the same series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Mair 's present work begins with Chaucer , and the author undertakes to defend what is not defensible , the old notion that English literature begins with " The Canterbury Tales . " He is at some pains not to be caught saying just that , but it is the idea he would like to convey . " For the scholars , " he remarks , " our literature may begin earlier ; for the poets it began with him Chaucer . " Is Mr. Mair also among the poets ? And does he think that students of Old English have no feeling for literary and historical values ? Does he forget , too , that , among the poets , Ben Jonson , Milton , Wordsworth , and Tennyson showed some interest in the earliest stages of the language and literature , and were variously indebted to the study of it ? His general mistake , perhaps , lies in uncritically following Professor Legouis , and in coming by himself to project Chaucer on a French and Italian background ; ? on this rather than on the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in Latin as well as in the vernacular literatures . But in particular one can not agree with him when he says that , if we go no farther back in England than Chaucer , " we shall certainly lose nothing which affects what is to come afterwards . " We should miss the Old English " Battle of Brunanburh , " which seems to  | have affected Tennyson , since he modernized it . And when Mr. Mair says that Old English is as distinct from Modern as Modern English from German , he must mean superficially ? as it were , to a schoolboy 's vision . Neither a scholar nor a poet who really knew and loved Old English would say so . We suspect Mr. Mair 's attainments in this part of the field from the time he alludes in his Preface to " the philologist " ( meaning student of linguistics ) and " the professor of dead dialects " ; and we therefore suspect his ability to judge after the fashion of Ten Brink whether the study of Chaucer is much or little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before proceeding to the praise which on some accounts we wish to accord to Mr. Mair 's volume , let us attend to a few other strictures . His plan , he says , " aims at maintaining an individual point of view , at laying stress on ideas and tendencies rather than at recording facts and events , and it does not hesitate to draw generously on standard works of criticism and biography with which students are familiar . " If in several casoa the author derives his opinions from excellent studies , such as the work on Chaucer by Professor Legouis , nevertheless he can not be termed discriminating in the matter of authorities . Thus he is capable of naming as the " two best critics " of Milton one who is good , but not best , Mark Pattison , and " Professor " Walter Raleigh , who is negligible . Where in his hierarchy would Mr. Mair put Addison and Dr. Robert Bridges ? And where would Osgood , Masson , and Verity come in ? This lack of discrimination as to books is on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton " never violates the harmony of sound or sense . " Is that an echo of Matthew Arnold 's description , " In the sure and flawless perfection of his rhythm and diction " ? It was Huxley , was it not , who imagined that Herbert Spencer 's definition of tragedy would be , " a generalization killed by a fact " ? Enter Mr. Mair 's unguarded " never ' ' followed by this irreconcilable fact from the Ninth Book of " Paradise Lost " ( 11.41. ff . ) : " Mee of these Nor skilid nor studious , higher Argument Remaines , sufficient of it self to raise That name , unless an age too late , or cold Climat , or Years damp my intended wing Deprest , and much they may , if all be mine . " Yes , the good Milton sometimes nods , as his best critic , Wordsworth , frankly admits , stating the matter thus : " I could point out to you five hundred passages in Milton upon which labor has been bestowed , and twice five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that I regret the absence of such labor , because no poem contains more proof of skill acquired by practice . " Nor would better critics , I believe , go so far as to say with Mr. Mair that Milton " devised his own subjects , and wrote his own style , " or that " he stands alone , and must be judged alone " ; Mark Pattison , indeed , says something different . Granting that Milton 's soul was like a star , and dwelt apart , we can not judge the poet by himself , since there is no astronomy , or other science , of the individual . His subjects were the common property of England , Holland , and Italy , and his treatment of them was profoundly influenced by the Italian interpretation of ancient poetical theory . To tell the truth , Mr. Mair , as his overpraise evinces , is not in sympathy with Milton , but ? with traditional notions about the poet , unrectified by scholarly observation and comparison of the facts . As a result , coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , he rashly declares that " Milton always argued from himself to mankind at large , " and falls into the vulgar error of associating the Miltonic writings on divorce too closely with Milton 's private life . Are they not , rather , singularly objective , and is there anything better on the subject in English ? The spirit of them is altogether in keeping with the ideal of good manners represented in the speeches of Adam and Eve , almost constantly , in " Paradise Lost , " and constantly in the words and actions of the Hero in " Paradise Regained . " " Manners , " we recall , are one , of the gifts which Wordsworth , good poet and scholar , thinks to be in Milton 's keeping for England . Turning to Shakespeare , we again find Mr. Mair using that dangerous word " never " : " A study of the plots of either the comedies or the tragedies will convince the reader that the orderly faculty of marshalling events has never been so completely shown in the work of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to understand : any other English writer . Well , what about Thackeray in " The Rose and the Ring , " or Fielding in " Tom Jones " ? " What a master of composition Fielding was ! " says Coleridge . " Upon my word , I think the Oedipus Tyrannus , " The Alchemist , ' and Tom Jones ' the three most perfect plots ever planned . " No Shakespearean scholar would have expressed himself as does Mr. Mair ; in the first place , none would put most of the comedies , in the matter of construction , on as high a level as most of the tragedies . And to sum up in the words of Mr. A. C. Bradley on Shakespeare :  | " Nine-tenths of his defects are not ... the errors of an inspired genius , ignorant of art , but the sins of a great but negligent artist " Turning to the pages on Wordsworth , we discover the same bent for overstatement , and for essentially the same sort of threadbare comment as is passed along in certain handbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus : Wordsworth is " a complete innovator " ; " he found his subjects in new places " ; in his earlier years he had a vision of " nature , " which eventually faded , so that only " a few fine things fitfully illumine the enormous and dreary bulk of his later work " ; " if we lost all but the Lyrical Ballads , ' the poems of 1804 misprint for 1807 , and the Prelude , ' and the Excursion , ' Wordsworth 's position as a poet would be no lower than it is now . " Does Mr. Mair realize that he has included threequarters of the poet 's work ? The bulk of what is left is not enormous . The other assertions also need reconsideration . Wordsworth is not a complete innovator : in part he harks back to his favorite " elder poets " ? more especially to Spenser and Milton . Substituting England for Sicily and the Mediterranean , one may say that Wordsworth finds his subjects where Theoeritus found them ; and that is just what he tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his earlier period his imagination was tinged with a neo-Platonism which , while not very good of its kind , still counts as " poetry " with the average reader of the present . That is , when Wordsworth talks about a motion and a spirit " rolling " through various things , people think him inspired , though they may not care for his translation of Michael Angelo 's address " To the Supreme Being , " which contains a very different form of teaching . Wordsworth gradually outgrew his crude naive philosophy , and , drawing his inspiration less and less from neo-Platonism , and more and more from Christianity , produced a body of verse that in workmanship is superior to his earlier attempts . Much of it is likely to attract well-educated readers of subsequent generations , when the doctrine of divine immanence gives way , as it gave way in Wordsworth , to a more artistic conception of the universe . There are not " a few , " but many " fine things " in the " Ecclesiastical Sonnets , " that most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that naturally falls into its place with the writings of Herbert and Keble ; and a critic who aims at maintaining an individual point of view ( which means observing and comparing for himself ) can not afford to treat it as it is treated in ordinary books of criticism and biography . Though he now and then lapses into an overfamiliar style , and though , as we have seen , his judgments lack finality , Mr. Mair on the whole is naturally alert , and expresses things for himself , often with vigor , and sometimes with felicity . He duly insists upon looking at the history of literature in the light of fundamental principles , and on occasion enunciates such doctrine as the following ( pp. 47-48 ) : " The unit of all ordinary kinds of writing is the word , and one is not commonly quarrelled with for using words that have belonged to other people . But the unit of the lyric , like the unit of spoken conversation , is not the word but the phrase . Now in daily human intercourse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and phrases of talk is not commonly supposed to detract from or destroy sincerity . In the crises , indeed , of emotion it must be most people 's experience that the natural speech that rises unbidden and easiest to the lips is something quite familiar and commonplace , some form which the accumulated experience of many generations of separate people has found best for such circumstances or such an occasion . The lyric is in the position of conversation at such a heightened and emotional moment . . . This is not to say that there is no such thing as originality ; a poet is a poet first and most of all because he discovers truths that have been known for ages , as things that are fresh and new and vital for himself. ; ' A word of praise must be given to the sixteen portraits scattered through the volume . The one of Wordsworth ( p. 220 ) , reproducing the sketch by Pickersgill in the Library of St. John 's College , Cambridge , though not well known , is a fortunate choice .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
