txt I do n't know what to say about my flight , except that I 'm here now when I expected to be in New York . It 's hard luck , and , of course , I 'm disappointed . But I 'll make it tomorrow . I got away from Chicago about 6:10 o'clock . and everything was going fine until I got a little past Erie . Then I noticed that gasoline was running out beneath the machine . Something was wrong , of course , and I knew I had to stop and investigate . There was n't any telling how much gas I had lost nor how much I had left to go on . I was right past Erie , but I turned around and went back there because T knew 1 would want to be near a big city and near a. telephone . 1 made an easy landing and jumped out to examine the machine . I found that the nut holding the pipe from the gasoline tank in connection with the carbu'etor had worked loose and gas was flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident to hold up a flight from Chicago to New York , but it held it up all right . A big crowd of people began to gather round atter I had landed , and I got the manager of the Bell Telephone Company to help me . He had an automobile , and I got him to drive me to the nearest telephone . I was nearly a mile , or maybe more , out of the city , and we drove to a grocery store , where I put in calls for Elmer Davis , THE NEW YORK Trams man , and for Charles B. Kirkham , the chief engineer of the Curtiss Company . I 'd left them both in Chicago . I could n't get 111 ' . Davis , but I got Mr. Kirkham , and talked over the situation with him . I wanted to let him - mow where I was and to ask him about what he thought I 'd better try to do ; whether he thought I ought to keep on as far as I could or what 31se . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggested that I could make Buffalo . I was pretty sure I could make Binghainton instead , but after I had started I decided to head for here for two reasons : first , I would have a. place to leave the machine , and second , I would have expert help to start the motor in the morning . You know it 's pretty hard to start an aeroplane motor like mine . That 's one reason I was delayed so long ' in Erie . There were plenty of people around , but there were n't many who knew much about aeroplanes . First off it was hard to get the gasoline I wanted and had to have . When I finally bought fifty gallons in town I had to have it carted out in a truck and poured into my tank . The minutes flew . Time goes fast when you 've got a lot to do and are all alone doing it . Fixing the motor was a cinch . It just needed a turn of the wrench to take up on that loose nut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't imagine how it ever came to go wrong . It 's the first time I ever had an accident of the kin &; Of course I found the trouble at once , for all I had to do was to trace up the leaking gasoline to its source , and I fixed It - at once , but it ' was some time before I was ready to start out again . Then I had to crank that motor single handed . I got some of the crowd to hold the machine and I got a man who knew something about automobiles to throw The switch on and off as I craipted . But even at that it took me a lot of time When I got going again I made good speed , just as I had the whole trip . No , I do n't think there was a/l/ling exceptional about my time . It was about the rate the machine usually flies , though the wind helped a. little . There was a southwest wind blowing , and it aided some . I flew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the better wind . It was steadier up above , not sif puffy . It was pretty rough down below , and it was n't any place to fly If you wanted to make speed . At , the rate I was going I 'd have made Governors Island before 4 o'clock . It seems a shame that a. little thing like a nut had to atop me , and I 'm pretty disappointed , but it could n't be helped . My machine is all right now , and I 'll finish the trip tomorrow pretty fast . In fact , there was n't a thing the matter with the machine all day except that loose nut , and after I had that made fast the machine was as good as the day we finished the final test . It was only a question of how far I could fly before darkness made flying and landing too dangerous to attempt . Only a couple of hours more of daylight would have landed me in New York . Now I 'll have to finish it another day I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I figure I ought to reach Governors Island about 9 o'clock , or perhaps a little before . I 'll come right down a-flying.
