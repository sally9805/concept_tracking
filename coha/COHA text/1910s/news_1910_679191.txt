Roosevelt is here , and with his coming the volcano of dissension which has been sputtering within the Republican State organization ever since he started to run out the bosses ' has split wide open . The situation is appalling from a Republican standooint . Old political allies are ? inflicting wounds upon each other which can never be healed . To-morrow 's convention will open with a battle which in savagery will surpass anything in the history of party politics in this State . Col. Roosevelt will have the votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but before he will get a chance for the rollcall which will mean the death knell of the Old Guard he will have to hear himself accused as few men have ever been accused to their faces in a political convention . He will have his victory , at a cost which he fully realizes , and is quite prepared to pay : but half the men who will support the Rough Rider are fearfully wondering where it is all going to end . To-night Col. Roosevelt finds himself face to face with the proposition of framing a ticket and a platform which the majority of the delegates who are supporting them will accept . Their platform ideas are already clearly defined except as to direct primaries , but in the matter I of candidates they are all up in the air . ' At midnight none of them will venture an opinion as to candidates . Bitter Attack on Roosevelt . The Old Guard still retain the control of the party machinery , and before they turn it over to Col.

When Chairman of the State- Committee Woodruff calls the convention to order it will not be with the usual perfunctory banging of the gavel , but with a speech which his friends say will be a political swan song long to be rememi bered .

When he is through Woodruff ? will Iscormize Abraham Gruber , who has prepared an oratorical bomb to hurl into the Roosevelt camp that is characterized by those who have read it as something j that no man could keep still and listen to . Roosevelt ' Must Listen . ' Col. Roosevelt will be sitting there In the front row of the convention hall to listen to all of these speeches , and he will have to swallow it until his turn comes . Then he can ride rough shod over those ' who denounce him and his friends , while the Old Guard , beaten but defiant , will tell him to work out his own and the party 's salvation In the situation he has created . From the moment of his arrival this afternoon Col. Roosevelt was more than busy and in his happiest mood . " lay George , this is bully . " he said . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of the old days when I was first elected to the Assembly . " ' Ho put in the afternoon in conferences with his supporters among the progressive leaders , getting reports as to the situation everywhere and learning the sentiment of the progressives on the subject of the platform and the Governorship . After dinner lie held a reception on t he porch and more than divided the crowd with the stormy meeting of the State Committee . Then he went into a long conference with Senator Root , who just arrived . At all points Col. Roosevelt emphasized his intention to take the fight against the bosses all down the line , but no compromise anywhere . Governorship ' Not Decided . It was all Roosevelt about the United States Hotel . His followers as well as his antagonists were anxious only to find out what he was going to do . His declaration that it is to be an open convention was put to the test at once by his own friends , who all wanted to know what he thought  --  and desired before expressing opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not stated . He . has said that he understands that an attempt is , to be made to stampede the convention for him and make him take the nomination for Governor , and he has said most positively that he will defeat any such effort . Of the many candidates who have kiln mentioned for the nomination the boom of Congressman William S. Bennet is still the most active here . There is a decided impression abroad to-night , however , that the nomination will go to an up-State man , of whom there have been many excellent names mentioned and each hour is adding to the list . It also seems to-night that if it is finally decided to give the nomination to a New- York City man Henry Stimson stands the best chance of being the one the lightning will hit lie is known as a strong personal friend of Col. Roosevelt . and at this time that seems to be likely to count for more than any other one thing . Chairman Griscom of the New York County Committee , who fully realizes the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but is as firm as ever in his belief that it is necessary for the ultimate salvation of the Republican Party . " The Old Guard will make their last stand to-morrow . " he said . " and then we will go on with the fight on new party lines and do our best to win . What is happening here had to happen . " Barnes Renews Attack . The temper of the Old Guard is shown by this statement issued at midnight by William Barnes . Jr. : Heretofore a Republican convention has always been regarded as a conclave in theory at least . where representatives and other members of the party gather to consult each other as to candidates and pot= fries that ought to be selected or adopted . This is the first occasion where such a meeting is sought to be converted into an occasion for the exploitation o : one individual whoAc personality has been crowded into this affair by arbitrary methods , and whose elevation it is sought to accomplish by the totally uncalled for humiliation of the Vice Presid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 11 the more extraordinary , since it is known that the individual in whose behalf it is sought to howl over every precedent has openly proclaimed himi-rif as the champion of doctrines subversi.e not only of every Republican prineiple and tradition , but which are rightfully regarded as a menace to public order and security . The mingling of Republicans in calm and orderly fashion , the fruitful and friendly discussion of candidates and measures have been swept aside on this occasion which . it is sought to convert into a form of " greatest show on earth . " whose chief attraction lends himself to every device known to the most industrious press agent . and not for the purpose of building up or conserving any of the ideals dear to Republicans . but apparently to enable a little coterie of manipulators to seize the reins of party management in defiance of constructive sentiment and of the masses of the voters n hose interests are butchered to make a Roman holiday . All familiar and honored methods of procedure are being trampled on : nobody can tell at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west perforrnam ? es will pull themselves together and throw off the yoke that threatens them . just as the blight of Bm. - anism killed the sober sons of the Democratic Party at Chicago in is98 . It Is better realized to-day . at all events , than It was yesterday , what the danger is that lies behind the present ruthless attack that is being made upon the ark of the Republican covenant . ' hat the Platform Will Say . The platform to be adopted by the procressives will recite the good things 111 legislation that have been accomplished by the Taft Administration and give the President a generous indorsement along that line ; it will make a similar statement about the accomplishments of the Hughes administration and praise the Republican Party for both . It will get over the graft scandal In the Legislature by pointing out that the Republican Party has turned its own rascals out , and will then denounce corruption generally . It will declare for direct primary nominations , a short . broad statement of adhesion to the general principle , and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employes ' compensation . In general it will slide over the troublesome points in the Republican record lightly , emphasize the fighting points in the record . and elsewhere will make promises for the future to cover all defects in the past . Committee Slaps Roosevelt Men . At the meeting of the State Committee to-night , at which the lie was readily passed , the Old Guard leaders were supported in their contention that no " deceit or misrepresentation " had been practiced in the selection by the State Committee of Vice President Sherman for Temporary Chairman of the convention . This action had been expected , but some of the members v:he-had voted with the progressives at the meeting at ' which Mr. Sherman " waschosen and whose delegates had been counted for Col. Roosevelt at to-morrow 's session of the convention voted with the Old Guard to-night . While this was a direct slap at the Roosevelt following , it was stated after the meeting by such men as Congressman J. Sloat Fassett that the action of the committee should not be taken as an indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled that State Superintendent of Prisons Collins is to be Chairman of the Roosevelt Republican State Committee . The bosses whom Roosevelt is going to put out of business to-morrow wonder at the strange fate that has wrought this future for their old pal ,
