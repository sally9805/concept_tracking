A room in the sheriff 's house which is used for conferences . At the rear is a door into the hall , at the left a door leads to an adjoining room . There is also a door at the right , going to the corridor which connects this house with the jail . LAWYER and PRISONER are found in heated conversation . The prisoner , an attractive young man , is seated , and has just turned away from the LAWYER , irritated . MR . FOSTER Do you know that murder is no laughing matter ? WALLACE Well , was I laughing ? MR . FOSTER Shoots it at him . Where were you on the night of October 25 ? PRISONER sits like one who never means to speak again . Your silence shields a woman 's honor . Do you know what 's going to be said of you ? You 're going to be called old-fashioned ! A worried look flits over the prisoner 's face . A man will not tell where he is because it involves a woman 's honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think she 's worth it ? PRISONER rises angrily.Yes , get red in the face , I should think you would . Blush . Blush for shame . Shame of having loved a woman who 'd let a man face death to shield her own honor ! p. 3 WALLACE You do n't know what you 're talking about . MR . FOSTER It 's just like a woman , the cowards . That 's what I most despise in women . Afraid they wo n't be looked upon as the pure noble sensitive souls they spend their lives trying to make us believe they are . Sickening ! WALLACE There are things you do n't understand . MR . FOSTER Oh , yes , I do . I suppose she 's got a husband . I suppose he 'd divorce her . Then she would n't be asked out to tea quite so often . Good Lord  --  die for something real ! WALLACE You and I have different ideals , Mr. Foster . There are things we do n't discuss . MR . FOSTER There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this romantic course , then at least we will have to get something out of that WALLACE What do you mean ? MR . FOSTER Simply that public feeling has got to swing toward you or the jury will say you murdered Erwalt . If we ca n't have an alibi , let us by all means have a hero ! WALLACE Outraged . Have you given out a story to the newspapers ? MR . FOSTER Drawing paper from his pocket . Very delicately done . " A life for a life . " Is n't that moving ? " While Gordon Wallace languishes in his cell , some woman is safe in a shielded home . Charged with the murder of John Erwalt , young Wallace fails to cut his chain of circumstantial evidence with an alibi . Where was Gordon Wallace on the night of October 25 ? He maintains a dogged silence . Behind that silence rests a woman 's honor "  --  and so on , at some length . p. 4 WALLACE You had no right to give out a story without my consent ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I ca n't get your consent for saving your life , then , my young friend , I shall save it without your consent . Pardon my rudeness . WALLACE How will this save it ? MR . FOSTER How little romantic young men know the romantic sex . Wives  --  including , I hope , jurors ' wives  --  will cry , " Do n't let that chivalrous young man die ! " Women just love to have their honor shielded . It is very touching to them . WALLACE Mr. Foster , I tell you again , I dislike your attitude toward women ! Laugh at me if you will , but I have respect and reverence for women . I believe it is perfectly true that men must guard them . Call me a romantic young fool if it pleases you , but I have had a mother  --  a sister  --  sweetheart . Yes , I am ready to die to shield a woman 's honor ! As he says this the door slowly opens and a woman steps in . SHIELDED ONE No ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at her . She has breeding , poise  --  obviously she has stepped out of a world where women are shielded . She maintains a front of her usual composure , but there is an intensity  --  an excitement  --  which indicates she is feeling some big new thing . LAWYER looks from her to the PRISONER , who is staring at the WOMAN . p. 5 MR . FOSTER To WOMAN . Oh  --  you 've come ? SHIELDED ONE Firmly , but with emotion . I have come . WALLACE I do n't understand . MR . FOSTER You were not willing to let him die ? SHIELDED ONE No . MR . FOSTER Good . This young man  --  He pauses , embarrassed , for it does not seem a thing to say to this ladywas with you on the night of October 25 ? SHIELDED ONE Yes . WALLACE Why , no I was n't . MR . FOSTER There is no use , Gordon , in trying to keep the lady from doing what she has apparently determined to do . SHIELDED ONE No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to do . MR . FOSTER For my part , I respect you for it . Then you are prepared to testify that on the night of October 25 Gordon Wallace was with you from twelve o'clock midnight till eight next morning ? SHIELDED ONE A little falteringly , yet fervent . Yes . p. 6 MR . FOSTER Was with you  --  continuously ? SHIELDED ONE Yes . MR . FOSTER Your name is  --  ? He takes out his note-book . WALLACE In distress . Do n't give him your name ! He 'll use it ! I tell you this is all a mistake . I do n't know this lady . I never saw her before . To the WOMAN . You must n't do this ! SHIELDED ONE Proudly , and with relief . I have done it ! MR . FOSTER And as I said , madam , I greatly respect you for doing it . You are , if I may say so , unlike most of your sex . Now  --  your name ? SHIELDED ONE This is not easy for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan you live at  --  ? A noise in the hall . I fear some one is coming in . Will you just step in here ? He shows her into the room at the left . They hear the corridor door open and turn . A woman is coming in  --  rather plump , middle-aged  --  a pleasant , motherly looking woman . She looks from the LAWYER to the PRISONER , moves to get a better look at the young man , who becomes nervous under this scrutiny ; then she seems to have it straight in her mind , nods pleasantly . p. 7 MOTHERLY ONE Cheerily . Good morning . MR . FOSTER Good morning . MOTHERLY ONE To PRISONER . Good morning . WALLACE Not cheerily . Good morning . MOTHERLY ONE There was no one out there , so I just walked right in . LAWYER nods . I thought you might be glad to see me . MR . FOSTER Oh  --  we are . To GORDON . Are n't we ? MOTHERLY ONE I suppose I am in the right place . MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things . MOTHERLY ONE Is it the place to tell the truth about Gordon Wallace ? MR . FOSTER It seems to be . MOTHERLY ONE Very cheerfully . Well , then , on the night of October 25 that young man  --  Steps for a better look at the PRISONERthis young man  --  was with me . MR . FOSTER From twelve o'clock midnight until eight next morning ? p. 8 MOTHERLY ONE Placidly . From twelve o'clock midnight till eight next morning . She takes a muffler from her bag and sits down and begins to knit . MR . FOSTER Was with you  --  continuously ? MOTHERLY ONE Oh , certainly  --  continuously . She knits serenely on . MR . FOSTER Well  --  Gordon . MOTHERLY ONE Pleasantly . It seems that mufflers get longer and longer . Looking up at LAWYER . Does n't it ? MR . FOSTER Why  --  perhaps they do . But  --  you are willing to leave your name and address ? MOTHERLY ONE Certainly , I 'm willing to leave my name and address . What else would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone first . Rises . It will be better to let them know that I 'll probably be late getting home for lunch . MR . FOSTER Is about to open door of the room in which the SHIELDED ONE is waiting . No  --  there 's some one in there . Here Going to the door at the other side of the room , I 'll show you how to get through to the jail phone . p. 9 MOTHERLY ONE The jail ! But we 'll soon have you out of jail . She goes , giving the young man an encouraging smile . The LAWYER steps out with her . The young man hears the rear door opening  --  this door into the hall has a slight squeak  --  starts nervously , looks around to see a young woman come in . In a keen , cool amused way she is staring at him . He turns away , petulantly hitching his chair . She moves where she can see him better , takes from her bag a newspaper picture , looks from it to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles at him . He looks like one at bay . Enter LAWYER . Sees what is going on , smiles . MR . FOSTER On the night of October 25  --  ? SCORNFUL ONE To LAWYER . I understand that down here a man is about to die for a woman 's honor . MR . FOSTER He had some such thing in mind . SCORNFUL ONE To LAWYER . Now you ca n't get away with that . Sorry to upset your plans , but the death seems uncalled for . On the night of October 25  --  Gordon Wallace was with me . MR . FOSTER From twelve o'clock midnight till eight next morning ? SCORNFUL ONE From twelve o'clock midnight until eight next morning . p. 10 MR . FOSTER Rather feebly . Con-tinuously ? SCORNFUL ONE In an off hand voice . Continuously . MR . FOSTER Well  --  well , Gordon , I begin to understand why you hesitated to tell the truth about that momentous night . Rise and thank the lady , Gordon ; it would seem the least you could do would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to GORDON , in rushes a fussily dressed hysterical woman and throws her arms around the LAWYER 's neck . SILLY ONE Darling ! I can not let you die for me ! MR . FOSTER Trying to free himself . Pardon me , madam , but  --  SILLY ONE Gordon ! You call me madam after that night together . Oh my beloved , when I think of those hours I lay in your arms  --  MR . FOSTER Pardon me , but you never lay in  --  SILLY ONE I know . Ah  --  I understand . You pretend not to know me . You would die to shield me  --  but you shall not ! You can not escape me ! MR . FOSTER Still unsuccessful in freeing himself . Apparently not . But permit me to tell you , you are making a mistake . p. 11 SILLY ONE No ! I am not making a mistake ! You shall not die for me . MR . FOSTER I really do n't intend to  --  if I can help it . SILLY ONE Love is so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold . When I think of that night  --  October 25  --  Sinks into a chair . MR . FOSTER After settling his collar . Well , Gordon , have you a choice ? Pause . You see you did n't understand women as well as you thought . WALLACE Fiercely . Neither did you ! The SHERIFF 'S BOY comes in . BOY While I was over at the bank , women came . MR . FOSTER Yes , I know . BOY Looking at the two women in the room . But more women . PRISONER starts in terror . Six women are out there . WALLACE Do n't let them in ! MR . FOSTER Tell the ladies we shall not need them . Thank them for coming . BOY goes out . To PRISONER . Well , come now . What shall we do with this embarrassment of  --  generosity ? You see dying for a woman 's honor is n't as easy as you might think . It even looks as though there were a sort of conspiracy against it . p. 12 WALLACE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FOSTER Are you sure you can help it ? The BOY comes back , looking worried . BOY Some of those women wo n't go away . I do n't know what to do with them . MR . FOSTER No , it 's not a matter the young can cope with . He goes out with the BOY . The amused young WOMAN sits looking the PRISONER over , to his embarrassment and final irritation . SCORNFUL ONE So you were thinking of dying for a woman 's honor . He says nothing . Now do you think that 's a very nice way to treat the lady ? He turns away petulantly . Seems to me you should think of her feelings . Have you a right to ruin her life ? WALLACE Startled into speech . Ruin her life ? SCORNFUL ONE Why certainly . A life that somebody has died for is practically a ruined life . For how are you going to think of it as anything but  --  a life that somebody has died for ? She pulls her chair to a more confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's honor is only about one thing , and that man 's honor is about everything but that thing ? After waiting for the answer which does not come . Now woman 's honor means woman 's virtue . But this lady for whom you propose to die has no virtue . p. 13 WALLACE Springing up . Please be careful what you say . SCORNFUL ONE I 'm being very careful . I 'm thinking it out just as carefully as I can . The night of October 25 , or at some time previous to that , she lost her virtue , and you propose to die to keep us from knowing about this loss . Now , it has happened , has n't it ? On the night of October 25 , from twelve o'clock midnight till eight next morning continuously she lost her virtue . You are n't dying to keep her virtuous . I fancy few lives have been laid upon that altar . But you 're dying to keep us from knowing she is what she is . Dear me , it seems rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble beyond words . SCORNFUL ONE There 's where you 're going to get your approbation . The MOTHERLY ONE now returns from her telephoning . She looks at the SILLY WOMAN , then at the SCORNFUL ONE  --  these two stand looking one another up and down . SCORNFUL ONE In her amused manner . Can it be that we are two souls with but a single thought ? MOTHERLY ONE In her mothering voice . Perhaps we are two hearts that beat as one . They stand there a moment not knowing what to do ; then , still uncertainly , they sit down , stealing glances at one another . Finally the SCORNFUL ONE smiles . p. 14 SCORNFUL ONE We might draw lots . SILLY ONE Love conquereth all things . SCORNFUL ONE Even the female brain . MOTHERLY ONE I wonder why you others came . SCORNFUL ONE Why did you come ? MOTHERLY ONE Oh , I have children of my own . I thought , he 's just a nice boy , and probably she 's just some nice girl afraid of her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful pity to let him die , or even spend a lot of time in prison . I said to myself , it would be just like a lot of men to fuss around about a woman 's honor and really let it hurt somebody . So I decided  --  well , I 'll go . What harm can it do me ? Resumes her knitting . You see , I 'm in the habit of trying to save lives . I do nursing  --  practical nursing  --  and I did n't happen to be on a case just now , so I thought  --  well , I 'll just take this case . Some of the folks I nurse for may be shocked  --  but good sensible nurses are n't so easy to get . Of course my children may be upset about it  --  but they 're awful nice children , and when they 're a little older probably they 'll be pleased to think their mother did n't want a nice boy to die . Drops her knitting . I wonder if she will come . Looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE I wonder . SILLY ONE " She " is here . SCORNFUL ONE Oh , it 's not you . You thought it was the lawyer you were with . Anyway , people who do things do n't make so much fuss about them . MOTHERLY ONE Whose interest has not been diverted . I think she will have to come . The door of the room into which the SHIELDED ONE was shown opens quietly and without the others being aware of it the SHIELDED ONE is standing in the doorway , bringing with her that sense of the ordered protected life out of which she has stepped . SCORNFUL ONE I 'm sure I do n't see how she could ever think of staying away . I hate a coward . MOTHERLY ONE Some women think a great deal about their honor . I think usually it 's women who are n't very well  --  or who have n't much else to take up their time . Impulsively the SHIELDED ONE steps forward as if to speak . Hearing her , they turn , and in their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 've come ? The PRISONER who to get away from the women gives the impression of being crowded into a corner , also turns and rises . p. 16 WALLACE To SHIELDED ONE , rather crossly . Please go away ! SCORNFUL ONE O  --  h WALLACE Ca n't you see there is no need for your staying ? SHIELDED ONE Quietly . There is need of it . She sits down , the other women still surveying her . MOTHERLY ONE It 's true we are n't all needed . Who will be best  --  ? To SCORNFUL ONE . Tell me , why are you here ? SCORNFUL ONE Well , you see for myself I have n't any honor to worry about , and have n't had for some time . So I thought , if the sacrifice of a woman 's honor is going to save a man 's life , let me , who have none , nobly sacrifice mine . MOTHERLY ONE What do you mean , you have n't had any honor for some time ? SCORNFUL ONE Oh , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen . MOTHERLY ONE Kindly . Do you miss it ? SCORNFUL ONE Well  --  yes ; sometimes when I 'm tired I might like to slump back into it . You see honor camouflages so many things  --  stupidity , selfishness  --  greed , lust , avarice , gluttony . So without it you 're almost forced to be a decent sort  --  and that 's sometimes wearing . In another voice . But I 'll tell you why I 'm really here ! When men begin to sob around about woman 's honor they get my goat . That lawyer  --  he thought he was going to get away with it . Why , woman 's honor would have died out long ago if it had n't been for men 's talk about it . p. 17 MOTHERLY ONE I suppose it really has to be kept up , as long as it gives men such noble feelings . SCORNFUL ONE That man  --  the one when I was seventeen  --  he 's that sort . He would be of course . Why , this instant his eyes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about saving a woman 's honor . Under her breath . Gee ! MOTHERLY ONE With a diffident glance at the SHIELDED ONE . If she is here , she must be feeling quite upset . If she cares enough about her honor to have held back this long  --  it ca n't be easy to let it go . SCORNFUL ONE She 'll be better off without it . MOTHERLY ONE I do n't know . You see , she 's had it quite a while . She 's used to it . I was thinking  --  The door opens and a brisk young woman dressed in cheap , up-to-the-minute clothes darts in . All turn and look at her , continue to stare . Something in this scrutiny becomes disconcerting . MERCENARY ONE While he was busy with the other women  --  I just slipped by . Is this  --  ? Sees the young man , now huddled in terror . SCORNFUL ONE Sit down and wait your turn . p. 18 MERCENARY ONE Are all of you ahead of me ? SCORNFUL ONE Your number seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause in which they continue to look at her in this unusual way  --  she finally rather indignantly settles her coat , her hat , assuring herself nothing is the matter with her . MOTHERLY ONE You look young for this . MERCENARY ONE Well , if you 'll excuse my saying so , the same objection ca n't be made to some of you . SCORNFUL ONE What are you here for ? MERCENARY ONE Oh , I guess I 'm here for about the same reason all of you are here . MOTHERLY ONE But we are here for different reasons . MERCENARY ONE Say , what are you tryin ' to put over on me ? Suppose I think you 're here for your health ? Or out of kindness ? Or to show your great beauty ? Hard-ly . Anybody not feeble-minded could dope out why you 're sitting here like owls . SCORNFUL ONE Well  --  why ? MERCENARY ONE Oh , not for money , of course . She has horrified them all . p. 19 MOTHERLY ONE I 'm sorry you said that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say  --  I do n't like the atmosphere of this place . SCORNFUL ONE We do n't like it as well as we did . MERCENARY ONE A business proposition is a business proposition . What a man needs and can pay for  --  SILLY ONE Rising and wringing her hands . I really must ask you  --  Love is so beautiful ! MERCENARY ONE Well , suppose it is ? What 's that got to do with it ? MOTHERLY ONE You seem hard for one so young . MERCENARY ONE I may be hard , but I 'm not a nut . SCORNFUL ONE Woman 's honor does n't play much part in your young life , does it ? Or woman 's self-respect , either . MERCENARY ONE Rising . Say , you think you can sit there and insult me ? I do n't know what you are , but I 'll have you know I 'm an honest working girl ! I heard they were going to take on another stenographer down here , but I do n't like the atmosphere of this place . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a misunderstanding . Ah , life is paved with misunderstanding . MOTHERLY ONE It will be said we did this for money . SCORNFUL ONE Oh , a great deal will be said . If you care about what 's said you 'd better follow the honest working girl out that door . MOTHERLY ONE What 's said makes an awful difference in some people 's lives . Her eyes turn toward the SHIELDED ONE . SCORNFUL ONE They do n't know how much difference until they 've heard it said . She too looks at the SHIELDED ONE . MOTHERLY ONE You get made into one thing and then it 's not easy to be another . And as the honest working girl hinted , some of us are n't as young as  --  we 'd like to be . SCORNFUL ONE Age should n't discourage one . It 's never too late to mend . The door swings , the women look expectantly around ; the unfortunate young man , whose face has been buried in his hands , looks round in terror . They wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If " she " is here , and really minds losing her honor  --  well , she could just go home . SILLY ONE rises , simpers , sits down again . We ca n't all lose our honor . It might do the young man more harm than good . It 's different with you  --  To SCORNFUL ONEyou had an early start . And then you 've got character . You do n't need honor to lean on . p. 21 SHIELDED ONE Breaking her silence with simple intensity . What is woman 's honor ? SCORNFUL ONE A thing men talk about . MOTHERLY ONE A safe corner . SILLY ONE A star to guide them ! SHIELDED ONE Very earnestly . Guide them where ? SCORNFUL ONE Yes , where ? Many a woman who 's guided has n't guided anywhere . SHIELDED ONE Passionately . Are n't we something more than things to be noble about ? SCORNFUL ONE Of course what we 've really been is kind . We have not deprived them of the pleasures of being noble . If we do it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHIELDED ONE Troubled but determined . Ca n't we put something in its place , so they wo n't be too desolate and yet we wo n't be so  --  SCORNFUL ONE Bored . MOTHERLY ONE If we could only get them noble about something else . I should really hate to take it from them entirely . It 's like giving up smoking or drinking . You have to do it gradually , and there should be something to put in its place . p. 22 SCORNFUL ONE If we could only think up a new vice for them . MOTHERLY ONE They have all those . SHIELDED ONE Oh , I hope you women can work out some way to free us from men 's noble feelings about it ! I speak for all the women of my  --  Hesitatesunder-world , all those others smothered under men 's lofty sentiments toward them ! I wish I could paint for you the horrors of the shielded life . Says " shielded " as if it were " shameful . " I know you would feel something must be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your sisters ? Our honor has been saved so many times . We are tired . And so when I read in the paper this morning that woman 's honor was being saved again  --  SCORNFUL ONE Excitedly going to her . Read in the paper ? Then you 're not  --  the one ? SHIELDED ONE Not that one , but  --  Slowly the door opens and a woman comes in  --  comes with a strange quiet . She droops , she has a queer passivity  --  she is unaccountably forceful . Gives a sense of one who has been cheated and is going to be cheated no more . She is scarcely aware of the other women . Her eyes , dead , or rather dogged with life , go to the unfortunate young man . He has turned to look at her ; he is not able to look away . p. 23 SCORNFUL ONE Nervously . Are you a stenographer ? CHEATED ONE Not interested in this . No . In her dogged way she advances upon the PRISONER . He is afraid . She sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . MOTHERLY ONE Low . I wonder if she is here . SCORNFUL ONE I wonder . SHIELDED ONE With an effort bringing herself and the others back to her . But do n't turn against me because I 'm not this particular woman . What a detail that is . I am  --  those victims of men 's dreadful  --  Turns away her faceneed for nobility . I 'd rather die than go back to it ! Help me to lead another life ! SCORNFUL ONE Fervently . We must lift her up . MOTHERLY ONE We will find a place for her in the great good world outside the shielded life . SHIELDED ONE Then you others go , and I will stay . MOTHERLY ONE and SCORNFUL ONE rise and move to the door . p. 24 SILLY ONE I will give my life for yours , my sister ! SCORNFUL ONE No you wo n't . I 'll have nothing to do with saving you . You deserve nothing better than woman 's honor . Come with us . But at the door these three stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to her . Are n't you coming with us ? CHEATED ONE Without raising her eyes . No . SCORNFUL ONE Why not ? CHEATED ONE I shall stay . MOTHERLY ONE Perhaps she is here . And if " she " is here  --  then we have not the right to leave her . Indicating the SHIELDED ONE . SCORNFUL ONE To CHEATED ONE . Tell us : are you the woman Gordon Wallace was with on the night of October 25 ? CHEATED ONE Yes . MOTHERLY ONE Of course we 've all said that . SCORNFUL ONE But she says it in a different way . MOTHERLY ONE To SHIELDED ONE . I am afraid that you will have to leave with us . It seems she has the right . These four move to the door . p. 25 SHIELDED ONE Thinking of it just in time . But do you think she has the right just because she is the one ? To consider this , they go back and sit down . SILLY ONE Leave me ! SCORNFUL ONE Wickedly inspired . Suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why  --  the more I think about it  --  the better I like it . To the other women . Yes , come ! To the young man . This is the lady you were going to die for ! SHIELDED ONE Distressed . But , no ! What can it do for her ? And how , through her , can we reach my poor sisters smothered under woman 's honor ? I insist upon it ! I am the one ! CHEATED ONE Suddenly turning upon her . You are not the one ! MOTHERLY ONE Now I think , to avoid feeling between you two , I had better stay . I 'm a nurse , and a mother , and I keep coming back to the idea these things are needed . SCORNFUL ONE No , you have too many other things to do . I am the one to remain . I am  --  peculiarly fitted for it . SHIELDED ONE You are not fitted for it at all . There is no one less fitted for it than you . p. 26 SCORNFUL ONE How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need it . Woman 's honor never hurt you . SCORNFUL ONE Reluctantly accepting this . To PRISONER . Are you acquainted with this woman ? Indicates CHEATED ONE . WALLACE No . SCORNFUL ONE Then why are you so afraid of her ? WALLACE I 'm not  --  But he is forced to meet the smoldering eye of the CHEATED ONE ; he can not look away . SHIELDED ONE Almost in tears . But you were going to help me lead a better life . And now you stand here quibbling over a petty question of fact , when the whole great question of escape from woman 's honor is at stake ! Oh , is it true that women will not help one another ? That they are hard and self-seeking ? She breaks down ; MOTHERLY ONE goes to comfort her . SILLY ONE My heart is full  --  SCORNFUL ONE Your heart is full of a simpering parrot ! The LAWYER returns . p. 27 MR . FOSTER Ladies  --  ladies  --  quarreling ? I 'm sorry to find you in this mood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at some understanding . SCORNFUL ONE To SILLY ONE . I wish you 'd go home . We might arrive at something if we did n't have you on our backs . MR . FOSTER Now why must women always dislike each other ? MOTHERLY ONE In her motherly way . If I were you I 'd try not to talk much . MR . FOSTER Why not ? SCORNFUL ONE She has a kind heart . Now I  --  I 'd let you talk . MR . FOSTER Sometimes it seems quite as well not to try to follow women . SCORNFUL ONE Sometimes even better . MR . FOSTER Well now , Ladies , let us drop personal dissentions for the moment . This unfortunate young man , Mr. Wallace , is much moved by your generosity . He had made up his mind to die for woman 's honor . Now it seems he is not to do so  --  a change of plan to which he has not yet adjusted himself . His perturbation makes him unequal to selecting the lady who was with him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around nervously . So  --  I would like to get your feeling . Since it seems unnecessary for all of you to have been with the young man on the night of October 25  --  Again door swings . p. 28 WALLACE In a rasped voice . Could that door be closed ? It makes me  --  nervous . MOTHERLY WOMAN closes the door . MR . FOSTER Now , doubtless you will agree with me that we should always eliminate waste . If a woman 's honor is to be sacrificed , may I without indelicacy inquire who would sacrifice least ? SHIELDED ONE Firmly . I would . MR . FOSTER Weakly . You would ? CHEATED ONE In a voice dull as destiny . The rest of you can talk as long as you like . I shall stay . She rises and takes firm hold of the unfortunate young man 's chair . MR . FOSTER Well , there seems something final about that . MOTHERLY ONE Tell us , are you the one ? CHEATED ONE I am the one to stay . SCORNFUL ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  CHEATED ONE Passion flaming through sullenness . Cheat ? Cheat ? You say to me , do n't cheat ? I do n't cheat . I 've been cheated . Cheated out of my chance to have a man I wanted by a man who would have what he wanted . Then he saved my woman 's honor . Married me and cheated me out of my life . I 'm just something to be cheated . That 's the way I think of myself . Until this morning . Until I read about Gordon Wallace . Then I saw a way to get away from myself . It 's the first thing I ever wanted to do that I 've done . You 'll not cheat me out of this . Do n't you try ! p. 29 SHIELDED ONE But she is thinking of it in just a personal way . CHEATED ONE That 's why I stay . SHIELDED ONE But think of my poor sisters ! All those unfortunate women  --  CHEATED ONE The only unfortunate woman I 'll think about is myself . SHIELDED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman she 'll think about  --  MOTHERLY ONE Approaching CHEATED ONE . Now we really must ask you  --  SILLY ONE Love is so beautiful ! SCORNFUL ONE You ca n't cheat just because you 've been cheated . CHEATED ONE Inflamed  --  incoherent . You say cheat to me again ? You say cheat to  --  MR . FOSTER Stepping in to pacify . Ladies  --  ladies . Surely there must be a way out of the difficulty . Perhaps we can work out some way to  --  SCORNFUL ONE To save both of them through Gordon Wallace !
