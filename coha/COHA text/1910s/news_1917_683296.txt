txt Hitherto the demand has been for more power for the Interstate Commerce Commission . More power has been given repeatedly , but without the expected benefits . Always there remained something not included in the power given . Now there is a different appeal for the Commission . It needs help , and the House has passed the bill to appoint two additional Commissioners and to enable the Commission to divide itself into sections , as courts divide themselves into parts . The divisions are to have power to act as and for the Commission , subject to appeal to the full Commission. - ' This is to take the place of the present method of appointing agents to take - testimony and report to the Commission for its decision . There ' are two reasons for thinking , that the bill is desirable . One is that the Commission : is overworked . In 1905 there were 65 formal proceedings before the Com-mission . In 1916 there were 1,215 . There were 195,235 pages of testimony offered last year . The first Chairman ? of the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways of the - United States as a whole . The impossible task has been attempted and the machinery has visibly broken down .. No seven members are capable of acting as judges upon the merits of over a thousand cases a year . It would be impossible if the Commissioners merely acted upon the cases brought and argued before them . It is doubly impossible when the Commission attempts to exercise powers of initiative and administer the rail . ways instead of judging their acts . The deterioration of the Commission 's procedure is evident upon a comparison of its first report with its last . The first report is a deliberate and careful Jimsideration of questions of principle . The later re . ports have been drowned in details , which have prevented due deliberation upon increasingly important tasks . In the earlier days the Com- , * mission did nothing which was not approved in advance . Now it can hardly do anything which is not received critically . If the process continues , the Commission Is In the way of meeting the fate of , the Commerce Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission should be strengthened . Appointments to the Commission have been so few that there has been a survival of the original anti-railway bias . A beginning was thought to be made when President ' WILSON appointed a Princeton professor to a vacancy . But his voice was not heard in dissent from the decision which the country has not approved . The debate in Congress upon the bill for the enlargement of the Commission showed that Congress is still in the hostile temper in which it passed the Adamson eight-hour law . But Congress does not appoint the Commissioners , and it may be hoped that the President will be accessible to the petitions which are being made for railway representation upon the Commission . There would be no analogy to the appointment of plaintiffs or defendants to be judges . Lawyers are thought best judges of the law , regardless of their personal or private affairs . Railway men would be good judges of railway questions . regardless of their previous railway affiliations . The present Commissioners are competent and conscientious men , but it is no disparagement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either the railways or the public . They hardly could have been appointed if they had , not been sympathetic with the temper of the time of their appointment . it was plainly said that shippers would be favored by mem1+1-s recently appointed . Some of them have been- railway subordinates , or railway regulators , or are learned rather in theory than in practice of railway administration . The railways now have been so . chastened and reformed that there are some railway managers who deserve , and ' possess , public confidence . The Commission would be strengthened if its future decision% should find sucha tx , ) member among the majority . And if he were in the minority he would have the opportunity of presenting the railway point of view on a position of equality . The dissenting opinions now handed down by railway Presidents concurrently with the Commission 's are a fire in the rear which can not be agreeable to the Commission . It wiould be better to have it out with the railway representative in the privacy of the council room . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
