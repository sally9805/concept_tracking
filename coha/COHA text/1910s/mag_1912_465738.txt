0F the making of many books about Lincoln there is apparently no end , and we do not know that we could wish there were any , if we may judge from the pleasure they all give us . We have never had , if we can ever have , the wonderful story of that most touching , that most teaching , life told too often . The telling of it always remands us to that condition of childhood in which one telling of a thing implies another and another telling , as the obligation of the teller and as the greatest pleasure and favor he can do the listener . Its very plainness holds us with the charm of mystery . The open day of its few events is of greater witchery than the twilights which involve the incidents , huddled , confused , contradictory , of other great lives , such as . most exemplarily , that of Napoleon . All that each succes- sive biographer of Lincoln can or need do is to give his impression of them , to relate those few events to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the events themselves we do not want any novelty ; we no more wish to have them added to than taken from ; like the children , we prefer to have them just as we had them first . Of course each new student of Lincoln 's life must philosophize it anew ; and perhaps in obedience to this necessity the student will come to concern himself with this or that phase of Lincoln 's character , touching upon the events which illustrate it , and trusting to the reader 's recollection for the relation of other events to it . This seems to have been the notion of Mr. Eliot Norton in his brief , too brief , essay on Lincoln , A Lover of Mankind . Re conceives of the companionable friendliness of Lincoln , his delight of being with his fellowmen in brotherly intimacy , as something very temperamental if not most characteristic of him . He follows him from his earliest experience to his latest , through that long , slow , continuous riseout of the depths of the rude poverty , close on barbarism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic greatness where he remained the same man he had always been , kind , wise , simple , shrewd , humble , but of as much final dignity as ever a man needed for the greatest honor his fellow-man could render him , or fate crown with martyrdom . We do not know whether it is with the wish to declare his own faith in a truer order of the democratic ideals , or only to suggest their acceptance by Lincoln 's life that the essayist reads them in his title-page , Eqnality , Fraternity , Liberty ; but the reader will not fail to find the order significant of much that is not explicit in the pages that follow . Equality was the instinct of that friendly soul of Lincoln . aware that without it fraternity could not be and liberty had never been . He was always seeking the level of other men , in jokes , in stories , in sports , for the sake of the companionship which he loved and found refuge in when care pressed mercilessly upon him . The laughter he enjoyed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , was from a heart without rancor , from a mind which did not harbor grudge and did not imagine revenge . His official life was a long forgiving , and it became the inspiration of whatever was wise in the much-mistaken policy of Reconstruction . When McClellan was insolent and Stanton was exasperating , he could see them droll , and if he could make some one else see them so , and laugh over it with him , he was consoled and forgot his hurt . Ee pardoned and pardoned ; he could not let the ruthless military code work its logic in the offense of the hapless sentinel who slept on his post . or the wretch who deserted his colors , and after the war he did not intend the death of the public enemies whom their enemies called traitors . The spirit of Lincoln , who loved so much to be with other men that he was always putting himself in their place , it was this which moved a nation to forgive , for the first time in. history , those who had attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his treason , but the mercy which prevailed , far more than the blood of patriots shed in battle , consecrated the dreadful war . A philosopher of profoundly religious convictions , Henry James , the father of the psychologist and the novelist , was wont to dwell in talk upon this unique fact as the most important among human events ; and he may have somewhere expressed his sense of it in his writings . But whether he did so or not the Great Pardon , which the soul of Lincoln inspired , marked an epoch in the evolution of man which had not before found such sublime expression , but which had no doubt been working itself out ever since men were bidden by their Saviour to forgive those who despitefully used them . If Lincoln had lived to have his way , none of the rebel States would have been punished ; they would scarcely have been embarrassed in their return to their former functions , since it was his magnanimous theory that they had never been out of the Union . The humor , the amiable irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these States to the Union , and each forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing these acts he brought the States from without into the Union , or only gave them proper assistance , they never having been out of it , " was a joke which in his companionable heart he knew would carry the magnanimity to the hearts of his fellow-countrymen . There seems something almost passive in goodness , which for a long time renders advance in the right imperceptible . There is nothing spectacular in forbearance , in mercy . If you pardon your enemy nothing appears to happen ; but if you stab him or shoot him there is something appreciable to the bystander . Perhaps this may have had something to do with the perpetuation of revenge among men . in the case of public revenge , or what we call justice , there is always something impressive . If a man is acquitted , say . of murder , the judge simply says the defendant isdischarged , and the defendant takes his hat and goes out . But if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairness of his trial and the enormity of his crime , and then sentences him to the electric chair . The newspapers print his portrait , and when he comes out of the death-cell to he killed , after all the torture which weeks and months of terror could inflict , a certain favored few witness the butchery and report its dramatic aspects to the press . So , in the case of private vengeance as it used to be taken , the satisfaction might be more or less to the gentleman , but to the immediate or mediate witness it was in the last degree filling . So even now when an injured man , in the breast or back , he has done something for which no degree of forgiveness could offer a dramatic equivalent . Yet in spite of this obvious advantage in the vindictive treatment of injury there does seem to be a decay of revenge . So long ago as the end of the eighteenth century Alfieri , in the preface to a tragedy of his which turns upon revenge , observes and regrets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all along been the custom of the injured to " take it out " of the injurer in some way or other . The vendetta had a consecration throughout Christendom which it still enjoys in Corsica and Kentucky , and in the wards of New York inhabited by our adoptive citizens from Sicily . But this species of private war was then following other forms of private war to extinction , though revenge on the national scale for hurts to the pocket or the pride of a people continued to be practised in a measure which only now seems to be diminishing , or promising to diminish . The rivalries of business are scarcely to be classed as revenges ; they are the incidents of competition which are presently merged in the calm of monopoly . The lynchings , legal and illegal , which deform our civilization are perhaps to be regarded leniently , especially the illegal lynchings , like the atrocities of war , as necessary concomitants of the hostile state in which imperfectly civilized communities still remain . When a negro is found guilty or is strongly suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and shot full of holes , or burned alive , in retaliation by people who can not wait for the law to avenge them . When the lynching is legal , as in a certain cause cele7-ire of the Chicago courts where the State 's attorney invited the jury to convict the seven men on trial , though he owned they were not guiltier than a thousand other men in the city , it seems as if vengeance might be safely trusted to the law by the most lawless . Yet the theory of modern jurisprudence is that the courts punish but do not avenge the wrongs suffered by the community , and if there is now and then a howl in the public prints for something very like vengeance on a convicted miscreant , that is because many journalists are of the medieval make , and of the mood of citizens who shoot suspected negroes full of holes or burn them alive . They are not characteristic of the community , or even of the press , which is , upon the whole , more merciful-minded , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay of revenge is the disappearance of the " enemy " as a social factor . In the days , or the ages , when revenge was rife , almost every man had " enemies " singly plotting or collectively conspiring against his health and happiness . A man who bad no enemies must be regarded as a poor creature , too insignificant to merit them . The enemy , as he formerly existed , was of course a fruitful occasion for revenge . The injuries he inflicted were to be met with reprisals , which , if possible , were made anticipative ; revenge was more effective if it took this form , which was of the nature of the prevention proverbially worth more to the ounce than cure to the pound . An enemy could be disposed of in several ways before he had a chance to do his victim harm . His effigy idealized in a diminutive wax figure could be melted at the fire . This made him very sick , and disabled his malevolence until possibly he came to a better mind . Or he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife of a bravo in his heart , or a few drops of acquetta in his drink , administered by one of the skilled females of the period . Still , this was begging the question , the question being vindication of your honor or profit , your purse or person , from tho wrong done either by any one , a secret foe or an open friend , in some specific action . Such a vindication was formerly held imperative in case of a wound to the reputation or even the sensibilities , and advantageous in case of pecuniary loss . As for the alienation of a wife 's affections , no self-respecting husband with any sort of public spirit could do less , under any circumstances , than do murder on the guilty , or imaginably guilty , foe or friend committing the wrong . As we have noted before , at divers times in this place , revenge upon such an occasion is still practised without disgrace and quite without danger . The suspected enemy is taken unawares , when his back is turned , or when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for flight or fight . In the last analysis the injury suffered is a sense of property loss , quite distinctly recognized in the Decalogue , where a man is forbidden coveting his neighbor 's wife , or his ox or his ass , or anything which is his . There seems to have been in men 's minds a silent revision of this primitive classification ; so that few men would now think of their wives in the same category with their oxen or their asses . But whether they still think of them so or not , they probably act , in revenging their honor , from the property instinct , so much older than the sense of honor ; and it is their complex motive in the affair which may make this species of revenge the last to fall into disfavor and finally into disuse . Apparently other kinds of revenge have fallen into disfavor and disuse because they have come to be regarded as barbaric . In civilized communities the Jaw is supposed to be effective in righting wrongs between man and man , and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law into his own bands is contemned as a survival from an earlier period of human progress . He is not so openly contemned as he ought to be for a recreant to a better order , for a traitor to civilization . Still , however , he is contemned , somewhat as a leader in a private war would be . He is not contemned so much as a pirate , whose calling is now held in such general disesteem but was , once respected by people of his own nation as that of a sort of Captain of Industry ; an English gentleman setting sail for the Spanish Main to prey upon the silver-ships from South America departed with the good wishes of all his neighbors . The chevalier d'industrie who practises his profession on land has come to be regarded with even greater slight than the pirate , and yet the time was when a noble knight dropping from his castled height upon a merchant-train passing in the valley was regarded with an honor and admiration which the merchant alone did not cherish . Both callings fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as shabby ships ' captains and footpads below the rank of highwaymen . They came to be looked upon as vulgar , and this sealed their fate . In like manner , we fancy a blight , an eating rust , has gathered upon the fair flower of revenge , once the ideal , almost the duty , of any self-respecting roan who aspired to the dignity of gentleman , or to the applause of his fellows in any rank . Just how this happened we are not quite ready to say , but we have a fancy that it began in the law 's meddling with the custom of carrying arms . When a gentleman wore a sword , a common man carried a dirk , but when the law forbade concealed weapons , and fashion frowned upon the rapier as the emblem of a swashbuckler , both were reduced to the coarse necessity of using their fists in taking revenge for an injury or an affront . In some such way , it seems probable , revenge itself came to be regarded as vulgar ; the blight passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " the noble passion , " as Alfieri calls it , was only a question of time until it passed into disuse . The very fact that the law provided a help for the " hurt that honor felt " on any level of society was enough to make a gentleman forego vengeance altogether if he must seek it in open court like a common person . Rather than that he would let his enemy go , unless he chose to break the law , and do a brave murder in some such ease as that in which the Englishman now finds himself sufficiently righted by the damages that one sort of proud American has no stomach for . That is , the sort of American who sees so red that he can see no other color ; not even the blackness of blood-guiltiness . The question attaches corrodingly to the glory of all kinds and means of vengeance , once so blindingly splendid in men 's eyes . One does not quite like the notion of a man who pursues his enemy in the court or in the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One would not only not " count him in one 's list of friends , " but would rather not meet him at the club . The man who habitually seeks revenge is already sometimes called an Indian , which sufficiently marks his place in civilization , his period . lie is not imagined a noble savage , but a sort of degenerate mongrel who unites the vices of both the white and the red races . Revenge is gone or going because it is no longer possible for people to see it as a fine thing . The Lincolnian manner of man is more in favor than the Indian . Modernity brings us closer together , and the old solitudes are settled by genial spirits that like one another 's company . In the pleasure of swapping stories , especially if they are funny ones , we find out what really good fellows we are , and probably have been all along ; we feel that a man , if he were really bad , could not have known such a good story as we have heard some one tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the mere matter of joking , when the talk strikes fire from the triturated wits , we perceive that the joker who before seemed only as hard as flint may be also as true as steel . The happy effect may impart itself from the individual to the nation in the course of time , and as the nations become more and more a family they may more and more feel it bad form to make war upon one another for flag-following commerce , or in vindication of that most fantastic thing , the " national honor . " As Lincoln imagined forgiving a whole rebellious section of this country , so Mr. Taft has supposed the possibility of France . England , and America getting together in friendly congress and forgiving their respective grievances , or agreeing to forget them . This points to the decay of public revenge as a passion , which may very well follow the decay of the passion of private revenge .
