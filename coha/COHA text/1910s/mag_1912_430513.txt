 | For this time of the year , which is a vacation period almost everywhere , many persons are in search of entertaining books of story or narrative variety , and just now , therefore , there is a great sale of ephemeral novels that , unfortunately , are based largely on exaggerated social or economic conditions , or that deal with so-called problems , which are of purely temporary interest and of little importance . While it is but natural that for recreation we do not choose philosophical or analytical studies , it is unfortunate that at any time so many worthless books should be read , especially when better books , equally entertaining and immensely more profitable , are to be had . Such a book is undoubtedly the recently published two volume work by Mr. John Dill Ross. * The author is an Englishman of long and varied experiences as a man of affairs in the Far East . His ancestors also lived there and played their part in shaping the course of events in that section of the world . Consequently , what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of first-hand knowledge . The story of Mr. Ross 's book is the career of John Dillon Northwood , a trading English sea-captain , and that of his son , of the same name , till illness forced the latter to leave the Orient . The captain 's life was spent in the Malay or East Indian Archipelago at a time when pluck and energy backed by shrewdness , honesty , and bravery brought to the individual a rich harvest of reward . His successful career as told in the book has in it much of romance and adventure that appeals especially to us of this age which is lacking somewhat in manly and martial virtues . He was equal to any emergency and was thwarted by no obstacles . Thus , he could skillfully handle to his own advantage querulous and narrowminded government officials when he found that by accident he had carried away in his ship the wife of the leading Dutch planter of a parish , and in the end derive only profit out of the predicament that promised ruin to his trade ; he could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a chief who was believed to  | be invulnerable , and by a clever , though dangerous , elevation of his cannon send the pirate chief to destruction . And when after disaster had befallen him through the too ambitious undertakings of his son and through the rascality of a shrewd Yankee shipcaptain who led the firm to ruin , though for a while his spirits were at low ebb , he finally triumphed again betaking advantage of the easy consciences of French officials in charge of French colonial affairs during a native rebellion . He died the proud Englishman that he had lived , happy in the esteem of his patrons who gladly gave him their business in spite of all tricks of competitors , and could boast that he had become the pioneer of English trade with Borneo . Though his career can not be compared with that of the well known Englishman Brooke , whose enduring and patriotic work in saving part of the great island of Borneo to the English is sketched so effectively in the introduction to the book , his story is well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have done so much to establish English commerce all over the world . That his line of ships should on his death fall into the hands of a German firm seems but prophetic of what is going on in so many places where the English and the Germans are entering into competition . The Germans by patience and organization are wresting control of trade out of the hands of the English who have so long held it . But the real hero of the book is young Northwood , and his career is described in detail . One feels that he represents the author himself . We learn of his birth and of his childhood spent it the Singapore of the earlier days , of his schooling and doings in London , his return to the East and later adventurous career as successful merchant trader , his financial ruin , his plucky rise again as employee of several large English firms till he obtained a position of great importance and responsibility . His story contains varied and various love affairs of the most romantic sort , narrow escapes from storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruises along the enchanting shores of the beautiful Spice Islands and experiences off lovely Turnate when the island was being racked by volcanic eruptions and the sea was red with fire . His employment in various capacities by large business firms and development companies brings him sooner or later in contact with all sorts and conditions of men of every race to be found in that interesting part of the world . His  | travels extended over all lands in the Orient and his observations and experiences are related in detail in his book . All of this is told in a style that makes the narrative most entertaining reading . Starting with the great prestige of his father 's name and the advantage of his wealth , young Northwood is too confident of his ability and acquires through sad experience the valuable lesson of learning to judge human nature before relying on all of its representatives . But when thrown on his own resources he " makes good " in adversity by dint of his own native ability , energy , and sound honesty . He , like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers are not unlike those of many self-made Americans . But the work is far more than a biography . Mr. Ross has attempted to depict as a background for his story the vanished manners and customs and the immensely changed conditions of the European colonies in the Archipelago . In other words , he would be both biographer and historian . Histories of so vast an empire as the British , however full , can not deal satisfyingly with all the changes and their causes in its far off and neglected spots . Thus , Singapore in its pioneer days with the adjacent islands and ports belonging to the different European and Asiatic powers and with consequently easily aroused friction , with conditions rapidly changing as interests more and more converge there , with conflicting racial points of view and customs , with various religions acting and reacting on each other , and all this at a time when the individual was more or less left a free hand ? such a background is surely well worth reproducing . It may be that Mr. Ross has not succeeded entirely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his personal interest in the story he is telling . We do not learn enough of religious conditions and practically nothing is said of education . But there is enough to cause one to forgive such omissions . Greater completeness would have drawn the work out to unmanageable length . While we enjoy the interesting glimpses of the novel and patriarchal life of the Dutch descendants on their plantations , and good descriptions of the natural scenery of lands and seas little known to us , and while we feel interested in the foods and drinks peculiar to the country , it is , naturally , the contact of European with Oriental civilization that offers most to us . The natives of the Archipelago are , for the most part , described as untrustworthy  | and indolent . Many of them are treacherous and cruel . The influence of their European masters seems to have had little effect on them . The Chinese are imported as laborers , since the natives have proved extremely unsatisfactory . The coolies are organized and managed in general despotically by Chinese bosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's experiences in dealing with such a labor situation prove good and instructive reading . Profitable business undertaking in that part of the world must depend on skillful handling of the labor situation . That native and Chinese labor , when unprotected from such high-handed representatives , is often cruelly treated by shortsighted business men is revealed in the book where we are told that farm-laborers were denied mere covering though ill , and dying from the lack of it . The picture is truly dismal in the extreme . One feels that with humane and wise treatment of labor great fortunes might be made from the cheap sago flour industry and from mining . But the deadly fevers and other diseases that infest the forests must first be got rid of through wise sanitary measures . From a political standpoint the conduct of the Dutch during their campaign in the Island of Lombok , undertaken on humanitarian grounds , is interesting . That such cruelty and barbarity could be shown in our age is hardly thinkable . It only confirms the belief that racial hatred is exceedingly hard to allay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such facts also show how very much there still remains to be done in the way of bringing about peace and good will in the earth . Likewise , we get from this book some idea of the great extent of the islands of this Archipelago , of whose ownership we seldom think . In time to come , no doubt , they will be the scene of great conflict when overcrowded countries are forced to seek more territory . How easy it would be and yet what changes it might involve in world history if , for example , Germany should see fit to take from the tiny European state of the Netherlands its vast empire of islands here which are known as the Netherland Indies ! All of this we feel keenly from Mr. Ross 's book . Young Northwood 's final work in the Orient was done during our war in the Philippines . From his point of view the conduct of the Americans was barbarously cruel and , even when not cruel , sadly lacking in wisdom . While not especially pleasing to us ,  | such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , much truth . Now that we have the responsibility of caring for the Filipinos and of developing the great resources of their islands , we might profit much from studying the history of European conduct of affairs in the Malay Archipelago . And Mr. Ross 's book touches here and there interesting points on the possessions of all the European countries in those islands that are so near the Philippines and naturally not very different in conditions from them .
