the list of New York 's public buildings rarely do you find any mention of Gibson 's . Viewed in the cold light of the tax-rolls , Gib-son 's is a department store , and so a private enterprise . Actually ' it is much more a part of the public life of the city than the Library on Fifth Avenue . No one would think of omitting the Pennsylvania Terminal from a study of New York , though that granite palace is only a booth for the sale of tickets to Rahway , Trenton , and San Francisco . The crowds pass through a railway terminal , but they abide in Gibson 's by the hour . The terminal is an entrance and an exit , whereas Gib .. son 's is a social institution . There is no folk psychology bound up with a railway station in a big town , however it may be in those places where the leading citizens congregate on the platform to see the trains pass . Gibson 's is not only a place , but a force for good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows how it is embedded in the common life . It is not Gibson 's Department Store but simple Gibson 's , Smith 's , Jones 's . It is more intimately related to the life of the community than that other great national genitive , Childs 's . We say Gibson 's as in England they sign letters Salisbury , Haldane , French . No initials or expletives are necessary . Why it is n't Gibson 's Bazaar I have never quite understood . I am aware that " bazaar " smacks of the small town where they also have " emporiums . " But , on the other hand , nothing can be uglier than " department store . " It is ugly and it is had business . If travelers do not speak of department stores as they do of the bazaars of the Orient , it must be because of the impossible name . For Gibson 's , as I have said , is not a store where things are merely sold , but actually a bazaar ; that is to say , ameeting-place as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently the owner has himself to blame if travelers look for the life of India in the bazaar at Bcnares and for the life of a little Macedonian village in its market-place but seldom think of looking for the life of New York behind the great plate-glass windows on Fifth Avenue . Or take the Stock Exchange . They print pictures of the Stock Exchange on post-cards , and visitors climb the gallery to look down on a national phenomenon . Yet what the Stock Exchange is to Economic Man the department stores are to Economic Woman . Only the hideous name stands in the way . Gibson 's qualifies as a public building by its significance ; it certainly qualifies by size . Any one of its floors is larger than most market-places in Merrie England . It offers you a spectacle with which only the cathedrals and the railway terminals and the Metropolitan Opera House can compare . But it combines all the separate qualities of these monster buildings into an unparalleled effect . The Opera House has color and sound , but no motion . The terminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library and the cathedrals have spaciousness , but no crowds . Gibson 's has them all . It spreads out , glows , and reverberates . An hour in Gibson 's , and you bring out with you a symphony of life in action , and not infrequently a headache . To the male shopper the geography of the department store is a source of never-failing wonder . Technically , he is shopping under one roof . In practice , a man will walk farther to buy a razor and a game of dominoes at Gibson 's than if he had bought the razor in Fulton Street and the dominoes near Brooklyn Bridge . The elevator system at Gib-son 's is complicated . As a rule it may he said that when you want to go downthe elevators all go up . But the matter of distances is nothing to the problem of distribution . Commodities in the department store migrate under the influence of the seasons , the laws of political economy , social status , fashion , and biology . Shirts and electric , stoves are in the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's shoes at regular prices are on the ground floor , and at sale prices they are to be found in the basement ; and Boy Scout shoes stand all by themselves , like something in Greek grammar . If a man is buying gifts for a brood of three small nieces and one nephew ? as will sometimes happen ? he is lost . It is borne in upon him by patient floorwalkers that his little nephew is a boy , and will be found on the second floor . His youngest niece , he discovers , is an infant , and three aisles away . The second youngest girl is a child , so you take the elevator to the third floor and walk across . The eldest girl is a miss , and she is in the next elevator coming down . And if the mother of the family , and perhaps the cook , are also to be provided for , say . at Christmas , you can see what wodid happen ; for the cook injects a social factor which probably involves a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as like as not to be found in a special sub-department which ministers to " stouts . " Just when an infant becomes a child , when a child becomes a miss , when a miss becomes a woman , and why a boy is sometimes an infant yet never seems to become a child , but leaps at once right next to the men 's department , is something I should like the Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University to tell me . " And you can always exchange it , " says the saleswoman to the woman shopper . The saleswoman who is worth her salt knows the precise moment when that suggestion must be made . h is the moment when the customer 's doubts have apparently been resolved . She wants the new gown very much . It pleases her , soothes her , fits her . It is the moment when the male purchaser would nod and say , " I 'll take it , " and pull out his check-book . In that momcnt the woman shopper goes panicky at the thought , the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the same to her at home as it does now in the store . For , whereas man buys clothes to satisfy a physical need , woman shops largely for the satisfaction of her soul . A man 's chest measure and sleeve length are the same at home and in the shop , and a three-button sack can not conceivably change to a two-button sack under any surroundings . But emotion is not to be tested by the yardstick . Woman , when she has picked and chosen , says to herself , " Yes , I like it now , tinder this light , in this room , set off against all the other shades and patterns , but how will it be at home ? ' How will it be with her when she has the new gown to herself , away from this superheated atmosphere of acquisition , in the sudden drop of spirits that is sure to come ? At home when she looks into the mirror and sees herself tired around the eyes , or when she first lifts the gown from the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her liberty of choice is gone , when that gown is hers to have and to hold , what then ? In that moment of crisis the wise saleswoman says , quietly , " And you can always exchange it , of course . " It is a problem of high moral importance , this system of purchase with a proviso . Its effect on the moral nature of woman is baneful . For consider only that human society , that all civilization , is based on the inviolability of contract . Organized life is possible only on the assumption that a man surrenders what he agrees to give up , and keeps what he has promised to take . Under special circumstances he is allowed to change his mind , to break the contract , but almost invariably there is a penalty attached . And this penalty he pays as a matter of course , because he recognizes that to decide one way and to want something else hampers the work of the world . It is anarchy . Too many women , however , enter the department store with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to exchange . Woman begins shopping in the certainty , which is almost part of her fate , that her choice will be bad , but that it is of no consequence , since she can always send the things hack . You see at once how utterly destructive this must be of all moral standards . It means living in a world of free choice where the sinner is not in the least handicapped against the saint . The woman who chooses wisely and once for all is no better off than the woman who keeps on exchanging things until she is satisfied . Consider , now , what it would mean to this world if men went at their day 's work every morning saying , " I know I shall make a mess of it . " Consider what it would mean if McLoughlin said to himself , " Of course I shall lose the first set , but then we can play it over till I win . " Consider what it would mean if Dr. Mayo were to say , " I know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can always bring the patient to life again . " I dwell on this point at some length because , so far as I am aware , no one before me has pointed out the vicious effect of the department store 's unrestricted exchange system upon woman 's nature and on her place in society . What sincerity , what force can there be in woman 's demand for an equal place in our man-made world as long as she continues to live so many hours a week in a world in which consequences do not follow upon acts , in which she may choose A and keep B ?  - -  a world in which mistakes are not paid for , in which you reach the second floor by taking the stairway to the cellar or the elevator to the second floor , it does not matter which ultimately ? Imagine a world in which the wages of sin are not death , but a transfer slip which you present at a little window in the rear of the store . And you can see how the practice of unlimited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm of the department store and into life . If choice is always to be made with the idea that the first attempt will fail , and that there is always a second chance and a third , then how , when it comes to selecting a profession , a cause to work for ? a husband ? The matter here becomes intricate and dangerous , and as a pioneer in the subject am not bound to exhaust it or even develop it through all its implications . As some one has said , whenever an idea is difficult or dangerous , or does not seem to justify your spending your own time i upon it , throw it out as a suggestion for some one else to work out . One might ask , for instance , whether there is any connection between the growth of the shopping habit and the divorce habit among the women of our unoccupied classes , both being based on a choice that is not final and a system of exchange that is not penalized . But , as I have said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggestion . In one sense , of course , it is not quite right to say that the habit carries no penalty with it . Specialists declare that the practice of sending things back adds something . i like ten per cent . to the normal price . So , after all , there is a penalty . But who pays it , my friends ? Everybody ; the shopper who does not exchange and the shopper who always sends things back , which is again a moral confusion . I he wages of sin and the wages of virtue are exactly the same ? ten per cent . on the normal price . Sex antagonism in the department store ? I should be making a sorry job of this study of a very important phase of modern life if I omitted the sex factor , which , I am assured , colors all modern life from the quintessence of Nietzsche to the teething habits of the American infant , the eight-hour railroad law , and the " movies . " You know , of course , what sex antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a front co-extensive with humanity . Man , the Central Power , is intrenched on the defensive . Allied woman batters away at the wall . War is waged by violence and by cunning . Sometimes the battle flares up in a storm of high explosive which flattens the trenches of masculine domination preparatory to a. charge by Sylvia Pankhurst . Sometimes it is the steady grinding process of field-artillery as woman conquers the suffrage State by State . Sometimes it is the consolidation of new lines by Women in Industry , carried on behind a curtain fire of shrapnel . blow them up sky-high . Sometimes it is plain treachery , as when the old - fashioned , womanly woman stretches out her arms and says , " Kamerad Kamerad ! " and the credulous male goes to meet his fate in the coils of the serpent of old Nile . In whatever form it manifests itself there is this eternal war between the sexes , the str wing to dominate and not to be dominated , the conquests that are the undoing of the conqueror , the surrenders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps of paper ; in short , the sort of thing hinted at in Ecclesiastes and Proverbs and amplified by Baudelaire , H. G. Wells , and Freud-Jung . But I was going to say that the kind of sex antagonism you find in the department store is different from that which obtains in every other province of life . It is antagonism between members of the same sex . It is civil war between the woman behind the counter and the woman in front . The purchase of four and a half yards of dress material is a process untinged by sentiment , a contest in which neither party asks or gives quarter . And the reason , of course , is that the two sides are too equally matched to permit anything but a grim attention to business . On either side of the counter are professional soldiers . I know , of course , that in the manuals of salesmanship there is much talk about the money value of courtesy in salesmanship . But from personal observation I am not prepared to say that such courtesy from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , a polite attention to duty , efficiency , patience . The arrogant blonde who offers her wares with an air of saying that socially she would prefer not to meet her customer is a disappearing type . But the politeness that is getting to be the rule is a formal , frigid politeness . The patience with which the seller will fetch the seventeenth tailor-made for trying-on is mechanical . Rarely is there heart behind it . It is quite different when a man wanders into the department store . The rigid rules of warfare do not apply . A man in the rush hour at the counter will be waited on out of his turn without protest from the women shoppers . He is like a babe who has strayed into the No Man 's Land between the hostiletrenches . There may be a smile on either side of the counter , but in his helpless state he appeals to the innate chivalry in woman . When a man shops for himself he is satisfied with the first approximation to what he wants . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants . He reads something from a list and asks for six yards of it , and only wants assurance that he is getting what he asks for . His ignorance of the distinction between poplin and cr ? pe de chine is a claim on the maternal instinct in the heart of the saleswoman . And he does not waste time . When a man huys half a dozen pairs of silk socks , he is shown a pair and assumes that the other five pairs out of the same box will be the same . A woman usually examines every pair of the half-dozen . A man in a department store is like Sir Galahad . He brings out what is best in everybody . Saleswomen are patient with him . Floorwalkers give him explicit directions to the shoe department . Elevator-boys call out the floors for him distinctly . The girl at the transfer desk guarantees delivery of the goods that same afternoon . The laws of war are not for him . He is not of the enemy . He belongs to the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very definite economy of time and nerves if women could have their husbands do their shopping for them . It would be time saved even if we reckon the hours expended at home in persuading the man to undertake the task . I throw this out as a suggestion . As to the advisability of taking one 's husband to the shops , much may be said on both sides . On the one hand , it is certain that after he has spent three hours in a chair while his wife tries on Spring suits , a man will have a very definite idea of what women suffer in the daily task . The next time his wife comes home from the shops with a headache he is likely to be more sympathetic . But then again it may be that the memory of his own hitter ordeal will prevail , and he will carry away with him a more vivid sense of the futilities in which the life of woman is spent . It all depends on the man , of course . But the husband endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three solid hours in a tapestry chair , in an audience of three hundred women and fifty salesgirls , will watch the strained and tired faces , the tryings-on and divestings ; the search after the unattainable ideal , the final purchase made more out of weariness than out of satisfaction ; and he can not help asking himself , " For whom is it all ? " And he will say to himself , " For us males ? " And it will make him thoughtful . On the whole , a university extension course in Shopping Practice and Observation would be good for the average man . The next time he speaks to a well-dressed woman at dinner he will know what it costs to make the world beautiful for him . He may thereupon decide to get on with less beauty or else he will be more ready to make allowances for women 's nerves . But am not sure . Taking along one 's husband to the store as critic and appraiser is of no use at all . In the first place , his principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the romantic , impressionistic school . He looks at his wife in the green cloak with fur edging and says , " I like that . " Or else he says , " You look well in that . " As if the mere fact that a woman looks well in a green coat , or that she likes it , were the deciding factor . Woman belongs , in the matter of dress , to the scientific school of criticism , which bases itself on universal principles ? Aristotle , Taine , Brunetiere . It is criticism which does not ask whether a woman looks well in a green cloak trimmed with fox , but says , How does this green cloak fit into that woman 's life , her temperament , her likes , her friends , her duty to her family and to society , on the one hand ; and how near is it in danger of being duplicated by the woman next door , on the other hand ? A man likes his wife 's new dinner gown when it looks well on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the gown in relation to the wall-paper and the lights at home , the fact that she had a dark-red dinner gown year before last , the fact that her color is somewhat higher than it was two years ago , that she has taken on three pounds in weight , that her husband 's income has materially increased since last year , and that next year people will be wearing greens and purples . But even the mere question whether a woman looks well in a new gown is one upon which her husband is not competent to speak except in the must superficial way . She is pretty in the new gown , or she is not ; the infinite gradations escape him . The trouble , of course , is that he knows the woman in the gown too well . He can not think of the dress but as an accessory to the woman . He can never see the gown as a thing-in-itself . This is a very subtle point , and naturally beyond the scope of the simpleminded race of husbands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well-dressed , we do not mean that she looks well in a dress , but that she exhibits a dress in which she looks well . It is doubtful whether there are many women who would consent to be so beautiful as to make people unaware of what they have on . It is a very delicate problem , this , of maintaining that perfect balance in which woman and dress do not drown each other . For a true appraisal , therefore , it needs the eye of a stranger to whom the two factors in the ensemble , woman and dress , are equally novel . Husbands should have recognized by this time that if it were a question of merely looking well , women would long ago have adopted the white uniform of the trained nurse , in which , demonstrably , more women look better than in any garment ever devised . It is only fair , after the emphasis I have laid on the deleterious effects of the shopping habit to suggest that the evil is probably not in the practice itself , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stores in a state of physical exhaustion and nervous tangle , but it is also true that what they seek in the stores is something like spiritual refreshment . That unmistakable revival of the soul which comes from putting on a new gown , or a fresh suit of clothes ? it is the same for women and men ? is here to be had in abundance . An hour spent with new things , heaping counters of white stuffs , gay colors , rich textures , the glimmer of crystal and jewelry ? it does not matter if it is imitation jewelry ? and lights , and movement , must be very much like a cold shower for the spirit . There is the chance for an imaginative possession of all these rich , glowing , gleaming , solid , flimsy things . It is , after all , the excitement of the country fair ? especially if you count in the music , the restaurant , the candy-counter , the marvelous patent clothes-wringer demonstrated in the basement , and all the other side-shows . It is the bazaar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these , I understand , can be easily dispensed with . And I dare say if the public should express a desire for the last touch of the bazaar , a turbaned Persian salesman in the Oriental rug department , a Chinese merchant with great horn spectacles in the porcelain department , the department store will supply them without loss of time . Perhaps they have done the trick already . But when all is said and done , when the balance has been most fairly adjusted , the influence of the shopping district on the position of women remains deplorable . The more attractive the business is made the greater the lure of the temptation . Try as I may to he fair to Gibson 's , the ultimate fact will assert itself : Gibson 's is a handicap which women must cast off if they are ever to take an equal share in the work of the world . The tyranny of Dress ? for shopping does mostly mean Dress ? weighs more heavily on women than any of our man-made despotisms . The waste of energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race is terrifying . It is a burden from which very few women find it easy to escape . Dress is the gate of tribulation through which she must enter upon her business and her pleasures . The boy packs up and goes off to college . His sister must shop before she goes away to college , and through the year she must continue to shop . A man locks up his desk and goes away for a month 's fishing in Canada . His wife must shop for a month 's holiday in Canada . A man goes off to see McLoughlin play tennis . His wife must first shop for McLoughlin . A man calls up the box-office and reserves two tickets for Fritz Kreisler . Woman begins by looking around to seewhether she has anything to wear for Fritz Kreisler . And when a million women strike out for freedom by going out to earn their own living , it is too often only to enter upon a wider career of shopping . I understand that it takes a great deal of time to pick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint against the Double Standard is justified . The double standard in clothes is largely responsible for her enslavement . What adds to the lure of the shopping habit is that the vice is made so attractive . Shopping in the best stores is not commerce , but a social function . It is not only that Gibson 's has music and pictures for your entertainment ; writing-rooms , rest-rooms , playing rooms for the children ; parcel-rooms , telephone booths , telegraph and cable stations , summer-resort bureaus . The very business of purchase and sale is conducted with a minimum stress on the selfish interests involved . When you enter Gibson 's you are not expected to buy . If you buy , you do not carry parcels home , of course ? that goes without saying ; you have them sent . And if the preliminary labor of picking out things to be sent is too much of a strain , you have them sent on approval . When you have made your choice , the obligation to stick to your choice , as I pointed out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the name of the charge account has done away with the sordid handling of money . I can not imagine how further removed one can be from primitive barter and sale than under this system where no one asks you to buy , no one asks you to choose , no one asks you to carry , no one asks you to pay . It is a delightful relationship of host and visitor . The great spaces are the host 's reception-room . The treasures he has gathered from every corner of the earth are his private collections for your entertainment . The music and the reading-rooms and the rest-salons are the setting for a delightful week-end . It is , as I have said , Society . " Mr. J. Walter Gibson requests the pleasure of your company at half after nine every day in the week at 999 Fifth Avenue . There will be music by artists from the Metropolitan , a conversazione on Picasso , and an exhibition of Japanese pongee shirt-waists , reduced to $4.89 . " Luxurious shopping , there 's the enemy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a dissipation . Everything has been made pleasant ; everything has been made easy . Take this question of " honest advertising , " and the special sale about which people are so much concerned . It is argued that if you advertise something for $11.67 reduced from $18 , and the article is well worth $11.67 , it is nevertheless fraud if the original price was anything less than $rg . From the standpoint of pure ethics , this is so , I suppose . Nevertheless there is a difference between the misrepresentation which would sell a second-hand garment for a new one or cotton for wool and the misrepresentation which gives you honest quality and your money 's worth and only exaggerates the bargain . A barrel of apples with three layers of good fruit on a foundation of windfalls is fraud . A barrel of apples , sound to the bottom , selling for three dollars , worth three dollars , but advertised as formerly selling forfive dollars , is disingenuous , perhaps , but , after all , why should n't a housewife know the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compelled i to dig into the barrel for bad apples , but she ought to know the world she lives in . It is best for the shopping women that she shall not altogether be safeguarded and sheltered . For her own sake she must not he surrounded with too many automatic safety devices . If she is not to have the worry of lugging parcels home as her grandmother did , if she is to have the privilege of changing her mind , if she is to be spared the trouble of handling money but leaves that to he managed by her husband at the end of the month with a check-book , let her at least exercise the amount of intelligence and effort necessary to distinguish between something which is intrinsically worth $11.67 and something which is worth $18 . If even that effort is spared her , she is utterly re-moved from the realm of responsible action . For her own moral welfare , shopping must retain something of its respectable function as an economic process and not degenerate utterly into a five-o'clock tea .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
