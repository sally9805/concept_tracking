ONE night , while dining at the Harvard Club with Captain Custance R.N.R. , who in times of peace commanded the famous Arcadian , I happened to notice that the silver identification tag which he wears , welded to a thin chain on his wrist , had turned bottom-side-up . Now , for the last year , I have seen a great deal of Custance , and though he had told me that this identification tag was made out of the lace of an old admiral 's coat , I never knew , until I saw it printed on the reverse side , that the British Admiralty had given Custance that tag Tor Valor . ' Custance and I have been friends for years . I am closer to him than any man in the United States ; yet he was very much embarrassed that I should have found out in his presence about that tag . The yarns about him which have already appeared in the Atlantic ( the reason for his getting the D.S.O. ) seem to be but part of the story . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncomfortable time of it , as we lounged in the living-room of the Harvard Club of New York , a fit setting for tales of valor . The other seaman knew the story and told it , while Custance kept saying , ' Others have done so much more , it is not worth talking about . ' The Mingary was coming off patrol ( this happened before the Warspite incident already related ) . The month was December . Custance picked up a wireless to the effect that , on another patrol route , a collier , the armed patrol yacht , and a trawler , were being attacked by two U-boats and were sinking . This all occurred up around the Shetland Islands . Custance at once put on full speed for the seat of action , which was some distance away . On the way he passed a trawler , which told him she had been going to the rescue , but two immense U-boats on the surface had stood in her way and she had had to turn about . Now , the Mingary was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed her with its longer-range guns ; but Custance kept on , for he knew that there were men floundering in the wintry sea as they clung to wreckage . The little trawler about-faced and went on , with Custance just abreast . Ten miles farther on , Custance came upon the two big Germans on the surface . He drove his tiny yacht at one of the beasts and his flotilla of two put up a wonderful show of fight . The Germans , not knowing what was coming , submerged and cleared out , and Custance passed on to pick up from the sea twenty-six survivors of a collier , armed yacht , and trawler . That is all of that story of sheer nerve . One of the men picked up out of the sea was an officer of the armed yacht , who , like Custance himself , in times of peace was a merchant-ship officer . I am told that , like Custance , that officer had attacked the submarines in trying to save the collier . Six months later , Custance met him in Southampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he replied , ' after they let me out of the hospital , I went mine-sweeping . ' And Custance says , ' Why distinguish what I 've done from the rest ? I 've but done my duty . ' Very true , yet the knowledge of these tales makes the world a better place to live in , and bucks up Americans to equal the daring of these modest men of the sea who but do their duty . I have just received a letter from a neutral port , telling me what a chap named Rathkens did ; and I can do no better than set down the copy of the letter . It is from a merchant-ship officer who has done work in this war with the same stout heart that Rathkens showed at the sinking of the French hospital ship Salta . As you know , I was for ten months on a hospital ship , making several trips a week across the Channel . The Salta was making Havre , as We were , with us about three minutes ahead of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Salta , for some reason or other , tried to cut in at an angle . We had just dropped our hook inside when the hospital major called my attention to the Salta and to the constant screeching of the whistles of the trawlers outside . I took one look and my hair stood on end . My God , I thought , he 'll be in it in a minute ! Her skipper got wise too late . ( Of course I wo n't give you details of the layout . ) He tried to back her , but he was coming down before a wallowing sea and a heavy blow . As her wheels churned up the foam underneath her counter , instead of backing straight back and out of danger , the sea caught her on the quarter and swung her around . The major and I stood like pillars of salt as we watched her . Yes ? she got it ? good and plenty . I 've seen many ships torpedoed and mined , but never so much smoke and such a volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mine-field . Jehosaphat , to use your American slang , it was hell ! There before our eyes we saw the Salta go right down ? pushed below the surface of the sea as you would collapse a tin drinking- cup . In about five minutes not even her masts were showing . We were powerless to act . About a hundred and seventy were drowned on her , including her skipper , who went down on her bridge , yet was n't drowned but choked to death by his false teeth . Rathkens , as you may recollect , was a second officer on the West Indian mailships , and after the war started , he was stationed at Bermuda for a year or so as boarding officer . On being relieved , lie was given an old torpedo-boat ? the P-32 , as I recollect it . When the Salta struck , Rathkens pushed the P-32 right plumb up against her . It was a fearful risk for him to enter that mine area , but evidently lie thought he could go at least as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? simply acted . He was alongside her in two shakes ? took off forty-eight from the Salta , mostly nursing-sisters ; and then , not to be carried down by the Salta , had to back away . You can imagine my sensations , standing there on the bridge . Of course I did n ' t know till later that it was Rathkens who had the P-3 ' 2 ; but considering what she was , I felt that some merchant-ship man was showing the men of the world the gumption in a merchant-ship man . Well , Rathkens backed away , but he got it ? got it like the Salta , had . Struck him amidships , and the P-32 broke in two . The after-section sank immediately , carrying down tlic forty-eight who hail been taken off the Salta . Glad to say that Rathkens himself was saved . There is a captain I know of , by the name of Willetts , who in this war has had more ships go clown under him than any man I know , and yet still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as ever his company will appoint him to another ship . Until the Moewe bagged the Radnorshire , Willetts navigated the war-zone ? had his days and nights of strain , and the experiences that other merchantmen have . After enjoying a spell on the Moewe , with other prisoners of war , he was set ashore in Brazil , and at once sailed for England on the big Drina . Off the coast of Wales she was torpedoed and went down , the engine-room force on duty at the time dying at their posts . Willetts was saved and his dander was up . So they put him on a transport ? the Arcadian , well known to us Americans . As he was without proper convoy , a submarine banged him . The loss of life was nearly two hundred and fifty ; and though Willetts was on the bridge , keeping up the tradition of the sea , as she went under , he nevertheless was rescued after being in the water many hours . Returning to England , he took command of the big Demarra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel to punish a submarine for attacking her without warning . Of course , ever since she has been a marked ship . Under convoy , Willetts took her from Liverpool , round through the English Channel to La Pallice , and just as he was making port , a submarine got him . In spite of the fact that she was sinking under him , Willetts got her to the beach , patched her up , and brought her back to Liverpool through the danger zone again . Last December there was a ship torpedoed , and until the British Admiralty announce it , I do not feel free to give her name . She was saved , and saved by the pluck of a British Naval Reserve captain , famous in the American passenger-carrying trade . The ship was the flagship of the convoy and had just turned over eleven American freighters to their country 's destroyers , and was swinging over to lead the remainder to England , when she got it . It was a wild sea , and even if the boats could have been got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing was seen of the submarine . Nobody even saw the wake of the torpedo . The explosion took all hands unawares . As the batch had been battened down and made water ? tight , the effect of the explosion was terrific . It struck in number 5 hold , abaft the engine-room , and the gases simply blew things to smithereens . The hole made in the side of the ship was 17 feet by 34 . It was mighty fortunate that the hatch-covering blew off , for the result was that the damage was all confined to number 5 hold , which was loaded with oil and Quaker Oats . Fortunately , not a soul was in that section of the ship ; so nobody was hurt . Other ships nearby took on a new form of camouflage , for they were pasted with a mixture of crude oil and cereal . It was four o'clock in the afternoon when the pirate shot his bolt , and from then on till she limped into port ? seventy miles distant ? early next morning , the big ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of touch and go as to whether or not she would reach the beach . As it was , there was only two feet freeboard at the stern when she touched the shore , and she had limped the entire distance with her funnel-shaft full of water and her engineers , momentarily during the long hours , expecting that thesea would seep in and put the fires out , or that the bulkhead separating them from number 5 hold would give way and drown them like rats in a cage , as many an engine-room force has been drowned since the Huns began their piratical warfare . Do not forget that these men are merchant-ship men . Think of the stick-to-itiveness of the beggars ! And the little man on the bridge , ? the little man who has safely ferried so many of us Americans about the world , ? think of the strain on him , realizing everything and injecting his personality into the souls of his assistants on the bridge or in the stoke-hold , so that they would hang on ! He had a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' they panicked , stripped oil every stitch of clothing they had , and piled into the lifeboats ; and though the boats were not lowered , the Chinks sat there in their birthday suits , their teeth chattering in harmony with the surging sea , which was licking its chops at the prospect of a good-sized meal . Yes , tragic ? but humorous , which frequently saves us from tragedy . Although other skippers have recently told me that credit for saving the ship was entirely due to one man , yet that man saw to it that the Admiralty gave the credit to the officers and men under him . And even if the Huns are escaped , the life of a merchant-ship man in these days is far removed from beer and skittles . An example of what they have to go through is furnished by the narrow squeak the Empress of Britain and the Cardiganshire had one night in the , , Egean Sea . Both are big ships , and they were loaded with troops and going at full speed , ? zigzaging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those nights when you can hardly see your hand before you . There were no stars , no phosphorous , ? nothing , ? nothing but to trust to luck and the ears of the man on the bridge . The captain of one of the ships has told me that , before he knew it , there was a ship , bow on to him , dead ahead . Of course , the first impulse was to shift his helm ; but if he did so , the danger would be of one ship giving the other a glancing blow . Fortunately , the other skipper appreciated this , also . Their nerve , in spite of several years of war zone work , was still equal to the occasion . It all happened in the twinkling of an eye , and they passed safely though there had been less than fifty feet separating the ships , and their out-swung lifeboats nearly scraped . The captain of the Cardiganshire , though he could not see him , heard the captain of the Empress of Britain , above the noises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , old man , do n't shift your helm ! ' so close were they on their respective bridges high above the sea . Instances of this kind , which try men 's souls , nightly occur , and quite frequently there are collisions and tragedies in the pitch-dark . The only way that the two ships identified themselves was ten days later , at Saloniki , when the captain of the Cardiganshire heard the skipper of the Empress of Britain asking a friend if he knew what ship he nearly bumped on a certain night . I am sorry to report that the captain of the Empress of Britain lost his life in the Halifax explosion , while doing hospital work . But the story of the unlucky Sundays of the Cephalonia takes the palm for varieties of valor . Of course , Cephalonia is not the ship 's name , as military expediency requires me to protect her , and , until she appeared here in July , 1917 , with the shell-holes in her sides temporarily covered by patches as if they were her eroix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiralty commandeered her at the beginning of the war . She 's a queer-looking craft , with four stumpy masts and stocky funnel all planted perpendicularly rather than at a sheer , to make her look more like a lady and less like a washerwoman . She has forty-two derricks and twenty-nine winches , and a stern which no ship afloat can equal in ugliness . Beauty is certainly not her long suit , yet her vast holds have meant more to the Allies the past few years than scores of graceful Mauretanias . Captain Weller , ? not his name , of course , ? Sammy , as I call him , has been in command of her during her war work . Sammy is a little runt of a man , whose rule of life seems to have been that to be simple and natural and kind is to find the real music of the living life . His face has an expression of perpetual alertness , and there is a funny little twist to his head when he listens , something like a curious puppy . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for you , and possessed of a devotion to his wife and kiddies which is equaled in magnitude only by his desire to punish Germany for the cruel things the U-boats have done to human beings . Last July he told me how for six months a hoodoo had hung over the Cephalonia ; but the details of his own part during the fires and the U-boat attacks I had to get from his junior officers or from Fong , his Chinese servant . We were yarning away in his cabin , like the old pals we were , when the sudden whirr of a winch just outside brought Sammy to his feet with a jump , and he peered through a port to see what was up . Satisfied that it was but the work of the ship , he sat down again , with a whimsical smile . Finally he blew a cloud of smoke which merged with the fog of fumes already in the cabin , and began speaking , almost as if to himself , and the angle of his thoughts seas most mystifying , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a certain congruity about it . But when the days are all gold , the sun alight in the heavens , nature showing her beauty , and gladness is in our hearts ? to see death come quickly before one 's eyes , surely that is the most incongruous thing in the world . That winch out there has been my nemesis these many months . It killed a man before my eyes one Sunday . Sunday ! Everything happened on a Sunday : this last voyage to Vladivostock , even the submarine , and that was on Easter at that ! ' The voyage began at London one Sunday in October , 1918 , Sammy told me . The Cephalonia was deeply loaded with shells , and her chill-rooms were filled with T.N.T . for the Italian army . She had been ready to go to sea since Thursday , when she was warped out of the Albert Dock ; and it had chafed all hands to swing idly round a hook in midstream less than a quarter of a mile off shore , with tiny cottages arrayed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was damnable , especially at night , for he could not display a riding-light , and he did not know but what any minute a destroyer or some blighter of a tug would come crashing into him , and the Cephalonia would vanish from human sight , as the Mont Blanc did at Halifax , and wipe out of existence all those pretty little cottages , where by day he saw kiddies in bright pinafores playing , as he knew his kiddies were playing at home in Southampton . It was Sunday morning when Admiralty orders came to up hook and join a convoy outward bound . The Cephalonia was well in the midst of the convoy proceeding down the Thames , and had just passed beyond the submarine net , when a thin pencil of smoke was seen to rise from the corner of number 1 hatch . It happened to catch the third officer 's eye first , and he called Sammy 's attention to it . In a minute another pencil came , and then another , and another . In two shakes Sammy had sounded four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard-arm , which caused all other ships to give him a wide berth , as the propeller of the Cephalonia churned up the sea in her frantic effort to back and turn as if to return to London . A ship on fire should return to port , but Sammy , with a cargo of T.N.T . was n't the kind of a skipper to risk blowing cottages and kiddies into the next world in an effort to save his own skin . No ? he turned the Cepha- Ionia till her stern was head to the breeze , and slowly kept her backing seaward to restrain the fire , if possible , from spreading aft to his chambers of T.N.T. ; backed her away from port and other ships , so that , if she did blow up , the military loss would be confined to the Cephalonia alone . And all the while he was wondering what moment a U-boat would pop up and send a torpedo into him , or he would strike a drifting mine . It was only about three hours before the fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to port . But those three hours at the beginning of a voyage ? sure to be telling on any skipper 's nerve , even in times of peace ? were a hell which I fail to find words to express . The repairs took only a matter of a day or so , and the Cephalonia made another start for the open sea . But during her delay Fritz 's ' tin fishes ' had got busy again , and off the Goodwin Sands she was forced to anchor till another Sunday came round and the Admiralty thought it safe to proceed . No sooner was the hook up from the mud and a white bone of action beginning to show at the Cephalonia 's prow , than a fog descended on her and the scores of ships in her vicinity . To blow the whistle would attract Fritz ; not to blow meant possible collision ; and to anchor meant a good chance of being rammed and of both ships going to Kingdom-come , as the Cephalonia exploded . Realizing that the God of Chance frequently favored the nervy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to do it , for a big P. &; 0 . mail-ship was just astern of him , loaded with women and children , and a collision with her would be the worst of tragedies . As suddenly as it fell , the fog lifted , and as it did so , just half a mile off to port , a tower of water shot up over the big Maine of the Atlantic Transport Line . The Cephalonia shook from stem to stern , and Sammy said he prayed to God that his cans of T.N.T . would behave themselves , as he turned the Cephalonia 's nose for shallow water where a U-boat could not operate . A little Danish ship went to the rescue of the sinking Maine , as the Admiralty records will show . But the tenderhearted Dane never got there . The Hun banged her , and she disappeared from sight in exactly two minutes . Sammy saw red then . It was the first time during the war that he really admitted having murder in his heart ; but , until the Admiralty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung round at anchor in shallow water . He was hugging the Spanish shore , making in for Gibraltar , when he came across a lifeboat . Being in neutral as well as shallow water , he risked a visit from Fritz by stopping the Cephalonia and rescuing the boat-load , who turned out to be all that were left of the crew of a Q-boat . And the story of those Q-boat men I believe I can best tell by quoting from a letter I received about nine months after San/my told me his experience . The letter is not from Sans-my , but from another one of my commanders . I know you have heard about them and probably saw some of them as you came through the danger zone ; and I feel sure I am doing no wrong in writing about them . We 've had a type of boat ? war boat ? known as the ' Q ' type . They look like old crooks , and go out looking for Fritz with a vengeance . And they 've got a lot of Fritzies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show himself and shell them , and then the merchant crew would abandon the Q-boat and row away . Fritz would close up . Then the Q-boat would drop her fake topsides and have a go at him . You see , the point was to get Fritz close in by making him think the Q-boat had been abandoned . Well , Fritz got on to it after a bit , and the German Admiralty warned the Naval Reserve men who man the Q-boats , as to just what would happen . So a man going out in a Q-boat took his life in his hands . Some time ago , when entering port , I met one of your old friends , now a lieutenant-commander in the Reserve , and he told me the cheerful news that Fritz had bagged four Q-boats that week and done what he said he 'd do . Judas ! Can you imagine this in a civilized ( ? ) day , to lash men to the rail of a submarine , pour paraffine over them , and set them on fire ? No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Q-boat crews , with the exception of one boat-load whom he made stand by while he did it , and then sent them into port to tell their story . Of course the object is , by terrorism , to do away with the Q-boats ; but , bless my soul ! the more of such stuff Fritz does , the more men of England there are to volunteer for Q-boats . Yes , Fritz lashed the crews of the Q-boats to the railing of his submarine ? oiled them well ? lighted them , and to make sure they 'd burn steamed around in a circle , ? steamed around the lifeboatload of men lie sent into port to tell the tale . Since Ernest told me the tale , I 've beard it in many quarters , and it 's true ? true as I 'm a living being . Everybody knows about the Belgian Prince and the Westminster , and I feel the world should know of this . Sammy , on that peaceful Sabbath off the coast of Spain , did not see the ac-tual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . He was spared that horrible experience , thank God ! It was a British Naval captain who told me a story which has come out in the British press , of a chap ? a junior officer on an Atlantic liner in peacetimes ? who acted like the famous Spartan youth with the fox . All hands were lying flat on deck as the German ' sub ' began shelling the Q-boat . A shot passed into the latter 's hold , and set her on fire . The merchant-ship officer was lying flat on top of the hatch , above the fire . If he got off , it would give the Q-boat game away to the submarine ; so the man lay there as the smoke came up around him , knowing full well that there was ammunition in the hold , that there would be an explosion , and that his chances of living were very slim . The explosion came ; but , as luck would have it , the man on top of the hatch was not killed , simply horribly mutilated , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital he was ordered to report , just as he was , at the Admiralty in London . He had on an oil-skin coat and looked much the worse for wear . It was a Sunday , and the Admiralty at once dispatched him , in spite of his protests , to Sandringham , where the King 's carriage met him at the station and took him to His Majesty . And , wearing an oil-skin coat , he received the Victoria Cross from George V , after which the King and Queen showed themselves the democrats they are by treating the embarrassed merchant officer as human beings in ordinary life treat each other . And not only ' that , but His Majesty refused to let him return to London that night , and lent him a pair of his pyjamas . Until after he got rid of that blessed cargo of T.N.T . at Genoa ; had reached Alexandria , with three Sundays passing and nothing happening outside the ordinary humdrum of ship life ; had nosed through the Suez Canal , and was well on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't draw a free breath or appreciate that God was still in his heaven . It was on Sunday , while he was preparing to sail from Colombo for ? Hong Kong , that the big Warwickshire passed him , her decks lined with passengers . Half an hour later she had struck a mine laid by a Swede the night before . And the following Sunday , as the Cephalonia was making Hong Kong and the chief was getting his gear ready to work cargo in the morning , the intermittent whirring of the winch outside his cabin door attracted Sammy 's attention . He had just dressed himself in a clean set of ' whites , ' to meet the boarding officials . As the winch continued its song in a manner not quite in accordance with the usual tune of a well-oiled winch , Sammy stepped out on deck to satisfy his curiosity . As he did so , he felt a drop of what he supposed to be rain strike him ' in the face , and then another and another . Ile thought it kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . Suddenly he noticed that his ' whites ' were covered with red spots . His foot struck something . He saw it was a heart , and looking at the winch ? well , Sammy said he simply stepped over to it and shut it off . Some nerve , believe me ; for it was what he saw on the drum of that winch which had made him say to me at the beginning of this story , that ' to see death come quickly before one 's eyes , surely that is the most incongruous thing in the world . ' Before his eyes a poor blighter of a coolie had gone to his happy hunting-ground , while the sun was alight in the heavens and nature showing her beauty in the dazzling spray , always moving , always catching the sunbeams and dazzling everything with color . ru From Hong Kong the Cephalonia went to Shanghai , and then on to Yokohama and up to Vladivostock ; and Sundays ? four ? came and went peacefully . The only incident out of the ordinary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship 's chest for the wherewithal to buy trousers for his Lascars , as Vladivostock was cold as Greenland . And when I think of // what he told me about Vladivostock and what has happened in Russia since , I can well understand why the Japanese and British have landed troops there . For Vladivostock , as far back as January , 1917 , was a veritable gold mine of war-supplies . The docks and warehouses were bulging with them , and for miles back of the town were mountains of goods , ever increasing in number and height as ship after ship unloaded . And for Germany to bring her diabolical efficiency to the management of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and get that war-material , would be a world-calamity indeed . From Vladivostock the Cephalonia dropped south to Manila , and two months of Sundays had passed with nothing happening except the worry in the hearts of her crew that something would . And when the Sunday came that that something did happen , it cost the lives of two men ? her carpenter and the mate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , putting his soul in the letter to his missus that he hoped to get off from Colombo by the homeward-bound mail-ship , when the chief officer reported that the chief steward had gone down to the chill-room and had not come up again . Now , Sammy had been having trouble with ammonia fumes in that chill-room , and he and the chief officer looked at each other blankly for a moment and then their eyes involuntarily turned to the calendar on the wall . ' Sunday , March 11 , 1917 , ' branded itself on their souls . With the shrug of the shoulders which is typical of an Englishman when he is about to perform an unpleasant duty which might cost him life itself , Sammy rose and followed the chief out on deck and along to number 5 hatch . Matters had gone from bad to worse , for not only the carpenter and the mate of the hold , but the chief engineer , had gone after the chief steward , and none of them had returned . Sammy 's first order was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove all hands away from the edge . A derrick was speedily swung over the opening , and , planting himself in a bo's'n 's chair , Sammy was lowered into the bowels of his ship . There were any number of volunteers to go in his place ; but the little man preferred to take all the risk himself . As they lowered him , the ammonia fumes were blinding , and before his feet touched bottom he was in agony . Yet he groped along toward the entrance to the chill-room , till he stumbled over a body . Grabbing it , he signaled to the men above to hoist away , and soon appeared with the chief engineer , whose life he had saved by about two minutes . Two trips more Sammy made into the depths ; but he brought up only dead bodies , as the carpenter and mate of the hold had succumbed . And still there was the chief steward to be accounted for . Realizing that the man must be in the chill-room itself , on his next trip Sammy swung himself clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his nose to the floor where the fumes were less pungent , he wormed his way into the room , and in the stinging darkness of that icy chamber felt about for the steward . Each second most have been torture to him , wondering , if he wondered at all in the intensity of the situation , whether the next second would find him still alive . Yet the next did , and , with the indomitable courage of the Anglo-Saxon which German terrorism can not quell , Sammy fought on till he had got his man and dragged him to the outer hold , where somehow he tied a rope round him , and then lost consciousness himself as the limp body of the chief steward was hoisted upwards . It was Lancaster , the second officer , who rescued Sammy himself ; and as Fong , his Chinese boy , told me , exactly one hour later Sammy was at his desk again , writing his missus as if nothing had happened to mar the gloriousness of a Sabbath at sea . There 's the Englishman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Navy , no doubt Ile would have been gazetted and have got the V.C. But being only a simple merchant-skipper , who had done nothing more than transport troops overseas and dodge submarines in order that England should not starve , his risking his life as he did in number 5 hold was not glorious enough to be publicly recorded . After leaving Colombo , the secret orders that Sammy opened once he was outside , lengthened his voyage home by sending him to Durban , Natal , for coal , and round the Cape of Good Hope rather than via Suez . And on Easter Sunday , 1917 , in the English Channel , the Cephalonia had one of those fights with a submarine which only a merchant skipper on a poorly armed ship seems to know how to carry on . It was a two-hour fight , and , heavily laden with foodstuffs as the Cephalonia was , it was a case of touch and go with her , as she had only one gun aft and that but a 4.7 , which was outranged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval crew on board except two youthful gunners who had to depend on the orders of a merchant-ship chief officer and the untrained assistance of the other officers . The Cephalonia was in the Chops of the Channel , and all hands expected that , ere the sun had set on Easter , they would be safely tied to a dock , and that some of them would get a chance of going to church with their wives that evening . It was Lancaster , leaning over the starboard side of the bridge-rail and scanning the white-capped sea , who first spotted Fritz 's periscope ; and it was Sammy who had the Cephalonia turning toward that stovepipe inside of twenty-five seconds . If Fritz had had but another two minutes , the CephaMama would have been abreast of him and he would have got her . As it was , he had to come to the surface to save himself from being rammed . And then the fun began in earnest . The U-boat encircled Sammy , trying to get in a position to launch a torpedo , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every fibre in his body alert , every corpuscle in his veins fighting mad , Sammy kept swinging the sluggish Cephalonia about , so that her bow was always pointed toward his enemy ; and he took the shelling until Fritz had got himself into a position where Sammy could safely swing around and give his gun-crew a chance to go into action . And zigzaging over the sea sparkling in the glory of the morning sun , running the risk of being cornered by a second or third U-boat , the Cephalonia put up such a fight that her antagonist was forced to get out of range of the 4.7 on her stern . Yet Fritz could still reach her with his shots , which tore gaping wounds in her steel sides . Sammy took his punishment , and as his fire became less , the U-boat got more daring and ventured closer , only to be driven out of range again . As Sammy said , with a laugh , that gun crew of his were damned poor marksmen . ' They should have sunk the blighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains enough to give merchant-ship crews a little gun instruction . Finding that he could not get near the Cephalonia or stop her with solid shells , Fritz began to give an exhibition of Kultur by peppering her with shrapnel . It fell about her like hail , embedding itself in her decks , puncturing ventilators , tearing awnings into ribbons ; and a piece lodged in Sammy 's leg . He was the only one hit on the ship , and though he stood there on the bridge , with a pool of blood about him , the little man sent his ship this way and that for half an hour , until the Hun gave it up and made off after a tanker which had appeared on the horizon ? a victim that he ' got , for Sammy heard the bang and saw the tower of water shoot up over her .
