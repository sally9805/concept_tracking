txt One of New York 's most prominent bankers gives expression to the following views : " The Teutonic nations have been willing to concede a vast extent of Austrian territory to Italy in order to keep that country out of the war , and it is inconceivable that Germany will not make the concessions demanded by the United States in order to keep America from joining the Allies . Germany has everything to lose and nothing to gain by bringing this country into the conflict . Should there be a declaration of war by Germany , its chief effect would be to unite Americans of all shades of opinion , give a solidarity that we have long lacked , assure the success of measures for national defense , and give a new impulse to business . Our crops are planted , so that , barring unfavorable weather conditions , and these so far are exceedingly favorable , nothing can interfere with the prospect for a big harvest . " In the past eight months we have paid off $400,000,000 of indebtedness , bought $224,000,000 of foreign obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American securities formerly held abroad . Our Fresent financial position is unassailable , and this country could complacently contemplate any expenditure which might be involved by a rupture of diplomatic relations with Germany . " I do not conceal the fact that German hatred of the United States is only a little less intense than that of Great Britain . Towards the French the feeling is now riuite different . Germany is at present trying to make love to France . but the latter will not reciprocate . Re , Tarding the feeling towards this country in Germany . I PM speaking from knowledge ; but I do not think that . much as Germans might like to make war on us. they will he rash enough to do it . I am a Republican : but regard the Wilson note as admirable , and I look for a conciliatory reply . "
