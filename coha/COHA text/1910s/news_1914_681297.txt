txt AMERICANS IN EUROPE . Why Government Should Take Measures to Bring Them Home . In view of the cancellation of steamship sailings , both here and ' ' abroad , with thousands of Americans now in Europe unable to book passage for returning to the States . it would seem that this Government should take a hand in the matter , and utilize the army transports now under the supervision of the Quartermaster ' s Department for this purpose . Some of these vessels were regular passenger steamers of large tonnage before bein6 taken over by the Government during the Spanish war , and would be well adapted for such service . Tho writer deems It the duty of this Government to provide the necessary facilities in such a case for the return of our cilizens who may be held up by the present deplorable conditions in Europe . as was recently done during the Mexican troubles in Vera Cruz , at which time the Government chartered several steamers for this purpose , besides sending a number home on vessels Of war .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
