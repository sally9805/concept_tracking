A JOURNEY TO CATARACT CREEK CANYON OURS was no triumphal entry as we toiled our weary way through the little village of Havasupai Indians , in the bottom of Havasu , or Cataract Canyon , 5o miles west of the Bright Angel trail , in the Grand Canyon , one of us astride a mule as weary as ourselves , the other walking , while one of our two pack-burros , with his precious load of cameras and dry plates , stampeded down the road , trying to shake off some yelping curs that were following at his heels . The other burro , meanwhile , was standing his ground and was circling after his particular opponents , striking at them with his fore feet with all the celerity of a boxer . Many of the 20o natives were amusedly watching the performance . They especially enjoyed our own efforts to appear unconcerned and yet keep our eye on the pack of vicious dogs that had rushed upon us so suddenly . Some young bucks , frequent visitors to the Grand Canyon , grinned and nudged each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the mule , as a clog finally laid hold of his heel . The dog flattened himself out on his belly as the mule 's feet twinkled harmlessly over his head . Then " Captain Burro " came out with a club and stones and drove the dogs to  | the bushes . The Captain was an old acquaintance , as were many of the other Indians , and this time at least we were glad to see him . Extending his hand in greeting , with his thinlipped gash of a mouth spread in his most amiable smile , he inquired not after our health , as you might anticipate , but if we had " plenty sugar , " for the Captain was an inveterate beggar . Telling him to come to the camp the next morning , we resumed our journey down the road , as we wished to camp a half mile below that evening . Before we could reach this point we had to cross a rushing creek two or three times . It was with difficulty that we persuaded the burros to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with a violent scramble for the opposite shore . We wondered many times how our plates were faring . Havasu , or Cataract Creek , is a beautiful stream amid wildly picturesque surroundings . Havasu , freely translated from the language of these natives , signifies " blue water , " and when combined with " pai . " meaning people , gives them the very poetical name by which they are known ? the People of the Blue Water ? much more poetical , we think , than their dirty appearance warrants . Havasu Creek is formed by the sudden appearance above the earth of an underground stream ; the exact location of its emergence changing from time to time , but always within a small radius a short distance above the village . Many miles above this place , at a point where caves and sunken rocks make an opening , the water can be heard far below the surface , rushing through its underground chan- nel . The water is heavily impregnated with mineral magnesium , lime , and silicate ? which are deposited on everything it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch or more in diameter delicate ferns and moss still show their green under newly formed coverings of semi-transparent alabaster . In many places a temporary barrier has caused the water to pause in its headlong flight ; then , coral like , it proceeds to build higher and higher , forming Toofoot precipices , over which it hurls itself . Enormous stalactites hang suspended underneath a sheen of water , giving the whole scene a beautiful , withal a most unreal , appearance . BRIDAL VEIL FALLS Such a fall occurred just above the place we camped that evening . Some one , wishing to be entirely original , had named it the " Bridal Veil Falls " ( see page too ) . At the village above , the walls were 3,000 feet high and about half a mile apart . leaving a fertile bottom to the canyon . At this first fall the walls narrowed until they were scarcely a hundred yards apart at the bottom , the lower walls going up sheer . Large cottonwood trees were scattered over the bottom ; ferns and moss clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself over everything within reach . We felt well repaid for our two days of hard work to reach this lovely place ; the most beautiful lateral canyon of all those that enter into the Grand Canyon . It had been a fatiguing journey to reach this camp. , which would be our headquarters for the next few days . Feed for the animals had been scarce , and the one little spring of water found at the head of the trail above the village was disgusting . " Topocobie , " the Indians call it , the equivalent of " bad water , " which it certainly was . Even the burros sniffed suspiciously at it . The half-decayed carcass of a horse , which had been shoved off the trail above , did not add to the general beauty of the locality . Our camp here at the bottom was all the more enjoyable for this reason . The burros were now in clover , or at least in grass , up to their knees . Also they were . sure of a three or four days ' rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was up to us to do the hard work . The Indian agent had given us the keys t some buildings at this place , telling uthat we could safely store our belongingtherein while we were absent . Our material was placed inside , but we preferred to sleep outside on the dry ground . PHOTOGRAPHING AN INDIAN Early the next morning Captain Burr dropped in for his promised sugar , an : any other little gratuity we should care to add . We bribed him to pose for us while we made a photograph ; but his typical Indian face , aged and wrinkled , was spoiled by a dirty and dilapidated costume of " civilized clothes . " On a similar occasion , several years later , on hioffering to allow us to make his picture . we informed him that we did not care for an Indian in a white man 's garb that we wanted him in Indian clothes such as he used to wear long ago . He was on hand the next morning , ready for the picture . The clothes were hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a splendid physique , in spite of his great age , and he earned the dollar we paid him for posing . It was a chill ) September morn , and the mist rising from the falls gave him an uncomfortable shower bath ( see page zoo ) . The remainder of this first clay was spent in exploring the wonders near at hand . A ' deep inner canyon entered on the right of the falls , with walls about 300 feet high , very narrow , and straight as a well . It is reported that the Indians formerly cremated their dead , together with all their belongings , on the cliff above , then threw their ashes into this canyon . Numerous tunnels and prospect holes were bored into its sides . Many years before great quantities of lead and silver ore had been mined and packed out of this place . In more recent years another company was organized to prospect the canyon for platinum . This company built the houses we had entered the night before .  | A DANGEROUS WATERFALL A mile down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being credited with a drop of over 18o feet ( see page 101 ) . It was 30 feet wide , the water going over in a solid wall , not spreading , as did the upper fall . The first party of miners met with a fatality here , one of their number , Mooney by name , losing his life by the breaking of a rope with which he was being lowered to the bottom of the falls . The mining company had provided a passage around the falls in a spectacular manner . A sloping cave in the travertine , or deposited mineral , had been enlarged , and a winding stairway was hewn out of its sides . In two places an opening had been made in the sides , allowing a view of the falls . These openings were spacious , and compared well with a box in a theater . Large stalactites hung pendant from the walls , and gave the whole scene an enchanting appearance . A short distance below the fall an iron ladder was erected 200 feet up the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enlarged by the miners . It was held by spikes inserted into holes drilled into the walls , then wedged with wooden pegs . We had a creepy feeling when one of these allowed the ladder to swing outward a few inches as we climbed it . THE INDIAN AT HOME We visited the Indians ' homes where we thought we were welcome . Their houses were merely a few logs leaning together , overlaid with willows , and with a covering of red earth over all . We saw a few fig trees and many apricot and peach trees . Some of the latter were in bloom , for this was the month of May . At one place we found a very old blind squaw , alone except for her dogs . She was busily engaged in carrying some corn from one building to another , guiding herself with a rope tied between the two structures . Several years after this visit a cloudburst at the head of the canyon caused a number of storage dams to give way , the waters sweeping down through the unfortunate village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every house in the place was washed away . This fact is merely noted in passing , because it gives some idea of the violence of the storms which sometimes occur in this country . The following day we prepared for the hard trip to the river , 6 miles below our camp . First we loaded our plate-holders , using one of the ' tunnels for a dark room . We have seldom had a better one . Then , with our cameras , food , and equipment packed on our backs , we set off down the canyon . As we descended , the walls grew higher and closer together ; the stream had increased in volume until it was more like a small but turbulent river ; the foliage everywhere blocked our path . We had to cross the stream several times . At times we would attempt to walk on the mineral deposit . Often this would crumble under our feet , and we would be plunged into the deeper water , our cameras being saved by holding them above our heads . After about five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 200 feet high at our camp , now towered above us to a height of 2,000 feet ; then they sloped back and up again to a total height of 4,500 feet . When we finally reached the river ( see page 104 ) we found that much the same condition obtained there , the walls directly above the river being almost sheer for 2.500 feet , with only a ledge or two to break their sides ( see pages 104 and 105 ) . We afterwards discovered the trails of mountain sheep on these ledges . DETERMINING AVENUES OE ESCAPE In all our excursions to distant parts of the Grand Canyon we always endeavored to reach the river and locate these possible avenues of escape from it , for some day we intended to descend the stream in boats , as Major Powell had done in 1869- ' 71 , and our knowledge of these places might prove to be valuable . We were two weary but happy travelers when we dragged our feet into camp that night . The distance traveled was scarcely more than 12 miles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulders , and cataracts ? about as much as an  | ordinary person would care to tackle in one day . NO ROYAL ROAD There is no royal road for the person who would explore the canyon 's hidden secrets . Enthusiasm in unlimited quantities is a most needful qualification ? enthusiasm in spite of discomfort , fatigue , and toil ? all to gain what may be a doubtful goal . Looking back over our 12 years of experience at our work , we do not remember having ever made an easy trip in the canyons , unless we counted those made down the Bright Angel trail , beside our home , and we do not count those , for they can easily be done in one day . After having satisfied ourselves with the beauties of Havasu ( Cataract Creek ) , we prepared to return . We left the agency about noon . A cold wind was blowing up the canyon and it was raining a little . On top we could see that it was snow instead of rain . We had no desire to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for cold weather at that time of the year . By the time we had climbed the 15 miles of trail it was quite dark , and 5 or 6 inches of snow , very wet and heavy , had fallen . The burros would have all the water they needed this trip . We imagined that if we could get away from the rim ? as the canyon 's edge is usually termed ? that we might get out of the storm belt , for often these storms hover over the gorge and spread back but a short distance . It was to p. m. when we stopped ? we could hardly say camped . The snow did thin out some , but still there was plenty , and the ground was very wet . We had been enjoying a month of fine weather previous to this trip , and a snowstorm that late in the season was entirely unexpected . There were no sheltering rocks ; our two blankets made a very poor bed , and we slept but little that night . On the following day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detour to the Bass , or Mystic Springs , trail , as we did on a later occasion . Three or four miles up this trail , which is one of the wonderful parts of the canyon , a great boulder , loosened from above , has fallen into a side canyon and lodged there close to ' the top ( see page 106 ) ? just one of the many things that go to make this section of the country something entirely out of the ordinary . STORM AND ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS IN THE GRAND CANYON We walked most of the 30 miles covered the next day , for the roads were slippery and difficult for the animals ; also it was the only way we could keep warm . It was nearly midnight when we reached home and hurriedly pulled the packs from the burros . The pleasurable thrills we experienced the following day when we developed our plates more than made up for any discomfort we may have experienced . More than that , the great amount of moisture in the atmosphere had formed into clouds which collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling it from bank to bank . It was a rare and wonderful sight . The rising sun tinting the tops of the billows made it look not unlike the whirlpool of Niagara , but on an immense scale . These clouds hung in a layer or stratum about 400 feet thick ; above the clouds everything dazzled in the sunlight ; underneath it was a cloudy day , About noon the clouds became heated ; they rose and disappeared , collecting again on the following night ( see pages to() and 114 ) . These storm and cloud effects of the spring form some of the most interesting phases under which the canyon can be seen . A few hours after the sun comes up every vestige of the snow has disappeared ; in two or three days the clouds lift and vanish , leaving a clear , blue sky , destitute of every vestige of a cloud . Even in midwinter much the same condition holds true . It is not often that the snow descends below the inner plateau , as it is changed to rain as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen to the river itself . The nights at such times are quite cold on top , the thermometer tarrying somewhere near the zero mark .  | The canyon is just as beautiful as before , but differently so . THE EFFECT OF SNOW The snow hangs in clusters on the trees and bushes ; then the rocky walls and the peaks in the canyon change their coats of many colors for a robe of purest white . Every hint of mist or haze disappears from the gorge below . The distant views of the mountains and canyon walls , ever deceptive in this rarefied atmosphere , are brought unbelievably near ; the opposite wall of the canyon , although many miles away , looms directly before us ( see pages 112 and 113 ) . All is quiet and impressive ; a junco flits across our path ; a nut hatch tips on cedar or pinon , but beyond that there is no suggestion of life or motion . Equally as interesting , but of an entirely different nature , are the rains of July and August . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms ? coming from one cloud ; or it may be a cloud-burst a half mile away , while the sun continues to shine in other sections of the canyon . The preparations for these storms are often spectacular . The hour , we will say , is noon , with the sun shining directly against the north wall ? the most uninteresting time of the day . The sky is cloudless ? an infinite space of deepest blue ; the heatwaves shimmer from the rocks . Suddenly from below the horizon a round , white cloud pops up . Pops is the right word , for a minute ago it was not there . It is not part of the sky behind it , but hangs suspended like a great balloon , or a circle of white mosaic against a blue background . Others then appear , these last being shoved up by a great thundercap , snowy white above , black and forbidding beneath . Then , like a flying squadron these clouds go sailing across the sky . Other clouds have appeared from nowhere in particular ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north ( see page 116 ) . There they rest , for the north side is from 1,000 to 1,400 feet higher than our 7,000 feet elevation , and they seem to have reached their destination . THE STORM KING REIGNS A boom of distant thunder rolls up the canyon , losing itself in the many side gorges . A little feathery rain breaks from one end of the clouds , but rises again in mist before it reaches the lower altitudes . Jagged streaks of lightning pour from the clouds and the storm spreads . Thunder crashes as though the cliffs themselves were falling , the echos continuing to reverberate long afterward . Then the rain begins in earnest . In a half hour the walls are deluged and angry ; red-colored streams run off their sides . Waterfalls , the color of blood , poor from the plateau into the river over a thousand feet below . A glance through the telescope reveals a mad , foaming torrent hurling logs down the beautiful Bright Angel Creek of an hour previous . In a short time the storm has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun , even if it has been obscured temporarily , now comes out again . Rainbows appear double , and even triple in the gorge beneath . The moisture rises in the form of vapor ; collects in a cloud which hugs the higher peaks , or drifts in long strings when they strike the cooler air strata . An Arizona electrical storm at night is a sight long to be remembered . Our little studio is so favorably located that we look into the very depths of the gorge , and can view these effects without being exposed to their fury . Many times we have worked from our veranda , exposing plate after plate in trying to record the electrical flashes . They are often disappointing ; sometimes the flash will divide the plate entirely in two , beginning and ending out of the range of the plate or on either side of the angle of the lens . We also find that a single flash seldom brings out the formations in the canyon as we want them to show in the printed picture . Our most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , thereby getting the benefit of the flashes of heat lightning as well as those of the stronger electrical flashes , the two combined giving us the illumination we want ( see page 117 ) .  | The account of our trip to Cataract Canyon , briefly detailed , gives an idea of our methods of reaching the little-visited portions of the canyon . We usually use burros in preference to the faster animals , because they are well adapted to the photographer 's needs . We nearly always walk , but if we do ride or drive it is only on the level roads away from the canyon edge . The burro is quite easy to care for in sections where there is little feed ; they get along on very little water , and our photographic material comes home in much better condition than when packed on a horse or mule . When any climbing has to be done , the burros are hobbled in the best grass available and are left to shift for themselves until we return . If this happens to be on the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance of wild burros , hundreds of which have their homes in the Grand Canyon . These wild burros are descended from a few which gained their freedom from some of the prospectors who were in this region twenty years or more ago . OLD PROSPECTORS TRAILS At this point we might also remark that all completed trails leading to the bottom of the Grand Canyon were originally constructed by these same prospectors , or miners . They led to places that gave promise of developing into valuable mineral properties . In a few cases the miners realized something from their experimental work : in other cases , they were doomed to disappointment . When travel ceases over a trail it soon washes out , and only a slight trace remains after a few years of neglect . This is true of the French or Tanner trail , the original Hance trail , and in a greater or lesser degree of one or two others . The one notable exception to this rule is the Cameron or Bright Angel trail , the only trail over which there is any continuous travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county , which looks after the upkeep of the trail ; and as there is a total of 7.000 people yearly who make the journey on muleback , it has been changed and repaired until it is well-nigh perfect . It is so favorably located that it is less than seven miles in length , yet it reaches the river without any alarming grades , such as are usually found on mountainous slopes . There are signs of ancient Indians at every point where it is possible to scale the sides of the canyon , these natural breaks being separated from each other in nearly every case by many miles of unscalable walls . We have , however , yet to see any evidence of an Indian trail that a horse could be taken over . They ( lid not understand the use of explosives . and no trail to the bottom of the canyon can be made without a liberal and intelligent use of giant powder , aided with pick and shovel . The remnants of these washed-out trails , crude as they are , aid us greatly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvon and its tributaries . II THE CATARACTS OF THE LITTLE COLORADO THE oldest , least known , and in many ways one of the most interesting of the trails that lead into the great water-hewn chasm is that known as the French , or Tanner , Trail , located about 15 miles below the mouth of the Little Colorado River , which marks the beginning of the Grand Canyon . Just when this trail was first worked , and by whom , it is difficult to state . There is no doubt that it was opened by some of the earliest Mormon pioneers who had settled in the country adjacent to southern Utah previous to the time when John D. Lee took up his residence at Lee 's Ferry at the beginning of Marble Canyon , some 65 miles above the canyon of the Little Colorado ( see page 12t ) . F. S. Dellenbaugh , in his interesting story of Major Powell 's second exploration in 1871 , records the fact that they found an abandoned log cabin built close to the river 's edge even at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these adventurous pioneers . A few miles above is a prominent ledge containing copper and other ores of more or less value , but sufficiently interesting to a mineralogist to induce far- ther prospecting . The Mormons have many tales of the nuggets of gold that John D. Lee brought from his hiding place in the canyons , and even today the hunt goes on for this mine , which may or may not exist . Our interest in the early history of this trail is merely passing ; what did interest us was the fact that we had been told that it was still possible to get animals over the trail , and even to follow up the gorge itself to the mouth of the Little Colorado . So thither we went one day in May , for we had heard rumors of photographic possibilities in that section ; besides , we needed a change , and we always look on these journeys , hard as they usually are , in the light of a vacation . VIEWED FROM THE CANYON EDGE Before descending the trail we skirted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desert View . What a stupendous view it was ! Owing to a bend in the gorge , there is more of the Grand Canyon visible from this point than from any other single view . Far to the west we could see the top of the canyon wall where it makes its northern turn close to Havasu Canyon . Seventy miles of river lay coiled up in that one view , vet so fully was it hidden that we only caught a glimpse or two directly in front of us . Still beyond that farthest wall were the volcanic cones of Mt . Trumbull , Mt . Dellenbaugh , and others . Directly across the canyon was Cape Final , the extreme end of Greenland Point , that 2o-mile-long peninsula which extends into the canyon from the north . To our right we could look into the very mouth of the Grand Canyon , and on past into Marble Canyon as well . Over to the southeast , and considerably below us , stretched the Painted Desert , brighter in color than the canyon itself , slashed through with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stretched the Vermilion Cliffs , the wonderful fault or fold which crosses the Colorado River ? visible from this point even to the head of Marble Canyon ? while farther yet , I20 miles away , Navajo Mountain raised its rounded dome above the desert . The Coconino forest to the south ended only when the San Francisco peaks hid them from view . The mere cataloguing of figures , however , gives no idea of the canyon . No description will make another see the subtle , elusive colors , as they shift and change with each hour of the day ; no word picture will make another feel the dizzy heights , the sublimity , and the grandeur of it all . On returning to the trail , after caching some of our provisions under a rock to save unnecessary packing , we each placed a 25-pound pack on our own backs , and with our bedding and provisions on Jennie , we set off down the trail . The upper wall of limestone , seldom very precipitous , was soon above us ; the cross-bedded sandstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was broken here , so that it was no more difficult than the wall above it . ROCK FORMATIONS The rock formations in all parts of the Grand Canyon down to the inner plateau are almost identical . The two formations already mentioned have an approximate width of i , 000 feet , the upper slope being covered with scrubby trees , cedar , and pinon pine wherever they can find a footing . These walls vary in color from a chalky white to a rich cream or buff . Next in order comes the red sandstone , a sloping wall of rock over 1,000 feet in thickness . This wall is seldom very difficult to climb . Of similar color on the surface is the next drop , a sheer wall of limestone , about 700 feet thick , and the hardest formation in the canyon . The red color in this limestone is only a stain from the sandstone above , and when broken it has a light-blue tint . Major Powell called this the marble wall , for he found it changed to marble in certain sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cross-bedded sandstone above are the two formations which present a problem to the climber or trail builder . In nearly every case where there is a trail the builders have taken advantage of a fault or displacement of rock ; but these faults are few and widely separated .  | Under the limestone is a bed of soft shales , 500 or 600 feet in thickness , a dark olive green in color , a covering of sage and cactus changing its hue but very little . The inner plateau , of which we have made previous mention , rests on this formation . It varies from onefourth of a mile to several miles in width , depending on the locality . Nearly all of the temples or peaks in the canyon rise from this base . With the exception of the little strip of canyon adjacent to the Tanner trail ( see page 118 ) , any canyon below the shale is quite narrow and very precipitous . This deep , narrow section is known as the Granite Gorge , perhaps the wildest and most forbidding part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost uniformly level , but this lower gorge is twisted and turned in every direction ( see page 131 ) . This granite is capped with a 200-foot wall of sandstone , a hard conglomerate rock which often overhangs the granite ; another very difficult formation to pass except where intermittent streams have broken it down . PAGE FROM A GEOLOGTST 'S DIARY We had neither of thes , two formations at the Tanne trail , for here was the on , notable exception to all thi : uniformity . Lnderneath thr green shales we find an im mense deposit of algonkian which , we are told , is the earliest form of deposited rock This section , or page it might be termed , seems to hold more of interest for the geologist than any other portion of this remarkable geologic book . We had no particular diffi culty in making the descent to the river , where we camped for the evening . On resuming our trip the following morning , we found enough difficult trail to make up for our brief respite . In low water it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . but the spring flood was on at this time . and that road was blocked . No trail had been constructed above the river on the steep slope but the numerous wild burros which roamed over this section had worn many little trails which went nowhere in particular , but crossed and recrossed each other in endless confusion . One of us would go ahead and figure out the best road , then the other would drive the burro up , scrambling and tumbling over the fallen boulders . After four miles of such traveling eye reached an abandoned miners ' camp on a level spot below a perpendicular cliff . Directly above the camp an enormous  | section of the cliff was separated from the main wall and leaned forward , hanging over the camp like the sword of Damocles , ready to fall any minute , so it seemed to us ? a most uncomfortable place to camp . The miners had tunneled into the walls in two or three places on both sides of the river , none of the tunnels being more than a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnels stained with copper and smelling strongly of sulphur . These claims are still held , and a certain amount of development work is done each year by two or three parties from the Utah side . A TEST OF NERVE From this point on to the mouth of the Little Colorado we slowly worked our way over one of the worst trails we have ever seen . The walls rose sheer above the river for 300 or 400 feet , then broke for a short distance into a steep slope. , boulder strewn and cut up with many gullies . Above this slope was another perpendicular wall ( see picture , page 121 ) ; 400 feet below roared the river . In two places large boulders all but blocked the trail . The burro , with her light but bulky pack , was very much frightened , and instead of swinging clear of the rocks , as they usually do , would shun the edge and catch the pack on the rocks . Twice she would certainly have gone over but for our assistance . One of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head , while the other staved behind hanging onto the pack harness , now shoving out a little to keep the pack clear of the obstruction , now pulling with all our might when it would catch and the burro would struggle to free herself . All this time we were carrying our own loads except when we laid them aside to engage in this more difficult task . It was hot down in that narrow gorge , and while the river was just below us , it was out of reach , and we felt the need of water greatly before we got off the ledge of rock . The wall towered above us to a height of 3,200 feet ; Chum Butte , directly across the river , raised its level top to an equal height , so that we were in a canyon of that depth , and less than half a mile wide at the top . It was late in the afternoon when we dropped  | down off the ledge to the level of the river close to the mouth of the Little Colorado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grand Canvon ; the section above , while nearly the same in appearance , is listed as Marble Canyon , for reasons previously given . THE LITTLE COLORADO RIVER An exclamation of surprise broke from us when we saw the Little Colorado . The water of the Colorado , now muddier than ever , and 5o feet above the lowwater mark , had dammed up the smaller stream into a deep , quiet pool half a mile or more in length . Its color was a deep indigo blue , and contrasted greatly with the water of the other stream . It is a pity that we have to record the fact that the water was strongly mineral and very unpalatable to the taste . The water in the Colorado , with all its mud and sand , was much preferable to it for drinking purposes . We had been told of a small clearing a short distance up the canyon , and found it as described . A small level spot had been cleared of willows and mesquite , and had been cultivated at some time many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff-dwelling , had been built under an overhanging wall . A plow had been packed in over this trail which we had found so difficult with our light loads . Cooking utensils and a coil of rope had been carefully concealed in a crevice in the rocks , then covered with sand and rocks . The wind , however , had blown enough sand away to reveal their hiding place . A DECOY TOR A SETTLEMENT It is quite likely that the person who had lived here was interested in prospecting , and was trying to raise enough vegetables for his own needs . Imagine living in such a place ! Still it is not unusual to find men in these out-of-the-way corners of the West , happy and contented with their lot , diligently searching for the fortune which they feel sure they will find before another week has passed . What a secluded spot it was ! Nothing disturbed the utter stillness of the air . The sun sets early in these deep canyons , and the intense heat of midday had moderated somewhat . After locating our camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where our attention was called to a peculiar noise . We had seen many mountain-sheep tracks in this vicinity , and thought for a while that the noise was caused by a slide of shale , but we could not locate any movement . Then Emery discovered what it was . On the opposite side of the pool the fins and tails of numerous fish could be seen above the water . The striking of their tails had caused the noise eye had heard . The " bony tail " were spawning . We had hooks and lines in our packs , and caught all we cared to use that evening . GILA TROUT They are otherwise known as Gila Elegans , or Gila Trout , but " bony tail " describes them very well . The Colorado is full of them ; so are many other muddy streams of the Southwest . They seldom exceed 16 inches in length , and are silvery white in color . With a small flat head somewhat like a pike , the body swells behind it to a large hump . Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body tapers down slender and round , ending with a large , strong tail . They are nicely flavored fish , but are filled with countless small bones which divide and subdivide until they are almost like needle points . As darkness settled over us that evening we began to wonder if our camp on the sand was to be as comfortable as we had anticipated . We had rejected the rock building as a sleeping place on account of the closeness of the atmosphere , added to the fact that it was the home of innumerable rats . As the hour grew late the absolute stillness of the air of an hour previous changed to a violent wind which went tearing up the canyon , laden with sand from the shores of the Colorado . Instead of diminishing in fury , as we had hoped it would , it kept increasing , coming first from one side , then from the other . We found that the junction of the canyons was the very center of the maelstrom of wind which  | poured in on us from all sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added its quota of sand , as if we did not have enough already to contend with . A REAL SAND STORM We had seen sand storms before , but none to equal that . It literally rained sand from the desert above . Our camp articles , which had been carefully placed on shelving rocks , were blown helterskelter over the place ; our bed , weighted down with stones , was the only refuge available , so we crawled into the blankets and covered up our heads , waiting for the passing of the storm . It is doubtful if the building could have been any more suffocating than our bed , covered up as we were . We both fell asleep after a while , and neither of us 4 mew just when the wind ceased . When we awoke all was as quiet as before the storm . The air , however , as is usual after these storms , was a brick-red color for two or three days . We had long anticipated the next day 's exploration . Prospectors had told us of having seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but imagined that it was not possible to follow up the bed of the river , as they had only seen them from above . We were anxious to photograph the cataracts also , to learn if it was possible to reach them by the river . We had taken the season when the water was low on the Little Colorado for that reason . Loading ourselves with the inevitable cameras and plates , a lunch , and a large canteen of muddy water from the Colorado , we began our journey , starting at an early hour , for we were sure that we had a hard day 's work ahead of us . The burro was left to await our return . A DANGEROUS TRAIL The trip was somewhat easier than we had expected to find it ; but it was hard enough , especially in spots . We took advantage of the shore wherever possible , sometimes finding long stretches of hard , firm sand on which we could make good time . It was quite different when we had to climb the canyon 's sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . Some of the sand , too , was very deceptive , and instead of being hard and firm , was treacherous quicksand . At times we spurted quickly over these places , resting on islands of solid rock , then would make another spurt . It would have been great sport but for the loads we carried . In other sections we shunned the deposit entirely , for it was very soft and slippery , being about the consistency of slacked lime or of lard . We managed to pass it all , however , by crossing the stream two or three times , climbing the banks where it was possible , and taking advantage of the fallen rocks which lined the river 's edge . About noon we reached the cataracts , which extended up the stream for half a mile or more ( see page 138 ) . The canyon walls were very narrow here , and about 2,500 feet high . We felt well repaid for our efforts . We not only secured our coveted opportunity , but had succeeded in doing what was commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledges to find that it was entirely feasible to make our way still farther up the canyon , but time would not permit . We knew from the rock formation that we were within a mile of a spot we had previously visited on our initial trip into the canyon several years before . Were it not for the fact that we had a burro and our camp to look after , we would have gone on up the canyon and climbed out as we did before . III SHOOTING THE RAPIDS OF THE COLORADO OUR photographic boating trip began September 8 at Green River City , Wyoming , where the U. P. R. R. crosses the Green River , hundreds of miles above our home in the Grand Canyon of Arizona . A glance at a map of the Southwestern States ( see page I53 ) will show our course down the Green and Colorado rivers . From Green River City , Wyoming , the river flows almost directly  | south for a distance of 60-odd miles ; then turning directly east shortly after crossing the State line into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses into Colorado at the extreme northwest corner . This is the only point at which the Green River or its successor , the Colorado River , touches the State of Colorado . It is a common mistake to confuse the canyon of the Grand River in Colorado with the Grand Canyon of Arizona . After making a loop about 25 miles in length , the Green River returns to Utah , flowing in a general south-southwest direction through the eastern part of this State . Four hundred miles below Green River City , at Blake , Utah , the stream is crossed by the D. &; R. G. R. R. Between these two towns there is only one village on the river where provisions could be obtained . This was at Jensen , Utah . WHERE RIVERS MEET Over Too miles b el o w Blake , Utah , the Green River is joined by the Grand , flowing in from Colorado . These streams , combined , form the Colorado River . The Colorado River , running in a more southwesterly direction , crosses into Arizona , after about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Colorado it changes its course and flows to the west , with many twists and turns . This is the section known as the Grand Canvon Finally it forms the dividing line between Nevada and California on the west and Arizona on the east . It empties into the Gulf of California , in Mexico , about Ioo miles from the U. S. line .  | Five parties had made the entire trip from Green River , Wyoming , through all the canyons to Needles , California . The first was Major Powell 's world-famous exploration in 1869 , supplemented by a second voyage two years later through all but about 125 miles of the Grand Canyon , where the second attempt was abandoned on account of high water . The second complete trip was made by Nathan Galloway , a trapper and hunter , with a companion named Richmond , about 1891 . The third was headed by Julius F. Stone , of Columbus , Ohio , accompanied by Galloway and two others . This trip was made in the fall and winter of 1909 , the party leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar own attempt . Two other parties had succeeded in making the journey through the Colorado River canyons , starting at Green River , Utah . These are usually referred to as the BrownStanton party and the Russell and Monnette expedition . The parties that have failed to get through the first short canyons far outnumber those who have been successful . RAPID-FLOWINH WATERS To get an idea of the descent of the Green and Colorado rivers , compare it with the St. Lawrence . From Lake Michigan to the Gulf this latter stream has a fall of 600 feet . This includes Niagara Falls , the Gorge Rapids , and many others . In an equal distance the Green and Colorado rivers fall 6,000 feet . Between the rapids there are many quiet stretches . These are formed by masses of falling  | rocks , which dam the river , or by lateral streams , which wash great masses of rock and debris into the stream during the flood stages . This often makes the water placid above ; but quite as often the water pours over these barriers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer us with tales of the others who had started out and were never heard from again . Several men , whom we had engaged to accompany us , from time to time , disappointed us when the time came to leave . The only one engaged who did show up was James Fagen , a young man inexperienced at " roughing it , " but strong , cheerful , and willing , and we were glad to have him along . We had wanted two assistants to help us with camp duties , photographic work , and in making portages around impassable rapids . With Major Powell 's record of over too portages , we had some idea of the work ahead of us . To offset the handicap of our small party we had , however , the benefit of the experience of the others who had gone through before us . Our boats , when loaded , weighed 1,200 pounds each , and looked like pretty big loads for one man to handle . The boats were flat-bottomed , but with considerable raise at either end . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers in each end . Our five cameras and a motion-picture camera were carried in these chambers ; likewise , a month 's provisions , photographic plates and films , and all necessary camp material . The oarsman sat in the open compartment , or cockpit , and the extra man on the deck behind . FLAMING GEORGE , HORSESHOE , AND KING-FISHER Though 16 feet long , the Edith and the Defiance looked small enough when compared with the width of the Green River  | when we started , for here it was 300 feet wide . We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly in the 6o miles of open country ? hunting and fishing or listening to Jimmie 's songs . He had a trained voice . His singing ceased for some reason or other shortly after we entered the canyons . There were no rapids of consequence in the first three canyons ? Flaming Gorge , Horseshoe , and Kingfisher Canyons ? but our tranquillity changed shortly after entering Red Canyon . The water was so low in Red Canyon that we struck many rocks , and we feared if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . Being built of cedar , less than half an inch thick , they cracked very easily . In swift water , where there were few rocks , the boats were taken through in the usual manner , by pulling clown stream ; but when running bad rapids the order was reversed and the boats were turned with the bow pointing up stream . In this way we could see where we were going , and by pulling against the current the velocity was checked . The boats , being flat-bottomed and having considerable raise at either end , could be turned very quickly , and enabled us to pull from side to side and avoid the rocks ahead of us . We had been informed before that some of these mountains were the hiding places of men who were " wanted " in the three States which bordered near here . Some escaping prisoners had also been traced in this direction ; but all signs disappeared when the mountains were  | reached . We found several secluded cattle ranches in these upper canyons . The young men seemed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seldom went out without a gun . They had secured some wild cats , coyotes , deer , and an occasional mountain sheep . INNOCENT HORSE THIEVES At one ranch we tried to buy some provisions . The men told us they would gladly supply us with what they had . In return they asked us to help them secure some of their horses from across the river , as their own boat had been taken out by high water . The horses were rounded up in a hidden valley , and were driven into the water ahead of the boat . After securing the horses , their welcome seemed to turn to suspicion , and they wanted to know what we could find in that wild country to interest us . We felt greatly relieved when we left them behind us . Soon after emerging from Red Canyon into Brown 's Hole we came to a deserted ranch . The doors were open ; furniture , pictures , and books were scattered all over the place . We had previously heard reports of a murdered man 's body having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this might be his home ; but we said nothing of this to Jimmie . Jimmie was worrying a good  | deal about our own troubles about this time . Below this we found several other deserted ranches . On asking the few people we met the reason , they gave us evasive answers . Finally one man said that the country was infested with desperados and cattle thieves , and that a person had to be in with them or was not permitted to remain there . Our informant was there for some reason or other . We were told that the man at the first ranch had been murdered two years before ; his body was placed in a boat and started down the river . We were also told that we were fortunate to get away from the ranch in the canyon with our valuables . The owner of this place had committed many depredations , and had served a term for cattle-stealing . Officers , disguised as prospectors , took em- employment with him , and helped him kill and skin some cattle . The skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried . The officers turned in their evidence against him , and he was convicted . This explained the strange actions of the men we had assisted . They thought we were trying a similar game . We had helped them steal eight horses and a colt ourselves ! In the lower end of Brown 's Hole we saw a great many beaver and numberless cottonwood trees that they had cut down ( see page 142 ) . On two or three occasions our boats narrowly escaped splitting on snags of trees which they had buried in the river . About the time we passed from Utah  | into Colorado a kind-hearted woman named Mrs. Chew informed us that they had a ranch at the other end of Lodore Canyon , which we were about to enter . She had a great fear of this short but dangerous canyon . Two of her sons had once attempted its passage . They lost their boat , and climbed out over the mountains , narrowly escaping starvation . LODORE CANYON , N. W. COLORADO Clouds had settled down into Lodore Canyon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most wonderful example in the known world of a river cutting through a mountain ( see page 143 ) . The river was here first . An upheaval took place across its course , but so slow that the sand-laden stream sawed its way through the rocks , keeping its old level . When we were one mile inside the canyon , its walls towered over 2,000 feet above us . A few miles further down is a rapid which Major Powell had named Disaster Rapid ( see page 146 ) . Here one of his boats , although made of one-inch oak , had been broken completely in two . We ran the upper part of this rapid , but found ourselves on some rocks below , and could not proceed on account of the low water . It was late and we had to camp on a low , rocky island that night . The next ( lay we proceeded to change our camp , running our camp material across on a trolley . The stream on this side , while small and rather shallow , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the boats was sent across , we proceeded to line the boats across , two men working on shore with the lines , while the other clung to the boat and maneuvered it . When ready to take the second boat across , the sun broke through for a short spell between the showers . MAKING A MOTION PICTURE UNDER DIFFICULTIES This was our chance to get a motion picture ; so I set up the camera and went to work , while the others worked with the boat . I was paying little attention to what they were doing . Suddenly I heard a call , and on looking up saw that my brother had been carried from his footing and was being swept clown the rapid . Jimmie had been holding the line on shore until the end was reached , then was instructed to go above to the crosing and join me . There was not a moment to lose . I caught up a rope and ran down the shore , reaching my brother , when a rock stopped the boat for an instant . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was fortunate he got out at this place . At Lower Disaster Rapid the stream almost disappeared under an overhanging wall ( see page 146 ) . A string , with one end attached to a rock and thrown from the shore to the wall , measured less than 25 feet . The remainder of the stream , which had been 300 feet wide in the flat country above , went under that wall . DANGEROUS RAPIDS The next clay we were not so fortunate . The Defiance , as my brother 's boat was named , was thrown on her edge on touching a rock , and was held there by the swift-rushing river . My brother saved himself by climbing onto the rock . I was having some difficulty in a whirlpool below and could not see him , but knew that something was wrong when a rubber bag containing a sleeping-bag came floating down the stream . ( immie had waded out in a pool at the end of the rapid and saved the boat . Ellsworth was quite close to the shore , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to shore . Leery plank on the bottom of the boat was split , and as I had received a similar upset that morning we pulled out on shore for repair . We had lost our two guns in the last tilt . They were too long to go under the decks . The cameras had all been in the muddy water , likewise our provisions . Some of our motion-picture film was lost . We placed all of our material on the shore to dry , as we were enjoying a brief period of sunshine . But it was short , for a deluge of rain , driven by a heavy wind , came sweeping up the canyon . We put up a small silk tent and got everything inside but it was long after midnight when we retired , after having repaired all possible dam- age . Landslides vied with the thunder , the wind , and the rain that night to add to our discomfort . And as we slept Jimmie rose up in his sleep and called , " There she goes over the rapids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise on the river . It was so muddy that fish were swimming on the top of the water , gasping for fresh water . We secured 14 by striking them with our oars . When suckers and catfish come to the top on account of mud in the water it is pretty bad . A test of the water showed that it contained 20 per cent of an alkaline silt . Afterward we found many dead fish , with their gills filled with this mud . We had suspected Jimmie of homesickness for some time . This day he told us his story . He had an invalid mother , and he had always looked after the needs of the family , aided by an older brother . When the proposition of taking the river trip came up , serious objections were raised by the family : but when the ticket came he concluded to go , with or without their consent . Now he feared that his mother would not live , or that we would be drowned , and that he would be left on the shore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us with tears in his eyes . No wonder he felt blue . We cheered him all we could , and told him we would send him out at the first opportunity . RUNNING THROUGH L0DORE The last place of importance in Lodore Canyon had been named Hell 's Half Mile ( see pages 146 and 147 ) . We thought it was all of that and then some . The entire stream was blocked by a lot of massive rocks , flung from the cliffs above in riotous confusion . This had happened at a point where the descent of the river was the greatest yet encountered . On the left side the barrier of rocks was crowned by a giant cottonwood once washed down on a flood , with its roots extending over the foaming torrent , which whirled and tore through every crevice between the rocks . We carried all the weight from the boats high above the rapids , climbing over mud-covered boulders , dodging under scrubby trees , sliding down recently washed-out gullies , staggering under the weight of the loads . Many times we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recent rise in the river , which had now receded , had left a slime of mud over these rounded boulders . Our clothes were torn to tatters . It took 18 loads to empty the boats . Carefully inflating our life-preservers and adjusting them , we then went to work on the Defiance . Our other experiences at working past difficult rapids were as child 's play when compared with this . At first , where the rapid was less violent , we lined the boat from the shore , or I rowed , pulling upstream , dodging here and there , while my brother held the line on shore , dropping her down as each threatening rock was passed . We struggled to retain our footing when standing , waist deep , in the water below protecting boulders , as we lifted the stern over a submerged rock , then slid the boat forward ( see pages 146 and 147 ) ; she would balance a moment , the bow would shoot into the air , then fall down with a thud and another rock was passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat ; the least misstep would plunge t is into the torrent . The life-preservers would have been of little use there . The rocks would soon batter one into insensibility . Even in less violent water the heavy sand collecting in the clothes soon sinks a swimmer , and a body once taken down in that manner seldom rises to the surface . When we came to the barrier , we concluded the only way to pass this in safety was to nail skids to an upright log which we found wedged between two large rocks at the end of the cottonwood tree . Both the log and the tree seemed to have been placed there for our convenience . In all this work there was only room for two , so we made use of this opportunity to get a motion picture ? the last we were to get with Jimmie 's assistance . During the breathing spells we would look up and find he was forgetting to tarn the crank . We would call to him , then all  | would go to work again . We kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bouyancy helping a great deal , as we lifted only one end at a time . Again we lifted the stern of the boat , then threw the rope from the bow over the root of the tree and tugged away until she was balanced on the skids . She was slid carefully forward , tipped slightly , then with a rush like that of a vessel on a greased runway she shot into the pool below , almost breaking away into what remained of Hell 's Half Mile . At the end of Lodore Canyon we found a small cabin occupied by an old man . Rumor had it that he was living this hermit 's life because he had engaged in a shooting scrape or two , and had been quicker than the others in pulling his gun . He was harmless enough when we found him , as he was feeble and childish . He had been in this section when Major Powell was making his survey , and had many interesting stories to relate of the early days . The disappointing thing about the stories was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the middle of his narrative and begin on something else . What interested us all more than anything else was that the Chew ranch was on the plateau above . When we arrived we found that Mrs. Chew had crossed the mountains and joined her husband and sons . When she saw us she exclaimed . " Why , boys , I thought you had passed here a week ago . " It had taken us eight days to get through 20 miles in Lodore Canyon , so you know we had some trouble . The river descends 42 feet in that short canyon . THROUGH EASTERN UTAH The Chews said they were going to Jensen , Utah , 40-odd miles away , on the following day , and gladly agreed to take  | Jimmie along . We were going to the same place by river . We traveled through Whirlpool and Split Mountain Canyons in two days ' time , just four hours behind Jimmie . We saw him off on the stage the next day , a very happy boy , bound for the railroad , 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with him , knowing it was in the best of hands . Two more canyons ? Desolation and Grey ? had to be traversed before we reached the D. &; R. G. Railroad . This is the point where Stanton and Brown , with their party , began their survey for a railway through the canyons of the Colorado . Mr. Brown and two of their companions were drowned in Marble Canyon above the Grand Canyon . Stanton , undismayed by these reverses , re-outfitted with heavier boats and completed the journey to the tidewater . Later it was the starting-point of the prospecting expedition composed of three men ? Russell , Monnette , and Loper . Records have been kept of nine other parties who have left this place for the passage through Cataract Canyon . Three men only escaped . The others simply disappeared . LABYRINTH AND STILLWATER CANYONS Few people know that parties are taken by motor boat down the Green River to its junction with the Grand , and part way up the Grand , and then by automobile to the railway . We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of seeing these wonderful canyons . All element of danger from rapids is removed from this 150-mile trip . Some of the scenery en route might be compared to the Garden of the Gods , but on a scale a thousand times greater and a thousand times more picturesque ( see pages 151 and 154 ) . At the junction of the Green and the Grand rivers we climbed out through a side canyon above Cataract Cannon . It was " The Land of Standing Rocks , " a country split , eroded , and cragged in every conceivable manner . There was little soil and scarcely any vegetation . The weird solitude , the great silence , the grim desolation seemed to affect us here more than at any place on the trip . We could drop rocks into the crevices , and watched them disappear into the darkness far below us . On going to the edge , 1,300 - feet above the Colorado River , we would find some of the rocks overhung 5o feet or more . JUNCTION OF THE GREEN AND THE GRAND RIVERS In Cataract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there must have been at least that many men who have attempted its passage and were never heard from again . ' We know one man who did climb out after losing his boat , and who existed for weeks on cactus and herbs until he was finally discovered . He is an able-bodied man today , but has practically lost his reason . The Colorado River at this place was ten times greater than the Green in the upper canyons , and the rapids were correspondingly more dangerous . We were surprised to find here tracks of some person who was ahead of us . That evening we caught up with the man who had made the tracks we had seen . IIe gave the name of Smith , admitted rather reluctantly that he was trapping , and did not appear greatly pleased to see us . Considering the fact that we were 15o miles from the last habitation , this struck us as being rather strange . GOING IT ALONE It was too late to go any farther that evening : so , as there was plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share our evening meal . After dessert , which happened to be some pineapple which we had kept for some special occasion , he became more sociable . He had started from Green River , Utah , one month before , lie told us . He had an old , rotten boat that one good wave would knock to pieces . He had made no attempt to run any of the twelve rapids we had passed that day , but held his boat with a chain and worked down in that manner . Once he had been dragged into the river , twice the boat had been upset he was engaged in drying out his tobacco  | when we found him . This was the only thing that seemed to worry him . He seemed to have no idea of the country below , but thought it was getting better . We told him what we knew of it , and , on the following morning , offered to take him through with us and help him with his boat , but he declined . It almost seemed like suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us if he ever got out of Cataract Canyon . As we proceeded on our journey we wondered more than ever if he had not made a serious mistake in attempting it alone . The rapids increased in violence and frequency ; the walls drew closer together and towered above us until they were over 2,000 feet high ; there was small chance to climb out . At one point the river descended 75 feet in threefourths of a mile . We had so many narrow escapes ourselves as we ran these rapids that we temporarily forgot all about Smith and his troubles .  | K-ROOM DIFFICULTIES We put up our small tent and camped at one place for two days , not only because I was not feeling well , but we wished to develop some plates and films as well . For this work our dark room , or tent , was hung inside the other tent , and we proceeded with our work just as though we were at home ? 3oo miles below us . We settled the mud in a bucket of water by placing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A substance which oozed out settled the mud and made the water sufficiently clear to develop our plates . A hole dug in the sand at the side of the river gave us water for cooking purposes , nearly as clear and in greater quantities than the method first mentioned . Rapid number 23 was just below this camp : it was one of the biggest drops of any in that section . We made moving pictures of each other in turns as the boats reeled and plunged over the cresting waves . We each had an extra oar knocked from our boat in this rapid , but recovered them a mile down stream in a whirlpool . PHOTOGRAPHING AN UNRULY SUBJECT The walls increased in height until they towered nearly 3,000 feet above us , the left wall being nearly perpendicular . To prevent our minds from dwelling too much on the dangers which surrounded us , Ave proposed having a little sport . The two boats were placed stern to stern and lashed together . My brother sat in the first boat and rowed down-stream . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow , holding the moving-picture camera down with my chin , turning the crank with my right hand , and clutching at the hatch cover with my left hand . In this way we passed over two small rapids . My brother said that the best picture would have been of myself as I rode the bucking boat over the turbulent water . This method was never tried when in the larger rapids . The last rapids in Cataract Canyon were the worst of all in some respects . The walls went sheer from the river on one side : the shore had almost disappeared from the other . Great boulders had dropped down and blocked one side of the channel . Twelve-foot waves overtopped and threatened to engulf us as we rowed into this rapid , carefully pulling away from the dangerous places . Put one danger was no sooner avoided than another jumped up before us . In the last rapid the shores disappeared altogether . An island lay in the middle of the rapid , but the stream on the left was entirely blocked with rocks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lot of fallen rock ; then it crossed to the opposite side and swept it clean . The rapid was much in the shape of the letter S. We rowed into this without stopping to look it over . First we pulled against the current , keeping close to the island , matching our strength and skill with the water which tried to drag us into the turn . This danger past , we pulled across the swift-running center , 6 or 7 feet higher than the water along the shores : then the opposite side was avoided in the same way , and we landed , breathless , on a shore below the rapid and proceeded to bail out with a grocery box which we kept under the seats . Then our thoughts reverted to Smith . What would he do when he came to this rapid ? The only escape was a narrow , sloping ledge beginning some distance above the rapid and reaching a height of 60 or 7o feet above the water at the lower end of the rapid . It would be possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of taking his boat up there was entirely out of the question , and , poorly equipped as he was , an attempt to run it would only end in disaster . The breaking of an oar , the loss of a rowlock , or the slightest knock of his rotten boat against a rock , and Smith 's fate would be similar to that of others whose bones were buried in the sands . OTHERS WHO HAVE TRIED Below Cataract , in Glen Canyon , we came to the Hite ranch and post-office , the first sign of human habitation for 175 miles , since leaving Blake , Utah . Mr. Hite had kept a record of the parties who had attempted Cataract Canyon and were never heard from again . On one occa- sion a man staggered into his door and fell to the floor . He said his companion was drowned , and that he had eaten nothing for a week but a horned toad and a lizard . Whether this was true or not , he was in a critical condition , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains . Elite promised to advise us if Smith ever reached there alive . The quiet waters of Glen Canyon were quite a rest after the torrents above . We found here many evidences of ancient Indians , who had reached the river through the side cannons . We found several ruined cliff dwellings , with broken pottery and arrow heads scattered about . There were strange pictographs of masked figures and of deer and mountain sheep on the walls ( see page 158 ) . Glen Canyon was filled with many curious rock formations , including arches and caves . It is in this vicinity that the natural bridges of southern Utah are found . It is not far from this point that Rainbow Natural Bridge was recently discovered . We thought we knew where it was and searched long and earnestly for the side canyon , but we had passed it be-. fore starting to look for it . It was a great disappointment , for we had been told it was only six miles from the river . We consoled ourselves with the thought that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . PATHFINDER.h In the middle of Glen Canyon we came to an old ford , known as the Crossing of the Fathers . Early in the fifteenth centry Spanish priests had taken the Indian trails leading to this ford and had crossed over into Utah . Thus this section was visited before the English settled on the James River ; yet how much does the American public know about it today ? While climbing out here we heard some hammering and blasting , but we traveled 15 miles down the river before we discovered what had caused it . We saw the strange sight of a half-built steamboat in the mouth of a little side canyon , with cliffs rising six or seven hundred feet above it . Between 15 and 20 men were at work putting it together . This boat was to be used to carry coal and driftwood to a placer dredge working at the head of Marble Canyon , 20 miles farther down the river . We reached the dredge that evening . This was at Lee 's Ferry . Thirty-odd men were at work here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads and told us of the great boulderfilled rapids in Marble Canyon , which they had seen from the cliffs above . GET THE PICTURE FIRST We had traveled less than one day below this place when we came to the famous Soap Creek Rapid ( see page 159 ) . It was just below this rapid that Mr. Brown had lost his life . Mv brother wanted to run Soap Creek Rapid , and suggested that I should make a motion picture as he came down , keeping a rope and life-preserver close at hand , so that I could run to the end of the rapid in case of an upset . Iris last instructions were : " If we upset , get the picture first . " I confess that l was shaking at the knees as he went back to prepare for the plunge . The rapid was a third of a mile long . I had set up the camera about 50 yards below the first dip . It seemed a long time before he came in sight above the rapid : but when once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two before he was opposite me , pulling with every ounce of strength to avoid the one rock that blocked his passage . For a moment it seemed that he would gain his goal ; then the Defiance was lifted suddenly by an unexpected wave ; she touched the rock for an instant and turned on her edge , then broke loose and turned upright again . The entire upset had occupied less than two seconds . I lost sight of my brother when the boat went over , but felt reassured on seeing him hanging to the gunwale and climbing in again as the boat righted herself . He scrambled for the oars , and brought her around just in time to avoid being taken into a cresting wave . The filled boat had lost her buoyancy and struggled through the foaming water . Time and again she disappeared from  | sight , and I wondered if she would sink ; but with the rhythm of a pendulum she rose each time she fell , getting smaller and smaller in the distance until the end of the rapid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was my brother 's question , and one which I found myself unable to answer . I knew that I had the start . I was just as certain that I had taken the long run after he had regained the oars , for I had carefully followed him , looking through the finder , but had no idea what I was doing when the boat upset . My brother was still determined to run the Edith through , feeling sure that his first passage gave him the experience necessary to handle it successfully . I advised waiting until morning , for it was now getting late in the day ; but he said " he would sleep better with the rapid behind us , instead of having to run it on the following morning , and with one boat below the rapid I could save him if it came to the worst . " While he walked back to the Edith I built a fire , then returned to my station in the Defiance . It seemed that he would never come . Finally he appeared above the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now in the gloaming and this was indistinct , but I could make out that he had missed his channel and was carried into a vortex of contending waves . He disappeared for an instant ; then the bottom of the boat , stern first , was shot out of the water and fell over , upside down . This was all I could see . Boat and all apparently had disappeared . I launched the Defiance and waited . Soon a dark line appeared rising on the waves . It was the bottom of the Edith . I listened , but if there was any call it was drowned in the roar of the water . The boat was gradually drawing nearer and I prepared to save her , having made up my mind that a dark object in the middle of the stream was my brother on a rock .  | ACROBATIC PHOTOGRAPHY Drawing close to the Edith , I heard a strangled call , and saw that he was hanging to the boat . A life-preserver was floating ahead of him and he was calling to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side and was pulling him into the Defiance . Then we caught the upturned boat just as we were carried into the next rapid , the rapid which had proved to be the last for Brown . There was no time to turn the boat upright , so we held to the rope to save her as she dragged us on and on into the darkness . It was a hard pull , but I made it , and kept clear of the overhanging rocks under which the current ran . But the Edith , filled with water , kept us from making the landing , and a mile of swift water was passed before we pulled into an eddy and tied the boats to a boulder . The lower end of Marble Canyon held many curious grottos ; in places the walls were honey-combed with caves . Some of these caves made excellent camping places , for the flood waters had been into them and had deposited a level floor of sand . Driftwood was piled up at the mouth of one of them , and a spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was early in the afternoon , we could not resist this invitation to camp , for it was snowing on the heights above and a cold wind blew up the cane on . The ' only disturbing element at this place was the roar of another rapid just below . When lying in our beds the noise made by the water was terrific , and we would imagine we heard all sorts of impossible things , such as crying children , women screaming , and the shrieking of the wind . On rising up in our beds it would once more be the roaring of the rapid . We could plainly hear the rolling of rocks as they turned over and thumped against one another . The walls of Marble Canyon fell sheer for hundreds of feet in many places , the gorges at these points being very narrow ( see pages 163 , 164 , 166 ) . In one place we recorded a high-water mark 107 feet above the low water on which we were traveling . IN THE GRAND CANYON ? THE SIGNAl , FIRE One week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid in the Grand Canyon . This was the beginning of the abrupt and violent rapids of the granite gorge . This rapid was run in safety , but not without some exciting experiences . Then came a series of rapids which differed from those we had found above . The rapids we had been traversing were usually caused by the debris from side canyons , which dammed the stream and transformed what might have been a good , swift stream with a continuous drop to a succession of mill ponds and cataracts . In most cases in the low water the deposit made a shore on which we could land and inspect the rapid from below . But the rapids in the granite gorge were different . They were not caused by any great deposit of rock , but rather seemed to be formed by a single narrow dike or ledge , rising from the bottom . The rapids dropped almost like a dam , then tailed out in long lines of interference waves . Had it not been so cold , this style would have been more to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat took us past every danger . There was little chance to make a portage in any of those rapids had we desired to do so , which we did not . We gave them but a glance , then rowed into them . One had a fall little short of 35 feet . The next was even more abrupt , and dropped about 30 feet . We paused only to bail out after each rapid , then pulled on again . In five hours we had dropped 178 feet . We never paused in our rowing until we anchored under the tramway , and prepared to go up Bright Angel Creek and build our signal fire . When our last letter was sent out we had told them to begin to look for us about the fourteenth of November ; it was now the sixteenth . We had some doubts if the fire would be seen on top , for stormclouds filled the canyon ; but now and then a rift appeared , and we hoped they saw the light . Ragged and tired , but happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reception that repaid us for all  | we had undergone . They were on the job , and saw the fire as soon as it was built . One month later , or on December 19 , we were ready to resume our journey ( see page 170 ) . It was with no great amount of enthusiasm that we left home to finish the trip to Needles , California . Yearly a foot of snow had fallen , and had drifted over the side of the canyon . The snow had descended to the plateau , 3,000 feet below ? something unusual , occurring only after several nights of zero weather on the rim . A little thin ice covered the pools at the river 's edge . A RECRUIT JOINS US With us was a new man who was anxious to make the trip ? Mr. Bert Eamon . Lauzon was a practical miner and a cowboy as well -- an adventurous young man who had followed life in the open since his boyhood days ? a typical product of the West . Our younger brother , Ernest , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the trail . was also anxious to accompany us , and we agreed to take him as far as the Bass Trail , 25 miles below . We soon saw that we were " tenderfeet " when compared with Lauzon . Instead of walking around such rapids as be could , while we ran the boat , he would lie down on the deck ( see page 172 ) , hanging on to the bulkhead like grim death as the great waves rolled over him . Then he would shake the ice-cold water from his clothes , and , with a grin , would remark , " Young fellows , was n't that great ! " Accustomed as we were by this time to the rapids , we failed to see any great amount of pleasure in having a toll of ice-cold water dumped down the back of our necks . Our first camp was in a grew some spot . Just above us , several years before , we had helped cover up the skeleton of a human being ( see page 171 ) . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a natural position . The man was dressed like a prospector , and wore hob-nailed shoes , while an overcoat was buttoned around him . His pockets contained Los Angeles newspapers dated May , 1900 . There was noth- ing about him by which he could be identified . He may have been on the river and lost his boat , and starved . There was no indication that he had met a violent death . POOR CHRISTMAS PROSPECTS It looked for a while , on Christmas Eve , that we would have a similar fate . Ernest had left us a few hours before ( see pages 176 and 179 ) , taking out our exposed plates via Bass Trail . A rapid was reached that looked bad , still we thought we could find a passage through . We had taken chances in rapids that looked worse , and came through unharmed ; if we could run it , it would be over in a few-minutes and forgotten an hour later . Lauzon had gone as near the lower end of the rapid as he could , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet rose from the water on the right . Ellsworth went first , taking a channel on the left . I had picked out another course on the right as being the least dangerous , but had no more than started when I found myself on a nest of rocks unable to move my boat . Other rocks were below , and the waves thundered about me . About that time I saw my brother 's boat caught sideways in a reverse whirl ? as they are called by rivermenwater pouring over a rock and shooting underneath , while a 2 or 3-foot wave comes up the stream and is taken down also . The Defiance was held between the opposing forces ? the one water pouring over the rocks , the other a wave equally as high on the lower side . Finally she filled with the splashing water , sank low , and the water pouring from above caught the 1,200-pound boat and turned her over as if she were a chip . For a moment she was held : then was thrown upright and forced out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a hundred feet below , only to be carried down again with every cresting wave . If he were to he saved it must be ( lone instantly . I knew he would take the same chance for me , so I pried the Edith loose with an oar and pulled with all ? nv might , hoping to shoot past the rocks . I was  | almost clear when I went over a dip , bow first , and struck another rock I had not seen . There was a thud and cracking like the breaking of a shingle . It was all over in a minute . THE EDITH WRECKED The Edith was a wreck ; my brother had disappeared . Lauzon was climbing frantically over some boulders trying to get farther down the stream to the head of the next rapid . I could not proceed with my wrecked boat , and landed on the right in an eddy in the middle of the rapid . Climbing to the top of the rock , I looked over the next rapid , but Ellsworth was nowhere to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped . I was returning to my wrecked boat when Bert called , and pointed to the foot of the cliff . Going back once more , I saw my brother in a little opening at the foot of the wall where he had climbed out , 20 feet above the next rapid . Returning to the wrecked boat , I was soon beside him . His outer garments by this time were frozen . I soon procured blankets from my bed , removed his clothes , and wrapped him up . Lauzon , true to our expectations of what he would do when the test came , swam out and rescued the Defiance before she was carried over the next rapid . Seeing that he could not aid either of us , he had bailed out . Coming- across with a big grin on his face , he remarked , " Young fellows , business is picking up ; " then added , " and we 're losing lots of good pictures . " These experiences were our Christmas presents that year , and they were not done up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked boat Christmas day . Three smashed ribs on the side were replaced with mesquite which we found growing on the walls . We patched the hole with the loose bottom laid inside the boats , then painted them . Apiece of canvas was tacked over this , and painted also . A piece of tin finished the repair , and the Edith was as seaworthy as ever . Some of our provisions were lost or spoiled in the upset . Both sacks of flour were wet , on the outside at least . At each camp the wet sacks were placed by the fire until this wet flour hardened . and we went on using from the center as if nothing had ever happened .. We caught a few fish . We felt pretty good one morning when we saw fresh meat in sight in the form of a big mountain . sheep . My brother reached for his camera at the same instant that I grabbed my six shooter , but the trigger was rusted and we had no mutton stew that day . The motion-picture camera had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a thorough cleaning , so we held up one day and repaired it . The next clay Ave were again running rapids under walls 4,500 feet high . A day or two later we camped at the mouth of Havastt Canyon ( Cataract Creek ) , but on quite a different stage of water than that we had seen wdlen here before ( see picture , page 18o ) . It was 5o or 6o feet higher on the walls when we had worked our way down on that overland trip . At the next camp below here , New Year 's eve , the walls of the inner gorge rose 3,000 feet above us and were almost sheer ; then another wall rose beyond this . with a narrow plateau between . The loss of the boats in that section would quite likely have been fatal , as there was no chance of climbing out over such walls as those . WIRELESS WARNINGS In these sections , if it was not possible to go below the rapid to inspect it , the one who arrived first would climb out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would direct the one who remained how to proceed ; or if he ran the rapid without getting out , he would point out the hidden rocks , which looked so much like innocent waves from above the rapid . We were always endeavoring to make time . If the rapids were simply big water , without danger of an upset , we would wear a light rubber coat , so that the splashing water would freeze on the coat instead of on our clothes . If the life-preservers were not constantly worn , they were always kept in- Hated and close at hand . We preferred this type of preserver to the cork on account of its light weight . ? For the same reason we had inflated mattresses with our sleeping bags . They saved carrying a lot of extra bed clothing , and could be thrown on the wet sand or rocky , uneven ground , and we could enjoy a comfortable night 's rest . Even in their protecting sacks of rubber and canvas they looked very small when compared with the beds usually carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kept a change of dry clothing and sometimes the films from the motion-picture camera in the bed , and as soon as the camp-fire was started a quick change was made , and the wet clothing was scattered on rocks or hung on lines close to the fire . They seldom dried entirely , and it was anything but pleasant to crawl into them the next morning . When choosing a camp , the first thing to be considered was driftwood , as nothing but a little mesquite grew in these lower canyons . A flood which had come down when we were in Lodore had carried most of the wood out with it , and it sometimes was very difficult to find all we needed . For this reason , if we found a good camp after 4 p . M. , we usually took it . The second consideration was a quiet place to tie our boats . ! loth boats had been rubbed against rocks in one or two places until they were nearly worn through . The last thing we thought of was a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overhanging wall , an occasional cave , but usually a bed in the sand , shoveled out to fit our beds , were  | our choice of bed-rooms . They were always well ventilated . With all our efforts to make headway , our usual day 's run was about to miles , if we were in bad water . The Grand Canyon would come under this list , with its 1700-foot fall in 200 miles . It was seldom that we had any sun in these deeper canyons ( see page 18o ) , as we traveled toward the west . In December and January it snowed several times , but the snow never descended quite to us , but turned to a chilling rain . This would freeze on the rocks , making it very poor footing ; so we made no portages that were not absolutely necessary . BELOW THE TOROWEEP About 6o or 70 miles of this great sheerwall canyon , the walls began to break down , becoming lower and less precipitous . How long it lasted it would be hard to . say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its old level just as it had before , and mammoth blocks of the volcanic rock are scattered for miles along its course . At one point in this section we imagined we saw smoke and hastened clown , wondering if our new - found friend would be a prospector or a cattle-rustler , Instead of a camp-fire we found some warm springs falling 20 feet into the river . Beside the springs was a lavafilled rapid , so full of jagged sections of the volcanic rock from the cliffs that a portage was advisable . It was colder than usual this morning , and we were in the icv water a great deal as we lined and lifted the boat over the rocks at the edge of the rapid . We would stand this until numbed with the cold , then would go down and thaw out in the warmer water at the springs . A WAYSIDE MEETING A day 's travel below this we did see some smoke , and on climbing the bank found a little , old prospector sitting in a dugout which he had shoveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented him from hearing us until we were directly in front of him . He looked at our clothes , the rubber coats and life-preservers , then said in a matter-of-fact tone : " Well , you boys must have come by the river . " After talking with him awhile we learned that he had once been wrecked in Lodore Canyon , and that Mr. Chew , who had taken Jimmie out , had supplied him with a horse and aided him on his way to civilization . His name , the told us , was Snyder , and he had just been across the river on a raft to do some assessment-work on a copper claim which he was sure would develop into a valuable mine . He was cooking his noon meal when we arrived ? two pieces of bacon and two biscuits ? in a frying-pan , and with nothing else in sight ; vet with trite Western hospitality he invited us to stay for dinner . We thanked him , but declined , as he told us that we were but six miles above Diamond Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4,000 feet , we could reach the railway . Below Diamond Creek we were surprised to find the granite walls even higher than they were above , and the rapids continued to get worse . We had imagined that the walls receded down . but the opposite was the case . It was in this last section that the three men left the Powell party , when within a little more than a day 's journey from the end of the canyon . They were killed by the Indians the day after they climbed out on top . THE LAST GREAT RAPID Any one expecting to make this joy ride at any time will know by three pointed peaks , on the south side , that they are nearing the end of the canyon ; also by a long quiescent stretch of water that they are nearing one of the worst rapids in the series . Major Powell graphically describes this rapid , located , as he said , " below a bold , lava-capped escarpment . " Mr. Stone also warned us against it , stating " it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything could be run . " On account of low water we were enabled to land at the lower end of the escarpment before beginning this portage . The river had an approximate fall of 40 feet and was filled with exposed and slightly submerged boulders from one  | end to the other . The roar of the rapid was deafening . We took our boats over one bad group of rocks , lined them down , then lifted them over a second lot . The rocks were icy ; there was only room for two to work , and we were weak and bruised with two other portages in much similar places . It was with a great sigh of relief that we slid our boats over this last rock , completed our fourteenth and last portage , and prepared to shoot down on the swift water that ended the rapid . Other rapids remained , but we ran them all , with only a glance at them from the boats . We were pulling for the end . There were two more camps before we emerged into the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we are entitled to a certain degree of honor for having- done something unusual . The trip is unusual and will hardly become a popular tour ; but as for honor , all honor is justly due to the one who made the original exploration ? Major J. W. Powell . He did not know what minute he would be confronted by a waterfall . We knew there were none . All we can say for our trip is that two or three men seldom attempted anything harder and got away with it . Our motion-picture films and plates were carried through 365 big rapids , a descent of nearly 6,000 feet , after having been on the river ioi clays . We landed in Needles on January i8 , one month from the time of our start from Bright Angel trail . HOW SMITH GOT THROUGH Among some letters awaiting us was the following , bearing the postmark of Hite , Utah : KOLE BROTHERS . DEAR FRIENDS : Well , I got here at last , after seventeen days in Cataract Canyon . The old boat will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another rapid . I certainly played rings around some of those rocks in Cataract ; I tried every scheme I had ever heard of and some that were never thought of before , but got here at last . I hope the movies are good . Your friend , CHAS . SMITH . Another from Hite stated that Smith told him when he came to that last rapid he had carried all his equipment over the narrow ledge and was ' engaged in dropping his boat down with the chain , standing on the rock above , when he was suddenly jerked off into the river . He still retained his hold on the chain , pulled himself into the boat , and went through the entire rapid without oars and without upsetting , landing a mile and quarter below his supplies . My brother afterward completed the trip into Mexico , to the Gulf of California , thus making for the second time a complete journey from Green River , Wyoming , to the tide-water . We have just returned from a 600-mile overland trip to the reservations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marsh Pass and our oftenthought-of Rainbow Natural Bridge . Rising from our bed under that wonderful arch while the stars were yet in the sky , we made our way to the river , and saw a familiar turn in the wall past which we had rowed with scarcely a glance that morning two years before . Returning in time for a late breakfast , we spent a few hours in making some views ; then , while the guides took the horses around the base of Navajo Mountain , we climbed the peak , sleeping under the shelving rock . Guided by signal fires , we rejoined our party the next day on the other side of the mountain and began our homeward journey over the sands of the Painted Desert .  |
