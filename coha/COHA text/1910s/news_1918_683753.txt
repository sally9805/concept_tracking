txt The fact that the dispatch from France reporting that the Germans are in control of the air over the American lines passed the censor is significant . Evidently General PERSHING would like to have all the battle planes he can get . For attack and defense , if not for reconnoissance , he is largely dependent upon the French . In the Lafayette Escadrille he ' has only an efficient nucleus . Just before the dispatch was delivered to the newspapers Secretary BAKER issued a statement intended to be reassuring . Battle planes , he said , " are today en route to the front in , France . " Looking forward , 1 the announcement was reassuring in a measure , for while Mr. BAKER admitted that the shipment was not large , he said it marked " the final " overcoming of many difficulties met " In building up this new and intricate " industry . " Ile promised quantity production of Liberty motors immediately . The " peak " would be reached " in a few weeks . " Nothing , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor . On this point there is usually reticence . Deliveries of spruce , which must be dried before it can be fashioned for airplane purposes , are known to be slow . There has been testimony to that effect before the Senate Military Affairs Committee . It is no secret . But shipments from the West are increasing . Enough spruce is on hand to provide for a considerable number of planes ; and before long they will not lag behind the Liberty motor . The situation seems to be that , if the French and the available Americans will hold the fort in the air for a while longer , General PERSHING will be able to look out for himself by midsummer ; we shall be sending over an always increasing number of battle planes , with the prospect of making it more and more unsafe for the Germans to fly over his lines . Mr. BAKER 'S explanation of the backwardness of airplane production is the telling of a story that is not new . It is not much to the point that the original plan was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1918 ? we went to war in April , 1917 . There should be no elation over the fact that the first shipment , " not large , " is now going over . If the War Department had not been so set on possessing an exclusively American motor , ( ultimately , no doubt , it will prove its great merits , ) deliveries of French 101 British mud ela could have been made months ago . Colonel E. A. DEEDS , assistant to Mailor Gen. SQUIER , testified before the Senate committee on Jan. 30 that the Handley-Page , an English machine , was being manufactured in this country Cr-ar weeks after the receipt of the final drawings . Work was begun , too , on Caproni specifications two weeks after their arrival . The story of the evolution through which the American models passed is instructive , as told by Secretary . BAKER . We are done with that now , although it may be felt that too much time was given to planning and to experiments and too little to profiting by the experience of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . are turning out engines and airplane parts in great numbers . Colonel Dr.ups says that the Signal Corps is.disbursing $2,000 , - 000 a day . Both here and abroad many thousands of aviators are being trained . I't is perhaps harder to obtain skilled mechanics , but that problem is being solved , too . In France a large territory was turned over to the Americans some time ago for aerodromes , shops , and training camps . The War Department is shipping engines and parts " over there " to be assembled as rapidly as possible . It is hinted that the result will exceed all expectations , but secrecy was imposed by President WiLsori himself when he forbade the holding of aircraft exhibitions . The decision was to be'commended . At the same time , an intelligent publicity about airplane production would be welcomed by the American people . They can put two and two together , and when they see a report of German activity over our lines contemporaneously with an official effort to reassure them , in the form of a document more argumentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future but avoiding a present emergency , they , the American people , can not understand what useful purpose is served by the policy of suppression or what harm would be done by being more explicit
