txt The same day brought the news of two characteristic German exploits , the torpedoing of the ambulance transport Warilda , with a loss of 123 lives , and the sinking by shellfire , without warning , of the Norwegian bark Eglinton , with a loss of all oh board except one . In the interest of her mercantile marine , Germany has long made a practice of sinking neutral ships . To the ships and sailors of Norway she has given particular attention . The case of the Eglinton is perfectly illustrative of German sea-manners and sea-morals . Without notice , the submarine opens fire on the unprotected bark , shoots away the rigging and sails , breaks the tackle of a lifeboat which the sailors are lowering . They try to get another boat , made fast on top of the deckhouse . The Germans fire at them point blank . The Captain 's right arm is ripped up by a piece of shrapnel . One of the steward 's legs is shot off . An able seaman is shot in the back . They succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew slide down a rope and reach the raft . Three are picked up out of the water . The sea is choppy . The wind is high . The submarine cruises around the raft and her commander watches the nine hapless sailors . He decides , ? evidently , that conditions of wind and water will probably make the sinking ' traceless " without any more bother m his part . The sailor shot in the back dies . The second mate dies . The Captain dies . On the fourth day only the chief mate and one sailor are left . The chief mate dies , mad , that night . Delirious , and just on the edge of death , after drifting nine days on the raft , the sole survivor is picked up by a patrol . Such is the humanity of the German tribes . A hospital ship , like a hospital , is a target that the German heroes can not resist . There were 800 wounded soldiers , a great number of them lying helpless in their cots , ' on the Warilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Saturday morning . To kill the wounded , to kill nurses  --  what a supreme satisfaction to the German mind , what a triumph of German valor and will-tovictory ! Only a few of the woman nurses were slain , less than one-sixth of the wounded . But , if fortune prevented the full consummation of the glorious design , none the less it was a piece of right German prowess , and the commander of the submarine deserves to be decorated with the Order of the Old Man of the Mountain . Scientific continuators of the sect of the Assassins , the Germans do deliberately on land and sea what the devotees of the Sheik-al-Jebal had to be stupefied with hashish before doing . Thus , every day adds to the crimes for which Germany stands outlawed among the nations . At this very moment , peddler as well as assassin , murdering indifferently to extend her trade , she is pondering how to get a share of raw materials after the war , is nursing grandiose plans for land and sea borne commerce , is organizing to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacres . The cup of her abominations runs over . Where has she a friend ? Who in the free world today would shake a German hand red with the blood of many nations ? If peace came tomorrow , who would sail on a German ship ? Who would do business with a nation of word-breakers , a nation of fraud and cruelty and murder ?
