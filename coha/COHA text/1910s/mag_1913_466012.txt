TRAVELED for a long day last year across the Kansas prairies with a very typical group of graduates from American colleges . They were from the East , the Middle West , and the Far West , brought together merely by the exigency of the moment , Iike a Freshman class in college . The journey was quiet ; we sat in the club-car at our ease , and conversation was general . I was struck by the narrow range of this conversation . Whether it flowed freely among a group at the observation end of the car , or became more intimate when chairs were drawn together by the buffet , a few topics ? business conditions , real estate , anecdotes , and reminiscences ? seemed to bound it . Interest did not go further . The men themselves were far from uninteresting . From the Oregon applegrower to the New York broker , every one was a factor somehow or somewhere in American life . They were not uninteresting ; but they were uninterested , except in their narrow ranges . The broker 's interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the apple-grower 's interest in Wall Street was romantic merely ; both yawned when I talked of the Russian story I was reading , or tried to follow through the window the route of the Santa Fe trail . There was nothing novel in this experience ; but it was illuminating . It seemed to me that these men had failed to get their money 's worth of education . It is very curious that so few care , or dare , to get their money 's worth from the American college . The poor man gets the best returns . He must ask the college first of all to make his boy selfsupporting ? if possible , more efficient than his father ; and he gets , as a rule , what he pays for . But the poor man is not the typical college parent . The typical parent of our undergraduates hasstored up more or less capital ; he has a position waiting for his son ; his boy will be ahie to live comfortably , no matter what may be the efficiency of his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , is certainly not the most important quality for this boy to possess . Very commonly , especially in the endowed institutions of the East , moneymaking in his family has reached the saturation point . It is unnecessary ; it may be inadvisable , or even wrong , for him to enter gainful pursuits . What the son of parents in comfortable circumstances requires is not so much a narrow training in the support of life as a broader one in how to utilize living . His interests , quite as much as his mental powers , need stimulus , development , and discipline . I know that in stating the situation so flatly I run head on into an American tradition ? or prejudice . The American democracy ? even . when in no other way democratic ? believes that the American boy , though millions may hang over his head , must work for his living , must make money . With a righteous fear lest his moral fiber degenerate in useless studies , the well-to-do father grudgingly allows his son to enter college , reminds him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he graduates , and hurries him into business as quickly as the faculty allows , breathing relief when he is safe in an atmosphere where labor is measured by returns in cash . If there were danger of starvation ahead he could not be more anxious to fix his son 's mind on the duty of earning ten dollars a week . I do not blame the fathers ? even in the instances to which I limit myself ? the well-to-do parents of intellectually able sons . They are applying the American tradition as it was applied to them . But what is the effect on the boys ? Sometimes it is good ; often it is unfortunate ; occasionally it is disastrousA Junior comes into my office for a talk . He is clear-eyed and intelligent , but conventional from his clothes to his conversation . His father controls an enormous business , and he is to begin at the bottom of the corporation as soon as he graduates . I gasp at the figures of output and return that he casually mentions . I wonder just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events will certainly bring . The prospect does not worry him in the least . He has inherited shrewdness and selfconfidence . He 'll " do as dad did . " But of interest in the problems and the possibilities involved in this vast ownership I discover not a particle ; and little more in what his means will enable him to do with his life . A fast motor , a country club , a good boat , a yearly trip to Paris ? his ambitions go no further . Among his college courses , English composition interests him because " dad " says he ' 11 have to write good business letters ; economics a little because it deals with cash ; English literature in a barely discoverable degree because of the useful culture which is supposed to flow from it . All the rest of the world of knowledge ? historical , scientific , esthetic ? is a dull blank . It does not interest him now ; it will never interest him . It is not to be expected that the college can ever make an intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . But if we could have interested him in ideas ; if we could have extended and lifted the range of his pleasures ; widened and deepened his conceptions of commerce ; given him a " social conscience " ? we would have accomplished something . It is not to the credit of the college that the time-spirit in this youth was too strong for its influence to combat ; but the blame does not rest entirely upon the faculty . " Dad " must share the responsibility . He sent the boy to us with eves closed to everything but money-making and fun . Perhaps this youngster will put all his energies into doubling the family fortune ; more probably he will discover the weakness in the American tradition of work , break through it , and enjoy himself according to his lights . Of these undesirable alternatives , the second is at least the more human and perhaps the more rational . But the youth whose plight arouses my sympathy and indignation is of a different type . His kind is not so abundant in the colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents , I think , the new generation of educated Americans . I knew him first in Freshman year : a pleasant boy , well-mannered , with the air of one who had lived in a cultivated home . He was not an " honor man " ; he seemed afraid to throw himself into his work . And yet his finer accent , his occasional interest in music , art , and books , made his classmates a little shy of him . He was said to be , possibly , a " highbrow , " or a " freak . " But he was a good athlete in a small way , and a good c. mixer . " As soon as he learned the conventional fashion in dressing , and acquired the proper slang ? which the boys from the big " prep . schools " had from the beginning ? he got on very well . He " made a society , " was on the track team , wrote for the papers ; bade fair to have an exemplary college career , and to become one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type and depart as one man from college . However , in Junior year came a reaction . I have seen it hundreds of times ? a faint dawn of intellectual awakening ; a sudden interest in the world as distinguished from college life . The mind grips upon knowledge and moves slowly with it , as the wheels move when the gears of an automobile engine slide into first speed . He was roused to an enthusiasm of thinking by a stimulating book . Ideas which he did not fancy began to anger him ? a sure sign of intellectual progress . He began to ask intelligent questions . Then he fell into a depression over his ignorance . He began to criticize the curriculum . Men talked in his room till late at night . He bought special cigarettes and posed for a little while as an esthete . But when he devoted a month of a summer vacation to reading up on religion , and came to a conclusion ( so it seemed to me ) as original as it was wrong , I felt sure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family in which cultivation and reasonable wealth had been hereditary for several generations . There was no pressing need for him in the family business , no reason why he should not be educated to the full ; in fact , his parents prided themselves on the education which they were giving their son . And yet , when Senior year came , and his desire for knowledge awakened with the approach of the end of the conventional period of training , clouds appeared on the domestic horizon . I gathered that he was not sufficiently anxious to enter business ; that he did not know what he wished to do ; that college seemed to be making him unpractical . I was consulted as a friend , first by him , then by his mother . I told his anxious mother that her boy needed to learn more , to think more , before putting his knowledge and his desires to the test of practice ; that , if their means per- mitted it , nothing would be so good for him as a little more education . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suggested that the youth be put into the bond business so that he should waste no time while making up his mind as to his future profession ! If he had wished to be a lawyer , or a doctor , or an engineer , they would gladly have given him the extra years of preparation . But he merely wished to think and to know : to study more economics , more history ; to read widely ; to carry through some guided work in social service , until he could shape his philosophy of life , control his mind , and find out what he wished to do with his powers . And this , coming in no recognized category of youthful endeavor , was unpractical , aimless , or leading perhaps to idleness and eccentricity . He must get to work ! They chose wisely , according to their lights . I think that this youth would have responded to the intellectual stimulus which the university could have given him . I think that he might have been led into study for its own sake , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been able to follow his bent wherever it led him , and taste of the delights and the rigors of academic life . without its meannesses and its sordid cares . He would have cut loose from business for ever , and perhaps distinguished himself . But distinction of that kind did not interest his family . They have made a mediocre business man of him ; and if that is what they wanted , they have movedsagaciously . Nevertheless , I do not believe in their lights . I am far from urging that all thoughtful , intellectually hungry boys should be drawn into the academic life . Hundreds of youngsters like the one I have de-scribed would have carried the profits of a fuller education into business and the professions . As business men , they would have gained in mental power , but most of all in a sense of proportion and a better understanding of the aims , the advantages , and the possibilities of the life they were choosing . As lawyers or doctors or engineers , their efficiency surely would not have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interests and the world 's work , and their lives would have gained much . That this fuller education , with the keener interest in life which comes with it , would have been a luxury for such men , I readily grant . But this is the age of luxuries . The same parent who balks at an extra year of education lavishes automobiles , large incomes , and less desirable favors upon his children . Most fathers who send their sons to college regard luxuries as a right ? if not automobiles , riding-horses , good pictures , and yachts , at least warm houses , electricity , travel , and far more expensive food than is needed for sustenance . Granted that an education beyond the requirements for self-support , but well within the demands of an active , pleasurable , intelligent life , is a luxury , are there not many Americans who can afford it ? I am assured that the best thinkers in the educational world are spending their energies not on lengthening , but in shortening , the period of education ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can reply that such work is invaluable . Let us improve , condense , reform , wherever we can , making four-year courses into three , if they teach only three years ' worth , concentrating and improving the work in our schools until they turn out boys of sixteen as well educated as French or German students of the same age . Let us save what time we can , so that the youth who can afford no more education than that provided by the usual college course may get it more speedily or more efficiently . But it is not a question here of providing the best education in the least time for those who must hurl themselves into the economic struggle . It is a question of providing the best education , regardless of time , for the boy whose struggle will be not so much to support life as to use it properly . If such an education is a luxury ? and when I think of the pre-eminent need of the times for more intelligence , I begin to doubt my term ? then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would flatly contradict the platitude that in all things America is luxurious . If the parent with a comfortable living or a good position to give his boy would put less emphasis on the rigors of the coming financial struggle , and more upon the advantages of a well-opened mind , the effect upon the college would be tremendous . The undergraduate would feel it first of all . Upon many , the influence , it is true , would be only indirect . Out of a college class of , say , three hundred , perhaps fifty are merely well-dressed , agreeable young animals , whose minds have already attained their maximum of breadth . It is a fair question whether they are not already spending too much time in education . Perhaps one hundred and fifty belong to the great average ? which is , after all , made up of too many varieties to be called an average . Dull men , who work , nevertheless , with faithfulness ; bright men , lazy by nature ; busy men , far too much concerned with social or commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these would feel that the world outside was beginning to value culture and the intellect , and , without radically changing their habits or their aims , would nevertheless manage to get what they felt to he their share of mental broadening . But it is of the remaining one hundred that I write : the men who are not content to take at secondhand , or do without the illumination of the last century of science , or the accumulated knowledge and inspiration of the earlier world ; the men whose minds are opening and are worth opening . Many of them are eager for active life , and will not wait for more education ; many of them are poor and can not wait ; but many more would choose the luxury of a deeper preparation if anxious parents , moved by a short-sighted public opinion , did nor force them , still immature , into the world . They may know the text , " Man shall not live by bread alone " ; but in the face of practical adults asserting the contrary , and urging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely to apply it . For it takes a clearer sight , a stronger will , and more independence than even the exceptional boy is likely to possess , to see that education in some instances may be the first and most important profession . The effect upon the professor of a more generous parental attitude toward education would be as great as upon the undergraduate , and more calculable . The college , as distinguished from the technical school , has always proposed , as its ideal , to educate fur living ? and this term includes both earning one 's living and enjoying it . The difficulty now is that the faculty , the parent , and the undergraduate each grasp their interpretation of this broad purpose and pull as hard as they can in different directions . The faculty , on the whole , lean too far toward the idealistic side of this education . The in among them main- tain that n college a boy should study nothing practical , nothing with potentialities of money-making . But education is surely broader than they think . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living does not help toward earning the daily bread . In truth , it is , and I suppose it always will be , a fault of our profession that we turn away from the utilitarian aspects of our subjects , and are more interested in their cultural than in their commercial value . Our lack of experience in turning thought into dollars makes us unduly depreciate what might be called the business end of a liberal education . But where this error exists we have been driven into it by the obstinacy of parents , who will not see that the power to make money is only a by-product of education ? by well-to-do parents especially , who send us youngsters who will have to assume vast responsibilities and use vast opportunities for service and pleasure , saying , Teach my youthful millionaire how to make more money ! We have had to fight an ingrained American prejudice ; no wonder that we have become a little prejudiced ourselves in the course of the struggle . For all these reasons , the reactive effect of even a portion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college professor ? which are , after all , those of a true liberal education ? would be very great . We would not turn out geniuses , or make over America ; but that deathly indifference , sprung of conflicting aims , which hangs like a fog-bank over the American college , would lift and lighten . The inefficiency which is to be found in teaching as well as in business , and the inherent laziness of the human animal , would prevent a too rapid clearing of the atmosphere . We would not be blinded by the flash . But I think that professor and father and son might begin to work together toward a common purpose ; and that the teacher would teach more broadly and more successfully the things which knowledge can contribute to life . But if education should be numbered among the permitted luxuries of American life , the greatest effect would he on a department of the university which means lirrle now to the undergraduate and less than little to the American parent . I mean the graduate school , the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . The well-to-do parent is not especially interested in the productive activities of the graduate school , and I do not see why he should be . He thinks of it , if he thinks of it at all , as a highly specialized laboratory for turning out unreadable treatises on the sources of unreadable plays ; or accounts of ridiculously named chemical compounds ; or pamphlets on Sanscrit inflections ; or philosophical theories whose very titles he does not understand . It is absurd to maintain that he should be vitally interested , because these represent the outposts of knowledge . No one blames him for a lack of interest in the valves of a steam turbine , in how to modify milk for a ten months ' baby , in the manufacture of breakfast foods . These things also are important . He can not afford to despise them because they lie beyond his metier ; but enthusiasm is not demanded of him . In another phase of the graduate school , however , he might well be more interested . I mean in the opportunities it offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard much of what the graduate schools can do for the country . I am more concerned just now with what they might do for the undergraduate who is to be allowed the luxury of a little more education . My own experience was typical only in so Far as my condition resembled that of hundreds of boys , who come to Senior year in college with a distressing vagueness of aims , a feeling of incapacity , and one certainty ? that they are not yet educated , that they are not yet ready to enter the world . As it happened , I was allowed to choose the path of the graduate school . I entered uncertain , doubtful of what interested me , guiltily conscious that I ought to be earning ten dollars a week in an office or a mill . I found myself in a new atmosphere . We were starting over again ; we were boasting of our ignorance ; we were clamoring for knowledge ; yearning for opportunities to study in a field which grew wider and wider under our touch . Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time acutely conscious of it . Reality , instead of being a simple affair of making money , marrying , and dying , began to grow vast , complex , and infinitely interesting . It was with difficulty that we held ourselves to the little segment which was assigned to us for study . Our thoughts leaped ahead ? though still vaguely ? to the practical , concrete work we must do , and we were distressed at the opportunities for knowledge which must be left behind us . Ennui became unthinkable ; idleness a crime . Yet we were boys still , and intensely human boys . We sat late with beer and pipes , and talked nonsense far more effectively than in undergraduate days ; we took up athletics , which in college we had left to the teams ; we were even merrier because our mirth came as a reaction from hard work . When we compared experiences with the intellectually sympathetic among our classmates who had gone out into the world , we found that they , too , had felt the spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they had already discovered a career , their enthusiasm was less than ours , their energies not so active ; they did not seem to be on such good terms with life . Of course , in a way , we were specialists , and this seems to remove my personal experience from the argument I am advancing for the luxury of a full education . In reality , I think , it does not . For we were specialists only by compulsion , because , since most of us were preparing for teaching or scholarship , we knew that we must confine most of our labors to one field . And I think that it was , and is , one of the defects of the graduate school that it drives too quickly into the more highly specialized branches of knowledge ; that it puts all the emphasis upon preparation for scholarly production , just as the world outside puts all the emphasis upon moneymaking . In Fact , the graduate school looked with ' a hardly concealed contempt upon the candidates for a simple M.A. degree , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of endeavor , who were seeking merely a further preparation for life . And that was its weakness . There it shared ? though the accusation would have angered its professors ? the American prejudice against the luxury of a general education . In all that seething intellectual life , with its burning interests and increasing powers , many of them saw no health except in the student dedicated to research . Those who left us by the way ? for the law , for business , for diplomacy , or for literature ? they regarded as strayed sheep . No one who knows the results would be so blind as to attack the value of that specialization in research which has already placed our graduate schools beside those of Germany and France . But why have we failed to realize that in the means they offer for fulfilling a general education they can satisfy a real need of contemporary America ? The life we tasted there would he better for many a thoughtful , hesitating Senior I have known since than a half-hearted plunge into a world which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would havesent him , eager and enthusiastic , into an activity which his broadening mind could have chosen for itself . It is easy to blame America and the American parent for parsimony in education , but it is not very satisfactory . To begin with , it is futile to blame a tendency , and the American attitude toward liberal education is a tendency ? and an inherited tendency , which makes it all the more difficult to escape . The American parent has , as a rule , but recently attained economic independence and ended his up-hill climb . His sons can start on the level ; they will not have to climb as he climbed . But climbing is what he best understands ; and he must be liberal-minded and a little prophetic in his vision if he does not send his boys to college to prepare for the needs , not of their generation , but his own . It is easy to blame the undergraduate for not striving harder for the kind of education which will make him most happy and most useful . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong medicine , or too little medicine , is prescribed for him ! And furthermore , that minority of uur undergraduates who really need more education are asking for it , are struggling for it , though often in a blind and halfconscious fashion . Every college teacher not case-hardened in intellectual superiority knows and is rejoiced by this fact . In truth , the college teacher must take his share of responsibility for the niggardliness of American education . I suppose that we realize the essential importance in contemporary life of the intelligence which comes from a full education , but I confess that I think we do not always act upon our realization . I find myself constantly resisting the temptation to say : This , gentlemen , will not interest you : it leads to an appreciation of life ; it shows how to rise to the possibilities of living ; but it will never make a cent for you , and it is difficult . You must study it ; but you wo n't be interested . " I hate this hierophantic , better-than-thou attitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume that the higher realms of the intellect are reserved for the scholar and the theorist ? What right to smile superciliously at all interest in knowledge which does not lead directly toward scholarly production ? What is gained by asserting that study must be bleak and austere ; that learning must be unworldly and exclusive ? The colleges also have been indisposed to allow the competent ? who do not wish to become specialists ? the luxury of a full education . Conclusions will quickly he reached by those who take the trouble to look about them . We are not so rooted in our prejudice against work that is unmeasurable by cash as to have produced no examples of those who are profiting themselves or the country by the luxurious excess of their education . The young millionaire who is using his wealth efficiently , enthusiastically , wisely for social service and social knowledge , is no longer so rare as to be unfamiliar , though he is still a curiosity . He is drawing dividends for himself and others from a deeper comprehension of the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many a man not a millionaire , though master of his income , is using his business or his profession for broad and interesting services to the community , made possible by the knowledge and the interests with which education has endowed him . Less valuable , perhaps , and yet invaluable in a genuine civilization , is another and more familiar type : the business man or lawyer who has learned how to live outside his office ; whose pleasures are not limited to the physical and the sensual ; who has a hinterland , a background , as H. G. Wells puts it ; who is a cultivated , sympathetic , intelligent , broad-minded man firsr , and a good business man or lawyer afterward . This , too , is a product of education ? an almost inevitable result of a full and true education , when the mind is capable of receiving and profiting by the riches of knowledge and the stimulus of ideas . Observe , on the other hand , the sons i of parents in comfortable circumstances , the boys who were guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon practical work , and who sought only the utilitarian in college . Have they gained by their loss of culture and a broad education ? Are they more useful to the community , more interesting to themselves ; are they happier ? Those who left us when their interests were just awakening ? have they gained by the year or so of time they have saved ? Considerthose familiar figures in American life : the bored youth selling bonds " to keep doing something " ; the half-hearted successor to a big business who lets his subordinates carry most of the work ; the wealthy youngster who conducts a gambling business on the stock-exchange because lie must have some excitement ; the rich idler too Intel- ligent to find the usual means of timekilling efficacious ; the heir to a million making more money doggedly because he does n't know what else to do . Some of these misfittings , no doubt , arise from difficulties of temperament , or defects in character ; but many of them are due simply and solely to insufficient education . These men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunities . Their interests are still dor-mant . Nothing very serious is the mat- ter with them ; they get along well enough according co common opinion . More education , whether in college or in graduate school , was not a necessity ; it was a luxury ; but it was a luxury they could well have afforded .
