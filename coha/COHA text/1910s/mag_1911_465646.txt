IN things educational , as in most things temporal , there is a tide which , taken at the flood , does not invariably lead on to fortune . The educational flood has in fact an awkward trick of washing us , at times , beyond the normal tidemark and then receding to leave us stranded a good deal higher up than we counted on . And in addition to this it not infrequently unsettles us still further with a vicious backwash in receding . The last thirty years of the nineteenth century witnessed such a flood . The problem which has vexed responsible persons for many hundreds of years ? what shall we do with our daughtersl ? came hack again and swept us up like a springtide to unusual liberalities of education . At the present minute some of our authorities are uncomfortably reversed in - what looks rather like a backwash ? and the old question seems to have taken the new and perplexing form of " What are our daughters going to do with us ? " In the most ancient of our English universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of feminine education cherishes some cartoons caricaturing early attempts at the higher education of women . Professor Sidgwick is represented lecturing to a collection of ladies , and the subject is " Aristotle on the Ox . " The lecture is reinforced by a diagram dividing the noble animal into sections ? " ribs , " " sirloin , " " shin , " the vaguer portions of his anatomy being indicated , comprehensively , as " suet . " The professor and the ox have an equally cl6gage air , the foreground is blocked with the wide skirts fashionable at the period , and most of the ladies are engaged in examining one another 's bonnets . Since the cartoons were hung up in that office a good many first-class certificates and degree equivalents have been given to women students . The flood of education ran very high during the last quarter of the nineteenth century , and later on professors found it necessary to go beyond suet when they lectured on Aristotle to the women students at the universities . At present a kind of reaction is setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of " Back to the land ! " are reinforced by a further cry of " Back to the home ! " The domestic heroine has reappeared in fiction , the domestic type has reappeared ? if indeed she ever disappeared ? in real life . In the meantime the spinster population of these islands has not only developed to an alarming extent , but has also developed rather alarming energies , and the problem with which captious persons are trying to pose us now is ? All this latter-day education has unfitted woman for domestic life , and what are you going to do with her now ? Let us adopt the Socratic method and ask questions too . In the first place , " Has it really unfitted her ? " yudging from results , it does not seem to he the highly educated woman who is incompetent or incapable when it comes to action , public or domestic . The cleverer a woman is , the better she can adapt herself to circumstances and the more quickly she recognizes that no occupation can be dull which involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second place , " Are things so different from what they have been before l " We are apt to forget that English ladies learned Greek and Latin in the sixteenth century , and that the domestic talents were not lacking then . The education of daughters caused a great deal of anxiety and experiment in earlier days , before Erasmus declared that girls should receive as liberal an education as their brothers . The education of women has always been a sign of the temper of an age . When any strong moral impulse comes to stimulate the conscience of a nation , there comes at once a corresponding rise in the standard of female - education . The barbarian races of Europe gave their women a better position than did the more civilized nations ; and this , though chiefly owing to characteristics of race , was in part because the pagan woman of the north had neither Eve nor Pandora to shadow her path . The Christian daughters of Eve were continually reproached with the indiscretion of their ancestress " when she bit upon the apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep her down , though it does not always appear to have done so . Many women saints there were indeed , but their ways were hard ; saints like Katherine and Elizabeth were commendable , and so were " the stout and painful housewives " who followed these so far as possible in daily life , but the natural woman was a snare , a curse , and a blemish in creation . Aspirants for heaven fled to the wilderness to avoid her , for " where is any place but that women he therein save in desert ? " Eve was locked out of Paradise ? poor Eve ! In many respects the legal standing of women had been better in late pagan times . Roman law , with two exceptions , had treated her better than canon law did . And feudalism made things rather worse , since , in spite of its refinements , the chivalric ideal did possess a taint of corruption which made the position of women essentially a false one . Now about twentyfive years after Crecy , when the age of chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight of La Tour Landry , being oppressed with the care of three daughters , bethought himself of writing a bock for their instruction in the conduct of life ; and his book , which was translated by Caxton and - much read , gives us great insight into the social conditions of that romantic age . The fourteenth century was a period of chivalry and romance , but it is an interesting question how far chivalry goes in a really excellent man . Certainly the Knight of the Tower had a poor opinion of the manners of his age . He wrote his hook , he tells us , remembering the crafts and vanities of idle youths in his own young days , " and there be such fellows now or worse , " said the good knight , wherefore he took pains to warn his daughters against their wiles . And when he goes on to quote his wife 's opinions onsocial intercourse , the point of view becomes singularly unflattering ; for the Lady of the Tower tempered respect for her own lord with an exceedingly mean opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at all events he gave his daughters sound advice . The virtues most popular in the Middle Ages were the Scriptural virtues , which have been recommended before and since ? love , joy , peace , and the whole string down to temperance . But first of all comes silence , and it is instructive to notice how this ideal of woman As a " gracious silence " has remained popular through Shakespeare 's time to the present day ? it is the listener who lures , not the chatterbox . The knight begins his book by telling his daughters a story of how his own father had wished him to marry a certain lady , whose appearance and manners had pleased him well , until at the end of their first interview she begged him to cume oft , whereat the knight was greatly shocked , seeing her so pert . " ft caused me , " said lie , " to be discouraged from her , for the which I have thanked God since many times . " He then instances ladies who through hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dreadful thing , apparently , could happen to a lady in the Middle Ages ! Women , he says , are always too ready to talk , whereas they should refer people who ask them questions to their lords . Eve should have said , " Ask my husband that question , not me " ? and all would have been well . The primary virtues appear to have been , after silence , meekness and submission to your husband , when you were lucky enough to get one ? a point much insisted on by medieval writers , whose judgment was possibly biased by the fact that for the most part they belonged to the sex which produces husbands . Submission to your lord , even if he is intolerable , is much insisted on , and a dreadful story follows of a lady who quarreled with another of whom she was jealous . After they had torn each other 's caps and hair , the accused broke the nose of her accuser , " which is the fairest member that man or woman hath and sitteth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never found in his heart to love her heartily as he did before , " says the knight . And a still more awful story warns ladies against argument with their spouses , for a hasty husband once broke his wife 's nose for chiding him in public . " Wherefore , " says the knight , " before folk she must ever let him have the mastery , and remember a woman may chastise her husband and make him do well with fairness rather than with rudeness . " Against vanities of dress the knight is especially eloquent , and it is amusing to notice how the universal masculine distrust of fashion 's latest freaks besets husbands and fathers in the Middle Ages too . No wise woman , the knight declared more than once , should he too hasty to adopt the newest fashions , because they are often of dubious origin . He tells how a holy bishop , who was a noble and great clerk , preached " to great Poison " of ladies and gentlemen about their inordinate vanities of apparel . Men , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those on women . But the good bishop 's wrath was chiefly directed toward the extremely high-horned caps then worn by ladies , and he reminded them that Noah 's flood destroyed the world because of the pride and " disguising " there was among women . " Women he so horned , " said he , " as snails , harts , and unicorns , I doubt the devil sit not between those horns . " The knight then tells of a lady who took a quarter of a day to array her , and of another who kept mass waiting while she dressed , and what became of her ! Against such pride he warns his girls with many other moral examples . " Such dressing , " he says . " is the sin of pride for which the angels fell into hell . And so it may hap they shall that use it . " In these days of immoderate experiments in so-called beauty culture , and advertisements in ladies ' papers entitled " Beauty by Post , " it is instructive to note that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in imperial Rome . The knight had a dreadful tale of the ultimate fate of a lady who had , when living , enameled her face and plucked out her hair , in order to obtain the height of forehead so admired in the fourteenth century . Where she had pulled out hairs to effect the fashionable degree of baldness , imps pricked her with diabolical instruments and fearful travesties of her washes and lotions , and this because she had " so plucked and popped and painted and farded her visage for to please the sight of the world . " Women , moralized the knight . should be satisfied to he as God made them and be humbly grateful that He made them in His image instead of making them " not women but dumb beasts and serpents . " The knight then encourages his daughters by the example of " good ladies " of Scripture ? Ruth , Martha , and others ? but warns them against the pride of Vashti and of Jezebel , " who hated hermits , men of Holy Church , and all them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died felonously . " He quotes with approval the learning of St. Katherine ; and it is interesting to notice that in all the saints ' lives the learning and accomplishments of this saint are dwelt upon with fervor , but we do not find that such prodigies of learning were expected from secular women . But the Knight of the Tower recommends the example of a certain " good lady , " Deborah , who went to school " to learn virtuous things and Scripture , " and who learned to rule well an evil husband . The knight then goes on to condemn gluttony and winebibbing , and describes its deplorable effect on the complexion . Charity to the poor is highly recommended , and he tells of the vision of a holy man who saw his kinswoman 's soul weighed in a balance against her gay coats and furs , which " with her evil deeds . jewels , and false language of slander " all outweighed her good deeds and caused her to be thus accused by the Enemy : " St. Michael , thou knowest this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thou wottest well less might have sufficed her after the law of God , and with the value of one she might have clothed fifty poor men and kept them from cold in gowns of white or russet . " ' Pitifulness and courtesy are indispensable virtues in the gently born . The higher her lineage the more gentle and courteous must a lady be , and must " ever give that she bath in great plenty , that is , weeping tears and a piteous heart . " And courtesy , as we learn from the Books of Courtesy that existed in all languages in the Middle Ages , included morality as well , and should be the chief study of life . Now it was in vain for the medieval moralist to preach about the falseness of women in his Epics and his Troy books , and his endless stories of Helen and Cressida . All the authorities on real life , that is , the poets and historians , were against him ; Froissart and Chaucer told the same tale ? " Ever a hundred good against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Envoy to Bukton " touching marriage " in an irreverent and satirical vein , authorities tell us it was like the Envoy to the story of Griselda , purely a tribute to conventions of the day and not to be taken literally . It took the medieval moralist all his time to point out to woman her errors and shortcomings , and after all she does not appear to have minded him much . There was , in fact , no repressing her in any age , as John Knox found when , horrified by the spectacle of four female sovereigns in power and a fifth imminent , he blew the " First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regimen of Women . " " Man , " said he , " in many cases blind , doth in this respect see very clearly . . . . It is more than a monster in nature that a woman shall reign and have empire above man ? " and he , goes on to quote at length the opinions of the fathers and of Aristotle on this subject . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( women ) weak , frail , impatient , feeble , and foolish , and experience hath declared them inconstant , variable , cruel , and lacking the spirit of counsel and regimen . " " Aristotle , " went on the " Blast , " " cloth plainly affirm that wheresoever women bear dominion , there must needs the people be disordered , living and abounding in all intemperancy. given to pride , excess , and vanity , and finally in the end that they must needs come to confusion and ruin . " Was it the result of training , or was it the impervious quality of the feminine conscience , that women of earlier ages do not appear to have been cast down as much as they might by these strictures ? After all , their lot was little worse than that of men . They must have been dull , so must their husbands . Men had wars , but their wives had pickles and pre serves . There is much food for reflection in pickles . Supervising the host of servants , seneschals , stewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages must have been a serious business . The etiquette and service of the age were very elaborate , the books of courtesy , of carving , and the numerous works on manners that fill the period seem to contain directions to occupy a lifetime . And though the state of society and manners was crude in many ways and the standard of household comfort and cleanliness very low ( as witness the household hooks of Henry VIII. ) , still the conditions of life do not seem to have been actually much harder on women than on men . The education of women was in proportion as good as that of men , and carried on in much the same way . And as men improved , women improved with them . When the moral force came , the standard of women 's education was raised at once . The Princess Elizabeth was well skilled in Greek and Latin , and Lady Jane Grey a devoted student of Plato . This is Harrison 's description of Elizabeth 's Court ; and Harrison , let us remember , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " of our courtiers ( of both sexes ) who have not the use and skill of sundry speeches , besides an excellent vein of writing beforetime not regarded . . . . Truly it is a rare thing with us now to hear of a courtier which hath but his own language . . . Many gentlewomen and ladies there are that besides sound knowledge of the Greek and Latin tongues are thereto no less skilful in the Spanish , Italian , and French . I am persuaded that as the noblemen and gentlemen do surmount in this behalf , so these come very little or nothing behind them for their parts : which industry , " adds the worthy parson , " God continue , and accomplish that which otherwise is wanting . " Now if we continue with Harrison 's description of Elizabeth 's England , there is a seamy side . Foreign manners had exercised a corrupting influence on Englishmen . " Many grievous offences , " said Harrison , the stanch Puritan , " do reign exceedingly in most noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graces gates . " For " the stranger that entereth into the Court of England upon the sudden shall rather imagine himself to come into some public school of the universities . than into a prince 's palace . " Certainly it must have been better for ladies to read histories and write Latin ( however badly ) than to occupy themselves with all the frivolities of the court of the Stuarts . Let us look again at contemporary portraits of the ladies of Elizabethan England . For more than one hundred years after Shakespeare 's death there are no such charming heroines as those that fill the plays and poems of his period . Could Imogen have been conceived in a degraded age , or could the Elizabeth of Spenser 's sonnets have been " weak , frail , impatient. , feeble , and foolish " ? Some of the ladies who talked euphuism. and reed the Arcadia were very possibly dull , and perhaps rather tiresome , but an educational ideal must have the defects of its qualities , and nobody can help the Pinenix turning up once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , early in the next century , in the person of Anna Maria von Schurman , born at Cologne in 1607 , who was a prodigy of learning and a model of all the virtues . Accounts of this remarkable lady are left us by various masculine contemporaries whom her accomplishments appear to have stupefied completely . One of them says : " No one paints better , no one works better in brass , wax , or wood . In needlework she excels all women past or present . . ? . Not content with European languages , she understands Hebrew , Arabic , and Syriac , and writes Latin so well that no one who has devoted his whole life to it can do it better . " Englishwomen appear to have been less immoderate in matters of learning . But the moral impulses that braced the nation during the age of Elizabeth bore fruit in the advances made then in women 's education . With the constitutional changes that succeeded that reign came a lowering of the standard . The moral force had left the court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duchess of Newcastle have left us memorials of the force that remained . But on the whole the intellectual standard of women remained lower until it sank beneath the debasing influences of the Restoration , when moral corruption , and factiousness , social , religious , and political , had lowered the national standard . In spite of the fact that Queen Anne 's reign was one of the greatest periods in English literature , with the exception of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu few women were well educated . Swift declared " . .. that not one gentleman 's daughter in a thousand has been brought to read or understand her own natural tongue . " Addison deplored the low standard of female intelligence : " the toilet is their great scene of business and the right adjusting of their hair the principal employment of their lives . " He allowed that there did exist " multitudes ... who join all the beauties of the mind to the ornaments of dress , " but in describing a literary lady 's library he suggests with gentle malice that the more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French romances popular at the period , notably Clelia , " which opened of itself at a passage which describes two lovers in a bower . " The change came , however , after the middle of the century . The moral force had reasserted itself and produced realities , so that instead of French romances and Deistic philosophy came Fielding 's novels and the religious revival . The national conscience was moved , and with that came an elevation in educational standards . The second half of the eighteenth century is filled with a mob of ladies who wrote with ease , who read , and who talked , who were interested in ail sorts of questions , social , political , and religious ; ladies whose serious compositions were , it must be owned , in a few cases extraordinarily dull , but who talked well and who wrote delightful letters , two minor arts sadly neglected by our own age . We owe them a large debt of gratitude , these Georgian ladies ? poets , novelists , letter-writers ? Miss Burney , Mrs. Barbauld , Mrs. Opie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Edgeworth . Miss Ferrier , Hannah More , and ? crown and flower of all ? Jane Austen . Were they all as agreeable as their less learned sisters ? Well , perhaps some of them were rather priggish ? there may be two opinions . Hazlitt was an immense admirer of Mrs. Montagu , but " Daddy " Crisp rudely called her a humbug . It is noteworthy to - day that the learned lady has ceased to be a legitimate type of caricature . She has taken her Place and justified it in spite of the fathers and John Knox and the Eye of the Law . Women have always got education when they wanted it enough , and it is also remarkable that when women do get education , of whatever kind , their invariable tendency is to apply it practically . Women are essentially practical creatures , they like the concrete , their minds are only remotely preoccupied with abstractions , and that , as a rule , when they can get nothing better . It is remarkable in women who are engaged in practical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . The feminine instinct is to reduce all principles to the test of action , and it may be that in the greater issues of life some principles are not susceptible of this test . But the natural woman 's instinct is to apply her principles immediately to somebody or something ? a person for preference . Langland knew that when he recommended the " lovely ladies with their long fingers " to deck churches and tend the sick and poor . The Knight of the Tower had said the same to his daughters , " Give that ye have in great plenty , weeping tears and a piteous heart , " and with the wider field of to-day the efforts widen . The educated ladies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were prominent in organizing all sorts of philanthropic and social work . That always comes with - so- called , " higher education . " Frederika Bremer , the Swedish pioneer of education , began by organizing hospital visiting and charitable work among ladies . It goes on today in England with increased force , since the " piteous heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a wider sphere of action . Now the moral of the foregoing summary appears to be this . It is little use ordaining what the nation is to do with woman , since the course of events seems to argue that she is likely to go on doing as she pleases . And the field of woman 's work is become to-day very wide , and though Latin and Greek and such serious studies may not be indispensable to the development of all the feminine qualities ( indeed , sad experience lies taught many of us that these have sometimes a deplorable effect on the feminine physique ) , still a serious training is indispensable to the woman who is going to undertake a serious occupation , whether it be novel-writing or factory inspecting , or the possibly more onerous task of marrying a genius . The women who have done most have usually managed to get such a training , whatever the opinion of their age in respect to it . And in the interests of the domestic heroine let us remark that among the most capable the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come behind the intellectual . Fanny Burney , when she became Madame d'Arblay , was kept so busy making her clothes that she had not time to produce a second Evelina . And Jane Austen , who had no especially organized education , was an omnivorous reader . Her favorite books were the Spectator , Richardson , Johnson , Crabbe , Cowper , Scott . She was , moreover , an excellent needlewoman , and was " especially great at satin-stitch . " Did not the practice of satinstitch help to point that other inimitable weapon which she used with such exquisite skill , touching the portraits of her friends and neighbors with the most delicate satire in the world ? Every movement must have its drawbacks . The seventeenth century produced Anna Maria Schurman ; the twentieth suffers from a militant spirit amongst a certain section of educated women . The long-standing position of their sex in the eye of the law appears to chafe them with a bitterness aggravated by the fact that , in the words of Mr. Punch , " the strong arm of the law still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is no new thing that some of our women are born with a doublet and hose in their dispositions . The earlier generations , however , adopted more heroic methods of showing it . In the old church at Chelsea there is an epitaph to the memory of Anne Spragge Chamberinyne , which narrates how , " having long declined marriage and aspiring to great achievements unusual to her age and sex , she , on the 30th June , 1690 , on board a fire-ship , in man 's clothing , fought valiantly for six hours against the French , under the command of her brother . " What a pity it is that our Anne Spragges to-day have not such a useful outlet for their energies !
