DEAREST MOTHER , Was there ever an army where a girl could live alone in a tent in the middle of an enormous Aviation Camp and feel as safe as a church , and be treated with the utmost respect and consideration by everyone ? I think not . And I think it is the greatest of proofs of what we are fighting for . Sometimes I get a little discouraged with men and their ways over here , but when I see how they treat American girls , I can see that we are a lap ahead of the others in civilization . I am the only white woman among thousands of soldiers . Which need not worry you , as R. ? McC ? and R ? are in the town , and we are surrounded at a radius of ten to twenty miles by hospitals . The swell Philadelphians , when I arrived , started leaving one by one . So I am here alone , to keep house for one thousand soldiers , two Y.M.C.A. men , and fifty officers , all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a household consisting of two headstrong French girls , and a little boy , who moves slower than anything I ever saw in my life . You ' d laugh if you could see me get up and get breakfast for the two Y men . Then there is a series of soldiers who come in and want breakfast , having just come from the front , or forgotten to get up , or feeling a little sick this morning . ' Then millions of sandwiches to be made , and cocoa ? a barrel of it ! Then I walk in town for my mail , or try 540to barter sugar for eggs in the village . The hens generally do not lay when you offer money , but when you say , J'ai du sucre , ' one can usually find nine or ten of them . Then I rush back and cocoa and sandwich the soldiers till twelve , when I rush to the officers ' mess . There I eat , either alone with thirty lieutenants , or sometimes with the C.O. and his majors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time he starts to tell a story , the major and the captain on each side of him kick him violently under the table , and he either shifts the story ' or shouts , ' Can that ! This one 's all right ! ' Every now and then he gets mad and starts off and then stops with a Alz-hmmmm ! ' and everyone howls and says , ' We are glad you 're here . ' They are all awfully nice and polite to me , really . It all seems to be quite natural and decent , one girl and fifty men ; and it is rather nice to think one lives in a country where it is possible . There is another lady coming right away . I hate to think what she 'll be like . The evenings are terrible and diverting . ON THE TRAIN TO METZ , January 51 , 1919 . I 've had the most awful two days getting off , you ever knew . Last evening I took a cab at six , to take my trunk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of back streets , and in the middle of the backest and blackest of them , the front wheel suddenly rolled off the taxi , and we coasted on the axle for a while and stopped . The taxi man thereon bawled me out for being an American , and said that 's what a good honest man got for taking Americans about . I ran about the dark streets , looking for a taxi . Finally one came along . He did n't want to take me , but I got in and said , ' Pas compris , ' and pointed to my busted chariot , shouting , Cherchez la malle At last we marched , after much swearing and cursing and shifting of baggage . At the Gare de L'Est it was ' necessary to form a tail ' ? which means getting at the end of a line a mile long . I formed a tail , and after half an hour arrived at the window . When I took out the yards of pink and yellow comic sheet we travel on , they said I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . So I went to the end of another line , full of trucks covered with beds , bird-cages , and baby-carriages , all being checked , ahead of me . Now in France , being checked is a matter of being weighed , of making out a separate fiche in triplicate of each article , of carefully placing a tin ruler on the fiche , tearing it in two , and slowly pasting , with a little pail and brush , one half of each fiche on each article . Again I waited half an hour . At last my little wagon with my trunk got on the scales , and they began parlez-vooing about my comic sheet . A man stepped up behind me and paid the official two francs to put his stuff on first . He had a truck with all his household goods on it , a great mattress standing up at the head of it . The baggage-man shoved my trunk off and put the traveling circus on . I could see it would mean at least thirty pastings , and I am afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I , and rushed my shoulder into the mattress , and pushed the truck off the scales , knocking down two men who were standing behind it . They all started howling and brandishing paste-brushes in my face . When angry I can-not speak French , so I just said , white with rage , ' Put that trunk on there again , you old fool ! ' At this point two American captains , who bad seen the affair over a pile of luggage , jumped over the pile , placed their backs firmly against the traveling circus , saying , ' Damn these frogs ! we ' II show ' em how to behave with a lady . Put her trunk on there ! Put it on , damn you ! ' And he put it on , and enregistered it , and it was over . STRASSENHAVS , GERMANY , March 9 , 1919 . DEAR MOTHER , Such a hectic two days ! Yesterday I got so fed up with this place that I decided to go A W 0 L , and accepted the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a corps horse show ? winners of all the classes in the different division shows . There were beaucoup generals and such in attendance , and altogether it was very sporty . Swell white grandstand and white-bordered ring , hung with hemlocks and flags at the corners , and across it the Rhine , with the steamers going up and down . There was a band , and everybody was very sporty . Some rather good jumping horses , except that most of the officers who rode them did n't know how to ride . I went down with the colonel and lieutenant-colonel from here , and some veterinary . Shook them at about 11.30 and went to do some shopping . Went back to show , and this time got a six-foot marine , who lugged coat and bundles . Then I found the show had evolved into races , which were about two miles down the river . I started to walk , and was getting frightfully cross and weary . About a dozen generals went by , with Y girls and nurses safely stowed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodge , waved madly at him , and ran up to get in , when a major- deleted material colonel , and it was all very military and thrilling to me . It was all beautiful , too . The horses looked wonderfully , ? groomed within an inch of their lives , ? and the men were cleaner and snicker and spanner than anything you ever saw . I never realized there was such a crowd of orderlies and horses and things connected with.the administration of a regiment . Even lieutenants have an orderly scampering at their heels , and bringing their horses back and forth when they dismount . It was great seeing them all mount , and get in order , and then to hear the colonel give the order to march , and see the batteries pull up , and pass , and roll off up the road through the frosty fields and the pink sunlight . I stood in the road and wished like anything that I was a part of it , and was going along with them . But I had to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we policed up the canteen that morning until we were all blue in the face . And of course he never came up this road , and would n't have stopped if he had . I had lovely spring flowers on all the tables , and new green blotters neatly thumb-tacked down , and we washed the mud off all the chairs and benches with hot water ! At about 10.50 I got a belated message from G-1 that a car would arrive to pick me up at 11 . It came , with a colonel inside , and I sent word I was n't ready and would go over myself . Major H ? took me over from here , and of course he had a horrible time getting there ? chauffeur was lost , differential was busted , etc. , etc . We got there an hour late , after pushing the car mentally all the way ; and , as usual in the army , the thing did n't start for an hour after that . The review field was most beautiful ? a great , long field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which one looked out and down over acres of rollingwoods and fields . The field itself sloped just a little away from a row of thick spruce woods , in front of which was the reviewing stand , with its flags , and a row of benches for the Y.M.C.A. ladies ! The sun clouded over while we waited ; but just as a wave of excitement thrilled the crowd , and the doughboys came to attention , and the Commander-inChief rode out from behind the spruce trees , the sun came out and shone beautifully on his white horse . He stood up there , like a statue , against the green , at salute , while the band played the Star-Spangled Banner . It made you cry a little . Then he inspected very quickly on horseback , going at a surprising gallop , with all the generals , and chiefs of staff , etc. , etc. , and a perfect army of orderlies after them . After this he made a detailed inspection on foot , which took about an hour and a half , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pretty , and it was so remarkable to see all these long brown rows of men spread out before you , and the German countryside rolling peaceably away beyond . It is nice , after you have been thinking about divisions so long , and seeing only scattered units , actually to see a whole one there before your eyes . I went over to see my outfit while the inspection was away off at the other end . They were all very much bored and very glad to see me , even though I could n't possibly recognize them in their tin hats . The 75 's were beautiful , in their new paint , and the horses were in great shape , and not a mangy one among them . One would have said that the whole regiment had never done anything but parade in new paint , if one did n't know they had been on the front for six months . My old friends the heavies ' ( 314th F.A. ) were drawn up alongside , looking very classy with their new tractors . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business after they had got ' em there through the mud . The paint was still sticky . After the inspection there was a presentation of D.S.C . ' s , which was good . We were right up close , so we could see and hear everything . The C-in-C. made a little speech , and then pinned the crosses on , while somebody read the citations . He shook hands with each man , very warmly and cordially , and had a few words for each . A cute little Indian boy , who comes to the canteen , got one . I asked him what General Pershing said , and he said he congratulated him and asked him where he lived . The actual review was wonderful . I got a place right down beside the reviewing stand , where I could see the faces of all the high officials and also the parade . General Pershing has a very nice smile . His face is stern while at rest , but when he smiles it is no halfway affair , but a good one . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later I found myself stepping forward a little , and it just happened that when I looked up I caught the general 's eye . I backed back hastily , and he smiled most delightfully then ! I never saw a regimental front march past before . It was great . These grand old doughboys , who are the real thing , in their tin hats and with fixed bayonets , coming row on row . There is a seriousness about our army that all the others lack , I think . You get a tremendous feeling of youth and strength and determined unity of purpose from seeing them march by . They are individual men , and yet they are soldiers , too . They double-timed off over the field below the reviewing stand , the whole regiment at a time . My regiment went by last , so when the colonel from G-1 tried to make me start home , I did n't go , but stuck on the line until the last man was past , so the others got quite a way off from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a tall figure coming down the steps of the reviewing stand and walking straight toward me , with his hand out . I gave a little gasp . How do you do , ' said General Pershing , shaking hands with me . ' I am glad to see you here . ' How do you do , General Pershing , ' said I , wondering like Alice in Wonderland , if I ought to say , ' Your Majesty , ' or anything like that . After that , it was all very genial and quite as if he had been anybody . Was n't it fine ? ' said I. ' It certainly was , ' said he . ' They are a fine division . I am proud of them . And they are the real thing , too . They fought as well as they look to-day . ' We conversed a bit , and then he asked me if I would come down and hear him speak to the men , and we started across the field to where the automobiles were . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said he knew all about me ! That is a habit of great men , is n't it ? Let me see , ' he said ; ' where were you in France ? Oh , yes , you were at Colombey-les-Belles . Yes , I know all about you . ' But how ? ' said I. ' I have reports on all you people . I remember about you very well . ' Interesting , if true ! By this time we had hit Colonel F ? and the other eight Y.M.C.A. ladies , and he shook hands with each one and said a good many nice things to us . He is really somewhat of an idealist , I think , and he believes firmly that we do a good job here , and that the whole game is of value to the army , and he told us so and thanked us . Which was nice . In the daily routine , you get to thinking that you are having a good deal of fun and giving very little , and that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone ? especially the head boss ? tell you that the job is worth while . After this he made them a speech . All the men clustered in a field by the road , which ran across a high sort of embankment , so that they were about fifteen feet below us . We , as usual , had box-seats , being up on the road with all the generals and the staffs . It was a most remarkable sight ? a solid sea of men , with their green-brown uniforms , and their red-brown faces , and their brown-brown helmets . Never was a crowd so uniform , yet with such a feeling of individual personalities under their tin hats . General Pershing made quite a good speech , very genuine and very heartfelt and very straight from the shoulder . He told about our part in the war , and the division 's particular part , and he thanked them for their individual part , without which the rest could not have been . He told them he wanted them to carry the spirit of the A.E.F. home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave three cheers . And after this , somebody from somewhere called out the perpetual question of the Army of Occupation , ' When are we going home ? ' at which Pershing laughed , and they all laughed , and the great day was over . I was standing about twenty feet away from General Pershing at that time , and thought he looked a bit lonely , as no one in the army can quite rush up and clap the C.-in-C. on the back and tell him he made a good speech . So I stepped up and shook hands with him this time , and told him it was a good speech ; and he grinned and said , ' Thank you ; you cheer me up immensely . ' I said , ' You speak much better than you used to , ' and he roared . I told him I heard him speak in Washington just before he left , and he laughed again , and said , ' That was a rotten speech , was n't it ? ' Well , ' I said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That man 's a soldier . " ' I am , ' he said . ' But now , ' I said , ' you are a soldier and an orator , too . ' He is , too , ? not because he speaks well , for he does n't , specially , but because he has something real to say , and says it as if he meant it . We then had quite a pow-NA-ow with all the generals ? General Hinds of the Corps and General Lassiter of the Division , and all the chiefs of staff and things . They all looked so funny in their tin hats that I had an awful time to recognize them . Tin hats look wonderful on the young , but I must say on an old gentleman of 55 or 60 , they are a bit quaint . After a little talk , General Pershing started to go . He shook hands again with all of us and said to me , ' I am glad to have met you at last . ' What the deuce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The boys say they got a movie of me all the time I was talking to the C.-in-C. , so be on the lookout for it . STRASSENFIADS , April 19 , 1919 . DEAR MOTHER , I certainly never thought that any place in Germany could get to be home ; but this undoubtedly has . Suddenly , since they heard they were going home , the regiment has all swung around so that they are strong for me , instead of strong against , and the ones that were the worst are now the best . Two or three have even gone so far as to say they are sorry . ' Say , Miss Lee , I certainly am ashamed of myself for beM ' drunk that night . You did n't hear me say nothin ' dirty , did you ? ' Or another : ' Your stock has gone up three hundred per cent in A Battery in the last two weeks . For the first two months the boys did n't compris . But now they do . ' The first of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin pans and playing two accordions , crashed into the Y , and gave me speeches , songs , more speeches , and a song which went something to this effect : ' Mary Lee , we roll along , roll along , etc . Across the deep blue sea . We want cocoa And cocoa we will have . ' There was more to it , but I forget it . Anyway it took away the feeling of being a complete failure quite effectively . A Battery is Captain C ? ' s outfit , and they hang out in Jahlsfeldt , a tiny town down the hill from Strassenhaus . I 've sent some pictures , which please keep carefully for me . They were awful at first , but at the last they fell quite heavily for the Y , and I never saw a nicer or a more humorous bunch . They howled when I came in the mess-hall and gave me the best of good times all through the meal ? most terrific fire of jokes and repartee I 've ever heard . After dinner we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just purchased for a mascot . They are awfully funny with it . Just happens they are all six-footers and giants , and the goat is very small and white , with a pink nose and ears like a rabbit , and they treat it with the utmost gentleness , using curses that they used to on the horses in the quietest , most gentle voice . It is a funny sight to see a great tough soldier called McGovern ' grooming ' the goat . We spent a great deal of time cutting out a blanket for the goat , and red arrows to put on it , and a red binding to go around the edge , and explaining to a German dame how to sew it . Then we went to the top of the hill , ? where the wind was cold , but the view most glorious , ? where I was to umpire a soccer game between the Micks ' and the A.P.A . ' s ? four Catholic and Protestant tables at the mess . It was great fun . Everyone was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were worth and kidding each other . Before it started Sergeant Leith , a charming Scotch character , held up his hand and said , ' No profanity ! First man that swears will be fined five francs . ' And not a swear did I hear all afternoon . Which was going some for A Battery , and for soccer , which is usually an orgy of all the bad language in the army . After the game ( the Micks won , of course ! ) we all adjourned and drank up more cocoa . The 23rd Infantry Machine-Gun Company pulled in in the middle of it , having marched up to take our places . They all came in for cocoa , too , and we went strong till about four-thirty , when we locked up and cleaned up and packed up till five-thirty ? Julia , the maid , and I and Drummond , the K.P . Julia wept off and on all last week . I think she was in love with the K.P . Whenever I asked him what was the matter with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Prob'ly she 's got some-thin ' on her mind . ' That evening the chaplain held his final service in the ex-Y , while the 2nd Division men got drunk in the saloon across the hall , and threw beer glasses through the windows until their officers came in and cleaned ' em out , to the great delight of our men , who said , ' Say , ai n't those guys hard ? ' Ours usually threw their glasses at the barmaid , so that the racket was not audible from without . DEAR MOTHER , Yesterday I went to Cologne . Cologne is a swell city . There is a very beautiful cathedral , and really wonderful shops . It has an atmosphere of age , yet chic , like Paris and Nancy , ? good clothes , good food , good wine , and good art , ? a perfect good breeding about it that this town lacks sadly . Also the Britishers lend a tone to it . They certainly do beat everything for style . Their officers are the smartest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stopped and asked at least ten Tommies questions about well-known things about the town , and the answer was always and invariably and identically , ' I do n't know , miss , ' in that strange cockney brogue . They never know anything , and they never think . You can bet I fell on the neck of two perfectly good Americans , when I saw them on the corner . Where 's the Rathaus at , anyway ? ' I said . ' I ai n't sure , ' says the Yank , but I think it ' s this way , 32nd . Come on anyway , and we 'll find it . ' So they got on either side of me and we went on down the street . Stopped and ate ice-cream , and coffee and some kind of German pudding in a store , they making awfully funny remarks to the barmaid , causing the silent Tummies about to crack surreptitious smiles under their mustachios . They insisted on paying for all the eats , too , and the British could n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Museum , where we hired a guide , and crashed full speed all over the paintings , the guide jabbering as fast as he could in English , and we getting off awful , disrespectful remarks and howling with laughter . I guess there were some good paintings there , only we did n't have time to stop over them . The only ones I liked were a couple of Rubenses and Richter 's picture of Queen Louise ( Queen Quality , of shoe fame ) . Just as we said we had to go , we found there was a collection of Roman stuff , so we decided to do another lap . One of the soldiers was awfully strong on both Biblical and ancient knowledge , and though he knew nothing about the pictures , he knew all about the subjects , and got very excited over them . When the man called our attention to the paint on the old ones , he remarked , ' Well , say , if they 'd ' a ' had to use that there O.D. paint we put on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' luck . ' There was a most wonderful collection of Roman things , which thrilled me to the core . The Museum itself is built on the ruins of a Roman church , and in the cellar there is an ancient tomb , left exactly as it was , with the little vases still in it ? a little square stone-lined hole in the ground , with a few little shelves , and you in a lovely glass bowl , and a couple of chickens or something in two others for you to eat in Hades , or some such notion . Then there were wonderful gold rings and bracelets , and the neatest set of doctor 's instruments ? tiny knives , tweezers , etc. ? and from a child 's tomb a tiny set of rakes , shovels , hammers , etc. , that make the tools the French use now look foolish . Also , the original safety-pin , built on the same model as ours , only slightly more cumbersome . There was a model of the ancient town , with its nice white houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall still stand . It is a little discouraging , really , to think of those old birds coming away up here , and living in a clean city , and writing with a silver penholder , and having lovely mosaic floors , and being altogether more near our civilization than anything since , ? and that back in the one hundreds , ? and then being wiped up and a dirty medieval city built on top of their remains . I would have stayed in that cellar all day , only I 'd decided to get a three-thirty train to Bonn , and catch the six-thirty from there back . Of course , I missed the three-thirty train , and lost my two soldiers in my attempt to catch it . I then tried to go up the Cathedral towers , but the Boches refused to take deleted material kippy at that by now . He was youngish and from Missouri , and has risen from a sergeant last July to being about to be a major now . He had a nice way with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonn , trying to see it before the light failed . The Tommies patrolling the campus of course did n't know whether that was the University or not , but we finally interrogated enough ' Huns ' to get the lay of the land . A British M.P. , even , does n't know a damn thing . All he can say is that he advises you to follow the rileway , ' pointing to the train line . Heavens ! How our soldiers have got it over every other soldier in the world ! Bonn is a lovely spot . It has the quiet , nondescript , **25;125;TOOLONG atmosphere of a college town , and you can feel it the minute you get off the railway . It is partly in the trees , and partly in the faces of the people , and partly in the students . I guess it 's the same in any University town anywhere . Professors do n't care a darn about anything but their stuff , and students do n't care a darn about anything , and they all take their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness swallowed it up . Then we found a poor lone American soldier down on the river-bank , and asked him where we 'd better eat . He led us to a swell hotel , and tried to find his chief ( who is liaison officer with the British ) , but with no success , so we ate in the restaurant of the hotel . It was a very chic place , and the first time I 've ever eaten German food . ( We are n't allowed to . ) We started off with plover 's eggs , which were green and speckled and hard boiled . The rest of the dinner was good , but not remarkably like French . Better than Q.M . food , though . After dinner we walked out to see the palace of the Kaiser 's sister , where a British general lives . It looked ? in the dark ? about like the Spragues ' , or any big place in Brookline . A Tommy was guarding the gate , but seemed inclined to talk to us . Said the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was English , if I remember , so that 's not so awfully smart of her . The British wo n't let her ride horseback , which is her favorite form of sport . Otherwise they treat her as becOmes a princess . Monday . We were much amused at the relief of the guard , which came strolling up as we were talking to the sentry . I expected he ' d get bawled out for talking to us . Not at all . The man ahead of the new guards merely said in a casual way , Well , ye can go now , Mr. ? . ' Itight-o , ' said Mr. So-and-So , and took his place behind the old guard . Gosh ! If ' t were our army , things would go quite differently . Also , we were halted on the way home , which was quaint , too . The British make everybody get off the streets at eight , so , as we went by some building with soldiers in front , one of them casually shouted across the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fresh , we paid no attention . Whereupon he yelled again , ' Halt-whoare-you ? ' as if it was all one word . Are you trying to halt us ? ' says the captain . Yes , sir , ' says the sentry , not even starting to come across the street . Americans , ' said the captain ; and on we went . They never put a light on us or anything . Again , in the American army ' t would have been a little differently managed . I guess one of those Tommies would die in a fit if he could hear one of our sentries yell , ' Halt ! ' and come up in front of you with a bayonet out of the darkness . The town was as dark and deserted as a French town in an air-raid when deleted material much soft pedal , and the chaplain ? a Polish priest ? prayed that the seventy thousand fallen heroes may get out of purgatory as quick as practicable . Of course , the soldiers would n't sing when we sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same . To me it was the rows of bronzed faces of men who had been through it all , and with whom the soft pedal did n't make a dint , and the stacked arms , and the robber barons ' stalwart tower with our flag floating on it , and the beautiful green country stretching for miles about us , and just the fact that we were there , was what was good about it , and the service and the purgatory did n't matter . They blew taps at the end , and that was lovely , as it always is , and a little sad ? and it was over . I made and served lots of lemonade this afternoon , it being a holiday . All my favorites are on K.P . this week , and as the kitchen is just above the Y , they have been dropping in in their blue jeans to cool off between doses of work . So the captain said he 'd court-martial anyone found in the Yin blue jeans . So the K.P . ' s now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their arms , enter triumphantly , and consume buckets of whatever cold drink is handy . They are a nice crowd ? one long lanky Texan , name ' Slim ' James , with a brown face and wild eyes . Last night we played checkers rather late , and then got talking about the war . I asked them all how many Germans they 'd killed . Some of them would n't tell , andjust shook their heads when it came to them . Slim gave me a funny look and said , ' I did kill one , but it was behind the lines . I was wounded , and I found him a-lyin ' there . He was terrible bad ? insides all a-blowed out . I tried to carry him in ? I carried him a little way . But I could n't do it , so I laid him down again and then I killed him to get him out of his misery . I figured it was best . ' Afterwards Slim walked home with me , and he never said a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and say , ' Oh dear , oh dear ! ' You were right , ' I said . Maybe , ' he 'd say , and then again , ' Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear ! ' Slim is only twenty-one , but I feel as if he , and all of these , were years older than me . All the ones who have really fought seem much older than boys of their age used to be at home . I guess you skip ten years of youth if you live through a war . I wish something would happen . This is the last little gasp of war , and it is fun . Whatever anyone may think , war is fun if you are right up where things are happening . I suppose the Germans will sign peace to-morrow , and life will start again on the dull slothfulness of another era of peace and prosperity . But to-night there is the possibility of a fight . M. L.
