The characters are three Chinese , two negroes and a girl . The scene represents a forest of heavy trees on a hilltop in eastern Pennsylvania . To the right is a road , obscured by bushes . It is about four o'clock of a morning in August , at the present time . When the curtain rises , the stage is dark . The limb of a tree creaks . A negro carrying a lantern passes along the road . The sound is repeated . The negro comes through the bushes , raises his lantern and looks through the trees . Discerning a dark object among the branches , he shrinks back , crosses stage , and goes out through the wood to the left . A second negro comes through the bushes to the right . He carries two large baskets , which he places on the ground just inside of the bushes . Enter three Chinese , one of whom carries a lantern . They pause on the road , SECOND CHINESE All you need , To find poetry , Is to look for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could find it without , On an August night , If I saw no moreThen the dew on the barns . The Second Negro makes a sound to attract their attention . The three Chinese come through the bushes . The first is short , fat , quizzical , and of middle age . The second is of middle height , thin and turning gray ; a man of sense and sympathy . The third is a young man , intent , detached . They wear European clothes. p. 3 SECOND CHINESE glancing at the baskets.Dew is water to see , Not water to drink:We have forgotten water to drink.Yet I am contentJust to see sunrise again. I have not seen itSince the day we left Pekin.It filled my doorway , Like whispering women . FIRST CHINESE And I have never seen it.If we have no water , Do find a melon for meIn the baskets .

" The court had known poverty and wretchedness ; humanity had invaded its seclusion , with its suffering and its pity . " The limb of the tree creaks . Yes : it is true of maxims , Just as it is true of poets , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHINESE Drink from wise men ? From jade ? Is there no spring ? Turning to the negro , who has taken a jug from one of the baskets . Fill it and return .

The First Chinese lights the candle and places it on the ground near the water bottle . THIRD CHINESE There is seclusion of porcelainThat humanity never invades . FIRST CHINESE with sarcasm . Porcelain ! THIRD CHINESE It is like the seclusion of sunrise , Before it shines on any house . FIRST CHINESE Pooh ! p. 5 SECOND CHINESE This candle is the sun ; This bottle is earth:It is an illustrationUsed by generations of hermits.The point of difference from realityIs this:That , in this illustration , The earth remains of one color  --  It remains red , It remains what it is.But when the sun shines on the earth , In realityIt does not shine on a thing that remainsWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . THIRD CHINESE And there are indeterminate momentsBefore it rises , Like this , With a backward gesture . Before one can tellWhat the bottle is going to be  --  Porcelain , Venetian glass , Egyptian Well , there are momentsWhen the candle , sputtering up , Finds itself in seclusion , He raises the candle in the air . And shines , perhaps , for the beauty of shining.That is the seclusion of sunriseBefore it shines on any house . Replacing the candle . FIRST CHINESE wagging his head . As abstract as porcelain . SECOND CHINESE Such seclusion knows beautyAs the court knew it.The court wokeIn its windless pavilions , And gazed on chosen mornings , As it gazedOn chosen porcelain.What the court saw was always of the same color , And well shaped , And seen in a clear light . He points to the candle . It never woke to see , And never knew , The flawed jars , The weak colors , The contorted glass.It never knewThe poor lights . He opens his book significantly . When the court knew beauty only , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through povertyAnd wretchedness , Through suffering and pity . He pauses . It is the invasion of humanityThat counts . The limb of the tree creaks . The First Chinese turns , for a moment , in the direction of the sound. p. 6 FIRST CHINESE thoughtfully . The light of the most tranquil candleWould shudder on a bloody salver . SECOND CHINESE with a gesture of disregard . It is the invasionThat counts.If it be supposed that we are three figuresPainted on porcelain As we sit here , That we are painted on this very bottle , The hermit of the place , Holding this candle to us , Would wonder ; But if it be supposedThat we are painted as warriors , The candle would tremble in his hands ; Or if it be supposed , for example , That we are painted as three dead men , He could not see the steadiest light , For sorrow.It would be trueIf an emperor himselfHeld the candle.He would forget the porcelainFor the figures painted on it . THIRD CHINESE shrugging his shoulders . Let the candle shine for the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it may be trueThat nothing is beautifulExcept with reference to ourselves , Nor ugly , Nor high , Pointing to the sky . Nor low . Pointing to the candle . No : not even sunrise.Can you play of this Mockingly to First Chinese . For us ? He stands up. p. 7 FIRST CHINESE hesitatingly . I have a songCalled Mistress and Maid.It is of no interest to hermitsOr emperors , Yet it has a bearing ; For if we affect sunrise , We affect all things . THIRD CHINESE It is a pity it is of women.Sing it .

The Third Chinese takes various things out of the basket for tea . He arranges fruit . The First Chinese watches him while he plays . The Second Chinese gazes at the ground . The sky shows the first signs of morning . FIRST CHINESE The mistress says , in a harsh voice , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my door , And I  --  I am tired of him . " She says sharply , to her maid , " Sing to yourself no more . " Then the maid says , to herself , " He will be thinking in strange countriesOf the white stones near her door ; But it is me he will seeAt the window , as before . " He will be thinking in strange countriesOf the green gown I wore.He was saying good-by to her . " The maid drops her eyes and says to her mistress , " I shall sing to myself no more . " THIRD CHINESE That affects the white stones , To be sure . They laugh. p. 8 FIRST CHINESE And it affects the green gown . SECOND CHINESE Here comes our black man .

I am sure you heardThe first eloping footfall , And the drum Of pursuing feet . FIRST CHINESE amusedly . It was not an elopement.The young gentleman was seenTo climb the hill , In the manner of a tragedianWho sweats.Such things happen in the evening.He wasUn misrable. p. 9 SECOND CHINESE Reach the lady quickly . The First Chinese strikes the instrument twice as a prelude to his narrative . FIRST CHINESE There are as many points of viewFrom which to regard herAs there are sides to a round bottle .

FIRST CHINESE She was represented to meAs young.Therefore my song should goOf the color of blood . He strikes the instrument . The limb of the tree creaks . The First Chinese notices it and puts his hand on the knee of the Second Chinese , who is seated between him and the Third Chinese , to call attention to the sound . They are all seated so that they do not face the spot from which the sound comes . A dark object , hanging to the limb of the tree , becomes a dim silhouette . The sky grows constantly brighter . No color is to be seen until the end of the play. p. 10 SECOND CHINESE to First Chinese . It is only a treeCreaking in the night wind . THIRD CHINESE shrugging his shoulders . There would be no creakingIn the windless pavilions . FIRST CHINESE resuming . So far the lady of the present balladWould have been studiedBy the hermit and his candleWith much philosophy ; And possibly the emperor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a way with balladsThat the more pleasing they areThe worse end they come to ; For here it was also representedThat the lady was poor  --  The hermit 's candle would have thrownAlarming shadows , And the emperor would have heldThe porcelain in one hand She was represented as clingingTo that sweaty tragedian , And weeping up the hill . SECOND CHINESE with a grimace . It does not sound like an elopement . FIRST CHINESE It is a doleful ballad , Fit for keyholes . THIRD CHINESE Shall we hear more ? SECOND CHINESE Why not ?

But this will be a part of sunrise , And can you tell how it will end ?  --  Venetian , Egyptian , Contorted glass He turns toward the light in the sky to the right , darkening the candle with his hands .

The First Chinese walks toward the bushes to the right . He stands by the roadside , as if to attract the attention of any one passing . ANNA simply . When he was in his fields , I worked in ours  --  Wore purple to see ; And when I was in his gardenI wore gold ear-rings.Last evening I met him on the road.He asked me to walk with himTo the top of the hill.I felt the evil , But he wanted nothing.He hanged himself in front of me .

The candle of the sunWill shine soonOn this hermit earth . Indicating the bottle . It will shine soonUpon the trees , And find a new thing Indicating the body .
