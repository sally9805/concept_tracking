THE average physical age of man is thirty-three ; his average educational age is eighteen , or thereabouts . A few men go on to school after eighteen , but they learn nothing fundamental , for theories , methods , and facts are not fundamental : they belong to the useful , the professional . Here and there is a student perennially eighteen years old in mind , who unlearns a few important things in and after college ; but most freshmen are what they are , and after three years in college they are seniors . They come to college with all their educational clothes on , asking the faculty if it will please help button them up . College gives a little better fit to the educational garment . We live on and learn , but the lessons from seventeen to seventy are only a review and an application of those we learned from six to sixteen . In any national survey of education , therefore , the higher schools and colleges are negligible . Our education as a people is that of the secondary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , more than in all other American institutions , are the issues of an enlightened national life ; issues no longer national merely , for the war has made them vital to the life of the world . American democracy is now a world-issue . Already from overseas the peoples are coming to study our institution of democracy ; the Japanese , with keen , characteristic insight , singling out the public schools ? as if in them were the source and the secret of democracy . Certainly no democracy can be better than its educational system ; for democracy , more than any other political programme , is a programme of education . The spirit of democracy- is the fruit of education , and never an inheritance , unless an education can be inherited , devised by will , and blessed upon a child by laying-on of hands . You can come by the spirit of aristocracy that way , for the **42;81;TOOLONG spirit is a negation and an assumption . One may even assume that he is a Kaiser and a vice-gerent of God . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop modestly with whatever else there is to assume . We all alike inherit the Constitution ; and it doth not appear at birth what we shall be , a President in Washington , or a Washington correspondent , or both ; for every child , although born a presidential candidate , can not commit his nomination and election to the hands of the priest who christens hint , as he can his social position ; he must leave it all to the large , firm hands of the future . How many American parents hate this divine hazard of democracy ! ' I will take no chance with my boy ! ' a mother said to me recently , who had come from New Jersey to Boston with her young son : as if the democratic hazards for her boy might be fewer in Boston ; and as if money and birth and breeding brought to Boston might overcome the handicap of equality conferred by the Constitution upon her son . Why is she afraid : Because I have boys in Hingham ? Mine are not . the only boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as her boy will soon find out . Every boy in Hingham is a challenge to my boys ; so is every boy in Boston , and in Baton Rouge , and in Bagdad . It is the girls in Hingham that I am afraid of . Money and birth and breeding count in a democracy ? for and against a man ; education and purpose , however , count a great deal more and altogether for a man . But count how ? What is the true end of American education ? ' Is it life or a living ? ' It is neither life nor a living . We can live and get a living without an education , as we can marry and give in marriage . But we can not make the United States a democracy without education . The true end of American education is the knowledge and , practice of democracy ? whatever other personal ends an education may serve . Education has turned a corner since we went to school , and finds itself face to face with a bigger thing than life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face with a big . enough thing to die for in France , a big enough thing to go to school for in America ? going to school , on the whole , being more difficult than dying . Life and the getting of a living may have been the proper ends of our private education heretofore ; such ends are no longer legitimate . Neither life nor the getting of a living , but living together , this must be the single public end of a common public education hereafter . This new and larger end demands a new and larger thought of education . The day of the little red schoolhouse , and all other little things in American education must pass . The large schoolhouse must come . Our present school concepts are as inadequate as are our What do the Japanese expect to find ? Surely nothing less than this whole nation in school , for we are a literate people ; and nothing less than the whole nation in school together , one common school , for we are without caste as a people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common school until it gets the conception of democracy , the abstract , spiritual meaning of democracy ; for democracy is a spirit , and they who know the truth of democracy know it in spirit . What the Japanese will actually find is a democracy divided educationally against itself ; wrong in its aim ; weak in its purpose ; feeble in its support ; faltering in its faith ; and notonly divided , but hostile , in its educational plans . It is bad enough that eighteen per cent of our children do not attend school at all ; it is not so bad for democracy , however , as that our other eighty-two per cent should be divided in their education by private , parochial , industrial , and the regular public schools , until we can be said to have no common educational programme , no common educational purpose , no common educational ideal ? no common school . Yet what else but a common school can he the head of the corner of democracy ? We must go to school ; we must all go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a common language , a common course of study , a common purpose , faith , and enthusiasm for democracy . Americanization is not this new educational ideal . The world is not to be Americanized . A few millions of foreigners in America need to he Americanized ; but all the millions of Americans in America need to be democratized . Nothing less than the democratization of America dare be our educational aim . I have not worked out the new course of study . This paper is a plea , not a programme . One thing I know : we must have a common school for all the people ; and all the people must attend a common school until every American child has a high-school education . It is not a dream ; it is not impossible ? unless democracy is a dream and impossible . The present standard of American education is a fourth-grade standard ? and less ! Only 6.36 per cent of all the children enrolled in American schools finish the eighth grade . This is not making America safe for democracy . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , on from the eighth grade to the end of the high school , we must push the education of the whole people before we can trust the people with democracy . There will be need of special schools aplenty ? for the subnormal : privateschools for the feeble-minded ; vocational schools for the slow and the stubborn ; but for the normal , one common school only , for rich and poor , up to the end of the " high school ; by which time we are pretty nearly all that we need to be for purposes of democracy . Is this a new educational language ? It is no newer than the new demands . no more foolish than genuine democracy . The old order has changed , and given place to so large an educational need that we have neither the mind nor the machinery for it . ' Fake the country clear across , and our educational mind and machinery are little better than a reproach . And our machinery for education is better than our mind for it We have better buildings , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than public sympathy and support . Poorer than he poorest piece of kit in all of our educational outfit is the individual American 's support of his public school . In this new and larger education there will be great elasticit y , providing for the special ease , the educational machine having a transmission with plenty of speeds ahead . and even a reverse gear for those who are backward . But a larger , simpler , speedier education is to be provided , that shall reduce the number of school years , and thus lessen the number of special cases ; that shall reduce the number of narrow school courses ? commercial , general business , college , and vocation ? to one common course , one broad , universal course , thus educating for democracy first , and after that for life and a living ? and even for entrance into college . Entrance into college ! O Lord , how long shall American public-school education suffer this incubus of the college ? A special programme of training , vocational , business , or college , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Decalogue , is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution , and a menace to democracy . Moreover , it is German , no matter how we try to clothe it . Such vocational training was in Germany , and is here , a deliberate attempt to create a working-class . Vocational education before the end of a general high-school course is education backward , the training of a man into a machine , a soul into a pair of hands . It is education for autocracy ? the German system , which , in its ' People 's Schools , ' carries 90 per cent of German children up to our eighth grade , then blocks all further education , except in trade and continuation schools . These are the ' masses , ' and not an average of one in ten thousand gets through these ' Peoples ' Schools ' into the gymnasium , or high school , with the other 10 per cent ? the children of the ' classes . ' Masses and classes until recently in American education have been one , the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guise of ' education for a living , ' or in some other robe of light , the German devil of vocational training goes up and down the land , installing machinery in the high-school basements , to steal away the quiet of the study room ; and , holding out ' Big Money ' in one hand , and a desiccated textbook in the other , says to the restless high-school boys , ' Choose ! ' American education is going vocationally mad , going bad ; for behind this mischievous propaganda is a purpose and a philosophy not had of democracy . Let me quote a passage from a textbook by a native American high-school teacher : ' In our country , where every youth in his first year in school learns that he may be president some day ; where parents permit their children to look down upon their modest callings ; where the higher professions are overcrowded , manual labor despised , the farms deserted , we often find in the serving class a weak , discontented class of people . In sharp contrast to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what they had to do and did it , without feeling that it injured their dignity . ' They , the servant class of Germany , had been educated to servitude , he means ; whereas , in this country , as he goes on to say , ' A " bum " wanted a dollar for carrying three small handbags for us to the station ' ; all because of this idiotic American teaching about some day being president ! That ' bum ' had had no presidential teaching . He might have had the ' business course ' in school , perhaps ; for , instead of a promise of the presidency , our schools nowadays hold out the necessity of making money , making it quick . and a lot of it . ' Double your salary ' is our educational slogan ? salary , not wages . The next revision of the Bible will doubtless read : ' The salary of sin is death . ' The word , with all its pretensions , has no place in our democratic dictionary . Vocational training can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . The American mind reacts in an American way ? turns hostile , instead of servile ; mobilizes into camps , instead of castes ; and goes forth to fight , chanting the Declaration of Independence . European education , as James Bryce says , has taught men either to look up or to look down . In America we look at each other on the level , square in the eye ; and our education must make that look friendly with perfect understanding . As a matter of fact , however , we are not educating enough workers , laborers , I mean , who work with their hands ; nor shall we till we educate everybody to work with his hands , to produce something , something elemental , essential for human existence . Who does not do some creative work with brain or hands lives a mendicant , dies a pauper , and lies buried in the potter 's field , no matter what mausoleum marks his tomb . We should be educated to the biology , the philosophy ? the democracy ? of labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and every manager and professional man might well return once in seven years for a sabbatical year at that trade . But such training is not the business of the public schools . I count myself a laboring man . I believe in labor and laborers . There must be a laboring class , educated as a class , and we must all belong . I have always worked with my hands , and the best I could with my head , too . A college class is not a garden of cabbages ; not exactly . Work ? God works . We all work , or ought to . Christ had his kit of tools .. It is not work that divides masses front classes , and sets worker against employer , nor is it money ; it is lack of understanding . ' Capital and Labor must get together , ' is the slow and still half-sincere cry of Capital . That belief was not in Capital 's education , nor in Labor 's either ; and both are asking , ' How ? How can a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , Labor , - which are now separated , get together ? ' But they must ! Then they must begin together , and stay together , not as Capital and Labor , but as schoolboys and men . Not long since , at a notable meeting of capitalists in Atlantic City , Labor was earnestly urged to get together with Capital ? hut not at Atlantic City . No labor leader was invited to get together with the capitalists there ! The separation is educational : it began in school ; and , wide as it now is , it shall go even wider with the spread of vocational and class education . Education and shoemaking are not the same thing . Said the president of the Stetson Shoe Company to me , ' We do n't want boys taught to make shoes in school . We can teach them better here at the factory . We want them educated by the schools . We need intelligent men , adaptable men , interested men , who see that their welfare and our welfare are one welfare . ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a printing-shop ! ) will give the green hand skill enough for wages . doing for him all that the years of distracting vocational work in school would do , and do but poorly . Ask the manufacturer if it is good business to spend years for hours , especially those precious school years so greatly needed for intelligence , adaptability , and that community of interests which sees in welfare , ' All for each , and each for all ' ! A democracy is a whole people educated up to the standard desired by the Stetson Shoe Company . It is a whole people getting together ; and the closer together , the better for the democracy . The purpose of our public-school system is to start the whole people together , and keep the whole people together for all their young years , until by calling and election their ways must part ; a parting not to be allowed before the end of the high-school course , in order to forestall the unequal ideals of the future , the suspicions , jealousies . and savage interests that education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such education is not skill . It is understanding . Let vocational guidance become a part of every high-school curriculum ; but set up no machine in the cellar . Let no vocational work steal from the book work ; let no trade , industrial business , no normal or technical school , divide the time with the high school . They must follow the high school . Technical and normal schools are increasingly necessary ; whereas trade schools ? schools to teach moulding , shipbuilding , coal-mining , trawling , and tombstone-cutting ? are sheer nonsense . What better trade school than the shop ? The technical school is a college and should be of college grade . A high school of commerce makes commerce the business of babes . Why not also a high school of medicine , of theology , of law ? Is commerce less exacting than these other callings ? and are merchants so much poorer mentally than other men , that an eighth-grade education gives them intellectual room and verge enough ? We can build nothing for democracy on a fourth-grade foundation : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has magnified and mightily mutiplied citizenship over the face of the world , and revealed , not only how inadequate , but how dangerous , a thing for citizenship a little learning is . Yet here is the average fourth-grade man inheriting the citizenship of the earth . The world and they that dwell therein have , of a sudden , become democratic ? become the average man 's with his fourth-grade education ! What will he do with his world ? in Russia ? in America ? Responsibility has not kept pace with liberty ; education with ideality . Politically we have suffered a series of ' double promotions , ' lifted from the first grades , and set clown to problems , grades , and grades ahead . There is only one thing to do : give us more education , which , in the United States , means an education to the end of the high school for every citizen , even though compelled by law ; an undivided general course , broadly human , broadly democratic ? and after that the shop , the technical school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic education is our great national need . Governments are not safe in the hands of any single class ? a democracy , of all governments , the least safe . Heretofore the issues dividing us nationally have been sectional , economic , commercial , fiscal , the political cleavage never following social or ' class ' lines . It is different to-day . The ugly word ' class ' now thrusts up its long , low bulk like a reef dead ahead . We must go about ! Education is a class-leveler . Though not by any means a cure for the inequalities of life , education comes nearer than any other thing to being the lowest common denominator of the ' vulgar fractions ' of society that ? we call classes . American education , however , is growing ever more divided . Instead of leveling class distinctions , our schools are erecting them , ? the vocational school its class wall , the private school its class wall , shutting in between them the common public school ? after the order of the old world , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of education is a sort of dress-circle seat in heaven , un-American and anti-American , and no substitute at all for the common public school . All true forces of democracy are centripetal , getting-together forces ; for , as Chesterton puts it , ' All real democracy is an at tempt ( like that of a jolly hostess ) to bring the shy people out . ' Out where ? Out where the self-confident people are . But what private school that I know is jolly hostess to the shy and timid ? I prepared for college in a private school , at a time , thOugh , when there was no common high school in my town . A private school , I say , but not of the ' select ' variety , or I should not have been admitted . A lad of thirteen , I rode through the beautiful school-grounds on horseback , as direct from the farm as a can of morning milk . I had come On the gallop , bareheaded , barefooted ? to my sudden confusion , when I found those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . kind man , who stood looking me over quizzically , not critically ; for he was not selecting me , I was selecting him , and it pleased and puzzled him . For nearly five years I went to that institute which , with the coining of the town high school , had no excuse for being , and shortly ceased to be . In that same city were three other excellent academies , which died like the institute and rose again ? in the common high school . le has not happened so in some other places . In the town where I now live the old Academy is still doing business . The public high school in this town was opened in 1872 , but the Academy , founded in 1784 , did well , and in a public way , for almost a hundred/Tears. what the high school is now doing . The Academy lives on , however ? select private school now , a sort of educational wedge , splitting the schoolchildren and dividing the town 's school interest and support . The town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good schools as they can be under the circumstances ? though evidently they lack something which the Academy has , and which possibly they might have if the Academy were closed . The town 's public schools are not so good as they ought to be . And I have four sons to educate . These four are ' all I have , and nothing but the best is good enough for them . ' I had hardly ' settled here before the grocery-man , bringing kerosene and coffee , remarked as grocery-men do here , ' Of course , you 'll send your boys down to the Academy ; they are nice and clean down there . ' And a little later , the town 's first citizen calmed my troubled school-spirit by concluding , ' Then , if you do n't like the public schools , do as the rest of us do : send your children down to the Academy . ' This is how the rest of us ' improve the public schools in Hingham ; and in Weymouth neat to Hingham ; and in Braintree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in Milton next to Quincy ? and in Boston . The town of Milton has just built a magnificent high school . I pass it on my way to Boston , and I say , ' Truly the Commonwealth believes in educe. tion . ' Then I remember that hardly a child of aristocratic Milton attends that public school . Still , Milton , of course , believes in public schools ? for the public . Milton , itself . however , is private . So is Hingham . We Hingham folk know that the American public-school system is the lest in the world , and good enough ? except for my children . ' Now , my children Well , ' my children ' really are extraordinary ? four perfect specimens of the average boll ! They look it , act it ? and actually seem to know it . I helped them , to be sure , but not so much as certain scions of auld Irish royalty down at the public , school . They had help , too , from a bunch of stout descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Little Lord Faunderoyity , from one who came to Hingham High School straight down the Appian Way . For all the roads that used to lead to Rome now run to Hingham , and terminate in her public schools . Here gather most of Hingham 's future citizens , quite un-:Americanized ? young Cangiano , Bjorklund , Weijane , Wainakainen , and with them four young Sharps , Americanized by birth , but not yet democratized . If these four Sharps can do some Americanizing ,  --  and the public school is the best place to do it in , ? they can get in turn sonic , wholesome democratizing to balance the account . Do not the public schools need my four boys ? Shall the newcomers from overseas find only Shoelenburgs , Chiofolos , Kozlofiskis , and Salomaas in high school , with never a Sharp or a Smith among them ? Here are the names of the New England boys , dead on the fields of France , as published in the Boston Herald to-day  --  January 13 . NEW ENGLAND BOYS ON CASUALTY LIST Killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vt . ICARZONIAROYK , CORP . MARION . Ansonia , Ct . SHANSE , CORP . .10SEPII J. , Torrington , Ct . LEFRANQOIS , PRIV .

My own four were too young to go , but they would have gone ? to fight , to die , had the war lasted longer . If my four boys could . fight for democracy in France , they can go to school for democracy in the United States ! Good average boys my four are , just the kind to grow into democratic citizens , and just the sort to go to school with those little foreign Americans , like Karzomaroyk , Lefrancois , Mikenezonis , and Murad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the sort to help make Hingham 's public schools what they ought to be . Hingham 's public schools are far from what they ought to be , because four Sharps and a Smith or two are not enough . All the boys and girls of Hingham are necessary to make Hingham 's public schools what they ought to be . But instead of all going to Hingham 's public schools , Hingham 's few boys are scattered between the public schools and Derby Academy , Thayer Academy , Milton Academy , Dummer Academy , Andover Academy ? boys who ought to be with my boys in Hingham 's common school ; boys whom my boys will never know , not even when they meet later in Hingham 's town meeting . Yet Hingham is not so bad as its neighbor town of Hanover , Hingham and Hanover are symptomatic of New England , as New England is symptomatic of the Eastern States generally . In the way of schools the state of New York is perhaps the least democratic community in the country , having practically no common school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York patronize only the private school . Let the Japanese visitors go down South , and they shall find another segregation ? of white and black children in the schools , both being educated for life and a living , but neither for living together , for democracy . And yet the South 's treatment of the negro citizen is more consistent , and , on the whole , more democratic , than New England 's . Boston gives the negro the best of educations and the meanest of chances to live . It is in the Middle West that our visitors shall come closest to their quest . The best public schools in the United States are the schools of the Middle West . The people of the West believe in their schools , they spend without stint for them , and to a degree most shocking to the exclusive East and South , they attend them . Their faith in public-school education was incorporated in the Act of 1787 , setting aside the Northwest Territory ; wherein was a provision forever prohibiting slavery in all that territory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West ? in Chicago ; and there are sure to be more as wealth increases and social privileges multiply : but the present generation of the West got its education in the public schools ; and it is the system of education in the West , and the spirit of education in the West , that these visiting educators will carry back with them for adoption in Japan . Under the Constitution , North and South , East and West share alike certain great obligations which , taken together , are democracy , the preparation for which can begin only in a common education . However different the social conditions into which we are born ; however far diverging , through inheritance and personal effort , our individual paths , there is a common national inheritance into which we are all born , a body of common knowledge which we must all learn , a code of common principles which we must all follow , a load of common tasks which we must all shoulder , and a faith of common ideals to which we must all subscribe . These things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which are impossible once childhood is passed . A pure democracy does not exist , not yet , anyway ; and if such an ideal state , by the nature of things , can not exist , its bed-rock exists , broadly , firmly laid in the heart of youth and in our American public schools . There is no other school American enough for my children . There are good private schools ; there are poor public schools ; but the one indispensable lesson for my child to learn is the lesson of American democracy ? ' that each one 's duty , ' as James Bryce puts it for us , ' is not only to accept equality , but also to relish equality and to make himself pleasant to his equals . ' The best private school that fails to teach this lesson is a poorer school for America than the poorest public school that does teach it . It is not impossible for a VOL. 184- NO. private school to teach democracy ; not impossible for it to be a democracy ? or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and what it is to be democratic ? these are the first things to learn in school ; after them come other great things : to know the world of books , and be a citizen there ; the world of nature , and be a citizen there ; the world of art , and be a citizen there ; the world of science , and be a citizen there . The world of men , however , laboring men , professional men , business men , Northern , Southern , Western men , Hingham men : to know these men , yourself as one of them , that they are America , is to be pretty safely educated for democracy ? an education provided against by the very nature of the private school . ' In my day at a public school , ' says John Galsworthy a public ' school in England is a private school here .. the universe was divided into ourselves and " outsiders , " " bounders , " " chews , " " cads , " or whatever more or less offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ourselves . . . . The workingman did not exist for us , except as a person outside , remote and almost inimical . From our homes , touched already by this class feeling . . . we went to private schools where the teaching of manners , mainly under clerical supervision , effectually barred us from any contaminating influence , so that if by chance we encountered the " lower class " boy we burned to go for him and correct his " cheek . " Thence we passed into the great " Caste " factory , a public our private school NI here the feeling becomes , by the mere process of being left to itself , as set as iron . . . All learned to consider themselves the elect . . . In result , failing definite , sustained effort to break up a narrow " caste " feeling , the public private school presents a practically solid phalanx of the fortunate , insulated against real knowledge of , or real sympathy with , the less fortunate . The phalanx marches out into the professions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , some awaken to a sense of wider values ? but none too many . From the point of view of anyone who tries to see things as they are , and see them as a whole , there is something terrific about this automatic " caste " moulding of the young . And in the present condition of our country it is folly , and dangerous folly , to blink it . ' It is folly , and dangerous folly , to blink such a system of education anywhere . It is worse than folly to tolerate it in America . If there is a compensation , or an equivalent , for democracy , have the American private schools a patent on it ? What can the private school do , because it is private , that the public school can not do ? Surely nothing which money can buy , for the public has he money . And it must spend it , until it puts every private school out of business . As for scholarship and deportment , the private school can hardly maintain the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notoriously sensitive to student fees . Did I say ' standards ' ? Standardization is exactly what the private school avoids . Superior individual training is its strong claim ; a claim which might have some force were this not a democracy where no man but the bad man and the handicapped needs an attendant . Let the private school act as an asylum for the backward and stubborn , a function already recognized in some quarters as peculiarly its own . One of my friends , entering her son at a New Hampshire public school , was asked by the superintendent , ? ' Where has he been to school ? ' ' In a private school near Boston . ' ' Then we ca n't take him , ' was the astonishing reply . ' We have no private school in this district , no provision of any kind for the abnormal . ' The other day I stood looking across the street into the windows of a private school , windows literally darkened by the shadow of a great public-school building . This private school had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had appropriated much as a hermit crab appropriates an abandoned mollusk 's shell , the school accomodating itself to the house , not the house to the school . A single window to a floor let in the shadows of the street . The select children were in the study room ; and as I looked , I chanced to see one of them seize what appeared to be her geography , and bring it down with a vicious smash upon the dear devoted head of her select sister . It was only the exceptional act , of course , which proves the abiding rule of good manners in private schools ; but I could only think how human and hopeful private-school children are , end how like public-school children , really ; and what a pity to mew up these few select girls in this dark , inadequate , abandoned house of gentry , when they might have spent the afternoon across the street with a thousand little unselected brothers and sisters , in the spacious halls of the great public school , ? as I was spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? marching down the long ringing corridors to the tune of ' Over There , ' for an hour of Christmas singing and story-telling in the sunny assembly-room ; and marching back singing , ' Keep the Home Fires Burning , ' every right hand at salute as the thousand little singers passed out between the Colors flanking the assembly-room door . Money can get culture for the public schools ; there is no patent on culture . All the factors of culture ? buildings , pictures , books , music , and refined teachers ? shall be had , and shall be had for all public schools , just as soon as the public recognizes education as strictly social , fitting us to live together . The Three R 's will be the beginning of this education , and democracy the big .. ger end toward which it moves . The Three R 's broadly handled , strongly , stirringly taught , and carried on until they compass the doctrine of democracy , shall be the common education of the future . Give me the literature of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic of mathematics ( denied me by the Creator ) , and besides these , give me the idea of democracy , as a moral code , as a social order , as a religious faith , and you have given me , not only wisdom and power , but an eye for the wind when I cart ashes for the city , and a sympathy for the flustered caretakers of the Belgian suite when I am entertained in Bucking .. ham Palace . Before President Wilson 's visit only royalty had occupied the Belgian suite , and the aged attendants were troubled over the proper etiquette . You can imagine Mr. and Mrs. Wilson , out of the abundance and gentleness of their democracy , saying , ' Oh , do n't make any fuss over us . Treat us just as you do your other guests . Whatever is good enough for royalty is good enough for us . ' It is the unabashed , complaisant American mediocrity , the lack of money and manners , that Hingham , and Boston , and New York draw back from in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of my groceryman . It is this and more : it is really American democracy itself which these people dislike . It is from America herself , her best self , that they withdraw ? to set up about them their little neighborhood aristocracies . The wise men from the East , exceptout of curiosity , perhaps , will not enter a private school in the United States , having learned in Japan how an aristocracy is created ; what they have come seeking is the source and the secret of democracy ; and they are right in coming to the public schools . But suppose they come to Boston , to the only public school in the Back Bay ? Oh , here is the secret for which they are seeking . They have followed the gleam , and it has led them to this school for rich and poor ? if there are any poor in the Back Bay ! Here shall be found the little citizens of the future , eleven hundred of them from the waterside of Beacon Street , over , far over from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , seat-mates , classmates , playmates together in the nation 's Common School ! Common School ! the nation has public schools , and private schools , but no common school . The Oriental visitors , who are used to a mild form of aristocracy in their own Japan , will stare with astonishment at the eleven hundred children in this Back Bay public school who are none of them Back Bay children . True , there are children from the Back Bay here ? cooks ' children , coachmen 's children , from over on Beacon Street ? while the rest are a floating riff-raff from somewhere west of Boylston Street , between the railroad tracks . Back Bay children used to attend this public school , and a few may still attend . When it was made thoroughly democratic , however , the Back Bay withdrew its children , on bloc ; but not its patronage . Back Bay women , believing in education and culture , have privately supplied this school with their money , ever since they deprived it of their children ? money for drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all these things money can buy ; but the thing that money can not buy is democracy . Only Back Bay children can supply the Back Bay school with democracy , and Back Bay children are not allowed to go to this Back Bay school . Eleven hundred children in the only Back Bay public school , and scarcely a Back Bay child among them ! As a nation , we understand the theory of democracy ; collectively , we are eloquent preachers of the doctrine ; but as individuals , we practise a dif2 ferent thing . We can die for democracy . Yet we can not go to school for it ; we can not be democratic . We are sending democratic literature to the ends of the earth . Our Fourteen Peace Points were translated into three hundred native languages of India , whose millions of poor for the first time had the gospel of democracy preached to them . The isles of the sea heard , and the Japanese came seeking the truth of democracy , ? in the only public school of the Back Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take things American , ' they say ; but what do they find America doing ? Dropping things American and adopting things German ? the vocational in place of the liberal school , the private and the parochial in place of the common school . They find America fighting to make the world safe for democracy , and arraying her own citizens in warring camps of class and mass by a system of ' education for a living , ' and by another system of ' education for life , ' for place , and power , instead of for liberty , equality , fraternity . I have four sons ? one a politician , I hope ; one a preacher ; one a poet ; one a combined farmer and a college professor , maybe ! I am ambitious for them . But professor , or poet , or preacher , or politician ,  --  I care not what , ? one thing they shall be , if the public schools can make them : they shall be democratic citizens of this league of United States , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
