Special to The New York Times . CHICAGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. refused to accept responsibility ' for the sale of tainted meat and other products to an army cantonment in Texas , as charged by the Federal Trade Commission , today .

" Because of the general upset condition of the railroads , " said Edward Morris , . Jr. , President of Morris &; Co. , " we .. are not receiving proper freight treatment . They can not give us enough refrigerator cars , and those they do give are improperly iced . Complaints like this , frequent of late , we can only refer to the transportation system . " Thomas E. Wilson , President of Wilson &; Co. , said : " The accusations made in the statement attributed to the Federal Trade Commission are avgue , but their vagueness gives them an aspect which will mislead the public  --  and that is evidently the object . This being Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , but this time has been sufficient to show that there are not the slightest grounds for such charges against Wilson &; Co . " When this whole matter is sifted down it will be found that there is an impulse of malice behind it upon the public mind . " I certainly must condemn the malicious intent veiled in such reckless charges at this time , against this part of an industry which is doing everything it ca'n , day and night , to serve the people and the army and the whole country  --  and is praised for its work every day . The Government officials having charge of the purchase and distribution of these foods for the army ? will boar . me out inwhat I home said . "
