The eighteenth century in France has called forth a considerable literature , even in the field of prints alone . Porta/is and Beraldi have given us a dictionary of the engravers of that time ; the Goncourts , Lady Dilke , and Ralph Nevil have written on the general subject ; Bourcard and DeItell have recorded prices brought by engravings , and there are numerous monographs on individual artists of this and of the preceding century , for which latter there is also the catalogue of Rohert-Dumesnil . But it remained for the author of the present work to make a special study of the portrait engraving of these two centuries , hitherto treated only incidentally , excepting in the work of Duplessis , published in French in 1879 , and in Charles Sumner 's article , " The Best Portraits in Engraving , " published in 1872 . For English-reading people , especially , the author had almost a free field , for Sumner 's article was cursory and uncritical . The present careful work traces the development of engraving from the somewhat austere effect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mastery of Nanteuil and the rich versatility of the Drevets ( with whom technique and the rendering of textures were still subordinated to the end in view ) , to the rather soulless devotion to method of Wille , which marked the beginning of decay , and to the change to greater simplicity in design and technique in the period of Louis XVI and Cochin . These changes in technique were naturally to a great extent a response to the changing point of view that dominated portrait painting . The imposing distinction of the decorative Rigaud , for instance , is reflected in the brilliantly executed engravings of the Drevets , admirable examples of adequate adaptation of an art to its purpose . The engraved figure-pieces of this period have a more obvious and vivid appeal through their subjects , as they mirror the life of the time in its elegance and light-hearted gayety . Yet the portraits also have a decided interest . Mr. Thomas does not bow unhesitatingly to previously accepted standards . Of the four famous plates long regarded as the finest portraits engraved , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass muster with him , while Masson 's Brisacier and Nanteuil 's Pompone de Bellievre do not . " Engravers , " he reflects , " are generally best known by works which are striking or sensational or peculiar , " and the reader here may recall the case of Mel-Ian 's Head of Christ executed in one spiral line . The sanity , the soundness of view , makes the book a stimulating guide , and the well-chosen illustrations are helpful because produced by a photo-mechanical process which does not cut up the Iines by a mechanical network as in the case of the half-tone . Naturally , no one will expect them to bear too close a scrutiny , particularly as many are much reduced in size from the originals . The student will use this book in connection with such excellent facsimile reproductions as those in the volumes of " Engravings and Woodcuts by Old Masters " ( prepared under the direction of the late Friedrich Lippmann ) , or those issued by the British Museum . Or he will get access to the originals if near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . There is an appendix , giving a useful alphabetical list of engravers , with summary characterizations . But the proofreading on the index has been careless . References one page out of the way , transposed names , omissions ( e , g. , Woeriot , Fouquet , Duvet ) , and names spelled differently in text and index ( Quen  --  dey , Queneday , Lombart , Lombard ) , are too common . Houghton Mifflin Co announces for publication in the early spring a memoir of the late John La Farge , with a study of his work by Royal Cortissoy , critic of art and literature of the New York Tribune . According to report , two new Rembrandts have been discovered in Frankfort , Germany . There are numbers of books dealing with Egyptian art , but they are forbidden to the busy man on account of their length and the exhaustiveness of their detail . A shorter book is welcome , such an one as has been furnished by Prof W. M. Flinders Petrie in his " Arts and Crafts of Ancient Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great and multitudes of details are introduced , but they are pertinent and do not weary the reader The volume contains one hundred and forty illustrations which are chosen with skill and out of a full knowledge . For the most part the text is made up of discussions based upon the things that are under the reader 's eye . After a couple of chapters on the character of Egyptian art and its periods and schools , the author takes up in succession the following subjects : Statuary , reliefs , painting and drawing , architecture , stone-working , jewelry , metal work , glazed ware and glass , pottery , ivory working , woodwork , plaster and stucco , and clothing . It is evident that the work is not exhaustive when it is seen that the entire exposition runs to only one hundred and fifty duodecimo pages . The author has been able to bring forth many new points from his store of knowledge gained by many years spent in excavating sites in. the valley of the Nile Professor Petrie has not changed his view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published date of 4777 s. c , instead of 3400 B. C , the date advocated by Professor Breasted and most German scholars . On some accounts it would have been better to group the illustrations at the end of the volume ; scattered through the book they are less convenient for reference Emile Michel 's " Great Masters of Landscape Painting " ( Lippincott ) is what its title implies , a series of individual appreciations rather than a history It is a ripe work , but must be reckoned one of the author 's minor achievements He brings to the task a mature judgment , and often draws on personal reminiscences of the recent masters . Perhaps the agreeable tone of the criticism is more prominent than anything in the way of novel or pungent opinion . The volume is a small folio and contains more than two hundred illustrations , of which . forty are photogravure plates . Sketches as well as finished pictures are fully represented . In the Italian field the treatment is scrappy and inadequate . Masaccio , who did a glorious mountain landscape in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention is paid to two admirable pen panoramas by Leonardo da Vinci , while Perugino 's distinguished position as a landscapist receives no recognition . In explaining Giorgione 's fantastic picture in the Giovanelli Palace ( p 16 ) , M. Michel ( or is it the modesty of the translator ? ) provides that artist with an otherwise unknown " wife " Generally speaking , the author holds by the realists , and when he reaches his favorite Dutchmen and the masters of yesterday the work gains immensely in quality Living artists are omitted , and this limits the treatment of the Giverny school to bare and disapproving mention . Constable is one of the excellent chapters ; Turner is taken with many reservations . Of Ruskin 's campaign against Claude is written ? " Ruskin speaks of Claude with the most vulgar and unintelligent presumption , " Change " vulgar " to " fanatical " and this harsh saying becomes wholly true The sparseness of the index indicates perhaps that this is a book to be read rather than consulted , and indeed the appeal is chiefly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , much of it quite unhackneyed , the scholar too may profit . We have received the forty-first volume of the International Studio , including the numbers from July to October last . Certain friends of this useful magazine would be glad to see it assume greater critical authority . As it is , it does useful service in gathering in current art intelligence from many sources , No single journal covers the field in so truly international a spirit . Essays on the art of Cecilia Beaux , Edward W. Redfield , and Daniel Chester French are attractive titles in the present volumes A. somewhat extended review of Modern Landscape Paintings in Japan , and Montgomery Schuyler 's critique of the new Pennsylvania Station in New York are articles of more than passing interest . " The Golden Age of Engraving , " by Frederick Keppel ( Baker &; Taylor ) , is an ingathering of lectures , magazine articles , and brief essays , some of which have done duty in the booklets issued by Mr Keppel 's firm . First and last nearly all the periods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by one who knows the subject intimately There is naturally some repetition , but no more probably than is salutary for the unskilled reader There are 262 illustrations , making a kind of compendium of the art Among really great figures we mist only Hollar and Blake . An autobiographical introduction tells how casually Mr. Keppel was led into the calling which he has illustrated for more than a generation . The chance of buying a lot of old prints cheap , and of finding a collector honest enough to pay a right profit , turned Mr. Keppel from bookselling to the allied trade His first customer , James L. Claghorn of Philadelphia , was also his mentor Of his adventures in the print shops and auctions of Europe Mr. Keppel tells vivaciously . Excellent is the story of Mrs. Noseda of London , who having lent some historical portraits to her landlord , Lord Salisbury , was rewarded by a personal visit and presentation of a life membership to the Army and Navy Stores This she refused with the words : Thank you , my lord , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs Noseda " said he , " you will save 10 or 15 per cent . in the purchasing of all your household supplies . " " Let the shopkeepers make their profit out of me , " she shouted ( by this time she was angry ) " My lord , " she went on , " you and the other great property owners are starving your own tenants , and if this goes on you will have whole rows of shops standing empty and idle I wo n't accept Your card , " " The Lure of the Antique " ( Century Co ) , by Walter A , Dyer , will be of considerable value to amateur collectors of old furniture , china , mirrors , candlesticks , pewter , glassware , copper utensils , clocks , and some other household furnishings of the American colonial period and the early days of the republic The book would be regarded by a museum expert as suggestive rather than authoritative In style , text , and illustrations , it is journalistic , a compilation , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not on that account less well designed to further the ransacking of garrets and enrichment of antique dealers . The author 's enthusiasm , however , is tempered with good sense ; his counsel usually cuts true , as in this : " When you buy an old chair , determine if it be really old , genuine , and fairly priced But examine it also for good workmanship and intrinsic beauty , and try to see if it be comfortable . Chairs to be seen and not sat upon are intolerable encumbrances " Of antique pewter Mr Dyer says ' " Its beauty is rather that of some quaint , sweet-faced , gray-haired old lady in a lace cap than of a blooming ball-room belle . Some people do n't care for old ladies  --  some do And there is the whole story in a nutshell , applying to nearly all forms of antiques " The illustrations , many of them from Miss Mary H. Northend 's collection of photographs , give glimpses of colonial homes on the Massachusetts North Shore and elsewhere Not many of the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included  --  a defect , certainly , if the work undertook to be a manual of its subject . And even accepting the book 's limitations , one questions whether the general reader ought not to be informed where he may see good examples of American antiques , the list to include not only the art museums which exhibit colonial and later arts and crafts , but such collections as those , say , of the Oliver Ellsworth house , at Windsor , the Paul Revere house , Boston , the Spalding house , Lowell , and the Longfellow House , Portland . The textile arts Mr. Dyer does not include among antiques , and there are other omissions , doubtless justified by the impossibility of writing about all old things . The space given to spurious and " glorified " antiques is certainly not inordinate , for as the author says . " There 's a vast deal of faking in the business , and it 's a dangerous venture for the uninitiated " The death is reported from Karlsruhe of Karl Heilig , the painter and illustrator , aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of last month at the age of eighty-five . The death is announced from Paris of the landscape and portrait painter , Etienne Prosper Berne-Bellecour , in his seventy-third year His reputation was first made by pictures of episodes in the Franco-Prussian war .
