No British writer who has visited America in recent years has been received with such enthusiasm as Philip Gibbs . A journalist of unusual distinction , a novelist , an essayist. and an historian , he has made for himself a unique position . He is the most graphic and brilliant of war-correspondents , but he writes not less vividly of countries at peace . He is first of all an observer . The following article is introductory to a series that by special arrangement is to appear exclusively in Harper 's Magazine , recording Mr. Gibbs 's impressions of America as he has seen it during the past few months . These articles will be illustrated by George Wright . I HAD the luck to go to New York for 1 the first time when the ordinary life of that City of Adventure ? always so vital and dynamic in activity was in ? tensified by the emotion of historic days . The war was over , and the warriors were coming home with the triumph of vic ? tory as the reward of courage ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the spirits of the people the staleness and disillusionment that al ? ways follow the ending of war , when men say : " What was the use of it , after all ? Where are gratitude and justice ? Who pays me for the loss of my leg ? " . . . The emotion of New York life was visi ? ble in its streets . The city itself , mon ? strous , yet dreamlike and mystical as one sees it first rising to fantastic shapes through the haze of dawn above the waters of the Hudson , seemed to be excited by its own historical significance . There was a vibration about it as sun ? light splashed its gold upon the topmost stories of the sky-scrapers and sparkled in the thousand windows of the Wool ? worth tower and flung black bars of shadow across the lower blocks . Banners were flying everywhere in the streets that go straight and long between those perpendicular cliffs of masonry , and the wind that comes blowing up the two rivers ruffled them . They were banners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each house from which they were hanging , with golden stars of death above the heads of the living crowds surging there below them . In those decorations of New York I saw the imagination of a people conscious of their own power , and with a dramatic instinct able to impress the multitudes with the glory and splendor of their achievement . It was the same sense of drama that is revealed commercially in the genius of advertisement which star ? tled me when I first walked down Broad ? way , dazzled by moving pictures of light , by flashing signs that shouted to me from high heaven to buy chewing-gum and to go on chewing ; and squirming , wriggling , revolving snakes of changing color that burned letters of fire into my brain , so that even now , in remem ? brance , my eyes arc scorched with the imprint of a monstrous kitten unrolling an endless reel of cotton . The " Welcome Home " of American troops was an advertisement of American manhood , idealized by emotion ; and it was de ? signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been touched by the au ? dacity of the master-builders of New York who climb to the sky with their houses . 1 think it was inspired also by the vision of the moving-picture kings who resurrect the gorgeous life of Baby Ion , and re-establish the court of Cleo ? patra for Theda Bara , the " Movie Queen . " When the men of the Twenty-seventh Division of New York came marching home up Fifth Avenue they of sunburnt wigwams where the spears of the braves " were piled above the shields of fallen warriors . " Like an undergraduate 's cozy cor ? ner , " said an unkind wit , and New York passed through triumphal arches of white plaster that seemed solid enough to last for centuries , though they had grown high , like Jack 's beanstalk , in a single night ; and the troops glanced sideways at a vast display of Indian trophies with tattered colors like those laughed , but liked the symbolism of those shields and went on with aston ? ished eyes to gaze at the masterpiece of Chaffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace like a net of precious jewels , suspended , between two white pillars surmounted by stars , across the Avenue . At night strong searchlights played upon this necklace , and at the end of those bars of white radiance , shot through the darkness , the hanging jewels swayed and glittered with a thousand delicate colors like diamonds , rubies , emeralds , and sapphires . Night after night , as I drove down Fifth Avenue , I turned in the car to look back at the astonishing picture of that triumphal archway , and saw how the long tide of cars behind was caught by the searchlights so that all their metal was like burnished gold and silver ; and how the faces of dense crowds star ? ing up at the suspended necklace were all white ? dead-white as Pierrot 's ; and how the 41,7 above New York and the tall , cliff-like masses of masonry on each side of Fifth Avenue were fingered by the miter radiance of the brightness that was blinding in the heart of the city . To me , a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and to the rush of traffic in its streets , these illumi ? nations of victory were the crowning touch of fantasy , and I seemed to he in a dream of some City of the Future , among people of a new civilization , strange and wonderful . The soldiers of the Twenty-seventh Division were not nvercome by emotion at this display in their honor . " That 's all right , " they said , grinning at the cheering crowds , " and when do we eat ? " Those words reminded me of Tommy Atkins , who would go through the hanging-gardens of Babylon itself ? if the time-machine were switched back ? with the same shrewd humor . The adventure of life in New York , always startling and exciting , I am cer ? tain , to a man or woman who enters its swirl as a stranger , was more stirring at the time of my first visit because of this eddying influence of war 's backwash . The city was overcrowded with visitors from all parts of the United States who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met them , stayed awhile to give these boys a good time after their exile . This floating popula ? tion of New York flowed into all thehotels and restaurants and theaters . Two new hotels ? the Commodore and the Pennsylvania ? were opened just be ? fore I came , and , with two thousand bed ? rooms each , had no room to spare , and did not reduce the population of the Plaza , Vanderbilt , Manhattan , Bilt ? more , or Ritz-Carlton . I watched the social life in those palaces and found it more entertaining than the most sensa ? tional " movie " with a continuous per ? formance . The architects of those Amer ? ican hotels have vied with one another in creating an atmosphere of richness and luxury . They have been prodigal in the use of marble pillars and balustrades , more magnificent than Roman . They have gone to the extreme limit of taste in gilding the paneled walls and ceilings from which they have suspended enor ? mous candelabra , like those in the palace of Versailles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea-rooms and lounges , and when invited to a banquet found it necessary to bring my ticket , because often there are a dozen banquets in progress in one hotel , and there is a banqueting-room on every floor . When I passed up in the elevator of one hotel I saw the different crowds in the corridors surging toward those great lighted rooms where the tables were spread with flowers , and from which came gusts of " jazz " music or the opening bars of " The Star-span ? gled Banner . " In all the dining-rooms there rises the gusty noise of many conversations above the music of an orchestra determined to be heard , and between the bars of a Leslie Stewart waltz , or on the last beat of the " Humoreske , " a colored waiter says , " Chicken okra , sah ? " or , " Clam chowder ? " and one hears the laughing words of a girl who asks , " Do you mind if I powder my nose ? " and does so with a glance at a little gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vastness , and the overwhelming luxury , of the New York hotels was my first and strongest impression in this city , after I had recov ? ered from the sensation of the high , fantastic buildings ; but it occurred to me very quickly that this luxury of architecture and decoration has no close reference to the life of the people . They are only visitors in la viz de luxe ? and do not belong to it , and do not let it enter into their souls or bodies . In a wealthier , more expansive way , they are like the city clerks and their girls in London who pay eighteenpence for a meal in marble halls at Lyon 's Popular Caf ? , and sit around a gilded menu-card , saying , " Is n't it wonderful . .. and shall we go home by tram ? " There are many rich people in New York ? more , I suppose , than in any other city of the world , but , apart from cosmopolitan men and women who have luxury beneath their skins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of these people . In the hotel palaces , as well as in the private man ? sions along Fifth Avenue and Riverside Drive , all their outward splendor does not alter the simplicity and honesty of their character . They remain essentially " middle-class , " and have none of the easy licentiousness of that European aristocracy which , before the war , flaunted its wealth and its vice in Paris , Vienna , Monte Carlo , and other haunts where the cocottes of the world assem ? bled to barter their beauty , and where idle men went from boredom to boredom in search of subtle forms of pleasure . American women of wealth spend vast sums of money on dress , and there is the glitter vamp , " and the social code to which they belong is swept clean by common ? sense . " My dear , " said an American hostess who belongs to one of the old rich families of New York , " forgive me for wearing my diamonds to-night . it must shock you , coming from scenes of ruin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I like to think of her , wore her diamonds as the mayor of a provincial town in England wears his chain of office , but as she sat at the head of her table in one of the big man VOL . CXXXIX. ? No. 831. - 42lions of New York I saw that wealth had not cumbered the soul of this masterful lady , whose views on life are as direct and simple as those of Ahraha.m Lincoln . She was the middle-class housewife in spite of the footmen who stood in fear of her . Essentially middle-class in the best sense of the word were the crowds I met in the hotels . The men were making money ? lots of it ? by hard work . They had taken a few days off , or left business early , to meet their soldier sons in these gilded halls where they had a sense of satisfaction in spending large ' numbers of dollars in a short time . " This is my boy from ' over there ' ! Just come back . " I heard that introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses that were worn by a gray-eyed man who had his hand on the arm of an upstanding fellow in field uniform , tall and lean and hard , " It 's good to be hack , " said one of these young officers , and as he sat at table he looked ' round the huge salon with its cut-glass cande ? labra , where scores of little dinner-parties were in progress to the strident music of a stringed hand , and then , with a. queer little smile about his lips , as though thinking of the contrast between this scene and " over there , - said , " Darned good ! " In their evening frocks the women were elegant ? they know how to dress at night ? and now and then the fresh , frank beauty of one of these American girls startled my eyes by its witchery of youth and health . Some of them are de'colletees to the ultimate limit of a milliner 's audacity , and foolishly I suffered from a sense of confusion some ? times because of the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is as that of Caesar 's wife . The frail queens of beauty in the lotus-garden of life 's enchanted places would envy some of the frocks that come out of Fifth Avenue , and scream with horror at their prices . But , although the American woman with a wealthy husband likes to put on the flimsy robes of Circe , it is only as she would go to a fancy-dress ball in a frock that would make her brother say , " Gee ! And where did you get that bit of fluff ? " She is Circe , with the Suffrage , and high ideals of life , and strong views on the League of Nations . She makes up her face like a French comedienne , but she has , nine times out of ten , the kind heart of a parson 's wife in rural England and a frank , good-natured wit which faces the realities of life with the candor of a clean mind . I found " gay life " in New York im ? mensely and soberly respectable . One could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get hot by her blushes . In fact , it is the American maiden aunt who sets the pace of the fox-trot and the one-step in dancing-rooms where there are music and after ? noon tea . Several times I supped " Eng ? lish breakfast tea " ? I suspect Sir Thomas Lipton had something to do with it ? at five o'clock on bright after ? noons , watching the scene at Sherry 's and Delmonico 's . It seemed to me that this dancing habit was a most curious and overrated form of social pleasure . It was as though American society had said , " Let us be devilishly gay ! " but started too early in the day , with des ? perate sobriety . Many couples left the tea-table for the polished boards and joined the throng which surged and eddied in circles of narrow circumference jostled by other dancers . Youth did not have it all its own way . On the contrary , I noticed that bald-headed gentlemen with some width of waistbands were in the majority , dancing with prodigious gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am told , from other cities ? Bostonians escaping from the restrictions of their Early Victorian atmosphere , Senators who voted for pro ? hibition in their own states , business men who had booked reservations on midnight trains from the Grand Central Terminal . Here and there young officers of the army and navy led out pretty girls , and with linked arms , and faces very close together , danced in a kind ofcoma , which they seemed to enjoy , though without any sparkle in their eyes , There were also officers of other nations ? a young Frenchman appealing Lo the great heart of the American people on behalf of devastated France , and danc ? ing for the sake of people scorched by the horrors of war , to say nothing of the little American girl whose yellow fringe was on his Croix de Guerre ; and young English officers belonging to the British Mission , and engaged in propaganda ? oh , frightful word ! ? of which a the dan ? sant at Delmonico 's was , no doubt , a serious part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key-note to the moral and spiritual char ? acter of the scene . It was the figure of a stout old lady wearing a hat with a huge feather which waggled over her nose as she danced the one-step with earnest vi ? vacity , and an old gentleman with side-whiskers . She panted as she came back to the tea-table , and said , " Say , that makes me feel young ! " It occurred to me that she might be Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch on a visit to New York , and , anyhow , her presence assured me that afternoon dancing at Delmonico 's need not form the theme of any moralist in search of vice in high places . It is not only respectable ; it is domestic . Savona ? rola himself would not have denounced such innocent amusement . Nor did I find anything to shock the sensibilities of high-souled ethics in such midnight haunts as the Ziegfield Follies or the Winter Garden , except the inanity of all such shows where large ? numbers of pretty girls , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights before groups of tired people who can hardly hide their boredom , but yawn laughingly over their cocktails and say , " Is n't she wonderful ? " when Mollie King sings a song about a variety of smiles , and discuss the personality of President Wilson between comic turns of the Dooley brothers . That , at least , is what happened in my little group on the roof of the Century Theater , where a manufacturer of barbed wire ? I wonder if they were his barbs on which I tore myself in Flanders fields ? initiated me into the mystery of a Bacardi cocktail , followed by a stinger , from which I was rescued , in the nick of time , by a kind lady on my right , who took pity on my innocence . A famous playwright . oppo ? site , as sober as a judge , as courteous as Beau Brummell , passed the time of day , which was a wee small hour of morning , with little ladies who came into the lime ? light , until suddenly he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we en ? joyed ourselves enough ? I want my bed " ; so interrupting a serious discus ? sion between a war correspondent and a cartoonist on the exact truth about Ger ? man atrocities , to the monstrous melody of a jazz band . Human nature is the same in New York as in other cities of the world . Passion , weakness , folly , are not eliminated from the relations be ? tween American men and women . But to find vice and decadence in American society one has to go in search of it ? and I did not go . I found New York society tolerant in its views , frank in its expres ? sion of opinion , fond of laughter , and wonderfully sincere . Wealth does not spoil its fresh and healthy outlook on life , and its people are idealists at heart , with a reverence for the old-fashioned virtues and an admiration for those who " make good " in whatever job to which they put their hands . After all , hotel life , and restaurant life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reveal the real soul of New York . They are no more a revelation of normal existence than boulevard life in Paris represents the daily round of the average Parisian . They are the happy hunting-grounds of the transient , and the real New-Yorker visits them only in hours of leisure and boredom . Another side of the adventure of life in New York is " down-town , " where the subways and the overhead railways pour out tides of humanity who do not earn their dollars without hard work and long hours of it . I should never have foundmy way to Bowling Green and Wall Street without a guide , because the un ? derground world of the subways , where electric trains go rushing like shuttles through the warp and woof of a mon ? strous network , is utterly confusing to a stranger . But with the guide , who led me by the hand and laughed at my child ? like bewilderment , I came into the heart of New York business life and saw its types in their natural environment . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confess that when I first walked through those deep gorges , between the mighty walls of houses as high as mountains , in a surge of humanity in a hurry , I felt dazed and cowardly . I had a conviction that my nerve-power would never survive the stress and strain of such a life in such a place . I nearly dislocated my neck by gazing up at the heights of the sky ? scrapers , rising story on story to fifty or sixty floors . In a House of a Thousand Windows I took the elevator to the top story and wished I had n't when the girl in charge of the lift asked , " What floor ? " and was answered by a quiet gentleman who said , " Thirty-one . " That was our first stop , and in the few seconds we took to reach this altitude I had a vision of this vast human ant-heap , with scores of offices on each floor , and typewriters clicking in all of them , and girl-clerks taking down letters from hard-faced young men juggling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decimal point , mean the difference between millions of dollars in the markets of the world . Each man and woman there in this House of a Thousand Windows had a human soul , with its own little drama of life , its loves and hopes and illusions , but in the vastness of one sky-scraper , in the whirlpool of commerce , in the machinery of money-making , the humanities of life seemed to be destroyed and these people to be no more than slaves of modern civilization , ruthless of their individual happiness . What could they know of art , beauty , leisure , the quiet pools of thought ? . . . Out in Wall Street there was pan ? demonium . The outside brokers ? the curb men ? were bidding against one another for stocks not quoted on the New York Exchange the Standard Oil Company among them ? and their hoarse cries mingled in a raucous chorus . I stood outside a madhouse staring at lunatics . Surely it was a madhouse , sur ? rounded by other homes for incurably insane ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of reddish-brown brick , like a Georgian house in London , and out of each window , which was barred , poked two rows of faces , one above the other , as though the room inside were divided by a false floor . In the small window-frames sat single fig ? ures , in crouched positions , with tele ? phone-receivers on their ears , and their faces staring at the crowd in the street below . Each one of those human faces , belonging to young men of healthy ap ? pearance , was making most hideous grimaces , and each grimace was accom panied by strange , incomprehensible gestures of the man 's fingers . With a thumb and two fingers , or a thumb and three fingers , they poked through the windows with violent efforts to attract the notice of individuals in the street . I saw , indeed , that all this fingering had some hidden meaning and that the maniacs , as I had first taken them to be , were signaling messages to the curb-brokers , who wore caps of different col @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up and down the street , and from the topmost as well as from the lower stories of many buildings , I saw the grimaces and the gestures of the window-men , and the noise and tumult in the street became more furious . It was a lively day in Wall Street , and thanked God that my fate had not led me into such a life . It seemed worse than war . . . . Not really so , after all , It was only the outward appearance of things that distressed one 's soul . Looking closer , I saw that all these young men on the curb seemed very cheery fellows , andwere enjoying themselves as much as boys in a Rugby " scrim . " There was nothing wrong with their nerves . There was nothing wrong with a crowd of young business men and women with whom I sat down to luncheon in a res ? taurant called Robin 's , not far from the Stock Exchange . These were the work ? ing-bees of the great hive which is New York . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they seemed as cheerful as our fight ? ing-men , who were always less gloomy than the fellows at the rear in the safe back-waters of war . Business men and lady clerks , typists and secretaries , were all mingled at the little tables where the backs of chairs touched , and there was a loud , incessant chatter like the noise of a parrot-house . I overheard some fragments of conversation at the tables close to me . " They do n't seem to be getting on with the Peace Conference , " said a young man with large spectacles . " All the little nations are trying to grab a bit of their neighbors ' ground . " " I saw the cutest little hat ? " said a girl whose third finger was stained with red ink . " Have you seen that play by Maeter ? linck ? " asked an elderly man so like President Wilson 's portraits that he seemed to be the twin brother of that much-discussed man . These people were human all through , not at all dehumanized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of a New York sky-scraper . I dare say also that their work is not so strenuous as it looks from the outside , and that they earn more dollars a week than busi ? ness men and women of their own class in England , so that they have more margin for the pleasures of life , for the purchase of a " cute little hat , " even for a play by Maeterlinck . After business hours many of these people hurry away from New York to suburbs , where they get quickly beyond the turmoil of the city in places with bustling tittle high streets of their own and good shops , and , on the outskirts , neat little houses of wooden framework , in gardens where flowers grow between great rocks which crop out of the soil along the Connecticut shore . They are the " commuters , " or , as we should say in England , the season-ticket-holders , and , as I did some " commuting " myself during a ten weeks ' visit to America , I used to-see them make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the after ? noon or late at night after theater-going in New York . I never tired of the sight of those crowds in the great hail of the Grand Central Terminal or inthe Penn ? sylvania Station , and saw the very spirit of the United States in those vast build ? ings which typify modern progress . In England a railway station is , as a rule , the ugliest , most squalid place in any great city ; but in America it is , even in provincial towns , a great adventure in architecture , where the mind is uplifted by nobility of design and imagination is inspired by spaciousness , light , color , and silence . It is strangely , uncannily quiet in the central hall of the Pennsyl ? vania Station , as one comes down a long , broad flight of steps to the vast floor space below a high dome ? painted blue like a summer sky , with golden stars a-twinkling ? uplifted on enormous arches . It is like entering a great cathe ? dral , and , though hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall because of its immense height , in which all sound is lost , and there is no noise of footsteps and only a low mur ? mur of voices . So it is also in the Grand Central Terminal , where I found myself many times before the last train left . There is no sign of railway lines or en ? gines , or the squalor of sidings and sheds . All that is hidden away until one is ad ? mitted to the tracks before the trains start . Instead , there are fruit-stalls and flower-stalls bright with color , and book ? stalls piled high with current literature from which every mind can take its choice , and candy-stalls where the ach ? ing jaw may find its chewing-gum and link up meditation with mastication , on the way to New Rochelle ? " forty-five minutes from Broadway " ? or to the ruralities of Rye , Mamaroneck , and Port Chester , this side of high life in Greenwich , Connecticut . Some of the male commuters have a habit of playing cards between New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind not dulled by their day 's work in town . But others indulge in conversational quartets , and on these journeys I heard things I wanted to learn about the experiences of American sol ? diers in France , the state of feeling be ? tween America and England , and the philosophy of success by men who had succeeded . It was a philosophy of simple virtue enforced by will-power and a fighting spirit . " Do n't hit often , " said one of these philosophers , who began life as an errand-boy and now designs the neckwear of society , " but when you do , hit hard and hit clean . No man is worth his salt unless he loses his temper at the right time . " In the last train to Greenwich were American soldiers and mariners just back from France , who slept in corners of the smoking-coach and wakened with a start at New Rochelle , with a dazed look in their eyes , as though wondering whether they had merely dreamed of be ? ing home again and were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The powder was patchy on the nose of a tired lady whose head drooped on the shoulder of a man in evening clothes chewing an unlighted cigar and thinking , with a lit ? tle smile about his lips , of something that had happened in the evening . Two typist-girls , with their mothers , had been to a lecture by Captain Carpenter , V. C. , one of the heroes of Zeebrugge . They were " crazy " about him . They loved his description of the " blunt end " and the " pointed end " of the ship . They had absorbed a lot of knowledge about naval tactics , and they were going to buy his photograph to put over their desks . . ? . Part of the adventure of life in New York is the acquisition of unexpected knowledge by means of lectures ; and Carnegie Hall is the Mecca of lecturers . Having been one of the lecturers , I can speak from personal experience when I say that a man who stands for the first time on the naked desert of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and white shirt-fronts to the farthest limit of the topmost galleries , feels hu ? mility creep into his soul until he shrinks to the size of Flop-o ' - My- Thumb , and is the smallest , loneliest thing in the whole wide world . A microbe is a monster to him , and he quakes with terror when he hears the first squeak of his tiny voice in the vast spaciousness under that high , vaulted roof . On that first night of mine I would have sold myself , with white shirt , cuff-links , and quaking body , for two cents , if any one had been fool enough to buy me and let me off that awful ordeal . And yet , looking back on it now , I know that it was the finest hour of my life , and a wonderful reward for small service , when all those people rose to greet rne , and there came up to me out of that audience a spiritual friendship so warm and generous that I felt it like the touch of kindly hands about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in Amer ? ica , there was a procession of people who came onto the platform to shake hands and say words of thanks , so that one gets into actual touch with all kinds of people and their friendship becomes per ? sonal . In that way I made thousands of friends in America and feel toward them all a lasting gratitude because of the generous , warm-hearted , splendid things they said as they passed with a quick hand-clasp . The lecture habit in America is deep-rooted and wide-spread . Every small town has its lecture-hall , and is in competition with every other town near by for lecturers who have some special fame or knowledge . In New York there is an endless series of lectures , not only in places like Carnegie Hall and iEolian Hall , but in clubs and churches . Great audiences made up of rich society people as well as the " intel ? lectuals " and the professional classes gather in force to hear any man whose personality makes him interesting , or who has something to say which they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People of New York will cheerfully pay five dollars to see a famous man , and not think their money wasted if his words are lost in empty space , or if they know already as much as he can tell them about the subject of his speech . Marshal Joffre had no need to prepare orations . When he said , " Messieurs et mesdames , " they cheered him for ten minutes , and when , after that , he said , " je suis enehanie , " they cheered him for ten minutes more . They like to see the men who have done things , the men who count for some ? thing , and to study the personality of a man about whom they have read . If he has something to tell them , so much the better , and if he is not renowned lie must tell them something pretty good if he wants their money and their patience . I have no doubt that the habit of lecture-going is one of the greatest influences at work in the education of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite very deep , and it leaves , I fancy , only a superficial impres ? sion , but it awakens their intelligence and imagination , directs their thoughts to some of the big problems of life , and is a better way of spending an evening than idle gossip or a variety entertain ? ment . The League for Political Educa ? tion , which I had the honor of addressing in Carnegie Hall , has a series of lectures ? three times a week , 1 think ? which are attended by people engaged in every kind of educative and social work in NNew York , and at a luncheon afterward I listened to a number of speeches by public men and women more inspiring in their sincerity of idealism than anything I have heard in similar assemblies . All these people were engaged in practical work for the welfare of their fellow-creatures , as pioneers of progress in the adventure of life in New York , and the women especially , like Jane Addams , impressed me by the real beauty of their personality . Another phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and in these dubs I met most of the men and many of the women who count in the intellectual activity of New York , I came in touch there with every stratum of thought and tradition which makes up the structure of American politics and ideas . I met the conservatives of the Union Club , who live in an atmosphere of dignified austerity ( reminding me of the Athenaeum Club in London , where the very waiters have the air of bishops and the political philosophy of the late Lord Salisbury ) , and who confided to me with quiet gravity their personal opinions of the President . I became an honorary member of the Union League Club . hardly less conservative in its traditional outlook , and having a membership which includes many leading business and professional men of New York City . It was here that I saw a touching ceremony which is one of my best memories of the United States , when the negro troops of a fight ? ing regiment marched up Fifth Avenue in a snow-storm , and gave back their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presented them when they went to war . Ex-Governor Hughes , speaking from the balcony , praised them for their valor in the great conflict for the world 's liberty , when they fought for the country which had given them their own freedom by no light sacrifice of blood . By their service in France they had gained a glory for their citizenship in the United States , and stood equal with their white com ? rades in the gratitude of the American people . There were tears in the eyes of colored officers when , after a luncheon in the Union League Club , they heard other words like those , giving honor to the spirit of their race . . . . Up the wide stairway in the softly glowing light which comes through a stained-glass window , the colors of the darky regiment hang as a memorial of courage and sacrifice ... . I was the guest of the Arts Club amid a crowd of painters , poets , musicians , and writing-men , who sat at long tables in paneled rooms decorated with pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clouds of tobacco smoke made wreaths above the board . A soldier-poet rose between the courses and sang his own songs to the chorus of his comrades . It was a jolly night among jolly good fellows who had wit and the gift of laughter , and large hearts which beat in sympathy for those who suffered in the war . . . . In the City Club I had a room when I wanted it , and the hall porter , and the bell-boys , and the ele ? vator-man , and the clerks in the office , shook hands with me when I went in and out , so that I felt at home there , after a splendid night when crowds of ladies joined the men to listen to my story of the war , and when a famous glee-party sang songs to me across rose garlands on the banquet-table . The City Club has a number of habitues who play dominoes on quiet nights , and in deep leather chairs discuss the destiny of nations as men who pull the wires which make the puppets dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , who know the inside of international polities , and whose president is ( or was , at the time of my visit ) a kindly , human , English soul with a genius for fellowship which has made a little League of Na ? tions in this New York house .

It seemed to me that New York is a city where friendship is quickly made , and I found that the best part of my adventure in the city . Day after day , when dusk was creeping into the streets and lights began to gleam in all the win ? dows of the houses that reach up to the stars , I drove down the long highway of Fifth Avenue with a certainty that be fore the evening was out I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome at their tables and re ? veal their convictions and ideals with a candor which does not come to English people until their ice of reserve is broken or thawed . And that was always so , At a small dinner-party or a big reception , in one of the great mansions of New York , or in a suite of rooms high above the traffic of the street , conversation was free-and-easy , with or without the aid of a cocktail , and laughter came in gusts , and American men and women spoke of the realities of life frankly and without camouflage , with a directness and sin ? cerity that touched the essential truth of things . In one room Melba sang with eternal girlhood in her voice , while painters and diplomats , novelists and wits , famous actresses and princesses of New York , were hushed into silence for a while until , when the spell was broken , there rose again a merry tumult of tongues . In another room a group of " intellectuals , " tired of talking about war and peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat down to drawing-games with shouts of mirth at a woman 's head with the body of a fish and the legs of a bird . In another house the King 's Jester of New York , who goes from party to party like a French wit ? the little Abbi .. Morellet ? in the salons of France before the Revolution , de ? stroyed the dignity of decorous people by a caricature of German opera and an imitation of a German husband eating in a public restaurant . I knew the weak ? ness that comes from a surfeit of laugh ? ter . . . I did not tire of these social ad ? ventures in New York , and I came to see something of the spirit of the people as it was revealed in the cosmopolitan city . I found that spirit touched , in spite of social merriment , by the tragedy of war , and anxious about the outcome of peace . I found these people conscious of new responsibilities thrust upon them by fate , and groping in their minds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destiny in the reshaping of the world by the history that has hap ? pened . Europe , three thousand miles away , is still a mystery to them , full of unknown forces and peoples and pas ? sions which they can not understand , though they read all their Sunday pa ? pers , with all their bulky supplements . When I went among them they were divided by the conflict of political dif ? ferences with passionate emotion , and torn between conflicting ideals of patri ? otism and humanity . But most of them put on one side , with a fine disdain , all meanness of thought and action and the dirty squalor of financial interests . Sure of their power among nations , the people I met ? and I met many of the best ? were anxious to rise to their high chance in history and to do the Big Thing in a big way , when they saw the straight road ahead . When I left New York they were rais ? ing their fifth great Victory Loan , and the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for victory and for the number of the loan . Their sense of drama was at work again to make this enterprise successful , and their genius of advertisement was in action to put a spell upon the people . The face of a farmer was on the posters in many streets , and that sturdy old fellow upon whose industry the wealth of America depends so much , because it is founded in the soil , put his hand in his pocket and said , " Sure , we 'll see it through ! " From my brief visit one conviction came to me . It is that whatever line of action the American people take in the new world that is now being born out of the tumult of war , they will see it through , by any sacrifice and at any cost .
