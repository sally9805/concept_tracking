txt Italian Socialists and War . The funniest of all the canards that have come out in the last twelvemonth Is the story cabled from Paris , on the authority of the Giornale d'Italia , which pretends to speak with authority for the Socialist Party in Italy , to the effect that on May 16 a rich Chicago woman tried to " bribe- " the Italian Socialists to oppose Italy 's entrance into the war . It would be about as reasonable to say that on the same date some one tried to bribe the Kaiser to Invade Belgium . For more than tine months before that time the Italian Socialists , with all but complete unanimity , had been opposing with all their might every effort to drag their country into war on either side . They continued to do so till war was actually declared and a drastic censorship imposed to pra ? ent any further protest . The few men hi the party who , earlier in the year , showed an inclination to support the jingo policy were driven out of all positions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined or imprisoned for their antiwar activity , and not a few gave their lives , being killed by gendarmes and armed thugs who raided Socialist peace demonstrations . Had the Italian Socialist Party been accessible to bribes , it would today be financially strong and morally bankrupt ; in fact , it is the reverse . ALGERNON LEE .
