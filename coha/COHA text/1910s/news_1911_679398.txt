txt Great activity in the camp of the Grlscoms and their allies here to-night produced a plentiful crop of rumors ' that the Dorothy Arnold mystery had been solved by the finding of Miss Arnold alive and will . The rumors had it that she was at home , 108 East Seventy-ninth Street , or , at least , in the hands of relatives near New York . One report had it that George S. Griscom , Jr. , had received a feller from Mrs. Arnold saying that her daughter had returned home . The more credence was given here to these reports because the younger Griacom said a few days ago that Miss ArI ; Iti ou Id return to-day , and belief seemed to become eertaInty when Roger O'Mara. , the Pittsburg detective who has been retainej by the Griscoms , said late ' to-night that he thought the case was " ended . " O'Mara was called several times to-day to the Hotel Chalionte , where the Griscoms remained in close seclusion . About 7 o'clock this evening , George S. GrIscorn . Sr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel to give his advice on " a matter of great importance . " After a conference with the elder Griscom , O'Mara . was asked If the Griscoms had heard any news of Miss Arnold . He smiled ' and returned a none too serious " I am sure I do n't know . " A report had reacned here earlier in the evening that District Attorney Whitman of New York nad said that he had volunteered his help in the search for the missing girl and that his services had been declined by the girl 's father . O'Mara , when asifed about this , solo : " Mr. Whitman is a pretty high official and his help would have neon valuable in looking for a missing girl . When the Arnolds decline his help , to my mind , that ends this case . " Another statement professlag to be . made on authority load It that District Attorney Whitman had served notice both on the Arnolds and the Griscoms to appear before him within twenty-four hours and-tell all they knew about Miss Arnold 's disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more credulous . Most of the rumors are undoubtedly due to the fact that a personal advertisement which appeared In a , New York daily last Saturday and to which was appended the signature " Junior . " ? by which Grlscom . Jr. , had been familiarly known , appointed to-day as the date when somzone , who. was believed to be Dorothy Arnold , wan to " hear " from " Junior . " Griseom has dented that he knew anything . about this advertisement . J. K. Turner , who for several days has acted as spokesman for the Griscoms , left ' the Chalfonte for New York this after-. noon . More rumors have been founded . upon this . Miss Marjorie Arnold , sister of the miss , ing Dorothy , told a Times reporter night that there was no truthswhatsoever in the report that her sister had been found and was in or near New York . She denied further that her mother had written to the younger Grlscom . " Mrs. Arnold is ill and confined to her bed by worry and grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She is in ? no. condition to write a letter to Mr .. Griaeoln ? or any one else . If we knew where Dorothy is , we would be only too glad to . an ; pounce the fact and be free of all this persecution and notoriety . We do not know , and have no more clues to her whereabouts now than we had when her disappearance was first announced . " A member of the firm of Garvan Armstrong , the Arnold family lawyers , characterized the Atlantic City reports that Miss Arnold had been found and was back in her home or with friends as absurd . " If she is even near her home I know nothing of it . " he . said . " I spoke with members of her family there less than ten minutes ago , and they told me they knew nothing fresh in the case and had no idea of her whereabout . I am as much in the dark now as I was on Dec. 12 , without a single clue or a single piece of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . The introduction of the Griscom family into the case has only served to confuse it with irrelevant elements to keep up interest in the matter from day to day , without shedding a bit of light upon it Much absurd stuff has been printed about the younger Griscom 's alleged statements that he would marry the girl if she is found . All that Mr. Griscom has done so far is to announce that he had come to help search for her , and that he hones she is alive . We all hope that Te only logical conclusion , owever , seems to be that she is dead . " District Attorney Whitman quickly disposed of the rumors regarding this sap- , posed action in the case by denying thathe had bed or attempted any communication with the Griscoms and telling frankly about the only communication he had had with the Arnoids . " A week or ten days ago , " said Mr. Whitman , " I found that Mr. Arnold had called me on the telephone , and got into communication with him . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help him in the case I would be glad to do all in my power : that it ne had any evidence - pointing , even remotely , to the possibility that a crime had been committed . I was both willing and determined to have it examined thoroughly and to examine personally every witness he might bring before me. or to subpoena them if he gave ? me names . " Mr. Arnold thanked me. but declared that he was not then possessed of any evidence which might justify the intervention of the District Attorney , and that he did not see how I could assist him more than the police were already doing . He seemed to be without any clue pointing to the commission of a crime , and to be unwilling therefore for me to take up the case . He told me of no suspicion of murder . and did not seem to have any definite theory . " That is the only conversation I had with him . To-night a reporter called me on the telephone , saying that Mr. Arnold was giving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another conference . That is untrue . " Mr. Whitman denied that he had made any attempt to get into communication ' with the Griscoms at Atlantic City or elsewhere last night or at any other time , or that he had taken any part in the case other than he had described . Hundreds of letters from persons who believe they have " seen Dorothy Arnold " or from hysterical persons , who " have a theory , " nevertheless pour into his office each day , he said . One such person , who said he was a " witness " in the case , communicated with the District Attorney a few days ago , offering to meet him in Philadelphia on Monday . As Mr. Whitman happened to go to Philadelphia on other business on that day , he made a point of going to the appointed rendezvous , but the " witness , " as he had expected , failed to keen his appointment ' Such volunteers of assistance , the District Attorney said . prove as useless as they are frequent in . every case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
