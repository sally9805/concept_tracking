DURING the tliirty years from 1879 to 1909 I was at the head successively of several corporations employing from two hundred to two thousand working people . Like most believers in democracy I originally believed also in the organization of labor ; in the right of the working men , singly weak , to strengthen themselves by union in any honest effort for their own betterment . I believed that organization , bringing to the front the ablest minds among their number , would tend to educate the working people in the economics of labor , to their own good ' and that of the community . Results , however , have been disappointing . The management of trade unions appears to have become like that of city politics ? an affair of personal self-interest rather than of the public good . This conclusion is drawn from various personal experiences , and from public documents to which I shall hereafter refer . I came into contact with organized labor when , about 1899 , a small typewriter factory in Chicago which I controlled , employing some two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of over three thousand of the largest employers in the United States . At the moment I found its attention preoccupied with the matter of union labor . A great dread of labor unions swept over employers about 1900 , and the National Association of Manufacturers , the Anti-Boycott Association , the Metal Trades ' Association , the Typothetw , and many local associations were formed , largely for the purpose of defense . Labor conditions grew worse ; strikes , original and sympathetic , multiplied , until many employers moved their works out of the city , and many others , including our concern , opened negotiations with various country towns for removal thither . We joined the Anti-Boycott Association , about 1901 , and I became a member of the committee in charge of the litigation begun by this association in the Chicago courts . I was made , about the same time , the vice-president for Illinois of the National Association of Manufacturers , and subsequently the chairman of its special committee on strike insurance . My company 's factory was unionized in 1903 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forthwith was ' struck ' by six unions affiliated with the Chicago Federation of Labor . The union demands included an eight-hour day instead of ten hours , an advance of twenty per cent in wages , the handing over of shop rules and discipline to a union committee , the sanctioning of sympathetic strikes , the closed shop , and a number of lesser requirements . Our company was young . Engaged as we were in a fierce competition with the so-called Typewriter Trust , and other large typewriter makers , whose works were without exception in country towns , and who paid lower wages for ten hours a day , the // narrow margin of profits which we had attained would have vanished instanter , and we should have started at once toward bankruptcy . I stated these facts to the union leaders , and invited them to put an expert on our books to verify my assertion . They replied that they could not bother with our books , that we could cook ' our accounts to suit ourselves , and anyhow they did not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in Chicago under union conditions , we had better get out of business or out of Chicago . What then of our men whom you have just unionized ? ' I asked . Would you destroy their jobs forthwith ? " They must sacrifice themselves for the cause of labor , ' was the reply , and the poor fellows did . As the business agents left they whistled , and most of the men dropped their tools and marched out . Before this there had been a fortnight of negotiations , during which I looked about for help . I tried to join the Metal Trades and the Employers Associations , and to get under their collective-bargain umbrella ; but I found no room there . These associations were controlled by the larger local factories such as the harvester , ice-machine and electrical works , with whose methods , scale of operations , sales , and seasons , our little typewriter factory had practically nothing in common . Labor conditions which were tolerable to them were to us about as deadly as the union demands . So I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fight alone . A few months before , I had met on the railway train one of the Studebakers of South Bend , whose factory had recently passed through a strike , of which he told me as follows : ' There had never been any unions in South Bend until the organizers came from Chicago to organize our men . As soon as this was done , they called a strike . Their demands seemed to us impossible . So we called the men together , and I made them a speech . I said to them , " We have got along with you men , from father to son , for thirty years , and have never had any trouble until these strangers came in to make it . Now you have put up to us demands that we believe are impossible . You , of course , believe the other way . And what you believe , any other body of men are likely to believe . If we ca n't get along with you , we ca n't get along with anybody else . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places or to run this factory unless we run it with you . We shall simply shut down and give you a chaiice to look around for a better job . If you do n't succeed in finding one and wish to come back , the old job is ready for you on the old conditions whenever men enough decide to come to work to run the shops . If you never come back the shops will stay closed . " So we shut down and left simply the watchmen there , as at night . We employed no ' strike-breakers , and there was no hard feeling . After a few weeks the older men began to think and argue and , in the course of two months , the strike gradually faded out . The men came back , a few at a time , work started up , and we have been nonunion ever since . No property was wrecked and no men killed , and we have had nothing to regret . ' Mr. Studebaker 's narrative pressed me strongly , and when I faced a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men and inclosed in every pay envelope a letter stating that we should not fill the men 's places , but merely wait until they found out that all the unions in Chicago could not furnish them another job ; after which , if they chose to come back , the old jobs would be ready under the old conditions . If they 760 THE VALUE OF EXISTING TRADE ? UNIONISM found other work and did not return in a reasonable length of time , we should feel free to start up with new employees , first giving each man ten days ' notice so that he could , if he chose , apply for his old situation . So the shop remained closed for nearly eight weeks . The unions picketed it in the meantime , but without reason . After six weeks the majority of the men indicated that they wished to return to work , and we gave them the agreed ten days ' notice . Before starting up , as many of the men expressed the fear of slugging , we agreed to put the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injunction restraining the unions and our union employees from picketing , intimidation , and violence . Nevertheless , on the day that work was resumed , two men were slugged . We caught the sluggers , brought them before the court , had them sentenced , and then had the sentence suspended during good behavior . We also furnished our men with police escort to and from work . ? These precautions ended all difficulties . The majority of our employees privately told their foremen that they had had no grievances , and had joined the union only because they were afraid to stay out . As soon as they felt themselves protected by the law , they quit the unions and returned to work . None of them except the pickets received strike benefits from the unions while the strike lasted , although they had been told when joining the unions that a large war-fund had been laid by in previous years in anticipation of this year of struggle , from which they should benefit . When our strike was announced in the papers , the Chicago manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office made a specialty of handling strikes , and that he could give me advance information of every movement made against our company . I expressed some doubt as to his ability to do so . He replied about as follows : ' These union leaders are all grafters ; they will take money from you , or from me , from the politicians , and from the men , ? anywhere they can get it . Our agency practically owns an official in every important union in America . We will give you detailed type-written reports of the proceedings of the executive and finance committees of the six unions with which you are concerned . When you start up , the unions will slip a union man in your shop to re-organize it . We will slip one of our operatives in there , too , and he will keep you informed as to what the union man is doing . ' He finally persuaded me to accept his services , and for nearly six months I received his daily reports , whose accuracy , regarding our strike at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts from our own side . The financial statements , which came in twice a month , showed that but one-fifth of the union war-fund came back to the men , mostly in the shape of pay for pickets , while four fifths went in salaries and expenses of the organization . The largest single items were the bills of a certain lawyer , perhaps the most conspicuous champion of downtrodden labor in America , aggregating many thousands of dollars , paid him for defending sluggers and fighting injunctions against violence and intimidation of non-union men . Our strike collapsed in about eleven weeks , but according to these statements our pickets , who disappeared from the neighborhood entirely about that time , were continuing to draw pay when I stopped taking the statements some three months after . As the business agents were frequently seen about our neighborhood , and must have known // that the pickets were not there , the interesting query arises ? who got the money that was charged as paid for the services of th ? latter ? Another interesting item in the financial report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing our shop . To cover this , each man had been charged three dollars initiation fee , and about fifty of our men failed to pay it . After the collapse of the strike the business agents proposed to me to ' call it off , ' provided the company would pay the union the amount of these defaulted initiation fees , ? a proposal quite in keeping with the whole miserable performance . When we finally started up as a nonunion shop , desiring to keep out union spies while filling a few vacancies , we advertised anonymously for men of the six trades , in three different ways , thus running eighteen ' ads ' at once : for union men , closed shop ? for nonunion men , non-union shop ? and for men , open shop . Nearly a hundred applicants answered both union and non-union advertisements and were , of course , rejected ; but the far more interesting development was the fact that out of about one thousand applications received by mail over eight hundred and fifty were for the non-union job . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be called by business agents every little while . Even from the ' polishers , ' supposed to be solidly unionized , of fifty-one applications thirty-one were for the non-union job . This ' straw vote ' satisfied me that our little shop at least could ignore the unions ; and it did . Meantime the work of the Anti-Boycott Association was going on in Chicago and the vicinity . Its purpose was to enforce the common and statute law regarding conspiracy and combination in restraint of trade against the labor unions . The strikes of 1901-1903 afforded a favorable opportunity , and Chicago a strategic point for its operations . Several important injunction suits were brought and fought through the local committee of which I was a member . The moral effect of the protection of the courts upon the laboring population was so marked that , during the years from 1900 to 1903 , not far from one hundred injunctions were taken out in Chicago and the vicinity . It became well understood among employers that the majority of employees , even union men , preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unions to the issuing of injunctions by the courts grew bitter , and still persists . Eventually less aggressive counsels prevailed in the National Association of Manufacturers . Suggestions of a great fighting association of employers and the formation of a large war-fund , of extensive lock-outs and the like , came to nothing . Collective bargaining accomplished little . The Studebaker method of non-resistance , involving merely ability to shut down , appealed to me as the best defense against professional trade-unionism . I therefore proposed at the annual meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers a method of conferring that ability on every member ; namely , a plan for mutual strike insurance , permitting any member to insure against loss of profits and waste of fixed charges during idleness caused by strikes . The Honorable Carroll D. Wright , Commissioner of Labor , had published , in 1901 , the first report of the Department of Commerce and Labor on Strikes and Lock-outs , covering the years 1881 to 1900 . The averages from this report indicated that such insurance could be written at a premium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the suggestion and appointed a committee on 762 THE VALUE OF EXISTING TRADE ? UNIONISM strike insurance , of which I was made chairman ; and in that capacity I conducted an extensive correspondence , sending out printed interrogatories to the entire membership of the association , which yielded much valuable information , ? among other things the fact that union labor was universally found to be from thirty to forty per cent less efficient than non-union labor . I then thought , and still think , strike insurance an absolutely lawful , cheap , and practical method of cooperation among employers , which if generally adopted would put professional labor leaders clean out of business . For an employer need only say to the business agents , ' Go ahead and strike . IP will cost me nothing . I am insured , and I will shut down and go fishing until the men feel like going to work again . ' But my associates , like myself , had had their experience in 1903 ; and had found out that unionism had not entirely superseded the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : ' Your proposals are sound , but not worth while . We do not have strikes very often . When business is good , and we want men , we have to bid up for them ; when it is bad and we do not want them , they come around after us . We prefer to take our chances , and if a strike comes , meet it in our own way . Organized or not , we can and will pay labor only what trade justifies . ' In short , by 1904 , to these representative employers , over three thousand of the largest in the land , organized labor was no longer the devouring monster of 1900 , but had shrunk to a mere gad-fly of trade , at which the patient ox of industry might indeed switch an uneasy tail , but against which it was scarcely worth while to screen him . Later on , our company dropped out of the National Association of Manufacturers and of the Anti-Boycott Association , and my personal contact with the labor organizations ceased . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the reader on to a far more important and convincing array of facts found in certain public documents , namely : The Second Report of the Commissioner of Labor , on Strikes and Lockouts from 1881 to 1905 ; the Report of the Senate Committee on the Course of Prices and Wages from 1900 to 1907 ; of the Census Bureau on Manufactures brought down to 1905 ; and the advance bulletins of the Census of 1910 . According to the first-mentioned report , there were in the United States in 1905 , besides transportation companies , some 216,262 wage-paying concerns , employing 6,157,751 workers . In 1881 the workers numbered 4,257,613 ; so that for the twenty-five years included their average number may be assumed as 5,200,000 . During this period there were no less than 36,757 strikes ( not counting those of less than a day ) , involving 181,407 concerns , and 1546 lockouts involving 18,547 concerns . Neglecting the lock-outs and excluding railroad employees , 8,485,600 persons were thrown out of employment by strikes , for an average period of 25.4 days . These totals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound conclusions . Assuming the low normal of 2.50 working days per annum , we may figure the total time lost by strikes during that twenty-five years as two thirds of one per cent of normal working time ? an almost negligible fraction . Of the establishments involved , 90 per cent were ' struck ' by organized , and but 10 per cent by unorganized labor . Organized labor won or partly won in 65 per cent , and unorganized labor in 44 per cent , of strikes undertaken . Lock-outs averaged 85 days in dura- // t ion , against 25.4 days for strikes . Employers won or partly won in 68 per cent of the lock-outs begun . Sixty-seven per cent of all strikes were for wages , hours , and other primary questions between employers and their men ; 33 per cent were for recognition of the unions , and other secondary questions between employers and the unions , as distinguished from the men . But , during the twenty-five years , as labor organization progressed , this proportion changed steadily and significantly . In 1881 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strikes , and recognition ' but 7 per cent . In 1905 the figures were respectively 37 and 36 per cent . As the percentage of strikes for recognition rose , the percentage of victories fell , from the grand average of 65 per cent for the twenty-five years , to 52 per cent in 1904 and 1905 , the last two years . Substantially no strikes were undertaken for sanitary conditions , or against dangerous machinery , child or female labor , and the like welfare questions , which the labor leaders have practically left to the philanthropists . To=day , after fifty years of organization , we may say roughly that 70 per cent of the industrial workers and 90 per cent of all wage-earners remain non-union and may be presumed not to favor strike-machines . The enormous majority of wage-workers neither unionize nor strike , but prefer to remain at work and settle their wage questions and working conditions for themselves directly with their employers . II In valuing the widely differing results of strike-effort , that is , the efficiency of trade-unions , certain general considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor is their poverty . ' All an employer needs to win any ordinary strike is the ability merely to shut down , and wait until starvation does its work . This he knows perfectly well . But low wages , long hours , and such primary questions between him and his men are seldom worth to him a shut-down , or a fight to keep running . They mean merely increased cost of labor which , like that of material , can generally be added to prices , and the burden passed along to the consumer . Indeed , the large majority of increases and decreases , the natural fluctuations of wages and prices , take place automatically under the law of supply and demand ; and differences come to the striking point , as we have seen , only two-thirds of one per cent of the time ? which is too seldom to count much . Ordinarily , therefore , the employer is indifferent , and easily yields wages and hours demanded . He is seldom the tyrant blood-sucker of helpless laboring men , women , and children that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions he is a pretty 764 THE VALUE OF EXISTING TRADE ? UNIONISM decent fellow , who likes his working people , and willingly pays full going wages , and runs as short hours as his trade will permit . Of prime importance to him , on the other hand , is the kind of work he gets for wages paid during the 991 per cent of the time between strikes . No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ' When recognition ' means that employees must take orders from half a dozen different unions instead of from the man who pays them ; that old and faithful hands must unionize or leave ; that sympathetic strikes and boycotts and refusal to handle non-union material may unexpectedly and uselessly involve him in the troubles of distant strangers ; in short , that brains , foresight , and energy may any day be ripped out of his business , as a scullion rips the vitals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridiron of competition , ? all of this being exactly what recognition ' does mean , ? verily the employer is bound to fight or lock out , if he can . But first , with property and trade at stake , he carefully considers his position . He can not fight or lock out , but must yield for the nonce , when , as in the building trades , time is of the essence of his obligations , with important work to be finished by a day certain ; or when he is financially so weak that he must keep going or fail . He can not yield or lock out , but must fight , when , as in the railroad and other public service , the law and franchises enforce continuous operation , yet limit prices for service ; or when , as of late in the soft-coal and garment trades , competition is so intense as to have precisely the same effect . The poor chap ponders long , and often decides wrongly . But the labor leaders are held back by no financial responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may suffer individually , but the leaders ' comfortable salaries run on , and union treasuries are on tap . The leaders ' personal importance increases enormously during a strike , while for the grafters among them ? and union history is full of graft ? the strike is their greatest opportunity . The student can understand , then , why there were ten strikes to one lockout , and nine union strikes to one called by unorganized labor ; why labor has won the majority of strikes so far , and lost the majority of lock-outs ; why , as they strike more and more for re-cognition ' and like secondary causes , the unions win less and less ; and why the leaders fight three times as desperately , and hold their unlucky followers out three times as long , for ' recognition , ' involving their own power and prestige , as for wages , concerning only the men ? yet , nevertheless , lose oftener in the end . One can understand , too , why , when trade conditions compel reductions of wages or demand shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comparatively helpless . And finally one can understand why ? as Allan Pinkerton said of the Mollie McGuire thirty years ago ? ' Organized labor is organized violence . ' It must always be . So long as the great majority of laborers remain outside the unions , and a majority of those inside are there only through fear , terrorism becomes the only means of preventing free competition in labor and the settlement of strikes according to the real attractiveness , or the contrary , of labor conditions . Samuel Gompers is credited by a recent New York daily with the remark , Organized labor without violence is a joke . ' It seems impossible that he should have said such a thing , but the thing itself is true of existing trade-unionism. // Seeing then that labor is at actual war ' with capital but two thirds of one per cent of the time ; and that even then organized labor wins but three times to unorganized labor 's twice , what after all is all this colossal organization worth to labor ? What is the net value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the time ? Does this minute increase of efficiency justify the cost of organization during the remaining ninety-nine per cent ? The labor leaders will answer that organization is the sole foundation of good wages all the time . Well , is it ? Let us turn to the Senate Report on Wages and Prices for the following testimony : While from 1900 to 1907 the average price of 25 leading commodities advanced 17 per cent , farm labor , entirely unorganized , advanced from 60 to 67 per cent . Ribbon and hosiery mill-labor , poorly organized , two thirds of whose strikes failed ( see strike report ) advanced respectively 44 and 36 per cent ; railway labor , highly organized , advanced as follows : trainmen 33 per cent , machinists 30 per cent , engineers 20 per cent , miscellaneous 18 per cent ; building-trades labor , over-organized , advanced but 32 per cent ; cabinet-makers , well-organized , advanced but 20 per cent . Another comparison from the same report of wages paid in 1907 in different cities and countries , shows that union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $18 , in Baltimore $21 , in Chicago $27.50 , in London , England , $10.65 . Union compositors earned in Philadelphia 43 cents per hour , in Chicago 67 cents , in San Francisco 80 cents . That is to say , of the different classes considered by the Senate Committee , entirely unorganized , unskilled labor gained most in wages , badly organized labor came next , . and the best organ ized and strongest of all union labor , the railway engineers , gained least ; while laborers of the same unions at one and the same time , in different cities of the same country , drew widely different and apparently inconsistent rates of wages for the same work . How can these contradictory facts be accounted for on the theory that unionism is the foundation of wage scales ? It is not . Actually , they are fixed the world over by local conditions of supply , demand , and efficiency ; and trade-unionism has had about as much effect upon them , broadly speaking , as has had that magnificent fake , the protective tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the workingman high wages , that is , a high standard of living ? The answer is plain ? nothing but efficiency : high-producing power conferred on labor by conjunction with brains and capital . This almost axiomatic proposition is prettily demonstrated by the 1905 Census Report on Manufactures , which shows : ? That small establishments whose annual product amounted to $5000 or less employed 1.9 per cent of the labor , drew 1.6 per cent of the pay-roll , and produced 1.2 per cent of the total output . That middle-sized concerns of $100,000 to $200,000 annual product , employed 18.8 per cent of the labor , drew 18.3 per cent of the wages , and produced 14.4 per cent of the output . That large concerns of $1,000,000 or more annual product employed 25.6 per cent of the labor , drew 27.2 per cent of the pay-roll , and produced 38 per cent of the output . Evidently the little fellow who is crushed by the trust ' and goes to work for it , ' no longer free but a mere slave , ' draws more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efficiency grows with it . A little of the resulting saving comes to him direct ; a little goes to the trust ; but the bulk of it comes to you and me , to everybody , himself included , in reduction of prices and cost of living . That is the law of trade . How much ought to come to him direct ? What should be his share of the increment of his productive value due not to himself , but to capital and brains ? Not much ! Like the unearned increment ' on real estate , most of it rightfully belongs to the community ; and one way or another the community gets it . What then are those rights of labor , ' which labor is to get when Mr. Gompers 's prophecy of the final domination of muscle over mind is realized ? Probably labor itself would define them as an even ' divide , ' master and man alike , all round . Well , what would that amount to ? Here is a crude guess . The census of 1910 gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , of which about one quarter was in the land ; which last the nation neither made nor saved . The rest was in worldly goods produced by all , and saved by some of us . It amounts to , say , $983 each for every man , woman , and child in the United States ; or , say , $4500 per family . At the usual capitalistic return of 5 per cent this would yield $225 per annum , or 61 cents per day per family . That is , were all the brains and property of the country to continue as now at the service of labor , and were it to work as hard as now , and were each family head to draw 61 cents per day greater average pay , labor would get everything ? nothing left for capital , brains , and time spent in evolution of the commercial situation . Labor would probably turn upon Gompers and say , ' Is that all ? Where are our rights ? our automobiles and Scotch castles , our golf and idle days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Those things are not on the cards , boys . You will each have to turn out many hundred times more work than you are doing every day in order to pass such luxuries around . ' The boys would probably reply , ' If 61 cents a day extra , and hard work for life , is all there is in it , we will take a vacation and spend our $4500 apiece right now , and have one good time while it lasts . ' As a matter of fact , there are no rights , ' there is no enormous profit stolen from its daily toil , which labor does not get . The whole wealth of the country , its accumulation of three centuries , was 80,000 million dollars in 1910 , land-values neglected . The farm products of that year were 9000 millions , the industrial products 15,000 millions , and the precious metals 126 millions ; probably all in all we produced 25,000 millions of dollars value last year . The savings of three centuries , then , are barely three years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food and merchandise disappear in a year ; the roads , rolling-stock , and machinery in ten years ; the buildings , say , in thirty . All must be renewed from year to year . The world really lives from hand to mouth , its toiling millions consuming at least 97 per cent of all they produce . A few million of workers of rare industry and thrift , a few hundred thousand of still rarer brain and energy , gather together the small fraction that remains , and concentrate it by the world-wide machinery of modern commerce in a few favored countries ? for themselves , as they fondly suppose , but really , under a mightier intelligence than theirs , mainly for the use and benefit of labor , which works and thinks as little as possible , and saves hardly at all . Let us inquire now what are the plainly evident interests of wage- // working people , and upon them try to build logical and useful principles of association with those of their fellow men who , possessing brains , will always also control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Employment . The laborer must have a job , furnished him by some one else , for he has not the ability to create one for himself . It must be continuous ; for his time is all he has , and every day lost is so much pay gone forever . He , himself , should be the last man to interrupt or cripple his own job ; nor should it be subject to interruption by quarrels of other men with other jobs in which he has no concern . Freedom to work . If employment fails , does not pay , or is unsuitable , it is absolutely vital that the laborer shall be free to seek any other employment or locality without being shut in or out by union walls . It is best ' for him , as for the community , that labor , like capital , should be liquid , free to flow where most needed ; in ample supply everywhere , in stagnation nowhere .

The only way the laborer can induce , or indeed enable , his employer to pay the highest wages is to produce the utmost in return , and make him prosperous . For , though it does not follow that a prosperous business always pays the highest wages , a losing business practically never does . Therefore , up to the point of healthy fatigue , the workman in his own interest should put his heart and back into his work , in fullest accord with the brain that creates and pays for his job ; doing his level best to increase output and decrease unit-cost to his employer and to the community . As labor seldom saves , and figures ahead only from pay-day to pay-day , pay-days must be regular and frequent , and the work steady . The employer , to be ideal , must be strong and successful ; in short , a capitalist as far as possible independent of the troubles of other business concerns .

Nevertheless , to satisfy Labor ' ? which nowadays wants to know , ' and would cut loose from simple and sound old methods , ? that labor-competition is inevitable , as well as immediately and ultimately just , and yet to mitigate as far as may be , its harshness , Capital ' might well , it seems to me , utilize the fine principle of brotherhood , of strength in union among laboring people ; devising for the larger industries , with its greater intelligence , a form of union among employees more logical than present unionism , wage-contracts more just to the individual , and more efficient than present collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical method of enforcing such contracts on both sides .

For the creation of a joint guarantee fund equal , say , to five per cent of each employee 's wages , to be contributed on pay-days , one half by him and one half by the employer , and placed in trust to accumulate at in terest ; its sum to be divided between himself and the employer if he quits or is discharged with the three months ' notice , or by mutual consent ; or to be forfeited entire by or to him , if he quits or is discharged without the three months ' notice , during his first fifteen years ' employment . After fifteen years he may at any time either retire , and withdraw the whole as a savings fund , or retire on a pension representing it , upon giving the three months ' notice . Employees who prefer not to join such a union are not to be forced to do so , or to quit other unions ; but to remain without benefits as ordinary employees by the day . Those who join and sign contracts are , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they think it worth while to forfeit their half of the guarantee fund . In case of a deadlock between the employer and the union representative , the employer as well as the men , if dissatisfied with existing scales or conditions , must give notice and wait three months before lock-out or strike , or forfeit the guarantee funds . Individual men preferring not to give notice would , of course , hold their jobs and their guarantee funds . At the end of the three months ' notice , should the deadlock continue , the men would draw their shares of the accumulated guarantee fund , and go their ways , sacrificing their pension-standing , etc . The employer would have to build up a new force . Probably both sides would try the ordinary endurance test , to see which would yield first ; the men better financed than usual , and the employer having had three months for finishing work in process and preparing to shut down , with his share of the guarantee fund as a financial anchor to windward . The possibility of strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , be greatly les- // sened under this plan . Nothing clears the judgment like financial responsibility . Such a form of unionism would , it seems to me , promote as well as human contrivance can the common interests of labor and capital , namely , continuous employment , freedom for labor to flow where wanted , high efficiency and high wages under healthy conditions ; and would add to the general blessings of industrial peace the special blessings of thrift and insurance . A prominent western actuary recently laid before his employer friends a plan under which the employer 's half of such a five per cent guarantee fund would more than suffice , and might be used during the first fifteen years to pay the premiums upon a death , accident , and sickness insurance policy in one of the standard companies , covering ( in lieu of employers ' liability ) the same scale of benefits as are now provided for working men under the admirable German Compulsory Insurance laws . At the end of the fifteen years the accumulations of the employee 's half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the insurance policy , which could then be dropped ; and thereafter the whole fund would accumulate to provide the same benefits , and a savings fund or retiring pension at the employee 's option . He would , however , 4acrifice all the accumulations and the two and a half per cent of his wages , should he break his contract and quit without notice ; or should he , in case of accident or injury , elect to abandon his contract benefits , and hold his employer liable under existing laws ? a strong , reason for doing neither . Would the men sign such contracts , offering incomparably greater benefits to themselves and the community than are offered by existing trade-unions , laws , and charities ? If we may forecast their probable action from the foregoing statistics , most of them would . It is certain , however , that no union man would do so if the present union leaders could prevent . Prying capital and labor apart with a wedge of class hatred , and inserting themselves between , is now their gainful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profitable relations between employer and employee would put them out of power . Therefore , when Mr. Taylor , by long experiment , finds ways for men to do vastly more work with less effort , and draw much more pay , Mr. Mitchell promptly repudiates for labor the idea of doing so much for the money . If Mr. Perkins offers Steel Corporation shares to its employees on easy payments , so that they may be directly interested in its success and in the profits from their own toil , Mr. Morrison denounces the offer as bribery , and those who accept it as traitors to their class . So there you have the issue sharply defined . However sordid the motives of capital , its methods have been enormously beneficial to the race . It has learned that human efficiency means abundance for human need , and abundance low prices , and low prices larger trade , and larger trade greater profits . With the purely selfish purpose of garnering these profits , capital has for a century produced and supplied to the race , in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and luxuries of life . On the other hand , labor , equally selfish but less intelligent , everywhere and always fights efficiency , discipline , scientific management ; in short , fights every means of increasing output and reducing unit-cost . Everywhere and always , strange as it may seem , labor stands for monopoly , violence , and coercion , and against personal independence . The non-union man has no right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of a job . At the very moment of time when the world demands of capital the utmost commercial freedom , the widest competition , the greatest energy , the cheapest and best service , labor stands for the exact opposite , ? for tyranny , combination in restraint of trade , high cost , inefficiency , and sloth . To sum up , in hauling the heavy load of human existence , it is the admitted principle and purpose of organized labor to balk and not to pull . A priori , and from the broad experience , personal and national , cited above , the conclusion comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose wrong , and the result inevitable ; in fine , that existing trade-unionism is of no value , to itself or to the community , and must make way for something better .
