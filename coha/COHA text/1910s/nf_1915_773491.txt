txt // the fact . The sand is probably a greater attraction to them at the seashore than is the bathing , in most cases , and there are a great many who positively dislike the water . Wherever a house is being built in the city , and a heap of sand is deposited , there will the children be found , digging away industriously usually quite unconscious of the passer-by . As Joseph Lee says : " Sand seems to have been made for the human hand . It is so plastic and obedient to the will of the planner . It furnishes excellent opportunities for drawing and molding , yet the child 's love for the sand is undoubtedly older than any intellectual interest . Its appeal is to the emotions and to nerve cells associated with a very distant racial history , so far back that their intellectual content is lost and only their emotional content remains . Doubtless the brain is always less emotional and has that much less energy at its command , if the child has not roused these particular cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even hark back to the amphibious days of the saurians , when the first progenitors of man crawled out of the sea to bask on the beaches of a pristine world . However that may be , or from whatever source , the love of the sand is there , and nearly or quite universal among children . " Nature furnishes the sand at the shore . There is a decided pleasure which comes from the contrast of the cold waters and the warm sand . The sea keeps its beach constantly sterile and disinfected . The ideal place to dig in the sand is at the water side . It is difficult to meet this requirement in the city playground , but not at all impossible . Some of the swimming pools of the South Park System have a sand beach around them made of several carloads of imported sand . Nearly all of the wading pools in Chicago are near immense Playgrounds according to Af , , es and Sexes 51 sand bins . It would have been quite as easy to make the sand courts the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the sand would constantly be getting into the pool . Shade . ? In the great majority of playgrounds , however , there are neither wading pools nor swimming pools , and the sand bin can not be so located . It is almost absolutely essential that the sand bin should have both shade and t he sun , because , if there is no shade , the sand gets so hot and dry hot the children do not care to play in it , and , if there is no sun , it soon becomes unsanitary . In all of the first school playgrounds in New York the sand bins were installed in the basements of the schools . It was a delight to go in at first and see two or even three hundred children digging away there . They were usually quite unconscious of observation and utterly absorbed in their play , but after two weeks had gone by and 1 he children had come in from the streets with their feet covered wit h the gutter slime , which is more than 95 per cent horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread crusts and melon rinds , the sand bin was not so delightful . One could smell it as soon as he came inside the playground . In the municipal playgrounds of New York , frame pavilions with permanent roofs were erected . These are better than the basements , because the sand does at least come in contact with the outdoor air . They are nevertheless very unsatisfactory , as they do not sufficiently expose the sand to the sun and the rain . In Chicago and in many other places they stretch a tarpaulin of some kind over the sand bin . This gives a certain amount of shade , though it is never very cool shade , and the tarpaulin can be rolled up in cool and rainy weather , so that the sand may have the benefit of the sun and the rain . However , a // tarpaulin is rather costly . The children are apt to climb on it and tear it , and it is apt to be torn by the wind unless it is very securely fastened . In some cases the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school or other building in such a way as to furnish the needed shade and give the sand the sunshine mornings and evenings , but on the whole the most satisfactory placing of a sand bin is under or around a tree . The sand will there get the sun in the morning and evening and be protected during the middle of the day when it is hot . The shade of a tree is much cooler than the shade of canvas , and the tree does not exclude the rain . A second good cover for a sand bin is an arbor with a vine of some sort over it . This has the great advantage that the arbor or framework can be cheaply erected , and the vine will grow in a few months if the right one is selected , and it can be protected until it gets a start . Kudsu is probably the most rapidly growing vine that is available , though Virginia creeper also grows very rapidly , and is hardy nearly everywhere . It looks so much like poison ivy that the children will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course the size of the sand bin should be determined by the number of children who are likely to use it . About twelve feet by twenty will be right for most playgrounds . This bin may be made either of cement or of planks . If it is made of cement and has a cement bottom , there should be some outlet so it will not fill up with water after rains . It is better , however , for the sand bin not to have a bottom if the ground underneath is hard and will not mix in too much , because this keeps the sand in contact with the moisture below . For the same reason it is better to excavate the earth and put the sand in nearly level with the surrounding surface , Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 53 as the sand will not dry out so fast as it will if the bin is on the top of the ground . The sides may be made of brick or planks or cement . If the bin is made on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one made of ordinary planks about twelve inches in height . There should be a plank or board running around the top , to mold the sand on and to serve as a seat . The sand bin should be painted about the color of the surrounding surface , green for grass , brown for earth . Its cost is trifling . If the bin be installed along with many other things that are of cement , harmony will require t hat the bin also shall be of cement . The Sand . ? In cities that have easy access to the sea or lake shore , it should always be the practice to secure the pure white sand that is found there . This sand is very fine , and pleasant to mold , and it does not soil the clothing . There is similar sand in many river beds and in some sand banks , but almost any plastering sand will do . Keeping the Sand Clean . ? This is a considerable problem , ? so much of a problem that I never feel entirely sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back yard . The sources of defilement are many , a few of which are as follows . In many quarters the wind bears large quantities of dust which settles down on everything . It is soon blown off from most things , but it is held by the sand . This dust in the city is largely horse manure , though , of course , it is the same that we are breathing on the street , and that settles upon the upholstery in the parlor . Even if it is only pulverized clay , it will make mud when it is rained upon . There are always cats that find the sand bin the most convenient toilet in the neighborhood . In many quarters the sand is sure to get full of fleas . If the playground // is unfenced , the sand bin is likely , in certain quarters , to be a place for carousal at night . After the children have gone home young rowdies come in to drink beer and have lunches , throwing the litter in the sand . But the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefooted with all sorts of filth on their feet . They bring in bits of luncheon and drop them in the sand . The little babies frequently urinate there . It is impossible to prevent this defilement . The only thing that can be done is to change the sand frequently , and it should be gone over with a rake every day . Changing the Sand . ? In Germany they change the sand about once a week , and many of the sand bins are mounted on low tables , so that the children stand up around them . This certainly must be a great help in keeping the sand clean and fit to use . In the majority of the playgrounds of this country , the sand is not changed at all . In others it is changed only once a season . The sand usually drifts out of the sand bin on to the playground more or less , and has to be replenished about once a season unless the bin is very large and deep . This old sand can generally be used to advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparatus , so there is no considerable loss in replacing it . In a great many playgrounds the sand that works out from the bin greatly improves the surface of the surrounding playground . Utensils for Sand Play . ? As to supplying utensils for playing in the sand , there is a difference of usage . Some playgrounds furnish the pails and iron spoons or shovels , and some do not . The child at the seashore is nearly always armed with a bucket and shovel . The children mold the sand in Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 55 the pail for many initial attempts at building . The only t rouble with furnishing this equipment is that it is hard to keep track of where the director has many other duties , and the little children have very little conception of property rights . Consequently , they are very likely to walk oil with the implements furnished . The cost of these things is trifling , and they can easily be replaced , but it is not well to teach the children to steal . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and if the fact that these things are not to be taken away is impressed upon the older children , t hey will largely prevent the younger ones from carrying them home . In some of the European sand gardens , a quantity of round pebbles are furnished , with which the children outline their drawings . In some places they furnish clam shells instead of shovels , so there is not so much temptation . Of course the utensils need to be collected and put away every night in any case . This means some trouble . Where there is a section for the little children , with a kindergartner in charge , there should be no trouble about the children 's stealing the equipment , and the care of it should not he burdensome . In any ground it might be well to make the experiment , impressing upon the children at the beginning that the shovels and pails are not to be taken home . Sprinkling the Sand . ? Unless there are frequent rains , the sand that is in the sun a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry that the children can not do anything with it . Some arrangement should be made , so that it can be wet down each evening or so by the janitor after the children leave for the night . Activities of the Sand Bin . ? Children of different ages Ow the sand for different purposes . The little children love // to dig and pile up the sand merely for the sake of doing it . They find pleasure in the feeling of the sand on their hands . They like to see it grow into different forms and feel themselves the cause of the change . As they grow older , the sand play takes on more and more of the artistic and expressive nature . Any one who has been at Atlantic City must have found the activities of the sand artists along the Boardwalk one of the most interesting sights of that great resort . They mold wonderful angels and horses and knights and castles , and not a few nickels and dimes are thrown to the artists every day by the appreciative onlookers . Sand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1889 , G. Stanley Hall told the Story of a Sand Pile in a rural village of Massachusetts . The boys who were the artists in this case were about twelve years of age , and came to the village each summer for their summer vacation . They made in the sand a complete model of the village with its streets , schools , public buildings , and other points of interest . This is a form of expression that is quite as educative as the sand and papier-mache maps that are made in the schools . The sand bin is very often used for the story period , and the children are invited to illustrate the story in the sand bin afterwards . The Ages of the Children . ? Children will use a sand bin with pleasure from the time they are one year old until they are twelve or thirteen , but the bin is always placed in the yard of the little children , and is used primarily by them . The sand gardens of Boston were the first supervised playgrounds in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Playground . " On the whole , the sand bin is doubtless much better adapted to the back yard than it is to the playground . It is difficult Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 57 to keep a public sand bin sanitary , and for the artistic and expressive uses of the sand there is little opportunity on account of the great number of children who make use of it . Swings . ? Swings will not be discussed in t his chapter , because they are taken up in detail in t he chapter which follows , but there should be the hammock swings for the babies , the chair swings for the three-year-olds , t he low board swings for the children of six and seven , and garden or lawn swings where they can have parties , take excursions , and otherwise " make believe . " Building Blocks . ? One of the most popular indoor activities of little children everywhere is the use of blocks . ' I'hc blocks which are furnished are not usually well adapted to the child 's purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable him to erect easily different kinds of structures . The blocks should be about the size of ordinary bricks , with flat boards and longer pieces interspersed . If these are stored in some box and there is a platform for building , the occupation is sure to be popular . Although keeping the blocks in order , and preventing their being scattered about the playground , is likely to cause trouble , it is probably worth the effort if the little children have a section to themselves with a kindergartner or an attendant in charge . Mud Pies . ? I once saw a playground in Berlin where a large section seemed to be devoted to the making of mud pies ; at any rate , that was all the children were doing . I doubt somewhat whether the parents would approve of a playground of this kind , but I suspect it would be quite as popular with the children as anything that could be offered . Hills for Coasting . ? Another very interesting development in some of the playgrounds for little children in Germany is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is well rounded and which serves as a sort of toboggan slide . The children coast down it in their express wagons in the summer , and doubtless ride down on sleds during the winter . The hill is so low that there is no danger to the children , and it is a source of endless delight . Near by was a small building where express wagons could be stored . A Balancing Mast . ? As every one knows who has ever observed children at all , little children are always delighted to walk on the edge of a wall or bank or fence or even on the railroad rail . This is a step in the process of gaining control and equilibrium which is a very valuable one in motor training . Most of the playgrounds of Germany have a balancing mast , which is a beam perhaps 4 by 4 or 4 by 6 , supported about eight or ten inches from the ground . It is a good thing to have two or three of these , some broader and some narrower , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Framework to Climb On . ? From the time the child is a year and a half old till he is eight or nine , there are few things that are more interesting than climbing . Children love to climb up the porch , into trees , up ladders , over anything that gives them an opportunity to hold on by their hands and raise themselves to a higher position . Some kind of low framework that the children could climb over , passing from one position to another by hanging on , perhaps , by their hands , would be one of the most popular things that could be put into the playground for small children . If there were underneath an abundance of soft sand , there would be no great danger of their being injured , and the development of courage would be worth the risk involved . Joseph Lee speaks of his Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 59 children playing tag over a framework of similar nature , and observation of our children convinces me of the popularity of such a piece of apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  This is also the place for a good deal of apparatus which is not ordinarily put in the kindergarten section , but . which belongs there more than anywhere else . The little child is like a monkey , as we all know . He loves to hang by his hands , and almost any apparatus which furnishes this opportunity will be appreciated . The parallel rings , the trapezium , and the horizontal ladder will be more used by the children in the kindergarten than by the older children . When the horizontal ladders were first placed in the school playgrounds in New York City and steps were made so that the little children could get up to them , there was an almost continuous procession of children five or six years old walking across these ladders on their hands . I can remember , too , as a child on a Michigan farm , how at a very early age we used to walk the great beams of the barn , sometimes thirty or forty feet from the floor , holding on by our fingers . An Out-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doors . It was his intention that they always should be there . Every one realizes that it is best for the little children to be in the house as little as possible , and that , so far as conditions permit , they should be in the open air in their play . Whenever a playground of the type suggested can be provided , it would be best that all the kindergarten work of the school should be done there . It would be probably necessary that there should be a pavilion with some shelter , but it would be no great loss , perhaps , if some of the gifts and industrial work were slighted for the more vigorous 6o Practical Conduct of Play games of the playground . This might mean that the kindergarten would have to take its vacation during the winter and be in operation from April or May till November or December , but this would not be any great matter . There should be a kindergartner , in any case , in charge of this playground for the little children . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of teachers to have charge of the play of the little children , but that the mothers should do it . But , as every one knows , the mothers , even those with kindergarten training , largely fail to play with their children . A playground of this type would furnish an opportunity for the instruction and encouragement of the mothers in this play . There should be shade , and abundant benches , and places for baby carriages , and any other inducements that might be thought of . During the first years in New York City , there were kindergartens on all the recreation piers , and the mothers used to gather around by dozens , and sometimes by hundreds , to watch the play . Not infrequently a mother was heard to say , " I do n't see how she makes him mind without hitting him . " Surely this object lesson in the guidance of children must have had a beneficial influence on the home discipline and the personal relationships between the mothers and their children . THE PLAYGROUND FOR THE OLDER GIRLS It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut off from the street and also from the boys ' playground by a high , solid hedge , though it is very desirable that it should be separated from the central space only by a low hedge , so that it may be entirely open to observation from within . Especially the section where the swings and teeter ladders are Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 61 located should be as completely secluded from direct observation from the street as possible . This playground should provide a place for ring games for the younger girls and for general games such as captain ball , pullaway , dodge ball , and the like , and it should have definitely located grounds for volley ball , indoor baseball , basket ball , tennis , and croquet . At one side of the ground there should be a running track not more than too yards in length and a place for the broad and the high jump . This ground should contain , also , a considerable number of swings not more than twelve or fourteen feet high , seesaws , giant strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the school building or , if there is no such building , in a special pavilion , there should he a place on this ground for dancing and for industrial work . It is in every way desirable that there also he dishes and some opportunity for serving very simple spreads , s , w I l i ( 11 should he available both for the boys and the girls . The girls love to have tea parties , and an occasional party wit It the boys is a great promoter of friendship . There are few things that would do more to promote courtesy towards visiting teams than the custom of giving them some very simple entertainment , such as ice cream or lemonade after the game is over . in most of the field houses of Chicago there is provision for such hospitality . In school playgrounds , it ought to he possible to make such arrangements , wherever there is a department of domestic economy . If the dress of girls is to be reformed , probably the best - lace to set the standards is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more or less understood rule as to what this dress should be . Certainly 6 2 Practical Conduct of Play girls who are to take active exercise should not wear corsets or high-heeled shoes or hobble skirts or white underwear , but tennis shoes and a middy blouse with bloomers under a short skirt , or some similar comfortable attire , should be standardized for playground use so far as possible . THE PLAYGROUND FOR THE OLDER BOYS This division may well contain very nearly the same things as the playground for the girls , but it should be somewhat larger , as the games of boys require more space than those of girls , and the attendance of the boys is also likely to be better . The space devoted to athletics should be more ample , to provide for longer races and for hurdling . Just as the girls should be provided with some facilities for cooking , sewing , and similar activities , so there ought to be some sort of shop available in connection with the playground where tools may be kept and repairs made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things which they wish to use . A school playground which is already provided with a manual training room has in this way an advantage over the municipal playground . THE COMMUNITY PLAYGROUND There are too many forces at the present time that tend to disrupt the home and the family . If the activities of the children are passing from the home and the yard to the playground , then the parents ought to go with them , for the sake of the home and for the sake of the wholesomeness of the play . Adults need recreation and exercise as well as children , and so far as possible the playground ought to be a community Playgrounds according fo Ages and Sexes 63 melting pot . During a large part of the year such a common meeting ground is almost the only possible condition of a real community life , and of wholesome relationships between parents and children and classes in the community . This meeting ground of the community should be in the central part of the playground itself , so that it shall have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the place for all the exhibitions and entertainments given by the children . It should contain the general baseball diamond and the grand stand for the observation of all special contests and exhibitions in folk dancing and the like . If possible , there should also be facilities for all of those games which are adapted to adults , such as volleybaII , indoor baseball , tennis , croquet , long ball , and quoits . This should be , too , the common meeting ground for the boys and the girls where they may play all of these games together if they wish , for , as has been said , it is not their playing together but their loafing together which is dangerous . Here , also , there should be a pavilion for general dances , and t here should be a stand for band concerts which might serve also as a sort of grand stand for general observation of the playground at other times . Moving pictures might be shown in the evening , and concerts given either by the city bands or by Victrolas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand stand , it should be possible to set tables for the serving of ice cream and coffee and other light refreshments . These phases which I have mentioned will not really be so great an innovation on the playground as they might seem at first . A number of the municipal grounds in New York have a large rostrum or elevated pavilion for the observation of the playground , and most of our amusement parks serve refresh64 Practical Conduct of Play meats in front of the band stand . In many ways the German concert garden is the most delightful community playground in the world . There is excellent music , there is shade , and good refreshments are sold at reasonable rates . There is a delightful social atmosphere throughout it all , and at the edges are abundant playgrounds for the children . The experience of Superintendent Parker in Hartford in making the park selfsupporting would seem to indicate that these new features might be furnished at a cheap rate and without any additional expense whatever to the city , provided it was done by the Recreation Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish moving pictures at little cost in a place where no hall need be hired . Every effort should be made to make the playground a community affair in which all take an interest , and which will become the common center of the social life . To this end it would be wise for the mothers ' club , or the civic club , or the social center association , or whatever organization there may be which represents the neighborhood , to have a certain supervision over the playground social life and seek to have some of its members on duty there at least during the late afternoons and evenings . To this end , it would be wise for the mothers ' club , perhaps , to hold afternoon teas at times in the band stand or some other available place , and there should be exhibits of industrial work , and baby shows , and other things which would call the parents in as judges or participants and which would make them feel that the playground was for them as well as the children , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adults and children would solve several of the toughest problems of the playground . Playgrounds according to Ages and Sexes 65 It would be a place where the family might meet together and would thus tend to unite rather than separate its members . The supervision of the mothers would be a most salutary means of preventing objectionable conduct between the boys and girls , and of checking bad language , smoking , and other actions which sometimes cause criticism of our playgrounds . There are probably no parents who would object to their children 's attending a playground where they themselves go and where they can observe constantly what is going on . if the parents came often to the playgrounds , they would have a better understanding of what the children are doing and would be more willing to cooperate in all of the enterprises which the director tries to carry through . The discipline would be made much easier by this cooperation of the parents . Although American parents are always ready to sacrifice themselves and to spend their money lavishly on their children , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably not a small city in the country whose people do not spend more on a golf club for a hundred adults than they do for the play of the four or five thousand children of the city , and the playground that provides for the recreation of the adults as well as the children is sure to have much more ample financial support than one which is for the children alone . CHAPTER V THE PLAY EQUIPMENT THE chief value of play , probably , is that it represents the old racial activities through which our progenitors climbed to civilization and modern industries . In spirit and motive it represents periods so distant and extended that the time of recorded history sinks into insignificance . It uses nervous coordinations that are hereditary and rouses those deeper layers of energy that have been developed and stored up through the whole life history of the race . It is not so much an activity as a spirit which represents an earlier time . It is nature 's method whereby the child may live through the childhood of the race and develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , and the will in the same way that the race has done . Its education is not for information ; but , as a training of the practical , emotional , and social life of a boy or girl , it is much more effective than arithmetic or geography . The same things can not be said of play with apparatus . In the larger sense this is not play at all . In its newer forms it has no direct associations with the past . In general , play equipment is probably most valuable for little children , and its value decreases rather rapidly with advancing years until for young people of high school age such equipment as swings , giant strides , merry-go-rounds , and the like have little value . 66 // THE COMMON PIECES OF EQU1i ' 1111 ? NT The Swing . ? The swing is usually the central feature of the equipment for small children . It is the piece of apparatus which is apt to attract the most attention . in the minds of many people , a city playground means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most expensive , dangerous , and troublesome pieces of apparatus . It causes nearly all the criticism that is made of playgrounds , is responsible for most of the accidents , and yields in return a mild emotional stimulus of no apparent value , and a very small amount of physical exercise . What has the swing to say for itself ? Why Do We Like to Swing ? ? Joseph Lee says the pleasure of swinging is a reminiscence of our tree top home . Very likely it is . All things that are spontaneously and universally pleasurable must have secured this association with pleasure in periods far back in history . Certainly monkeys , ill like to wing , and it is said to be through their skill in leaping from swaying branch to swaying branch or in swinging from vines or each other 's tails that they bridge the gap from tree to tree and are able to traverse the highways of the forest . Children like about as well to swing from a single hanging rope as on a regular swing with a seat , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the age of our present swing with two ropes and a board , but it seems to belong to the race . Pretty much everywhere it is to be found suspended from the limb of some convenient tree , and it seems to be the natural corollary of childhood everywhere . ' l'lie sensations of swinging are of almost effortless motion , of a mild and gentle breeze , of falling without danger . These sensations , however , can scarcely explain the universal pleasure in the // swing . Lee says that " swinging is like foreign travel , " but lie fails to explain the resemblance . He thinks his children ( lo not need to swing , because of their varied experiences . I suspect , however , that there is a specific stimulation of the brain cells that only the swing can give , and that the child who has not had this emotional awakening may be the poorer intellectually all the rest of his life . The Lawn Swing . ? The lawn swing is scarcely a swing in its effect on the mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It produces very different sensations . The lawn , garden , or skup swing in its ordinary form will not stand the strain of the general playground . Two were placed in each playground the first year in New York City , but they were nearly all broken during the first week , because it was hard to prevent six or eight children from getting into each of them at the same time . There is a large swing made by W. Tothill of Chicago out of heavy timbers , which is used in the Chicago playgrounds . This is a serviceable playground swing , but it is expensive as compared with the other swings . Its chief value is as a seat when you are tired , a seat also that creates its own breeze . This is well adapted to playground use , and it is a good thing to have a few of them at the side of the strenuous play fields , so that they may take the place of benches . The lawn swing , even as usually made , I believe to be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much interested during the last year in observing half a dozen children , the oldest of whom is five and the youngest two , in their play in a garden swing . I had always regarded this swing as of comparatively little value , but this experience has entirely changed my views in regard to it . There are at least // a dozen different ways in which the children are able to operate this swing , and nearly all of them are excellent physical exercise . They have gained considerable courage in getting on and off while it was in motion , and I have never known a child to be much hurt . They use the rungs at the top as horizontal bars for all sorts of gymnastic stunts and constantly climb over the framework , so that the paint has been nearly all worn off from the upper part of the frame . One of their commonest games is to take journeys to various places of which they have heard . They all get in . One child is conductor , another engineer , and the swing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time , while the conductor goes about taking up the tickets , announcing Chicago , tit . Louis , and other cities , as he goes along . After everyboy 's ticket has been collected , the engineer stops the train , and they all get out and collect more tickets from sonic near-by tree , when the train is again started with a different conductor and engineer , and is run to some other city . This game has been almost endlessly repeated and varied and the interest has held . In this way they have all learned the names of all the cities that any of the children knew , and they have also learned much about the running of a train . f am not sure that such a use for a garden swing would be developed in a playground , and I fear most directors would not allow the children to climb over the top of the framework , but . I believe it has been well worth while and that more has been got out of it than out of any other single piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children . The Hammock and Chair Swings . The hammock itself is a form of swing that comes the nearest , perhaps , to the primeval . The orang-outang builds his own hammock in // the tree top , and weaves the couch in which to die when shot . The hammock is found only in the infant department of the playgrounds , where baby hammocks are sometimes furnished for the little children . A number of these were installed in Seward Park in the first years , but it was soon discovered that the mothers would come over , put their babies in the hammocks , and go off and leave them for an hour or more at a time , with the result that the directors had a day nursery on their hands . Chair swings are much liked by children from three to six years of age . In any place where they are provided , they will generally be found filled , but the older children are apt to crowd into them and break them , or they are broken in putting them up and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but they require considerable care , as the children usually have to be put in and taken out . When a child gets into one of these comfortable chairs also , he likes to stay , and there are apt to be complaints from other children who wish to use them . The Wooden Framework. ? In the early days nearly all of the equipment was of wood . The present practice is to use steel almost altogether . This is in accordance with the general trend of development in other lines . A swing framework , when there are two big boys or girls in each swing , with each couple trying to swing as high as they can , is subject to great strain , and steel is none too strong . It is possible to make the wooden framework as strong in the beginning as it needs to be , but it soon rots away both on the top where the rain soaks into the timber and also just at the surface of the ground or a little below . Consequently , it may be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this may not appear at // all at the surface . However , if the swing frame is properly braced , it will not collapse , even though the uprights are rotted off ; at least , it will not do so at once and without warning . This rotting of the part in the ground can be largely prevented by setting the post in concrete about three and a half feet , which should also come at least half a foot above the surface of the ground . If this concrete is mixed with a small amount of alum or oil , l it will keep the water out and give stability to the framework at the same time . The posts may also be protected by creosoting the lower end of them or by dipping them in hot coal tar . However , these two met hods ( 10 not give the rigidity to the frame which is secured by concrete . Timbers , four by six , of Georgia pine are t he ones usually used . The crossbeam at the top is another weak spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water soaks into it and rots it , especially at the places where the bolts go through . Sometimes this is prevented to a considerable extent by rounding off the top beam or by covering it with tin . Perhaps the chief objection to the wooden framework , however , is that it is big and awkward . It is not nearly so graceful and sightly as the steel frame . It should always be kept painted , of course , if used , but in the long run it will not be found to be much cheaper than the steel frame , and the steel . // is to be recommended unless the whole arrangement is temporary . The Steel Framework . ? There is nothing difficult to understand about the steel framework . Ordinary gas pipe will serve perfectly well , and it can be screwed together by almost any one . Three-inch medium pipe with three and a half inch horizontals should be used , or two-inch uprights and two and . one half inch horizontals , if the extra heavy pipe is used . All pipe dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low swings , if they are well braced , but it would be well to use a half inch larger pipe for the high swings for big children . ( Spalding sizes . ) There is a general feeling that galvanized pipe should always be used , but there is no great choice between well-painted black pipe and the galvanized . The iron workers who build bridges , towers , and such structures , with the exception of windmill and electric light towers , use the black iron , which is first painted red to protect it from rust and afterwards black . Galvanized pipe is pretty sure to rust where there is any wear . In the ordinary gas pipe that is screwed together , the thread of the pipe cuts it about half in two and consequently reduces its strength by that much at the last thread . Spalding avoids this by using an unthreaded pipe and fastening the fitting with set screws . Medart uses an unthreaded pipe and fastens the fitting and the horizontal together with bolts . This requires two holes through the pipe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as the thread . The Spalding set screws tend to work out , and none of these arrangements are ideal . The Height of the Swing Frame . ? Children like the tall swing . Of course the taller the swing , the heavier the frameThe // work will have to be and the better it will need to be braced . This is true both because greater leverage and momentum are acquired by the high swing and because the tall swing will always attract the large children , while the low swing is likely to be left to the little children . The high swing is considerably more expensive also . My own feeling is for the low swing , in the main , because it does not take so much room , is not so dangerous , does not cost so much money , and is not to taken from the little children who are its rightful possessors by the big children who ought to be doing something else . The swings for the little children in most cases ought not to he more than eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bent of twelve to eighteen swings in a section , as this is cheaper , and they are ore easily controlled than where they are put up in separate ' ct.ions . The swings for the little children will re ( u i re about ree and a half feet for each swing . I should he inclined to it the height of swings for the older children to twelve or ourteen feet also . These will require about four feet to a wing . The Swing Fittings . ? The ordinary tees am I elbows for regular pipe can be obtained at any hardware store , hut . where all e apparatus is secured locally , a special fitting to attach the races to the pipe will have to be made . Spat ( ling has special ttings that hold the braces as well as connect the horizonal and vertical pipes , which may be purchased of him , even ough the pipe is purchased and the work done locally . ese fittings are expensive , but are now much cheaper an they were a few years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which holds the rope or chain . This likely to slip and slide , and as it has to bear all the strain , should grip like a vice . The hook also that holds the // chain or rope should be above reproach . If made of soft iron , it will wear through within less than a month in any muchused playground . It should be made of tempered steel that is both hard and tough . In the Spalding swing this friction is greatly reduced by having the swing work on ball bearings . I do not see any great advantage in having a swing run very easily , as the children tend to stay in too long anyway , and they do not get any exercise if the swing runs itself , but it is an advantage not to have the fittings wear out . Spalding will furnish the designs for the framework , if the fittings are purchased of him , so that local men can put it up . The Swing Rope or Chain . ? There are three mediums used to suspend the swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chains . The bar swing has been used extensively in England and Scotland , but very little in this country until lately ; just now it seems to be coming in . The new playgrounds in Philadelphia are equipped with bar swings that are very fine . The bars are about an inch in diameter . Everywhere the traditional method of supporting a swing is by a rope . It is not certain that we have yet discovered anything better . The chief danger in the playgrounds is that children may be struck with a swing . It is best to make the swing as light as possible , so as to reduce the momentum of the blow , though of course the chief factor in the momentum will be the weight of the child or children in the swing . The rope swing with the board seat is the lightest swing made . Most swings are hung with Manila rope . This is cheap , but it stretches out rapidly where it is exposed to the weather and may soon bring the board too near the ground or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs unevenly . The // children overcome this by tying knots in the rope , but this gives the swing an untidy appearance . If Manila rope is to be used , it should first be shrunk . I understand that the cordage of sailing vessels is made of hemp which does not stretch . If this is so , such rope should be used , if it can be secured , even if it does cost more . The chief difficulty with rope is that it will rot if left out of doors for a long time in all weathers ; moreover , there are likely to be rowdies in the neighborhood who think it a good joke to come in at night and cut a swing rope partially through , so that it w i l l break when exposed to strain . This happened repeatedly ice the early days of the parks , so that the park men who have their swings out in all weathers and under all conditions have come to use chains altogether . However , the swings in the South Park System are supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any system where , for any reason , the swings need to be taken down frequently , as is usually the case in unfenced playgrounds . A large variety of steel chains are in use , but the one t hat is coming to be generally chosen is the chain with links about one foot long ; each link is really a bar which connects by a looped end with the next bar in the chain.These bars flare In the middle and are about one half inch in diameter . There are several very decided advantages which these swing chains have . They are of galvanized steel and do not rust much . They will stand the weather . They do not stretch . They Can not be cut and do not need to be taken in to protect them from the elements . There are also disadvantages . The awing is too heavy , the link is not large enough to get a good grip on it , and it is too hot in summer and too cold in winter for comfort . These objections would be largely overcome if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put on the lower links . In a number of places , especially 4n school yards , I have seen a slender steel chain not unlike a/dog chain used . This chain is not strong enough or hard enough and soon breaks or wears through . Taking in the Swings . ? When an unfenced playground is adjacent to residences , it will probably be necessary to take in the swings each night and on Sunday , because they will attract undesirables who will make a disturbance at times when the neighbors have a right to be quiet . This has been the source of most of the adverse criticism of playgrounds throughout the country . Where swings with ball bearings and steel links are used , it is very difficult to take them in , and the practice is to lock them up with a short chain to the uprights . $ Where rope swings are used , they are usually hung from hooks and taken in at night . The bar swing also can be taken down . This , however , is a good deal of bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of the director 's time . The Swing Board . ? The swing board is the catapult that bowls over so many children if the swing is improperly placed . It should be as light and soft as possible for this reason . I am inclined to think that a steel board is a mistake for a number of reasons ; it is too hard , too hot in summer , too cold in winter , too rusty after rains , and always too heavy . In the early days in New York they used to nail a bit of rubber hose on each side of the swing seat , so that if a child were struck it would be by something soft . The best thing would be a pneumatic edge like a bicycle tire . The swing board should be only a little longer than the width of the child . It is tiresome to have to hold your arms ? // out horizontally at right angles to grasp the ropes , as is necessary where a small child is seated on a swing board that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attaching the rope to the swing seat : one is to run the ropes through the board and tie knots in them ; a second is to run the rope through the board and up on the other side to the limb of the tree ; and the third is to cut a notch in the swing board and place this over the rope . None of these methods is satisfactory in the playground , because they are all more or less dangerous . The knot is likely to come untied , the rope to slip out of the notch or to wear through where it is run under the board . The board also wabbles more or less with any of these attachments . The approved method is to have a clamp go around he board terminating with a stirrup strap and eyelet of steel in which the rope or chain is fastened . Height of the Swings from the Ground . ? The swings should be hung just high enough to keep the feet of the children m touching the ground . However , the children will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to clear e feet of all , it will be too high for the little people . The st that can be done will be to have swings for different ages th a medium height for each . This will probably mean , owever , as has been said , that the feet of some of the children a touch and in consequence that the earth will be ( lug out derneath in certain places . This hollow is likely to fill th water after rains , and as the children swing back and rth , they splash themselves and others . To prevent this , board or cement floor about three feet wide is often placed beneath the swings . The Swing Space . ? The swings for the most part belong to c little children and should be in their part of the playground , 8o Practical Conduct of Play every muscle in the body . It is excellent for the back muscles especially and for the heart and lungs . Turns at the Swing . ? In the beginning there are always many quarrels over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay there , but there are several other children who want to use it . This makes it seem all the more desirable to the one in possession , and the situation is likely to become acute if there is no one to adjust matters . Various methods to ease the strain have been used in different places . A very common method is for the director to appoint a monitor , who sees that each child stays so long and no longer in the swing . This usually means that each child may have ten swings of five minutes or something of the kind . In some places the teacher rings a bell every five minutes , and every one is required to change . I have often seen fifteen or twenty children standing in line for a swing , and sometimes these children were playing catch or something of the kind to while the time away . However , this always indicates a very congested playground , or a poorly conducted one where there is little going on . The games and other activities are more valuable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where the swings are empty and the games are full rather than vice versa . Full swings and no games is sure proof that the whole playground needs speeding up . The swing is a piece of nearly standard attractiveness against which the teacher has to compete in organizing the play . The teacher who can make the games more attractive than the swings is a success . In Conclusion . ? It would appear from what has been said that there are many physical and moral dangers connected with the swing , that nearly all of the criticisms of the playground // come from its use at night , that it is on the whole the costliest single piece of apparatus in most playgrounds . In return for this the swing offers a mild emotional stimulus and some good physical exercise , though certain children are always made seasick by it . One can but ask , " Is it worth the cost ? " The swing is a purely individual piece of apparat us . It does not require companions for its success . Everything indicates that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It always interferes with the play activities that are really more valuable . It makes it more difficult to get the children into the story period , into the ring game , into the folk ( lance , or any of the other activities . The swing creates no loyalty or friendship , no habit except selfishness . It does not belong in the playground at all . Yet it is one of the main advertisements of the playground to the children , and it is questionable whether the attendance of the children can be secured without it . The Slide . ? The slide is not like the sand , a natural and universal form of child play , inasmuch as a special piece of equipment is required for it , but the interest which the slide has come to satisfy is racially old . Otters and muskrats and elephants and I know not what other animals have slides of their own . It will be found in all of our cities that , wherever there is a smooth incline that is accessible , it is kept well polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a terrace or the banister of the house . Our modern slide seeks to satisfy better an old love . The Home-made Slide. ? All that is strictly needed for a slide Jo some smooth , inclined piece of wood or metal down which one can slip . In the early days , these slides were usually made by supporting planks in an inclined position and having a lad-
