I DING in Christmas weather from the arid gold-fields country of Western Australia eastward to the edge of the habitable places and somewhat beyond , we came at last to a rocky elevation from which the land fell sharply to a flat alkaline wilderness . From this desolate hill , for the moment appalled by what we saw , we looked off in the long , dry direction of the center of the continent ? those many of miles of still disreputable country , concerning which many confusing tales are told , these having variously to do with grass-lands and stony deserts , with wide , hopeless wastes of scrub and dust , with new domains of pastoral land , awaiting settlement , and with good-pastured stock - routes and waterless tracts of sand and spinnifex . Whatever quality these lands may at . last turn out to have , here , at any rate , four hundred miles from the fertile coastal reaches and well past the remotest desert mine , was the end of the Western Australian world . There were no habitations beyond : no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hill we had a glimpse of the very sorriest habitable Australian country . We faced a flaming wilderness ? a red prospect , splashed with the green of hardy scrub , its distances , where a sullen wind was stirring , lying in a haze of heat and crimson dust , nut of which the sky rose pallid , vaulting overhead high and hot and deepest blue . Behind us the lean trees ? the quick and the dead ? ran diminishing to the north and there vanished , discouraged . From the salt-land to the south they seemed to shrink aghast ? to huddle back upon themselves and deviate over the horizon in fright and haste . There was a vast salt-pan below , somewhat forward into the waste , stretching an ugly length farther than sight could carry from the crest of the hill , with straits , bays , bluff shores , meadows of white slime a chain of dry , incrusted lakes , most treacherous to cross , being in wide spaces coated thin above quagmires of salty mud , the shores a quicksand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low-lying , poisonous vapor . All this was of no very grave significance in relation to the whole . Presently it will be possible to land at Fremantle of Western Australia and pass by railroad to Sydney much as one might go from San Francisco to New York by way of New Orleans . But there is no overland trail going east and west through the central dry-lands ; nor ever was ? nor ever can be . These inimical lands , which now glowed red-hot beyond us , are a wide , effectual barrier , stretching from the middle southern shores , which are uninhabitable , far up toward the abundant tropical country in the north , which is hardly inhabited . No mild traveler could adventure far to the east of where we stood and for long endure the miseries of his journey-An expedition of proportions , outfitted with experienced precaution a seasoned leader with his camels and bushmen and black fellows ? could not advance through the center from Kalgoorlie and come safely to the nearest settlements of Sydney Side except by grace of those fortuitous chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Providence . Returning afoot from this depressing prospect to a new point of departure , we came soon to a shallow gully which I fancied we had nor penetrated on our devious course to the crest of the hill . And here our bushman ? himself regarding the feat as a meanest commonplace of the bush ? displayed a certain astonishing aptitude . Truly he was a very dirty white man , a monstrously lazy fellow ! Yet in a way most highly to commend him he was given to industrious reflection upon all the faint little traces of desert life he encountered as we went along . These absorbed him , occasionally , much as an interval of deep thinking sometimes abstracts a scholar from his company . He would interrupt himself to stare at some small space of earth ; and at the end of the pause , having achieved an inference to his satisfaction , he would abruptly resume his way and conversation . As I look back upon him listening again to his slow revelations ? it seems to me that he coveted bush lore inure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a price . " We did not come this way , " I maintained . " Ah , yes , " " he yawned . I insisted that this was not so . " Ah , well , " he drawled , eying me with amusement , " I see the tracks , right enough . " Now the ground hereabouts was of red earth mixed with gravel and outcroppings of ironstone which nearly matched its color . It was baked so hard that the press of a heel left no trace that I could descry ; and it gripped the stones so fast that to be dislodged they must be kicked out . It seemed that a man would leave no trace whatsoever of his passing . I returned a little upon our immediate tracks , looking for some sign of our passage of this path which I knew we had followed ; but though the search was both deliberate and diligent , it did not reveal to me the slightest indication that the ground had in any way been disturbed . Altogether baffled somewhat incredulous , too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had observed . And he pointed forward a matter of six paces . Yet after a period of painstaking observation I could distinguish nothing ; - nor could I find the sign until the bushman advanced in impatient disgust with my incapacity and put his finger on it . It was a dislodged pebble , no larger than a peach-stone , the measure of its disturbance in its mold being not more , I am sure , than an eighth of an inch . " Why , dod-blime me , " the bushman exploded , " I could follow this track on a gallop ! " Off he went , on a sort of a slow run , to make good this gigantic boast ; and make it good he did , sure enough ? corning now and again to a sharp standstill to indicate the whereabouts of an overturned stone or a broken twig of dead brushwood . The display of this sharp , sure sight , swiftly engaging its object , was a more amazing performance of the sort than I had ever hoped to behold . Presently he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our outward course halted to make a cigarette . When he pointed out the fresh-charred stub of a match it was of course obvious that one of our party had in that place begun ro smoke . But why I ? A few flakes of my peculiar tobacco , which I had not observed ? nor had 1 observed the stub of the match ? sufficiently disclosed my identity . It was evidence enough to hang a man . Yet it was nut a difficult inference . The bushman 's feat was this : that as he ran he had caught sight of the stub of the match and the flakes of tobacco . After that he paused once more to say that 1 had at that point " made a note in the little hook . I did not recall the circumstance . It was , at any rate , my custom to make jottings secretly . And , moreover , I had not walked with the bushman to the crest of the hill . He had been far ahead . How , then , should he be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little hook " ? My eyes could discover no indication of the fact . But it was no great mystery . Some scattered chips of cedar , which I had failed to detect , disclosed that a pencil had there been pointed . That the pencil had been employed was an inevitable inference . It was all so very obvious , indeed , that the presence of the cedar chips thereabouts should in the first instance have been instantly inferred from the bushman 's remarks . In all this , it will be noted , the inferences were easily drawn . Yet to infer immediately was something of an achievement . And to pick up these obscure indications in swiftly passing was an extraordinary triumph of observation . " These ' ere tracks , " said the bushman , as we resumed our way , " is all my tracks . " Among the evidences this man was following , the mark of a heel or toe would have been eloquent ? to say nothing of its prolixity ? as compared with what confronted him . But there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a dislodged stone and here and there a broken twig . It is obvious that a freshly disturbed stone indicates surely enough the track of a man in a land in which no considerable beasts can be imagined to have traversed . That it should discluse the identity of the passenger is quite as obviously out of the question . I was not aware that I was in the habit of disturbing the earth in a peculiar way . Nor could I conceive that the Artist was accustomed to set his foot on a twig in a fashion to betray him as the author of the fracture . Nor could I observe that in his progress the bushman himself dislodged the stones in a manner so singular that he could confidently recognize the work of his toe as his uwn . It was a mystery of the Australian bush . I made haste to solve it . " How do you know ? " I demanded . " 1 made ' em ! " he scoffed . " Think I are n't got sense enough to know my own tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the continent , one of the first explorers , being forced long ago to sum- mer in this selfsame latitude much as an Arctic explorer winters on his ground ? found far to the east of where we journeyed a shade temperature of 13e , which rose in the sun to 157 ? . The mean temperature for January , in that situation and exceptional season , was 104 ? in the shade . " The ground was thoroughly heated to a depth of three or four feet , " he records ; and the tremendous heat had parched all vegetation . Under its effects every screw in our boxes had been drawn . Horn han- dles and combs were split into fine laminae . The lead dropped out of our pencils . Our hair , as well as the sheep 's wool , ceased to grow , and our nails became brittle as glass . The flour lost more than eight per cent . of its original weight . We were obliged to bury our wax candles . We found it difficult to write or draw , so rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Truly a shriveled and terrible world to journey through ! It was now Christmas weather . We were not much more than a fortnight into January . It was , therefore , hot and dry . The land was at its worst . With a previous experience on the gold-fields as a basis of approximation we made sure that the temperature was reaching for izo ? in the shade and would triumphantly achieve it before the day was out . Yet life was far better than tolerable . Though the sun blistered ? blistered quick and sure and painfully as a mustard-plaster ? it did not strike any traveler down . Coming out through the Indian Ocean , we had been told of a young gentleman who had sacrificed his life in a supererogation of gallantry by raising his helmet in farewell to a lady at the wharves of Colombo . In the humid tropics fear of the sun is instinctive . But here in this dry open the sun showed no grave menace . And we were not oppressed . That day we drew breath with ease and satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weather , we were at least greatly amused . All at once a diminutive whirlwind took life under our very feet and went swishing and swirling to the east . " What 's that ? " cried the Artist , astounded . It might have been a partridge whirring to new cover . " A little willy-willy , " said the bushman . It was a singular phenomenon . Its force and activity were amazing ; and the noise it made ? the swish and hum and crackle of it ? astonished us no less . We watched its erratic course . Its outline was definite . Its path no man could guess . And it moved swiftly , only occasionally stopping in indecision to spin like a top . It darted , it swerved , it circled . Had it returned upon its tracks ? and there was no certainty that it would not immediately do so ? we should have taken to our heels ! It was so visible and small that , having short warning , we might have leaped aside and escaped . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fearsome violence ; it caught up the twigs , it scattered the pebbles , it tore at the scrub , it gathered a cloud of dust . When at last it vanished , a thick , red mist , high in the air , we laughed heartily at this comical little six-foot cyclone , as we were then disposed to regard it . Traveling subsequently in the midst of a host of these small winds , we had no laughter left . Precisely speaking , the willy-willies are those destructive cyclones which originate in the ocean to the north of the continent and , blowing to the southwest , fall heavily on the northerly Western Australian coast from December to March . Off Ninety-Mile Beach , near Broome , the pearl-fishers call them Cock-eyed Bobs . Five years ago two visitations of the willy-willies sent sixty luggers to the bottom and accounted for the disappearance of three hundred men and more . It is now the custom of the pearlers to lie discreetly in harbor during the willy-willy season . If , however , the great wills-willy , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east , as sometimes happens , it crosses the continent to the Great Australian Bight , on the south coast , and its course is marked by torrential rains . A fall of as much as twenty-nine and one-half inches has been recorded . All the dry-lands ? where , too , we traveled ? are in this way sometimes refreshed . Retreating westward , we were presently confronted from the trunk of a gnarled dead tree by a singular wayside sign-board . It announced the proximity of a public-house , three miles distant into the bush , and bade al wise travelers leave the road and seek entertainment for themselves and beasts in that direction , to live and let live being the true policy of the establishment . So quaint was the flavor of this , and so astonishingly out of the way was the situation of the inn , that we were at once enlisted to visit it . Having in lively expectation accomplished these slow miles , we were dashed to find the tavern-keeper absconded and his house closed by the sheriff and fallen into ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here was a rarelymysterious tavern , drearily alone and remote in this sand and scrub ? no halfway house , but the last dwelling of these parts ; and we wondered what manner of rascal had kept the place , what peculiar villainy he had practised , what strange variety of patronage he had drawn from the waste . No highwaymen were riding the country ? nor had ever ridden the country ? to stimulate the imagination concerning this forsaken inn . Its secrets were not those of a romantic rascality ? of nothing but the sordid villainy of foully robbing drunken travelers of their gold . Vile traps these are ? these lonely inns of the remote Australian back-blocks . On our way back to the trail we encountered a hairy , dusty , ragged fellow , pedaling a bicycle through the scrub , a swag on his back . He was all in a lather with the labor of his haste . Whether he was miner , prospector , cattle-man , or sundowner ( tramp ) , there was no telling . At any rate , he was riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fast going mad for it . It was " a case of the dry horrors " with him ( said he ) , and he was vastly disgruntled with our news that the tavern was closed up . Perking up , however , in our company , he seemed in no bad way , after all , and presently told us , as we went along , that some days before , traveling the edge of the " nigger country " to the north , he had fallen in with a roving bandof gins ( black women ) with whom he had enjoyed an astonishment which still kept him laughing . What these savage women were about , wandering the country without men , far from their tribe , he could not discover ; but as they were daubed with clay he concluded that they were mourning some death . What amused him was this : that as he rode near he was , to his dumfounded amazement , addressed in lackadaisical English by a young woman ( he vowed ) who was not only the dirtiest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob . " " Really , " she drawled , " do n't sot : find the weather rawther oppressive ? " At this the swagman blasphemed hi : surprise . " If you were to address me in French , ' said the young woman , with sweepinE dignity , " I should have no difficulty in comprehending you . " It turned out that this aboriginal maiden had , according to her story , been reared from childhood by a lady of Adelaide ; that she had reverted to the bush and was then with her tribe . Whether for good and all she did not know ; she might return to the lady some day ? to play the piano . And she tittered like a school-girl ( said the swagman ) ; and she CXXVIII. ? No. 764. - 27 ! chaffed and giggled and chattered in the most flirtatious manner of the settlements , not in the least perturbed , moreover , being now in the bush , by the shocking fact that she was in the garb of the bush . Now this was the swag-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no great reason to doubt it . It seems that aborigines of both sexes , employed in the towns ? the employment of aboriginal women is rigorously restricted by the government ? must periodically return to the bush . They remain content for a rime , sufficient servants , in some cases , if lazy . And then the inevitable interval : off they scamper , without warning , and they strip themselves of the last clogging connection with civilization , and cache t he i r garments against the time of return , a n d run wild to their satisfaction , r e - turning , by and by , as if they had not been absent ar all . Everywhere on th e edge of the wild lands tales are told like the swagman 's story of the tittering ward of the good lady of Adelaide ? told with scorn of this philanthropic endeavor . " Just beasts , " s a id t h e swagman . And he abandoned our slow course , being in haste , as he confessed , to case his pitiable state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day we rode into a wide reach of primeval bush which not even the wretched gatherers of sand lewood had combed for the dead branches of their meager living . From a rise of the land , slowly down and far away , it was like a jungle , ungle , a low , impenetrable tangle ; but it thinned , as we entered , into an open growth of slender , delicately lovely and diminutive trees , springing in blithe health from the sandy earth , many of them peculiar to the Australian world , like the kangaroo ? she-oaks ( said the bushman ) and gimlet-trees , salmon gum , mulga , tea-trees , thorny spinnifex , and succulent sage-bush . A stretch of dry , blazing days , intolerable to an American forest , had not in the least diminished the spirit of this hardy bush . Not a leaf was wilted , that we could see , nor did any branch droop . These pretty midgets were as fresh and clean and fat with their small nourishment as from the rain of an abundant yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of good health ? a curious variety of color , against the red and blue of the world , deepening from a tinge of gray to the darkest shade of green . Yet there were many gaunt dead , mingled with the quick , which seemed to have died of sheer old age : burly , gn a r l ed dwarfs , bleached white , so old that we ached to contemplate their length of days , striving in this mean desert land . In the thin shade of a salmon gum we rested for an hour with a bushman who had a but in the scrub on the edge of the salt-lands and was then trudging to a broken mining-town of the neighborhood for a sack of flour . He lived with the blacks ( said he ) ? a condition so degraded in Australia that few men challenge its obloquy ? and was even married with them according to their customs and his own , A red-bearded , vacant fellow in filthy tweed : he was a disgusting creature , without sensibility , thus fallen too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lay with the bestial savages in the inferno of sun and sand beyond the frontier . And these savage brothers ? there had been some bloody heathen ceremony of initiation to tribe and family ? he now cursed for mistrusting him . Brothers ? Ha , ha ! Brothers ? were they ? No fear ! They would tell a white man precious little ( he sneered ) of their mysteries . How much would a black fellow tell a white man about magic ? Huh ? Haw , haw ! And how about message-sticks ? How much would a black fellow tell a white Mail about message-sticks ? They 'd lie ? oh yes , they 'd lie ! And from all this we made out that our outcast was newly returned from a protracted visitation with his savages and was in the worst of humor with his welcome . " Our back , " he complained , sullenly , indicating the desolation to the east with a petulant sweep , " they got everything fixed . " " Who ? " " ' Who ? ' " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Specifically what ? " " It 's all fixed to keep the old men comfortable , " said he . " What 's right and what 's wrong , I mean . It 's mostly religion ? magic . I reckon their religion was made by old men . If I was an old man I 'd make one just like it if I could . Do n't you reckon that what 's right and what 's wrong depends on who has the power to say so ? I do . I 'm a Socialist . " Take grub . Grub 's a good example . Grub 's scarce with the black fellows , is n't it ? Well , the old men get the best of the grub . That 's law ? that 's religion . It 's one of the Ten Commandments . A young fellow ca n't eat a nice big snake . It would n't be religious . He 's got to take that snake to his father-in-law . Why ? Because a snake 's good . And there 's a while lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ca n't eat anything at all that 's nourishing and real fat and juicy . He ca n't eat a lizard . If he ate a lizard it would be just the same as crime , and that 's the same as sin , is n't it ? If they did n't catch him ? Oh , they 've got that fixed ! They teach the little shavers that if they eat lizards they 'll swell up and bust . And it works , too ? just about as well as the same sort of thing works with us . " You sec , they 've got their own notions of right and wrong . But their notions of right and wrong are not the same as our notions of right and wrong . And that 's queer . Why should n't they be ? " There was an interval through which the outcast bushman heavily pondered . " I wonder what is right , " said he , perplexed , " and what is wrong . " We left him in the thin shade of the salmon gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we inferred that he had been piously reared . In the heat of mid-afternoon we came to a broken mining-town . In its brief day of promise it had made a great noise in the Western Australian world . They had planned it large , with quick , leaping enthusiasm , in the Western Australian way ; and though it was here set far back into the desert , they would surely have made it large , with Australian vigor and determination to thrive big and powerful , had the earth yielded a good measure of its first encouragement . Its one street , up the broiling , deserted vista of which the bitter red dust was blowing , was wide enough for the traffic of any metropolis ; and the disintegrating skeleton of a magnificent boulevard , conceived with high courage in these dry-lands , implied a splendid vision of that lovely maturity to which the town had never attained . The town had lived fast and failed . It was now as pitiable as the wreck of any aspiration ? as any young promise which has broken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can endure to contemplate it . The people had vanished , taking their habitations with them , in the goldfields ' manner , to new fields of promise . They had not left much to mark the site of their brave ambition . A hot , listless group of corrugated - iron dwellings remained ? a public-house , too , and a spick-and-span police-station and a sad little graveyard . A fat landlady , performing the office of barmaid , resolutely interrupted our way to the public bar and bade us into the parlor , which was better suited ( she said ) to our quality . In this her concern was most anxious . It was apparent from her air of indulgent consideration that , perceiving us to be strangers , she had , with great good nature , made haste to rescue us from a breach of gentle behavior . It seems that , remote as this far country is from the usages of Home , one is still expected to choose one 's pot-house company with self-respect and decent precision . And a variety of opportunity is frequently afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor . No thirsty man need stray from his established station . Should he drop into company beneath him , he may blame himself ; and should he intrude among his betters , let him take the scowling consequences ! The parlor is , of course , the resort of unquestioned gentility ; but precisely what distinctions admit a patron to the qualified respectability of the inner bar , and what lack of quality banishes him to the outer , I could not by any means make our . The moral of it all , though it be derived from nothing better than a pot-house arrangement and the solicitude of a mining-town landlady , is broad ; the Australians still live astonishingly close to the caste traditions of Home . u r landlady was a rippling , genial body , flushed and smiling with intimate and honest hospitality , and did what she could to refresh us according to our temperate humor . This was not much . She had no ice ; no ice could survivethe red-hot journey to that town ; and as for the beverages of discretion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious habits . IIer parlor was darkened  - -  a grateful relief from the blistering agony of the white light of day ; and it was happily separated from the public room by nothing more than a stretch of bar and the small difference between a sixpence and shilling per glass of tipple , drawn from the same cask . Here we fell in amiable conversation with a casual miner whohad dropped in from some desperate little show ( mine ) of his fur the refreshment of a glass of lukewarm ale . He was not a parlor patron ; in appearance not at all of parlor quality , being frowsy , plastered and speckled with dried mud , a little the worse of life . From the public room he talked across to the shadows where we sat in rather embarrassed superiority , not used to these accepted distinctions ; and he ran on in a free , lively fashion , his accent and vernacular more nearly resembling those of an Englishman , it seemed , than they approached the cockney speech of the Australian back-blocks . " It is remarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for it . " Our mystification had to do with the men who perish of thirst . They strip themselves , poor wretches , in their desperate wanderings ; and stripped to the skin the trackers find them , stark naked , their hands bloody with digging , their eyes wide open a n d white , their tongues swollen clean out of their mouths . Nor are these deaths occasional . They are frequent . It is a dry land ? all these wilderness miles . No rivers water it . There are no oases . A rainfall vanishes like an illusion . Travelers beyond the tanks venture recklessly . They must chance the rainfall ; and failing the rare rains they must find water in soaks and gnamma-holes , or perish in their tracks , the soak being a basin scooped in the sand at the base of a granite rock , and the gnamma-hole a great cavity in the granite from which the last rain has not evaporated . And all the water is illusive : it fails or changes place being here and there , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctured water-bag is sentence of death . Many a man , lost alone , has died alone , cursing a thorn : convicts of the old days , escaping without hope over the desert to the settlements of South Australia , and prospectors of the days of the rush , pushing the search beyond the boundaries of caution . Travelers returning from the deserts ? the prospectors of these better-informed days ? casually report the skeletons . It is all true of the country we rode ? these worst Australian lands . " A chap got lost out here in the early days , " the miner went on . " Came out from home , you know , and struck an everlasting fortune at Kalgoorlie . Wild times , those days . My word ! I saw the Hand - to-  Mouth squandered . They sold that show to an English syndicate for L30,000 and dissipated every bally shilling before they quit . Everything free to everybody ; and every barmaid a harpy and every publican a leech . It did n't take long . And the ' Australia . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they paid . E1,200 for cablegrams ? experts ' reports and all that ? before the deal was closed in London ; and there was n't anything too good for the goldfields while the . ? 24,000 held out . But what should this chap I 'm telling you about do but fall in love with a musical barmaid and squander a fortune on her . Well , what should she do , when he 'd knocked down his cash , but raise the fantans and throw him over . And back he came to the gold-fields to get another fortune . No chance . What should he do then but take to the hush . Prospecting , you see . We waited a decent bit and tracked him . First thing they do , when they go mad , you know , is take off their boots . But we could n't find this chap 's boots . We found his hat , his jacket , trousers , shirt . When we found him he was stripped ? feet all cut to shreds and his boots in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was an inch of big black tongue sticking out of his mouth , poor old chap ! " It is a land no man should penetrate distantly and alone unless he has mastered the last subtleties of Australian hushcraft . A Canadian woodsman would find nothing in his experience to enlighten him . A North American Indian would perish of ignorance . A Bedouin of the sandy Arabian deserts would in any dire extremity die helpless . Australian hushcrafr is a craft peculiar to the Australian bush . It concerns itself less with killing the crawling desert life for food ? and schooling a disgusted stomach to entertain it ? than- with divining the whereabouts of water in a land which is to the alien vision as dry as a brick in the sun . A black tracker , said our bushman , once turned in contempt from the corpse of a man who had died of thirst . He had no pity ; he spat his abhorrence of the stupidity of this dead wretch .

But the worst may come to the worst ? there may he no " water trees , " or the roots may shrivel and dry up . " What then ? " CXXVIEL ? No. 764. - 28 " Ah , well , " said the bushman , " they do with what they have . " " What have they ? " " Ah , well , they lick the dew from the leaves and grass .

It indicates the desperate hardship of his life and discloses the quality of his cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologist , Baldwin Spencer , that , having come in a dry season to a dry clay-pan bordered with withered shrubs , his company was amazed by an exhibition of aboriginal craft which seems to have been beyond compare in any savage land . There was no water , there even was no moisture , within miles ; and the clay was baked so hard that to be penetrated at all it must be broken with a hatchet . A keen native guide presently discerned little tracks on the ground ? faintest indications of life , apparently , like obscure fossil traces ? and , having hacked into the clay to the depth of a foot , unearthed " a spherical little chamber , about three inches in diameter , in which lay a dirty yellow frog . " It was a water-holding frog ; and it was distended with its supply ? a store sufficient , perhaps , to enable it to survive a drought of a year and a half . And the water ( says the anthropologist ) was quite pure and fresh . If they are squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perishing travelers . " Find a nigger , " said our bushman , when , as we rode , we told him this tale , " and you 'll get water . " " What if the aborigine is obdurate ? " " Ah , well , if the nigger wo n't tell , " the bushman explained , " you rope him by the neck to your saddle . When he gets thirsty he 'll go to water right enough ! " In the back-blocks of central Western Australia , to the east of the few discouraged little government tanks of the goldfields country , and , indeed , in the dry-lands to the north and south of this , there are no fixed , fresh wells , generally dependable , as in the African and Arabian deserts ; and consequently there are no determined routes of travel , like the caravan routes of the Sahara ? no main-traveled roads from point to point . Nor is there any traveling back and forth . It is a wilderness . It would , however , be a rash traveler who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million square miles . The dry-lands which we rode in a midsummer drought indicate nothing at all of the quality of the tropical north ; nor do they any more hint at the forests and hills and green farms of the southwest than the Arizona wastes imply the rich corn-lands of Kansas . All the while , all Australia over , now more confidently than ever before , the settlements are pushing in from the coast , amazed to discover beneficent areas where deserts were expected ; pushing up from South Australia , down from the Northern Territory , doughtily westward from Queensland and New South Wales ; but here in this parched , blazing red country , baffled by the perilous and dry monotony of the land , they seem long ago to have stopped , dismayed , and never to have taken heart again . It is a vacant land ? the whole raw , wide state . Within a radius of fifteen miles from the capital city of Perth , in the fertile and established southwestern country , the population exceeds one hundred thousand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good city of Kalgoorlie is the center , approaches one hundred thousand ; so that what remains of the total population of three hundred thousand , subtracting the population of the old town of Albany on the south coast and the population of the thriving Geraldton district on the middle west coast ? roughly , a remainder of eighty-five thousand ? peoples what is left of the million square miles of territory . The little towns are scattered remotely . Wyndham , in the north , for example , with a population of one hundred and five , two thousand miles away , as one travels by camel and coach and sea ; and Hall 's Creek , where sixty-three whites are exiled in twenty-five hundred miles of distance and many weeks of time , happily and prosperously , no doubt , and in the good health of the open . Consequently land is cheap to the settler , cheap and wide . In the Kimberly and northwest divisions pastoral leases may be had of the year ; and in the central division , too , where we rode . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired of an old prospector . " Three shillings , " said he , " down in Eucla . " " An acre ? " " 0 Lord , no ! A thousand acres ! " " Any good ? " " Not to me , " he laughed . " I 'm a miner . " We came with regret to the last amazing day of this midsummer dry-lands riding . It was a waste place ? wide , parched , empty ? yet it charmed us , with its color and isolation and many singular aspects , as any desert will , and we wished we were riding east into the midst of it , where the savage life of the land is , rather than turning tamely to the dead town of Coolgardie . It was hot . It was still . Yet a hot wind blew in rare , bewildering gusts . The touch of dust burned like sparks of fire . We traveled an oven of the world . There was a coppery haze , as though the impalpable particles of the air were incandescent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aglow ? molten blue and green and red . In contact with the hot sand the air went mad . It seemed to he streaked and honeycombed . We fancied that we rode from areas of relief into streaming currents and still pockets of heat . Those extraordinary atmospheric conditions which break in cyclones were here operating multitudinously and in miniature to raise a host of little whirlwinds . It was an astounding spectacle , that blazing red expanse and its thousand little dusty tempests circling and darting far and near . They went whirling past , enveloping us , screaming under the feet of our discouraged beasts ; and far away , swirling and swelling in the last places we could see , they raised a dust like the smoke of a forest fire .
