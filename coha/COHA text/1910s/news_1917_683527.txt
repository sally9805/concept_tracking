txt Champ Clark , Speaker of the House of Representatives , backed down yesterday from his charge that New York bankers had conspired to hamper the Liberty Loan in order that they might force the Government to pay a higher rate of interest when it attempted the next war issue . Just why Mr. Clark changed his mind remained last night a matter of conjecture that gained added interest front the fact that his radical reversal of his own words came just three hours and six minutes after he had declared , in St. Louis , that he " had nothing to retract . " At 12 : 2S o'clock yesterday afternoon The Associated Press sent out the following news dispatch : ST . LOUIS , Mo. , Oct. ** Clark , Speaker of the House of Representatives , said today that his sthtement at Oklahoma City that New York financiers were thwarting the sale of Liberty bOlidd was quoted substantially correctly .

" When I t4ade that statement , " said the Speaker , " the papers were full of stories telling of the fact that the sale of Liberty bonds was lagging all over the country . When the first Liberty bonds were lz.sued some fellows in New York tried to beat the Price down below par . In view of that fact .

CLARK WITHDRAWS LOAN ' RING ' CHARGE // were two opinions last night as to why Mr. Clark had suddenly deemed it wise to admit that he knew of no such conspiracy as that which he had likened to machinations during the civil war which drove Government bonds far below par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that his original statement , made in Oklahoma City last Wednesday , was sensational and reckless and that so insistent was the storm of protest from bankers and bustness men in the East laden with demands that the Speaker either prove his charge or retrat it that he realized he would be compelled to lay his cards en the table and admit he had no proof . Straw for Propagandistr . Others thought that Mr. Clark 's evident determination early yesterday afternoon to stick by his guns , followed in a little over three hours by a reversal that almost was complete , indicated that the Administration , realizing possibilities of mischief in the original Clark statement , had brought pressure to bear to induce him to admit that he had spoken hastily and ill-advisedly . It had been recognized among Liberty Loan workers here that however absuri might be the charge , it was none the less probable that the " mouth-tomouth conspiracy " against the flotation ' a-ainst which Washington had warned , could desire no better material than a whispered " why not wait for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the big bankers are doing ? " The telegram sent by Chairman Strong of the local Federal Reserve Bank and of the Loan Committee in this district had not reached Mr. Clark when he made his retraction in St. Louis , a fact that lent added weight to the belief here that " headquarters " might have sent him word to undo his mischief as promptly as possible . Even in taking back what he had said , the Speaker insisted that " sonic fellows in Ntrw York tried to beat the price below par " when the first Liberty bonds were issued , and added that he did n't remember whether he said " a ring of New York men " or " a ring of New York financiers " when he made his statement four days ago . His Oklahoma City Charge . Mr. Clark 's original interview appeared in The Oklahoma City Times of Wednesday , Oct. 24 , and the substance of it was reprinted in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Thursday , Oct. 25 . As published in Oklahoma City , it read : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence the Second Liberty Loan campaign in such a manner as to make it a failure or partial failure and thus force up the rate of Interest on the next issue was the accusation made today by Champ Clark , Speaker of the National House of Representatives . Mr. Clark Is the figure around which today 's " Liberty Day " ceremonies revolve . Be is to speak at 8 o'clock tonight at tho City Auditorium and took part In the afternoon parade . Mr. Clark did not care to disclose the exact manner in which the ring of conspirators against the Government Is working , but he declared they are the spiritual " descendants " of a similar ring which during civil war times forced down Gove  --  nI ment bonds to forty and fifty . Ono day civil war bonds touched thirty-nine , through their manipulation , declared the Speaker . Mr. Clark declared that it is the duty of the United States to make the - Liberty Loan a success despite the New York traitors , but reiterated that unless the people of the nation respond Congress will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Put this down in your memory , " said the Speaker , " Congress is going to have money to carry on this war , to back up its boys in Europe . Congress had rather get this money through the Liberty Loan : It had rather give the people of the nation a bond in return for their money and pay them interest for its use . But if they do not subscribe to the loan , then Congress will be forced to increase taxes . It will put an SO per cent , tax on excess profits . Mark that : and it will pile the taxes on a lot of other things , too . " Sees No Evidence of Crime . No crime has been committed by Speaker Champ Clark in making the charge against New York bankers , in the opinion of Roger B. Wood , who formerly was in charge of criminal prosecutions for the New York Federal District Attorney . Mr. Wood expressed the opinion that the most that could be laid at the Speaker 's door was the utterance DI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were all utterers of such , where no criminal intent could be shown . The obvious absence of intent on Mr. Clark 's part to hurt the flotation of the bonds , Mr. Wood said , would render him safe from any Federal prosecution under the Espionage act , even in the unlikely event that it could be shown that he had deliberately made a false statement tending to injure further flotation of the bonds . Mr. Wood , interviewed before the Clark denial came over the wire , felt , however , that he should be called upon for proof of his charge or else for flat retraction . When it was suggested to him that propagandists might take advantage of Mr. Clark 's reported words to whisper about among the ignorant that it would be wiser to wait for higher interest , as the bankers were doing , than to invest in the present loan , Mr. Wood agreed that such use might be made of the statement attributed to the Speaker and urged that he be called upon " either to put up or shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was learned that the feeling in the prosecutor 's office was that the charges were so absurd as to require no refutation , and that action of the Liberty Loan Committee in calling upon Mr. Clark for retraction or proof amply met the case . Asked if , in view of the fact that a responsible citizen of national reputation had been said to charge the existence of such a conspiracy , he did not consider it his duty to ask that citizen to lay before the prosecuting authority whatever evidence he might possess , Mr. Gaffey refused to reply for quotation . It may be stated , however , that even before the Clark retraction lie was firm in his intention to do nothing . Persons familiar with the administration of the Federal criminal law , when asked what specific crime would be committed by bankers or others who might conspire to hamper the loan , said such a crime would he covered by Sections 3 and 4 of Title I. of the Espionage act , which reads : " Sec . S. Whoever , when the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States , or to promote the success of its enemies , and whoever , when the United States shall be at war , shall cause or wilfully attempt to cause insubordination , disloyalty , mutiny , or refusal of duty , in the military forces of the United States , to the injury of the service of the United States , shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years , or both . " Sec. 4 . If two or more persons conspire to violate the provisions of Sections 2 or 3 of this title , and one or more of such persons does any act to effect the object of the conspiracy , each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be punished as in said sections provided in the case of the doing of the act , the accomplishment of which is the object of such conspiracy .
