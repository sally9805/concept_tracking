One will look far for a choicer gift-book than " Boston , New and Old " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $7 50 net ) The drawings , by Lester G. Hornby , include all the fine old bits , as well as the new and imposing , and reveal that artistic sense which last year made his drawings of New York much more than a play of surfaces To Bostonians , his present work should bring delight , for , without in any-way disguising his subject , he has seized upon the things which residents of Boston like to think make it different from the rest of the world . Mr T. R.

Some who read this book will find themselves wondering- if the authors have sufficiently pondered Petrarch 's ejaculation , " Believe me , it requires no little confidence to promise help to the struggling , counsel to the doubtful , light to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary . These indeed are great things if they be accomplished ; trifles if they exist but in a promise . " Confidence is certainly not lacking here . Though Professor Clark has apparently had to modify his views in no inconsiderable measure since the first edition of this work was issued in 1901 , he has now no hesitation in uttering what , in its main content , may be regarded as his definite philosophy of Trusts . - It is a philosophy that will not pass unchallenged . And it may be said that our authors have , by their choice of terms , made it hard rather than easy for those who have honestly differed with them in the past to come round to their way of thinking . This work , indeed , has one grave defect- it is too often couched in the terms of the agitator . Invidious distinctions meet the eye at every turn . " Honest capital " and " honest labor " are everywhere in favor of the free competitive system . If the monopolistic power can not be taken away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When there is a large public to plunder , the gains are great . " It is assumed that the Trusts create their products with a maximum of economy , " but cheat the people out of their fair Share of the gains therefrom . This does , in fact , describe what within the short period of their existence they have done , and yet , if they should become secure monopolies , they would do something much worse . " Instances of such language could be multiplied indefinitely . If this book were put forth as a manual for those about to go on the hustings , it would serve the purpose admirably . It has , in fact , not a little resemblance-to the literature so constantly flooding the market in Great Britain in periods of political stress . Nothing could be more regrettable . . For if there is any one question in the mind of the people of the United States that calls for absolutely dispassionate discussion it is the question of the Trusts All this , however , does not alter the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten years ago Professor Clark entertained the notion that potential competition had shown its power to control prices . Whenever mills in a combination had raised their prices greatly , they had caused new mills to be built , and the fear of further cases- of this kind was holding prices within bounds But the limits thus established were not rigid , declare our authors , and the companies soon discovered ' their own power to crush audacious rivals when they appeared . They so often did this that their evident power to do it had its effect in advance and ' deterred competitors from appearing The potentiality of unfair attacks by the Trust tended to destroy the potentiality of competition . Under these conditions it was and is necessary to disarm the Trusts  --  to deprive them of the special weapons with Which they deal their unfair blows . The failure of potential competition accounts for the appearance of the work before us . Almost at the start we are forced to inquire if the writers of this book have properly correlated the Trusts with their times . Great prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consolidation . The period since 1891 , they add , has been anything but one of impoverishment , and it is no uncertain guess which assigns a reason . for this general prosperity . It has been due , in their judgment , to " production on a vast scale , carrying with it a corresponding increase of efficiency , and to improvement in productive methods . " We are led to infer that Professor Clark and Mr. John Maurice Clark rank the Trust as a cause of the great industrial prosperity of recent times . For they declare that we need more , better , and again better means of production if our growing population shall be kept above the level of ' want ; and then they add : " Now what has happened within a third of a century has been such a multiplying and improving of instruments of production , and , secondly , the utilizing of them on a vast scale . Big mills where little ones stood , and groups of big mills under one management , have added enormously to the productiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the minds of many the Trust is more distinctly an effect than a cause . That is , it did not come into existence for the purpose of initiating and moulding a new industrial development , but was forced into being to escape from the consequences of a rising tide of competition created by a new industrial development . From 1873 to 1898 was a period of falling prices . Sir Francis Webster has recently pointed out some of the reasons for this . There was an absence of great wars ; transportation . facilities were being increased and improved on an enormous scale ; goods , whether raw or manufactured , kept pouring into the market at a pace that baffled previous experience . One crop came on top of another before it could be absorbed . The glut was universal . Then followed a period of unproductive consumption of wealth . Capital was destroyed in prodigious amounts by war and armaments . The world 's consumption from these and other causes gradually overtook the years of plenty before 1900 . To quote Sir Francis Webster , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases on actually , smaller stocks , and more from hand-to-mouth , than at any time in the experience of a generation . During the years of plenty and low prices , which were often years of small profits , the incentive for new capital to enter into competition with old was reduced , even though the new capital could take advantage of all the latest improvements in the arts . About fifteen years ago began an astonishing era of industrial combinations , the purpose being chiefly one of self-preservation . Opportunely , just as industry was forced to such expedients , a reign of militarism set in , which , combined with other forms of unproductive consumption the world over , turned glut into scarcity , and opened the way for enormous profits , not only for capital already invested in production , but also for huge amounts of new capital . In view of these well-recollected facts , there seems to be scant warrant for the assertion that great general prosperity has come " under a regime of consolidation . " The most that can , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well to dwell on this point , because , as unprofitable years made the Trusts , it is barely possible that eventually they may unmake the Trusts . Certainly , there would be hope of this under free competition . But free competition has been lost , declare the authors of the present work , and can only be regained through legislation . It must be admitted that they have much to say for this contention . A Trust can follow a newcomer into its field and undersell it , while keeping up prices everywhere else in its own field ; it may boycott merchants who do not comply with its regulations ; and it may discriminate in other ways to the destruction of free competition . Whether the alleged practices of the Trust could be employed successfully to the end of time is at least debatable . But the world of affairs is not very much concerned with remote contingencies . The capitalists that desire to compete with the big corporations in the present , and the public that desires to profit from such competition , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . How shall they do it ? We find here an interesting chapter on how not to do it . Among the inadvisable measures are government ownership of industrialplants and indiscriminate tariff legislation . The constructive programme of Professor Clark and his collaborator is not simple . Incidentally , these reformers disclaim any desire to dogmatize as to the legal methods by which their aims should be brought about . Many- of their readers will be likely to regard this as a fatal weakness in their book . If they are able to show us a sure path out of the present situation , their guidance will be welcomed ; if they are not able , their work is of no more practical value than many another 's . The first thing demanded here is that our control over transportation shall be so developed as to prevent all favoritism of the kind that leads , or may lead , to giving the favored shipper a monopoly . Next , we must have an administrative commission , like the Interstate Commerce Commission , to deal with the kpecific and general provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities must be protected ; predatory competition and misuse of patents must be prevented ; combinations must not be allowed to attain a size that will preclude competition , and if they-do they must be broken up . The central feature of the programme here coed lined , and the feature which our authors are quick to recognize as the one most visionary , is the control of methods of marketing , and the enforced selling at one price publicly advertised . The reader will begin this book with more assurance than he will possess at the close . Almost the first words that will strike his eye are these : - The purpose of the work is entirely constructive , since it advocates a positive policy for controlling Trusts It aims to show that certain measures having this end in view are in harmony with modern tendencies and are well within the power of the legislator and the executive official , and that they give promise of ensuring what the public needs , namely , protection against abnormal prices , continued increase in production , and improvement in conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader , but as he goes on to the end he finds himself less sanguine . He may even find himself asking if the remedy is not worse than the complaint . This able treatise has not simplified the Trust problem . it has , it anything , made it seem more difficult than before .
