 | THROUGH the courtesy of the Speaker , I sat in the front row of the Distinguished Strangers ' Gallery yesterday afternoon April 4 and for more than an hour listened to Mr. McKenna 's speech on the Budget . The speech was not intended for home consumption by constituents or newspapers one thousand miles or more away , but was addressed to the audience surrounding the speaker , in a comparatively small room ? which is the House of Commons . The audience was very keen to hear what the speaker had to say , and the speaker was equally keen to gain the attention and sympathy of his audience ; and he promptly did both . Within ten minutes from the time he rose every bench was crowded ? about four hundred thus gaining seats . Many were standing at the gangway , and nearly a hundred Members were in the Members ' Gallery . The Peers ' Gallery was crowded . The Ambassadors ' Gallery was empty . The Ladies ' Gallery , the Strangers ' Gallery , and the Public Gallery were completely filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a directors ' meeting of a colossal corporation , at which the officer corresponding to the vice-president in charge of finances was telling the directors how the corporation stood financially , what it had done during the past year , and what it expected to do during the next year . There was no attempt at oratory , but just a plain business discussion . The speaker never lacked for a word , had none of the hesitation so frequent among speakers in the House of Commons ; he had his subject thoroughly in hand , and he made a luminous exposition of it . Within a few minutes after he began he and his audience were in complete accord . There were a good many " Oh ! oh ! oh 's I " when he told them that he proposed an income tax of twenty-five per cent , a tax on railway tickets , and a tax on matches ; but they were not disagreeable " Oh 's ! " and there was much laughter and good-natured chaff when he told them about his proposed tax on mineral waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear , hear 's ! " when he proposed a tax on cinemas ( moving-picture performances ) , which he expected to yield $25,000,000 . The House gave him its closest attention . There was no talking or shuffling of feet or moving about ; and except at the moments of laughter , approval , good-natured chaff , and occasional utterances of doubt expressed  | by " Oh ! oh 's ! " the silence was so complete that , although the speaker spoke in an ordinary tone , every word penetrated to the farthest point in the galleries . They were certainly colossal figures which he used . This is about twelve per cent of the national wealth of the United Kingdom and its dominions and colonies ; about equal to their total income for six years , and to their savings available for investment for thirteen years . Only three per cent of the debt is held abroad . and the amount so held is less than half of one per cent of the total wealth . But , while the debt will have increased about fourfold during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from taxation has also correspondingly increased : The increase in taxes for the coming year , as compared with the year just ended , is $861,000,000 ? almost as great as the entire ' taxation three years ago . Well may Mr. McKenna point out with justifiable pride that the increased revenue from taxation in the coming year , as compared with the year before the war , will be $1,554,000,000 , while the poor German Chancellor , Dr. Helfferich , can find only an extra $120,000,000 ? about one-twelfth of the increased revenue of Great Britain ? and even that is doubtful . It will be noticed that the revenue for 1916-17 exceeds the revenue for 1913-14 by $1,554,000,000 . It is interesting to note how these increased taxes have been raised . It is shown in the following statement . The figures for 1913-14 are not available as I write , but the official figures for the three subsequent years as given in the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer are before me : These figures show that the increased taxation comes from three principal sources : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was before the war ; the excess profits duty , which , although levied last year , has not as yet become payable to any considerable extent , and is thus practically a new source of revenue for 1916-17 , and from which nearly one-half of the increase of the present year , as compared with the past year , was derived ; and customs ' and excise , which includes duties levied on imports and practically all internal revenue . The excess profits duty was raised from 50 per cent to 60 per cent , and , as this has to be added to the income tax , the result is that of every $100 made in war profits $77 goes to the Government and only $23 is retained by the owner . In foods the duty on sugar was raised one cent per pound , and it is estimated that this will bring in $35,000,000 . On cocoa the duty was increased from three cents to twelve cents per pound , and on coffee and chicory from six cents to twelve cents per pound , these two items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On motor cars the tax is doubled up to 16 horse-power , and trebled above that , so that a 60 horse-power car will have to pay $630 a year . The total revenue from motor cars and motor cycles is estimated at about $4,000,000 , of which one-half is increase . As the streets of London are filled with placards asking people to economize in their daily expenses , and particularly to stop using motor cars , the gasoline for which must all  | come from abroad , thus injuriously affecting the foreign exchange situation , it would seem probable that this tax is levied more in the hope of prohibiting the use of motors than of providing any considerable revenue . The entirely new taxes are on places- of amusement , railway tickets , matches , and mineral waters . A tax is to be levied varying from one-eighth to one-quarter of the price of a theater ticket . Mr. McKenna estimated the revenue from this source at $25,000,000 , and , as the average duty is about one-sixth of the tax , this would indicate gross receipts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States a few months ago indicated gross receipts from " movie " theaters of about $400,000,000 , or approximately about $4 per capita . Mr. McKenna 's figures indicate about $3.50 per capita in the United Kingdom . On railway tickets all single fares less than 1s. 6d. are not taxed ; above that sum the tax begins at two cents , or one-ninth , and rises to six cents on a ticket of twenty-five cents , and two cents for every twenty-five cents additional . Mr. McKenna stated that he proposed this tax with some reluctance . It would produce only $15,000,000 in a total revenue of $2,545,000,000 , or about sixtenths of one per cent of the entire revenue . It would seem as if a good deal of a nuisance would thus be created for a very small return . This is almost the only part of the Budget upon which there has been any serious criticism . It is intimated in several of the morning papers that this item may be withdrawn . A new tax is also proposed on matches , amounting to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoker 's match ? are sold at one cent a box containing seventy matches , which would be about fourteen cents per thousand matches , and as the tax is to average eight cents per thousand matches , this tax , which Mr. McKenna said ought " to bring in as much as $10,000,000 , " is at the rate of nearly 60 per cent . At this point of Mr. McKenna 's speech there was good-natured chaff from all over the House about burning his fingers . The tax will bear with great hardship upon poor people , and will probably give rise to a good deal of discussion . Finally , a tax is proposed of eight cents a gallon " on table waters prepared with sugar or fermented " and six cents a gallon on all f others . Cider and perry will bear the same charge of eight cents per gallon . Soft drinks are thus expected to contribute $10,000,000 per annum . The principles underlying the incidence of taxes to provide this phenomenal revenue of more than $2,500,000,000 in the midst of the greatest war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only for the United Kingdom , but for us in America ; for it is quite among the possibilities that at no distant day we may have to devise a revenue of almost equal magnitude . In general , it would appear as if , following the trend of legislation in recent years on both sides of the Atlantic , an effort has been made to saddle the expense of the war on the rich or well-to-do and let the laboring man go almost scot-free . The income tax , the estate duties ( inheritance tax ) , the tax on bank checks , negotiable instruments , and other taxes paid by stamps , and the excess profits duty , all fall upon the comparatively wealthy ; and of the new taxes those on matches and moving-picture performances , sugar , cocoa , and soft drinks , are about all that affect the laboring man ; and all of these amount only to about $80.000,000 , or a little over three per cent of the total . It so happens that the laboring man is at the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before has he received such wages as he receives now . There are placards begging him to invest his money in Government funds , but , instead of doing this , he is rather inclined to squander a good part of what to him is sudden wealth . Whether the pendulum which has been swinging so long in the direction of the laboring man is to take a different direction as a result of this war is a subject much too large to be entered upon here . How has John Bull taken this stupendous Budget ? Like " Tommy " in the trenches , where he calls Ypres " Wy-pers , " the big guns of the Germans " Jack Johnsons , " and his own particular gun " Mother , " and where his elastic spirits and good temper never fail under the most distressing circumstances , so here in the City and in the West End John Bull has taken this Budget , which is the heaviest blow to his pocket he has ever received , as if it were all in the day 's work , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with " right-o ! " The " Times " is no longer the Thunderer , but it is still a Thunderer ; and , at all events , all  | the Thunderer that remains under modern conditions ; and the comment in the Times this morning says editorially that the Budget " can only be regarded with justifiable pride by all who have the maintenance of British credit at heart . " In its news columns the headline is " Model Budget Speech , " and in his report of the speech the writer says " The House did not fail to appreciate the significance of Mr. McKenna 's closing figures , and they were more enthusiastically applauded than anything else in his speech . " The speech and the comments upon it in different parts of the paper filled more than twelve columns , or the equivalent of two pages . There were arguments as to the wisdom or unwisdom of the tax on railway tickets , on matches , and on some other items , but as to the enormous figures there was no sign of grumbling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , with the exception of the " Morning Post " and the Daily Telegraph . " These are the advocates of the new theory of Protection , which . in their view , ought to supplant the principles of Free Trade , which have been the basis of Great Britain 's development for nearly a century ; and these papers think that a great opportunity was missed for introducing the protective principle . But even these papers make no cl iticism of the size of the figures and the amount of money to be raised . The headlines are of the most cheerful character , such as : " John Bull 's Purse ; " " Well Able to Stand the New Taxes ; " " No Serious Criticism of the Budget ; " ' Cheerful Taxpayers ; " " Harder Hit but Still Happy ; " " Strength of British Finance , " and so on . Of course there is much serious thinking about the hereafter , when interest and sinking fund , which at the close of the present fiscal year will amount to upward of $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid . If this vast amount of money had to come out of the United Kingdom alone , which has no undeveloped resources , it would indeed be a serious matter ; but the strength of British finance lies in the dominions and colonies ? Canada , Australia , and various parts of Africa , where there is still virgin land capable of supporting at the very least five hundred million people . It is as certain as anything in the future that there can be but one end to this titantic struggle , viz. , the complete and overwhelming victory of the Allies . One result of this will be the annihilation of the German colonial system ; another result will be some form of consolidation or federation of Great Britain and her great dominions . This will be the great question for Englishmen after the war . It has been under discussion for almost an entire generation , during which the Imperial bond between the British Isles and their dominions in the four quarters of the globe has every year been growing stronger and stronger . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been impossible to surmount ? these difficulties . But the splendid response made by the men of English race in Canada , Australia , and Africa to the mother country in its hour of need has brought about a condition of affectionate sympathy and mutual good will , and has at the same time shown the absolute necessity of some such form of confederation , so that when the war is over these difficulties will no longer be insurmountable . With their hard , practical sense , and the experience of a thousand years in finding practical solutions of difficult political problems , this problem will also be solved . In a word . this Budget speech reveals the unparalleled financial strength of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , and the British Dominions Beyond the Seas . " It is a mistake to suppose , as some bankers do , that wars are decided by financial considerations . Wars are decided by the hard blows struck by soldiers in the field and sailors on the high seas . We won our Revolution , although we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The South continued to fight in the Civil War for nearly two years after it had become bankrupt . Turkey has been virtually bankrupt for nearly a hundred years , and has been making wars , sometimes successful and sometimes unsuccessful , during about one year in four of that period . On the other hand , it is equally a mistake to underestimate the influence of financial solvency upon the issue of a great war . Success in battle , on the land or on the sea , is the element of first importance , but financial credit is a close second . This record-breaking Budget was given forth on the same day that the German Chancellor made his feebly boastful speech in the Reichstag . No unprejudiced person can study these two documents without reaching the conclusion that in the matter of finances Germany is to Great Britain as a pygmy to a giant .
