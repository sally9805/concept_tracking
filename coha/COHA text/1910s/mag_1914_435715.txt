DURING the last few years , the attention of readers has frequently been called to the life of the college professor , his work , his hardships , and his compensation ? or rather his lack of compensation . But , seemingly , all the information which has been offered on the subject has been concerned with the professor in the larger university , and only passing attention has been given to the teacher in the small college . And yet there are in the United States about ten thousand men and women who are teaching in colleges that enroll less than five hundred students each . These men are popularly , and perhaps correctly , classed as professors ' along with their brothers in the more exalted positions . There is not so much distinction here between professors , " assistant professors , ' and instructors , ' for there is frequently only one man teaching each subject , and , in a surprisingly large number of cases , two or three subjects will be taught by the same man . To a far greater extent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our civilization , and their own peculiar struggles and aspirations form a unique chapter in contemporary history . Following a strong natural bent , I have joined this army of educators and I consider myself , at present , a fairly typical specimen . There are a wife and baby to share my life , and give me an added incentive to do good work . I hold a master 's degree from one of 608 America 's leading universities and am planning to take the degree of Doctor of Philosophy as soon as possible . This is the usual state of affairs with the professor in the small college , as those who already hold doctor 's degrees are comparatively rare . I do not hesitate to say that I am successful in my teaching . My students are enthusiastic , the work they do compares very favorably with that done at much larger schools , and there are many other things which indicate that I have at least average ability and success . The great scholar under whom I took the greater part of my post-graduate work said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going ahead by leaps and bounds as you are . ' Being a natural teacher , I enjoy my work as I suppose few men ever enjoy their work , and altogether my life is happier and gayer than that of most of my fellow teachers . I am teaching in a state that borders on the Atlantic , in a fine old school that for over seventy-five years has been sending out graduates who afterwards have become senators , governors , judges , ministers , and leading men in industries and professions . This school ranks high among the educational institutions of the state and , even financially , is fairly successful as schools go . The salary which I yearly receive is twelve hundred dollars , or rather I receive eleven hundred dollars and my house is furnished free ; this is a very good house and it would probably cost me much more than a hundred dollars a year if I had to pay rent . It will be A PROFESSOR IN readily understood that this salary is equivalent to almost twice as much at a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , in the midst of a rich agricultural section , and we know nothing of the great expense of life in a city or the great cost of social duties which are necessarily attached to the life of a university man . While there are a few small colleges that pay better salaries than this , there are others ? and many others ? that pay much less . Altogether , my lot is as good as or better than that of the average college professor , and I feel justified in saying that the lines have fallen unto me in pleasant places . I was never a very good accountant , and it is next to impossible to make my accounts balance . Usually at the end of a month , there is a slight deficit , which may amount to as much as a dollar or two . I know that there are economic specialists who can keep accounts for years and show where every penny has gone ; some of these are also very efficient in the art of living cheaply , and are inclined to censure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I have noticed that those who are so expert in this way are , as a rule , not extraordinarily good teachers . I can not conceive how a teacher , so sufficiently wrapped up in his work as to arouse the proper amount of enthusiasm in his students , can always remember to set down the two cents Which he spent for a postage stamp or the quarter which he paid for some collars when he forgot to send off his laundry ? only , of course , the man of this type would not have forgotten to send off his laundry . The average college professor can not keep accounts as accurately as this , but is sometimes absent-minded ; not extremely so , but just about as much so as any other ordinary individual . VOL.114-NO. 5 // II Without attempting to give an exact account of the way we use our income , I can give one that so nearly approximates it that it will serve our purpose very satisfactorily . Aside from my regular work , I teach in a summer school , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to meet the expenses of the summer . Therefore we can count out the summer months and discuss only the expenses of the school year , which is about ten months long . The following table will show the disposition which we make of the greater part of the salary : It will appear from the above table , that , counting the fifty dollars for life insurance , I make about two hundred and fifty dollars above expenses each year . But it will quickly be seen that there are many calls for money which are not taken into account in the table : these are the occasional expenses which fall under no special heading . I do most of my typing , but occasionally I am so rushed that I must hire somebody to do a little of it , and a few dollars leak out in this way ; a new typewriter ribbon or some repairs on my machine take their mite ; unless I neglect my teaching it is impossible to split all my kindling and take care of the yard , so I must occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; my wife can not always do all her work and sometimes a colored woman comes in and helps 610 A PROFESSOR IN A SMALL COLLEGE her wash or scrubs the floor for her ; the baby needs a carriage or at least a new toy , and , in fact , almost every day sees a draft made on the long-suffering and rapidly diminishing two hundred dollars . When I count up , I wonder that we succeed in getting through even , which is about all we can do . I frankly admit that I could economize on some of the above items . I could spend less for books and magazines , for example , and I know some teachers do this . This may be justifiable in some lines , but to teach the subjects which I am teaching , and teach them right , it is necessary to do a great amount of reading and keep up with the times . And laying aside the question of what he ought to do , the teacher wants to keep up so badly that he will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure these books and magazines . Sixty dollars is little enough when there is no city library accessible and there is a dearth of such material in the library of the college . The textbooks alone which I use in my classes this year cost over thirty dollars , and the texts are comparatively insignificant . I grow sick with longing when I read the advertisements of books and journals which I should have . I keep lists and catalogues of these publications and occasionally read them over , just for the torturing pleasure of thinking how delightful it would be if I could afford them . I never take any journals that are taken by the library , I never buy any that I can borrow , and I work every scheme of which I can think to gain access to as many as possible , spending every cent that I can afford for some of the best that are most closely related to my work . But how many there arc that I ought to have and can not get ! There is the Eugenic Review , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma Mater as well- informed , efficient , enthusiastic citizens , I ought by all means to have access to this magazine . Then there is the Harvard Theological Review ; sometimes I finger the announcements concerning this journal with much the same fondness that a small boy has when he fondles his painted bow and arrow , and longs to get out into the deep cool woods . Some of my students will be preachers and I could do much better work by them if I only had this publication ; and of perhaps equal importance is the theological journal issued by the University of Chicago Press . Then there are the Psychological Bulletin , Mind , the British Journal of Psychology , the Journal of Race Development , the Journal of Animal Behavior , the ? but why name them ? There are at least fifteen or twenty such , costing from two to five dollars each , which I could use to great advantage , both to myself and my students ; but they are hopelessly beyond my reach . And books ! Here I become sick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Eskimo , Ellen Key 's writings , some of Bergson 's works ; Pfister , of Germany , has written a new hook on Freudian psychology , Die psychoanalytische Methode , which , from its descriptions and commendations , most be the best thing in this line that has ever been written ; there is a book , just off the press , that gives the life of G. Stanley Hall , and my relations to him have been such that I can hardly be resigned to do without this book . I should have no trouble whatever in spending an additional hundred dollars for seemingly necessary books . A number of my students will enter universities to take up graduate work next year , and I would 1 ike to give them at least a speaking acquaintance with some of these recent books before they go . What would it not mean to the:1111'i could give them the gist of these books A PROFESSOR IN while we walked round the campus or sat in an informal visit ? which , after all , is by far the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my students , I need these books for my own personal good . I need them in order that I may remain fresh and keep on growing , and escape the danger of mental ossification . Ii will be noticed that I make no mention of any books that are not closely connected with my work . This is not because I do not like other books , for I am passionately fond of poetry and good fiction , but I can not afford to invest in any books for pleasure or because of the binding of the book . This year , I have been especially fortunate with my books . I made a sort of bargain by which fifty dollars of the hundred that I yearly give to church and educational matters might be given to the college library in the form of books . Of course , I secured the use of the ones that I put in the library , and that was just as good as if I had bought them for myself . That is , I secured as much objective good from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pleasure from the act of owning a book myself that is lacking when I read one that does not belong to me . Altogether , I hardly see how I can spend less than sixty dollars yearly for hooks and magazines . // attired as a professor 's wife . ' There are probably some who could dress more cheaply , but , as I said above , I specialize in teaching and not in being an economic expert . It is really funny , sometimes , when I think of the way I manage my clothes . Only a few days ago , one of the other professors apologized to me for the am pearance of the suit he was wearing ( he was having troubles , too , poor man ) , and intimated that my clothing looked very neat and new . Well , at that particular time , I did have on the best suit I own , but I have worn it three winters , and there was a hole at the bottom of one trouser-leg , which , however , did not show very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me say , just here , that she is very efficient in darning and cleaning my clothes . I wonder how many of the readers know that men 's clothing can be washed ? Last winter my wife fished an old suit of mine out of the rags and decided to see what she could do with it . I had worn this suit in a chemical laboratory for a year and the acid had eaten it full of holes . I had caught the coat on a barbed-wire fence and torn it badly , and I had spilled some paint on it . She washed this suit in a tub with warm water and Ivory soap , dried it , darned the many , many holes with ravelings from the raw edges , pressed it nicely and I put it on and wore it ? and everybody admired my new suit . This was a thin summer suit she had washed , but it turned out so successfully that she tried her hand at a heavy old black suit which I had thrown away because it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear out . This she washed with as much success as the other , and when she had put new lining in the sleeves it was a very respectable suit . She has washed them again this year , and they seem to look about as well as ever , and I laughingly 612 A PROFESSOR IN A SMALL COLLEGE tell her that I shall he wearing one of those coats when I receive my doctor 's degree ? that far-distant mystic event toward which we both look with much the same feeling that we have when we speak of the time when ' our ship will come in . ' There are many little tricks that a ' professor ' employs ? at least I do . I wear low-cuts , ' or slippers , the year round and explain that I like them better than high shoes , which is strictly true ; but the real reason is that a pair of shoes will last me longer than six months , and I wear them until they are entirely worn out before buying a new pair . Therefore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds begin to blow and , instead of buying a new pair of high shoes , I buy gaiters . They cost only fifty cents a pair , and one pair will last me two years . And I never have a strictly dress shoe , but always buy shoes that will serve for school and street wear after they are too worn for ' best ' functions . I own no dress-suit and never wear one . As long as I am associating with ' professors ' 1 am safe , for few of them own dress-suits and , even if they do , they understand . I should greatly enjoy attending functions where suits of this kind are in demand , and my natural social instincts would make me at home there , but I am one of the many efficient , well-educated , up-to-date teachers who never appear at such places ? and for a reason . Even in the matter of hair-cuts and shaves , I have learned to economize , and I usually let my hair grow very long before having it cut and thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get into the chair ( a guilty conscience will always force one to make some explanation ) that I used to play football ? which I did ? and that I still wear my hair long ? which I do ? but again there is a rea son . Fortunately , I look fairly well with long hair and I have become somewhat proficient in trimming my neck and temples with the razor . lam something of an expert with a razor , and during the last three years I have been shaved by a barber only once . I speak of this as a kind of record whenever the subject comes up , and show that I am proud of it , but still there would have been no such record if it did not cost money to be shaved by barbers . The ordinary man , who detests shaving himself as much as I do , and who also enjoys the luxury of a good shave by a barber as well as I do , will know something of what this means . I received fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and I celebrated by getting a shave . Do not think that I am the only man in intellectual work who goes to such an extreme . I know a man who took a doctor 's degree in philosophy last spring from one of America 's leading universities , who acknowledged in a private conversation ? a very private conversation ? that he had never been shaved by a barber and had never eaten a meal in a restaurant . I do not stand alone in my wearing of fixed over and antedated clothes . My wife has worn the same hat and the same coat for four winters and yet , some way , she manages to look neat and well dressed . This year she did shrink from going to formal affairs and managed to wear a becoming little wool cap most of the time . Sometimes 1 imagine how splendid it would be if I could afford to get her some furs and elaborate gowns , but all such unnecessary and luxurious things as furs and Paris gowns are hopelessly tabooed . Of course she could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she rightly prefers a few simple dresses and suits of really good quality . Oh , well , sometime maybe I can afford // to get her some furs and things ? after I get my doctor 's degree or our ship comes in . It has already been noticed that we keep no servants , and yet it is a physical impossibility for my wife to do all her housework and take care of the baby . We have wrestled with this problem in different ways at different times during the last few years . I have had considerable training in dishwashing , sweeping , caring for the baby , and even cooking , especially when my wife was not well . Just now we are solving it in a fairly satisfactory way by taking our meals out . We board at one of the regular college boarding-houses and ? how she does it I do not know ? the landlady gives us very good board for two dollars and a half a week . When she is relieved of the cooking , my wife manages to do practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing . We could certainly not board at home as cheaply as this , especially when one considers the extra servant hire and the extra fuel that it would necessitate . And again , let no one think that I am alone in helping my wife with her work . I could name a rather long list of college professors of my own acquaintance who give much of their valuable time to helping with the housework . Household expenses are deceitful , as one is always thinking that they are over for a while , and yet they are always cropping up . This year we had to buy some book-shelves and stoves and a few window-blinds and curtains . We then had a feeling of relief as if we were settled , but on stopping to think , we saw where we shall have to expend about as much for such items next year . We need a bed and furniture for a guest-room , and some new screens , and another stove to take the place of one that wore out this year , and a rug for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always brooms and coal-buckets and shovels and all sorts of things which one never takes into consideration until one finds they are necessary . I do not see how we can do with less than seventy-five dollars a year for household expenses ? at least we shall probably average that for some years to come . My laundry bill is not large , as my wife washes all my clothes except my collars , cuffs , and stiff shirts . On the other hand , my outlay for stationery amounts to nearly twenty dollars a year . I have many very good friends , and besides I keep up a heavy correspondence with publishing houses , libraries , teachers in other schools , educational boards , and through this semi-business correspondence I strive to keep abreast of the times in my line . With the correspondence is also counted the cost of the paper which I use in the numerous outlines and question-lists that I get out in connection with my teaching . The doctor and dentist bills are usually very light , but they demand their portion , and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the year has passed . And if the doctor is needed more than three or four times , there is another onslaught on that hard-pressed two hundred dollars which must serve as a reserve fund for all such emergencies . It may seem too much to allow seventy-five dollars for recreations and kindred items , but careful consideration shows that it is certainly small enough . Christmas alone costs us over twenty-five dollars , and this is an absurdly small sum when we have so many good friends whom we so like to remember . We always combine business and pleasure in giving to each other , and give something which we must have anyway . In fact , we save 614 A PROFESSOR IN A SMALL COLLEGE up ' for some time before Christmas , putting off the buying of many necessities just for the pleasure of receiving them on that day . I go out into the hills and bring in our own Christmas tree and we trim it ourselves , but even then the Christmas season costs us a little bit , aside from the small presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this list , it must not be inferred that we indulge in many pleasure trips . Whenever we do any shopping , we must go to the city , and that costs a dollar or two each trip ; we make only two or three trips during the year , but they count up along with everything else . And then there are always institutes and teachers ' meetings and meetings of science associations , and it is necessary for me to attend some of them , though the number is very small . This seventy-five dollars must also pay for the few little dinners and luncheons which we give to students and friends , and must provide tickets to the Y.M. C.A. banquets , athletic banquets , other college and community functions , and the lyceum numbers and lectures that we attend . And the professors ' are expected to buy tickets for them even if they are too busy to use them . They are also expected to pay membership dues to the athletic association and often to contribute to other organizations . About all of this seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ' in the strictest sense , is the small sum which I spend for tennis balls and an occasional pair of tennis shoes or some repairs on the racquet . It may be that I have fallen from grace , and on the other hand it may be that I have grown into a broader conception of Christianity , but in either case , I do not feel the binding necessity of living by rule-of-thumb that I did when in my adolescent years . There was a time when I was very or thodox , and I considered it very essential to live by the old Puritan standards and faithfully to tithe whatever income I might receive . I no longer feel that we should be bound by the old Jewish customs , but I still hold it as true that a man should be sufficiently interested in the welfare of the world and the advancement of science and civilization to give approximately a tenth of his income for religious and educational matters . I do not say this in the spirit of preaching to any one else , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such causes each year . I sincerely believe that the average college professor gives this much , though he may not think he does . To be sure , many do not give lavishly through the churches , but they generously support athletics , Young Men 's Christian associations , educational organizations , and respond to a hundred and one other calls that arise in connection with church or school . Every college has some kind of financial campaign on all the time , regardless of how rich it may already be . This statement may be overdrawn , but the exceptions are a decided minority . And , of course , the professors ' are often called upon to start some special fond with a liberal donation . These men , in so far as I have been able to observe them , whether church members or not , are a very liberal class and respond readily and generously to such calls . Altogether , it is nearly or quite impossible for us to get through the year with very much money left to lay by ? except the fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a hundred dollars , I consider that we do well . However , let me say again that I am not an economic specialist , nor do I want to be . I would rather be an ' A No. 1 ' teacher even if I do have a difficult time with my finances . So far the discussion has all centred around the compensation , and it is as well that we turn our attention to another phase of the professor 's life and see what he does . Regularly , I teach twelve hours a week ? just two hours a day . That is , I have four classes , each of which recites three times a week . This looks easy enough and the man who works twelve hours a day is apt to smile at the difficult toil of the teacher . In this connection , I am reminded of what I once heard a high-school teacher say . Although it is the general impression that a school-teacher works from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon , he stated that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until nine p.m. and even work some on Sunday . And this is true not of him alone , but in general of all teachers , from the primary teacher to the university president . My father was a farmer and he used to get up at three o'clock and be out in the field ploughing while the stars were yet shining . How easy would he consider my life if he were still alive and knew that I do not get up sometimes until eight o'clock ! But it must also be remembered that some nights I do not go to bed until about the time that he got up . Many a night have I studied until after two o'clock and then reluctantly gone to bed , thinking how much there was to do and how little I had succeeded in doing . In common with most teachers in the small schools , I have several subjects to teach and this makes my work much harder . My four classes are in three subjects , psychology , education and sociology ; and even logic and ethics are incorporated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of these , or even two of them , I could do the work well and still feel no special hardship , but as it is , I must be reading in three different fields all the time . There are a great many people who think that a teacher should know what is in his textbooks and teach it , and that , after having taught a year or two and learned his books well , he has nothing to do . This is , of course , a very erroneous idea , as the textbook bears about the same relation to the field which the teacher must cover as the preacher 's text does to the sermon . In fact , I have found that I can always teach a new book better and with more ease than one with which I am already over-familiar , and for that reason I change texts as often as possible . During the course of the year , I read ? and I believe digest ? between twenty and thirty thousand pages of material on the subjects which I teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is from the most recent publications . Of course , I could neglect this reading if I wanted to , but it would be simply lying down on my job , as we say , for I must do it if I would keep up and do the best kind of teaching . If I were teaching only one or two subjects , this reading would be cut in half and I should have time for a little drama , poetry , and general literature . Because the professor enjoys this reading , there is a general impression that it is not work ; and it is difficult , anyway , for the layman to think of reading as really being work . But I doubt if the professor enjoys his reading any more than others who have found their proper sphere enjoy their particular kind of work . 1 used to enjoy ploughing and cutting corn and pitching wheat in much the same way that I now enjoy the feast of new scientific information which I get from some well-written clear-cut book . I was raised on a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few years ago , ? I counted it a delight to get out 616 A PROFESSOR IN A SMALL COLLEGE into the wheat-field , and it was glorious to pitch the heavy bundles and feel myself completely master of the situation . Even since I have been in school work , I have spent one summer working at hard manual labor for its recuperating effect . It had been a very strenuous year and I was greatly run down physically . I worked that summer M a sawmill , carrying heavy lumber for ten hours each day ? and I gained fifteen pounds . I remember one man who was cruelly hard worked who for a few minutes every afternoon would snatch an opportunity to lie in a hammock and rest ; but even as he rested , every fibre of his nervous system calling for release from the constant strain , he would have his books with him and put in the time studying . It was not a very satisfactory rest , but it was the best he could get . Just at that time of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would look up to where he was lying and call out , " raking it easy , are you ? ' I have often thought that this is a good picture of the professor and the attitude of the public toward him . But the work of the teacher does not consist alone in reading and recitations . I have found that I can advantageously use a list of review questions on each book covered in my courses . So , when we finish a book , I write out from one hundred to three hundred questions covering the main points and make carbon copies for the different members of the class . And as we use twelve or fifteen different textbooks during the year , this in itself is not a small job . Besides these books there are many others which we use as parallels , and I like to write out a few questions about each of these . Of course there is nothing that compels me to do this work , but I could not neglect it and keep a good conscience ? just at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system later . It is here that I must occasionally employ some help in typing , as I said in the discussion of extra expenditures . I stated above that I teach twelve hours a week ; but that is the ideal rather than the actual . Just at present I am teaching an extra class , which had to be handled by some one and there was no one else to take it , and that adds another three hours a week and another subject in which to read . And the teacher must always hold extra classes for those who have been out on account of sickness or for some other reason . It is hardly worth mentioning that I teach a Sunday-school class and a Y.M.C.A. Bible class , and do a few things like that . Occasionally , too , I go to neighboring schools and teachers ' institutes and make talks or , as they call it , lecture . This is tacitly understood to be a part of my regular work as it advertises the college . Really , I can hardly consider this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a break in the monotony of the regular programme that they furnish an agreeable pleasure . One of the biggest parts of my work ? and I wish it were bigger ? is the personal work . I can usually find that each of my students is more or less interested along some line that is included in my work , and I try to guide him to some literature on the subject and keep up his interest , and this takes no little portion of my time when there are forty or fifty students , each reading on a different subject . And what a pleasure it is to have some of the fellows drop in occasionally and ask me about an oration or a debate , or even a sermon . I have often thought that I could give a student as much education in an hour or two of personal conversation of this kind as I could in a whole term of classroom work . But this , along with everything else , means work // and time , and the outcome of it all is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no let up . Every day in the week , not excepting Sunday , he must be at his best , questioning , explaining , watching , drawing out ; and when he is out of the class , he must be planning and studying lest he fall behind or fail in his mission . vi Does the teacher have any right to ask for better pay or easier conditions ? To answer this question , we should look a little further into his personal life . A few months ago , I awoke one morning with an acute case of rheumatism which was so painful that I could not get out of bed . I treated this as something of a joke and was at my work again in a day or two , but this rheumatism has never completely left me . I do not anticipate any great amount of trouble with it and it ought to leave during the summer , but why has it clung so long , and why does it not go away now ? I am persuaded that my naturally vigorous system would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days if it were not for the fact that I have practically no reserve store of energy upon which to draw . I have realized ever since this little attack that I have been overworking and am perilously near the breaking Point . Now , just suppose that this rheumatism did not leave , but persisted in growing worse ? Suppose the doctor forbade me to teach for a year and ordered me to go to some hot springs for a few months ? Suppose , suppose ? sometimes I think of my life insurance and wish it were ten times as much . What would become of my wife and baby if anything should happen to me ? What should we do if I did have to quit teaching for a year ? In the midst of such thinking , the sweat has a tendency to start out , and such situations are not good when one is not yet thirty . And this is not an isolated case , for the teacher must constantly stand under the menacing danger of a break ? a sword of Damocles . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete break-down , ? comparatively rare , I say , for the actual number of those who have suffered in this way is considerable . Much more often he settles down instead of breaking down , and , at times , I am inclined to think this the more tragic of the two . He loses the freshness of delight when he turns to read an especially worthy article along his line , and he finally grows to neglect his reading almost entirely ; he learns a few books well and does not have to study ; he drops behind ; he gets into a rut ; and , though he is still successful in a way , his life becomes humdrum to him and his work distasteful to his students . Society would be benefited if the teacher could be shielded from this kind of settling down as well as from breaking down . It must also be borne in mind that the successful teacher could make more money at something else and make it with less effort . Twice have I stood at the threshold of remunerative careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , indeed , I was urged to reply by long-distance telephone accepting a position at least twice as lucrative as the teaching position which I held . And these opportunities come to most of the teachers . Some occasionally accept them , and they usually advise the rest of us to quit teaching as soon as possible . Just a few months ago , a professor of my acquaintance , who had been trying to pay off a little debt for about twenty-five years , at last gave it up and quit teaching for a position which gave him better pay . The teacher needs recreation as well 618 A PROFESSOR IN A SMALL COLLEGE as rest . I am a natural hunter , camper , and fisherman , and before I was a ' professor ' I spent a few summers among the beauties of the Rockies . What would it not mean to me ? and to my classes ? if I could spend the summer in these mountains ? I would come home as brown as a bear and about as hairy , and my whole being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounce upon the tasks of the coming year with all the vigor of a wild thing out of the woods . I know what a difference it would make , for the last time I was there I was ten pounds heavier than I have been since . But such a thing is out of the question . Commencement day is on Tuesday and the next day , Wednesday , I begin work in the summer school . There are about three weeks during the late summer which I have left for rest and recreation . This is largely spent in catching up with the correspondence that has been gradually falling behind throughout the year , and in reading and planning for the coming year 's work . I usually spend a few days visiting my own and my wife 's people , but our trip is so hurried that it is apt to tire us more than it rests us . I play a little tennis occasionally and really enjoy it , but my private honest testimony must be that it is a poor substitute for riding a good horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming mountain waters . I saw a statement once to the effect that it was hard to inflict lawn-tennis habits on a football soul , and I have a football soul in all I try to do ; and I believe that if I can not get a physical expression of this occasionally I can not long sustain a football attitude toward my work . My wife and I have been planning a delightful trip to the Panama Exposition at San Francisco ; I say we have been , for even now , eighteen months before the event , we realize that it is utterly be . yond the possible . Of course the conditions will probably become somewhat better as time goes on . If we stay in one place long enough , the household expenses will become smaller , some of the other items of expense may be lowered , we may learn how to manage better , and we may even get a little better salary . Perhaps a more honest way to put it would be to say that I would settle down a bit and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may even get to the place where I can spare time to keep chickens or a cow , and that would help immensely ; but I am so constituted that chickens or a cow would certainly cripple my work . VII In all this , I have taken for granted that I shall get no more schooling ; but this is an unbearable thought to me , for I am hungry , yes , craving , for the research laboratory . The university has even a greater drawing power than the smell of damp sage-brush and rabbit-weed on the mountain plains . I stated in the beginning that I am not a failure , and I know I would ' make good ' in advanced work if I only had the chance . I know from the letters of the president ( and I have been surprised at their friendliness and personal tone ) that there is a place for me there and a fellowship for me if I want to ask for it . But a fellowship pays only a fraction of the expenses , and even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we indulge in no trips or recreations , it will take us about five years to save enough to justify my reentering the university . But by then I would have fallen far behind the times , and very probably would have settled down to a more or less listless life . And besides , what may not hap- // pen in that time to sweep away all the money that I might save , a few dollars at a time ? And whatfuture would there be for me if I did return ? I might secure a bigger position after I had taken a doctor 's degree , but the men higher up tell us that with the bigger salaries there go greater expenses , and that there is no better chance to save money there than here . This being the case , can I dare to go in debt for some more schooling ? It was with all these thoughts in mind that I appealed frankly to the university president and asked him what to do . And the big-souled man realized my longings and desires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . ' You know how we all want you here , ' he said , ' and it is hard to give an impartial reply . ' But he went on to tell me that many who had gone on and finished their work did not have as good a place as I , and said that he did not believe I would ever again find a place where , all things considered , I could do as much good and do it with as much pleasure to myself . Many of these details will seem very crude , even to other teachers in small colleges , and I suppose there are no others who meet their problems in exactly the same way that I do ; but they all have struggles , and each has his own individual way of waging the warfare . Many keep cows and sell milk , hundreds keep chickens , and some even raise their own hogs , and in this way secure their meat . There are some fortunate professors who have other sources of income aside from their salary , money perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these get along very well and are able to do splendid work . I know one man who takes orders for clothing and advertises in the college paper ; some lecture in institutes and chautauquas , some sell books through the summer and make more at it than they do by their teaching , and many a professor 's wife keeps lodgers and some even keep boarders . As a rule they say very little about all this , but go quietly ahead with their work and fight their battles out in silence . As I recall the ones I have intimately known , I realize how very true it is that each has had his struggles . I know one especially capable professor who for twenty years has been planning and looking forward to a whole year at Harvard . Occasionally he spends a summer in research work , but his year at Harvard seems as far off as ever . His hair is gray and is rapidly turning white , but he laughs heartily and says he is still planning his full year of university work and expects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being visionary and impractical . It would take another paper the length of this to handle this question , but it will not be out of place here to say that in a certain sense , they are visionary ; but the visions they cherish are being certainly and surely realized and made manifest to the world . If they did not possess vision they would never stay in their chosen profession , but would seek more lucrative fields elsewhere . Also , if they did not possess vision the world would stagnate , and science and civilization would remain at a standstill or revert to primitive conditions . Knowing better than any others that ' Though the mills of the gods grind slowly , yet they grind exceedingly small , ' they almost unconsciously take for their motto ' Let there be light , ' and quietly and determinedly go on with their work . For make light of the statement as we will , it is still true that there are some things better and greater than money .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
