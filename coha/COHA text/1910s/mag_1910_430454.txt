 |p903  THE enduring charm of the literature of Socialism lies in its complete emancipation from the thraldom of reality and experience . No cringing deference to the teachings of human history chills the ardor or cramps the inventive fancy of a Socialist when he sits down to draw up a program for the reconstruction of society . He sets his foot upon the neck of authority , and blithely repudiates established truths worked out through centuries of toil and strife in the organization of institutions . The immense and enviable advantage of this free position is self-evident . It exempts socialistic theory and utterance from conformity with a host of tiresome axioms ; it dispenses with research , it shuts out the confusing past , and enables the Socialist to soar with light heart and unhindered wing toward his ideal . This sense of freedom and detachment colors all socialistic writing , and must , I imagine , bring to the expounder of that faith a joyful sense of the perfection of his work rarely vouchsafed to toilers in other fields of authorship and exposition . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even for themselves , the actual conditions under which the socialistic state would take up and carry on its work . I have now-here found such a projection of the program of the socialization of industry and production . A balance-sheet of Socialism , a Socialist budget , is a thing unknown . No Socialist writer has told us how much his ideal government would cost , or has disclosed to us the sources of its revenue . I shall try to put before the readers of THE CENTURY some of these missing elements of the problem . For a thorough test of Socialism it would be necessary to construct a sort of working plan of a complete Socialist government , and put it in operation . No Socialist will do that ; nobody else will have the hardihood to attempt it . I shall merely set forth some of the conditions that would confront a Socialist administration in the United States , in the hope that the showing may bring into view certain matters of which Socialism has taken small account . There are no canonical books of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed that is in all its parts everywhere accepted by Socialists as orthodox . Of current writers no two are in such agreement that it is possible to quote one as an authority on the " faith and morals " of Socialism , save at the risk of being reproached for misrepresentation by most of the others . There is , how-ever , a collective pronouncement of Socialism in this country which we may accept as authoritative , and which may safely be consulted by those who wish to know what Socialism is and what the Socialists really propose to do . Everybody should know that Socialism aims at the overthrow of the existing social and industrial system , the abolition of capitalism and the competitive wage-system . Jaures says that the proletariate , the wage-earners , and the salaried classes , have now an ideal : " They desire not merely to cure the worst defects of society as it exists ; they want to establish a social order founded on another principle . For individual and capitalistic property , which assures the domination of a part of mankind over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism of production , a system of universal social cooperation which would make every man a partner by right . " This embodies in general terms the ideal of European and American Socialists . We find these principles concisely set forth in the platform of the National Convention of the Socialist Party , adopted at Chicago , May 17 , 1908 , the platform upon which Eugene V. Debs made his campaign for the Presidency . Two hundred and nineteen delegates , representing nearly all the States in the Union , had seats in that convention . The conflict of so many minds and four days of debate ought to have prepared the platform to resist triumphantly the impact of the exegesis of the faithful and the criticism of unbelievers . From this seasoned exposition of the principles of American Socialism I quote the general demands to which the convention and the candidates were pledged : GENERAL DEMANDS i . The immediate Government relief for the unemployed workers by building schools , by reforesting of cut-over and waste lands , by reclamation of arid tracts , and the building of canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All persons employed on such works shall he employed directly by the Government under an eight-hour workday and at the prevailing union wages . The Government shall also loan money to States and to municipalities without interest for the purpose of carrying on public works . It shall contribute to the funds of labor organizations for the purpose of assisting their unemployed members , and shall take such other measures within its power as will lessen the wide-spread misery of the workers caused by the misrule of the capitalist class . 2 . The collective ownership of railroads , telegraphs , telephones , steamship lines , and all other means of social transportation and communication , and all land . 3 . The collective ownership of all industries which are organized on a National scale and in which competition has virtually ceased to exist . 4 . The extension of the public domain to include mines , quarries , oil-wells , forests , and water-power. 5 . The scientific reforestation of timber lands , and the reclamation of swamp lands . The land so reforested or reclaimed to be permanently retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The absolute freedom of press , speech , and assemblage . In this new world where everybody is to have everything , it seems to me that , to many weary souls , the most pleasing prospect must be that of rest ? rest from the endless arguing and contention that have plagued our statesmen and our politicians for a generation . Are not all these problems solved in the twinkling of an eye by this inspired program of social reor-ganization ? The regulation of interstate commerce would be consigned to the limbo where the Wilmot Proviso and the Alien and Sedition acts have been forgotten . It is inconceivable that collective ownership would wink at unholy rebates , or in any other way stoop to the chicane of favoring one shipper over another . There would be no watered stock ? nor any other . Monopolies in restraint of trade would be made forever impossible ? an amazing paradox ? by combining all the " combinations " under one ownership . Complete desuetude would he the fate of the Anti-Trust Act . All the land being collectively owned , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unearned increment . Although banks and banking are not mentioned in these " demands , " the control of the instruments of exchange has always been insisted on by Socialists . That would inevitably come , and early . The Monetary Commission could rest from its labors , and turn over to the Socialist Secretary of the Treasury its accumulation of texts and documents ; for which , we may be quite sure , that functionary would have no use . The Socialist fiscal and currency system would be simple beyond belief . There might still remain subjects for discussion by statesmen , by legislators , by orators , and by the press , but they would be new subjects . The matters we . now take with such entire seriousness would interest only antiquarians . These " general demands " call for the acquisition by the Government of a great deal of property now in private hands , owned by individuals and by corporations . About the terms of the bargain , the price to be paid to present owners , the platform  |p905  is as silent as the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that private property is to be paid for , not confiscated . The Fabians , the so-called " intellectual " Socialists of England , have proposed that the British railways shall be purchased at a price reached by capitalizing their earnings on a four per cent . basis ; that is , the purchase price would be twenty-five times the average dividends for three years . Let us assume that the Socialists of the United States intend to make payment for the property conveyed from private to collective ownership . We are now in a position to apply the first test , to picture forth the effects of Socialism upon the commonwealth , and to bring clearly into view the conditions under which the Socialist government would take up its important work . All lands , all the instruments of communication and transportation , all except the minor industries , all the mines and the forests , all the water-power and oil-wells , are to be acquired by the Government . Banks , as I have said , are not included in the list , but Mr. John Spargo , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , " Socialism , " that " a monopoly of the monetary and credit functions , including coinage , banking , mortgaging , and the extension of credit to private enterprises , " belongs to the irreducible minimum of Socialism 's demands . Now let us count the cost , so far as the elements of computation are within our reach , of achieving collective ownership and of setting the new Government upon its feet . According to the last report of the Interstate Commerce Commission , the entire outstanding capital of all the railroads in the country ? stock , $7,373,212 , - 323 , bonds , $9,294,332,5o4 ? amounted on June 30 , 1908 , to $16,667,544,827 . The securities , bonds and stocks representing the capital of the Western Union Telegraph Company , amount to $138,462,100 . Of the 1Iackay companies , which control the Postal Telegraph and Commercial Cable companies , and many others , the outstanding capital is $91,380,400 , and the Cable Company has outstanding bonds to the amount of $20,000,000 . The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has , of bonds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , foot up $619,429,800 of capital . The resources of all the banks , State , National , and private , and of the trust companies in the United States , amounted on April 28 , 1909 , to $21,095,054,420 . If Socialism assumed the liabilities , it would feel at liberty to take the assets , I suppose , upon payment to the owners of the par value of their shares , and of the distributive value of the surplus and undivided profits . That item would be $3,637,972,240 . In banks having a large volume of deposits other elements of value belonging to capital might very properly be included . But bankers must not expect too much from Socialism . The value of the farm-lands of the country , with the improvements , was determined by the census of 1900 to be $16,614,647,491 . The value of the buildings and improvements can not be separately stated , but it would be only a small part of this sum , and the deduction on that score would be much more than made up by the increment in farm values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-eight principal cities of the United States was assessed for taxation in 1909 at $12,838,399,024 . Assessed valuation ranges from fifty per cent. , or less , to one hundred per cent . of actual market-value . The unvalued and unassessed margin , together with the billions of land-values in the smaller municipalities , would easily swell this total to twenty billions , even after the deduction of the value of buildings and improvements . The " Statistical Abstract , " using the figures of the Census of 1905 , puts the capital employed in manufactures in the country , not including hand trades and minor concerns , at $12 , - 686,265,673 . No trustworthy estimate of the property value of the steamships , oil-wells , mines , and water-power privileges in the United States is accessible . The merchant marine , including sailing-vessels , reached the total of 7,365,445 gross tons in 1908 . The energy yielded by the streams of the country , turning 52,877 wheels , is estimated at 5,356,680 horse-power . The oilwells produced in 1908 crude petroleum to the value of $136,347,831 . The Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 338,300 , does not own the wells the crude petroleum of which it refines . In 1908 , other mineral products reached a total of $1,469,982,914 . These properties are  |p906  worth many billions of dollars .. They sustain their fortunate owners , some in comfort and others in luxury . But there is no basis for an estimate of their worth , and we need spend no time in vain regret over this blank in the statement of accounts . We have assembled so many more imposing masses of capital that these items may properly be omitted on the principle of tie minimis . In this account , as I shall show , a matter of a few billions more or less is quite negligible . We may now state the account in tabular form , and give ourselves up to the pleasure of contemplating the total initial liabilities of the Socialist government : How would the Socialist government settle for these properties , bought at such colossal cost ? Only by issuing its obligations . There would be no other possible way . Thus we should come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy billions . The present public debt of all the nations of the world is only thirty-seven billions . The largest debt of all is that of France , amounting to $5,600,000,000 ; the United Kingdom owes $3,880,000,000 . The annual interest charge on all the public debts of the world is $1,550,433,038 . At three per cent. , the interest charge on the Socialist government 's debt would be over two billions , or more than twice our entire national debt , and more than three times our total annual treasury revenue . Much more than half the wealth of the nation would , by the Socialist program , be transferred from private to " collective " ownership . We may grant that Socialism would cut down " capital 's " account . It would make large deductions for inflation in stock and bond issues . But , even on the basis of a fair " physical valuation , " the total would not be materially diminished . The reader who is in any degree familiar with fiscal theory and practice will already have reached the conclusion that , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not make the slightest difference whether the Socialist government proceeded by purchase or by confiscation . No government on earth could give value to bonds representing a seventybillion debt , nor could it keep up the interest payment , meet other public expenditures , and maintain its credit . But Socialists point to the revenue features of their program , " extension of inheritance taxes , graduated in proportion to the amount of the bequest and nearness of kin , " and " a graduated income tax . " It ought to be unnecessary to point out that , after the government had taken over all the land and the instruments of production , transportation , and exchange , a great deal more than half the whole wealth of the country , the people would find it hard enough to make a bare living on the remainder in their hands . There would be no incomes for the levy of the tax-gatherer , no estates to be bequeathed . There remains the possibility of profit in the operation of railroads , factories , telephones , and telegraphs by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that to be a delusive hope . The highest skill and trained capacity of private railroad management secured in this country in 1907 ? 08 a net return of 3.9 per cent . on railroad capital , and in England , in the period from 1901 to 1905 , the net return to capital was 3.38 per cent . There is no source from which the Socialist government could get revenue enough to pay its bills . Its bonds would be worthless , and holders of them could never hope to receive any part of either principal or interest . It would be just as well . What use could they make of their money ? No field of possible investment would be open to them . There would be no shares to buy , no corporations to organize , no citylots to be bought , no farm-lands , not an acre anywhere left to which they could acquire title . Only the smaller trades and occupations , and those mostly cooperative , would remain for the employment of private capital . To abolish capitalism is the fundamental intent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve that , their " demands " are made . Mr. Spargo says that when these enumerated activities are undertaken by the state , " private enterprise would by no means be eliminated ,  |p907  limited to an extent making the exploitation of public interests and needs for private gain impossible . " Again : " It may be freely admitted , however , that the ideal to be aimed at , ultimately , must be approximate equality of income , otherwise a class formation must take place , and the old problems incident to commercial inequality reappear . " To check this deplorable tendency , llr . Spargo would provide that the inheritance of acquired wealth should be denied , " society being the only possible inheritor of property . " Here reappears the bland , engaging aloofness from unconquerable fact and conclusion . Socialists plant themselves firmly on the postulate that present economic conditions , the unequal distribution of wealth , are responsible for the differing conditions of men . The redistribution of wealth would make all men equal , all men happy and contented . The Socialists overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat widely held that it is the inequality in the capacities and in the ambitions , temperaments , and dispositions of men that have made economic conditions unequal , that have brought the reward of accumulations to the industrious and the thrifty , and have visited the penalty of narrow circumstances upon the improvident and the prodigal . Plainly , the Socialist ideal is a social dead-level , an organization of society in which no man would have either the incentive or the law 's permission to surpass his neighbor in effort or in the fruits thereof . That dream of a state of social perfection can be attained by an act of their congress . The bees appear to be Socialists . They are industrious , they seem to be happy and contented . But they long ago enacted that the honey-cell should be constructed in a certain way , and that , it happens , is the perfect way in the mechanical as well as in the economic sense . Since then , very naturally and sensibly , the bees have given up the idea of progress . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blest , he can not rid himself of the idea of progress . It is an ineradicable propensity , and he clings to that idea and yields to that propensity in proportion to his ambition and to his ability . Some men are happy in the static condition ; others find content only in change , and change always with the idea of advancement . The chief of all the many unconquerable conditions which the Socialists ignore is the nature of man . But they can not change it , for it is about the most unchanging and unchangeable thing within our knowledge . Death alone ? the death of all men , and the arrest of all organic forces ? can bring about the ideal deadlevel of Socialism . ) Jr . Herbert Spencer assures us that one of the laws of the vital universe is " the instability of the homogeneous , " which may be transmuted into the homelier phrase , " the cream will rise upon the milk . " Organic matter is never inert , and human society is only an organism . Socialism can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or blast with sterility every atom and cell of its being , by decreeing that the government shall own the railroads , the farms , and the factories . Brains , industry , capacity , foresight , would assert themselves in a Socialist state as in any other , and laziness and improvidence would bring want and dependence , as they now bring and always have brought them . The Socialist state , even if it were possible to establish it , would tear itself asunder . Living men would dissociate themselves from the body of death . Yet the doctrines of Socialism are taught to adults and to children in many schools established and maintained by Socialists in New York City , and in many other cities and States . Picture primers , reading-books , songs , little plays , serve to instil the abhorrence of capitalism and the present social order into infant minds , and into older ones as well . The doctrines are preached from pulpits and from the chairs of professors . In no Socialist writing that has ever come under my observation has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to show how the bill would be paid . Any candid inquiry into the problem leads to but one conclusion ? that the bill would not and could not be paid at all . Collective confiscation must necessarily precede collective ownership . We may therefore ask by what means the owners of half the national wealth are to be made to part with it for the common behoof . Evidently not by persuasion . Nothing in human experience , nothing in  |p908  history , supports the theory of voluntary surrender . The Socialists say that the change is to come with the ballot . Socialist lawmakers , executives , and judges will accomplish the desired expropriation , paying no heed , of course , to the outcries of the despoiled . Armed revolution is no longer very much preached save by a fiery agitator here and there , and by those passionate declaimers , newly come to our shores , who bring with them the ardor of Continental Socialism . And they , it seems to me , are the only consistent Socialists , the only ones who really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the adaptation of means to ends long ago came to understand that revolution by force was out of the question , because , as Karl Kautsky puts it , " of the colossal superiority of the weapons of the present standing armies , as compared with the weapons in the possession of civilians , and which makes any resistance of the latter patently doomed to failure from the beginning . " Is it not natural , therefore , that Kautsky should insist that " the abolition of the standing army and disarmament ? is indispensable , if the State is to carry out any important reforms ? " Far above the great volume of Socialist utterance , that remark shines by the quality of consistency . There is no antidote to Socialism . It was born in man when he first fought over the spoils of the chase and raged against his sturdier cave-mate who seized the larger share . But there are checks and palliatives . A clear understanding of what Socialism means and what it seeks to do will tend to arrest the spread of its doctrines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamers and visionaries and children , and , above all , among those who are altogether uninformed as to what Socialism is . It is well , therefore , that there should be a clear understanding that the Socialist government would begin , must begin , by wholesale confiscation of property . The palliatives are being administered all the time in every civilized land , by the action of public opinion upon the makers of the laws . A study of the legislation of the last century in this country and in England for bettering the hard conditions of toil , for the prevention of " man 's inhumanity to man , " for establishing the rights of wage-earners , and setting up safeguards for them against oppression , extortion , injustice , and disease , for better housing , for schooling , for the relief of the needy , and importing heart and human feeling and conscience into a relation that , a hundred years ago , was based upon the relentless law of supply and demand which regulates the commodities market , would put into the heads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable ladies who are dabbling in Socialism , a fund of knowledge which they now lack . They would learn that , under the existing social order , under our institutions as now established , through the working of public opinion , and by the orderly process of law , the evils of which Socialism justly complains are curable and being cured .
