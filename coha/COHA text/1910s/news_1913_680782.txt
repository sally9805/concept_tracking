txt THE LAST TRUMP . Will It Resurrect Lives Extinct , or Only Dormant ? We noticed a letter in THE TIMES of Sept. 29 , entitled " The Last Trump , " in which the ' writer alluded in disparaging terms to an address recently given by a British scientist as to the probability of a man existing after death . In the course of his remarks he speaks of the last 6,000 years in a way that gives one the impression that he believes that man has existed on the earth no longer than that length of time . The estimated number of years that man has existed on this planet as given by the best authorities is so large that 6,000 seems a small number by contrast . Then the writer says : " In God 's own time all those who have died will be resurrected back to earth . " It is doubtful if there would be standing room for so many . But the most preposterous statement in the letter is that contained in the closing sentence . He says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , and spirit , and extinct until the resurrection morn . " How does he reconcile such an assertion with the account in the Bible of Lazarus and the rich man , both dying and going directly , one to heaven and the other to hell , with no loss of identity or any apparent cessation of conscious existence ? And how does he understand the words Christ addressed to one of the malefactors who was crucified with Him : " To-day shalt thou sup with me in Paradise " ?
