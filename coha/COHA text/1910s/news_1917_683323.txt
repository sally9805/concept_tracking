txt The Germans were told by their newspapers a few weeks ago that we were about to lose our trade with South America . Submarines were killing it . Already it was " dwindling , " a leading journal in Berlin asserted , and soon it would " cease entirely . " This would be " the great " est triumph of i'te TT-h , 4  - -  -  over " our new enemy . " The truth was , is shown by official reports , that this trade was steadily growing and had increased since the beginning of the ruthless submarine piracy . Now the German people are permitted to consider the actual condition of this trade with the countries of the southern continent . Their most prominent commercial paper publishes figures which show the remarkable growth of both exports and imports , remarking that the " Yankees " have " hurled themselves upon South America like vultures , " attempting to " swallow Germany 's share . " Our " money princes and their hireling WILSON " have sought to " throttle " Brazil and Argentina " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers believe that by a corrupt use of money we have induced Brazil to turn against Germany , and are employing / similar methods at Buenos Aires . And it may have found in its essay on trade an opportunity to let the German people know that , as it says , " Brazil considers herself at war with " Germany , and , according to the " latest reports , Argentina is about " to break off diplomatic relations . " Undoubtedly there will be a severance of these relations if the Berlin Government withholds the apology , indemnities , and guarantees which Argentina demands . The German people have been permitted to know very little about the attitude of South America . They have now been enlightened about the course of trade . Growth of our exports and imports has not been checked . This is proved by the reports for May and the incomplete fiscal year . In the eleven months the gains were 45 per cent . for exports and 37 per cent . for goods received . Not all that this journal in Germany says is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered carefully by those who are asked to condemn the " Yankee vultures " : The longer Germany is cut off from the South American market , the harder she will find It to recover her share of trade . The longer the South Americans are compelled to take nonGerman , , and especially American , products , the more accustomed they will become to them , and the more anxious to avoid another change . If the war should end this week , Germany could not recover her trade with those countries . And the longer the war continues , the more difficult it will be for her to regain any part of it . She would be unable now to provide for that financing of trade there . which made her successful in the past . Her weakness in this respect will be greater six months or a year hence . In the cost of the war to her must be included a great and Permanent trade loss in South America .                  @ @ @
