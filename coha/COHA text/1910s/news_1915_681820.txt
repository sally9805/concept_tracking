Resolution adopted at fifth annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1915 : The Drama League of America believes that the welfare of the drama requires that the theatre be treated as a public institution ; that all dramatic performances in it should be subject to honest and fearless criticism , and that any attempt on the part of any theatrical manager to dictate the terms under which criticism of dramatic performances in his house may be written would be fraught with danger to the theatre , the drama , the art of acting , and the principles of a free press .
