Mortimer L. Schiff announced at a . meeting of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday that $500,000 had been offered ' to found a College of Commerce by man who was not ready to have bit ; ' name revealed . Few of the members present had heard of the gift , and the announcement was received with much enthusiasm . There was much speculation throughout the rest of the meeting as to the unknown sponsor for the pro- I posed college , but no name was uttered . Mr. Schiff said afterward that not even .... his associates on the special committee appointed to inquire into the merits of a College of Commerce had been told who had offered the endowment . After news of the gift appeared the name of Jacob H. Schiff was mentioned . Mr. Schiff refused to discuss the mat-yter , other than to say that his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Mg . The $500,000 gift was announced during the presentation of a report of the Committee on Commercial Education , headed by Mortimer L. Schiff , which has spent many months looking into the advantages of a college in which chief emphasis might be put on commercial subjects . The committee inquired ? ' into the advisability of placing the new institution in this city , and , after con : - suiting with eminent educators , inciud-. , ing Dr. John H. Finley , State Commissioner of Education ; David F. Houston , Secretary of Agriculture ; Dean Joseph . F. Johnson of the New York University School of Commerce , and others , it was decided to recommend to the Chamber of Commerce that steps be taken for its establishment . The committee 's report was accepted by the chamber at yesterday 's meeting , and work on the proposed institution is expected to begin soon . In addition to the great individual Pledge of funds , four subscriptions of $50,000 each have been obtained by the special ' committee . The estimate was advanced in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood of $500,000 , and the unknown doner stipulated that his money should be used for its erection . He made the condition , Mr. Schiff stated , that the $200,000 other pledges be used to install a commercial and civic museum in the new building , and that the City of New York enter into a contract with the Chamber of Cotnmerce providing for the annual support of both the college and the museum by the city . To offset the responsibility and expense thus put upon the city , the committee suggested that the college be put under the joint administration of the College of the City of New York and the Chamber of Commerce . The committee informed the chamber that their plans had gone far enough to choose a tentative borne for - the College of Commerce . " The building in which the college should be housed , " said the report . ' should provide adequate space for the installation of a museum of commerce , on the lines of the well-known Deutsches Museum in Munich , and also for a civic museum , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laboratory for young men who are preparing for public buiness . The old site of the City College at Lexington ? Avenue and Twenty-third Street is now available and may not continue so , as the city may determine to utilize it for other purposes . Those whohave been consulted are of the opinion that the present building is not suitable for the purposes of a College ( of Commerce , and that if a college is to be established on that site a new building should be erected . " The committee suggested that Immediate steps be taken to obtain the cooperation of the city authorities . 1t was pointed out that this country was far behind Europe , and particularly Germany , in providing adequate facilities for commercial education , and that the basis for courses should be made practical and not theoretical , with particular weight upon continuity and even " ing work for students . By an institution on the collegiate plan , " the report said , along this line : " the committee understands one that Is similar to a college of arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements , would ateord the same mental discipline and culture training and would lead to a baccalaureate degree , but provision should , in this instance , be made that practical experience and special knowledge might be permitted to take the place of certain counts in the entrance examinations and an incentive be thus furished to young men who have not hcett able to complete a high school course . It seems particularly appropriate that such an institution for higher commercial training should be maintained by the municipality and that instruction should thus be made available to all classes . Whether this instruction. - should be made absolutely free , or whether some moderate charge should be made , is a question which can hereafter be determined . Business is becoming a profession , and it seems fitting that the leaders in business in the greatest business centre of the country should aid in establishing in this city a College of Commerce and Administration second to none in the world . " The committee suggested that the College of Commerce should provide primarily for a four year course , with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Requirements for . entrance should be made similar , the report said , to those now in force at the City College . except that particular stress should be laid on commercial subjects as taught in the High School of Commerce . Special students should also be admitted , and measures taken to secure employment for graduates. - The Chamber of Commerce has been considering a College of Commerce for more than two years . The original committee named to take charge of the project began work in November , 1011 , with George P. Brett as Chairman . Mr. Brett went abroad and studied the situation in foreign schools thoroughly , but was , not able to carry to completion the task . He was succeeded by the late Theodore F. Miller , who died last May , and Mr. Schiff was then appointed to the place . Some of the other members of the committee are Frank A. Vanderlip , Thomas W. Lamont , Alexander C. Humphries , Edward A. C. Smith , and Clark Williams . $600 ; 000 TO ST COMMERCE COLL      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
