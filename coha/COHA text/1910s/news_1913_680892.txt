txt LICETZSE ALL 1SSOTOR CAR DRIVERS If Gov . GLYNN will send to the Legislature a special message , urging that it repass the bill vetoed by Gov . SULZER last Spring , New York State will then follow the example of most of its neighboring States in requiring that all operators of motor cars , whether chauffeurs , owners , or borrowers , shall be licensed . The bill does not require that operators other than chauffeurs be examined before licensing , but it does provide that the Secretary of State may revoke or suspend the license of any operator for a third violation of the speed rules In the Motor Vehicle act : moreover , if ' the holder of a license shall be convicted of a felony under the act , or of physical or mental disability , of drunkenness or the use of drugs , of gross negligence resulting in injury to person or property , or of running away without stopping to give name and address after causing an injury , the Secretary of State may suspend or revoke his license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law are many and varied , but they are summed up in the accelerating increase in the number of persons killed and injured , amounting to 9,884 within this State since January , 1911 . During this year , until Dec. 1 , 416 persons were killed and 2,149 injured ; of these 277 were killed in New ? York City , and 1,093 Injured . These figures include only those users of the public highways who were run down by ino-1 tor cars over which the innocent and unfortunate victims had no control ; they do not include the hundreds , perhaps thousands , of operators or occupants of cars who were killed and in jured by structural defects or recklessl driving . There were few , if any , subsequent investigations to fix the blame . The ? present means of registration Is so bad that , in approximately seven-tenths of the civil cases for damages , the occupant of the car could not be identified before the court as the registered owner . The bill is not very radical . It might reasonably require that all operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the examinations in New Jersey show that in the beginning over one-third of applicants for licenses could not drive a car properly around a city square , and the Secretary of State of New Jersey now says that 15 per cent . of applicants are regularly disqualified because of incompetency . But the provision enabling New York 's Secretary of State to revoke licenses in the cases recounted above would be a strong deterrent to lawbreakers . Secretary MAY can now suspend a license only on the recommendation of the Judges in local courts . The Court of Special Sessions in this city does not recommend suspension and revoking of licenses for the enumerated reasons . The Massachusetts Highway Commission , on the other hand , has within eleven months found it expedient to suspend 494 licenses or registered certificates and to revoke 144 more . During that period 103 persons were prosecuted in Massachusetts on the charge of running their cars while drunk , and of these 89 were convicted . The Legislature will probably repass the bill if specially urged by Gov . GLYNN.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
