 | THE world , ever since men began to realize that there is a world , has been a morosely steady planet , undergoing its daily revolution , and plodding along a path imposed upon it by the forces of the universe ? a dogged Caliban of a world , suspecting and searching for a divine Prospero which it has never been able to visualize . Then , all of a sudden , four years ago this subject and obedient world crashed out of its orbit , and became a comet enveloped in flame , an outcast of a world , rushing furiously towards a sun which scorches and threatens to consume it from pole to equator . The trend of the political organization of mankind in 1918 is as different from that of 1914 , as 1914 was different from 1814 or from 1514 . The frightful changes in eastern Europe and western Asia seem incredible , like the barking of an angry prophet , like the headlines of a Hearst newspaper , like a basket full of snakes , like a Coliseum on a field day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses with fresh trains dashing into the wreck from both ends all the time , like a succession of asteroids dropping into Vesuvius . The world is uncouth , dishevelled , possessed of evil spirits , full of woe , wrath , and putridity . It is a hodge-podge , a world in which two and two make three or five , as it may happen , but never four ; in which things equal to the same thing are greater than each other , in which logic is thrown from air-  | ships and brotherly love drips from bayonets . A world personally conducted by Victor Hugo 's djinns : Totters the house as though , like dry leaf shorn From autumn bough and on the wild blast borne , Up from its deep foundation it were torn , To join the stormy whirl . Ah ! all is lost ! From this frightful confusion , this destruction of family life , this enslavement of men 's bodies and caging of their free spirits , the United States has been and is freer than any other part of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that a great war is going on . We think so because we strum the headlines of the newspapers , which have some relation to the despatches , which in their turn imperfectly reveal the course of events yesterday in France . Nevertheless about half the space in current newspapers goes into the war ; and we probably know more about the serious events in Europe than is known from day to day by the people of the central countries . The war news perhaps is too abundant and therefore loses its thrill . Again , we are aware of the war because of the soldiers . The streets are alive with khaki and with the blue and white of the Jackies . Every community has its contingent in this multitude of armed men . The draft throws its lassoo in ever widening circles . The whole country : s fastened to the war through its sons . Every household that flies a service flag impresses upon its neighborhood the existence of a great war . Yet so far , with the dread exception of the twenty thousand names in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public as being actually in the contest . We do not think of them as held over the Pit , as devotees held their children ready to drop into the bubbling lava of Kilauea . They have gone for a vacation ; gone to camp out ; gone to the South ; taking a sea trip ; living outdoor life ; visiting Europe ; absorbing new impressions . As yet the events and the losses of the war have not penetrated to the heart of the public and seared its soul .  | Nor is the country aroused by its pocket nerve . One family scrapes the butter from its bread , and another is compelled to reduce the available automobiles from three to two ; in neither case is the country alarmed . The reason why there has been such general and cheerful submission to the flour ordinances and the sugar decrees is that nobody in the United States expects to be entirely out of flour or sugar for more than a brief time . We are not on calling terms with the famine demon . We are spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk , that the children will pine away on the coarse and scanty food , that grandfather will weaken and be snuffed out , and that any of us may perish of positive starvation before this accursed war shall end . So with finances . The nation has no serious apprehensions of bankruptcy , public or private . Judging by the obvious measure of money to spend , there is a lot of it . High wages in munitions factories , pleasure automobiles , new theatres , crowded movies , roaring White Ways , lively trade of jewellers and fur dealers , all point to a continued notion of widespread prosperity . As for taxes , they have not yet set their jaws for a permanent hold . Neither the wealth nor the property of the country has so far been hard hit by taxes ; both have had surpluses to invest in Liberty Loans ; both have fitted out their sons for service ; both are living on about the same scale as just before the war . The pressure caused by the subtraction of a considerable part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war purposes has not yet taken effect . If the war and war expenses could stop instantly , the country would not feel poor . Up to date it has been an easy-going war so far as the taxpayer , the plain citizen , the recruit , and the wellto-do classes are concerned . Immense changes in our daily lives are approaching but as yet we hardly notice their shadows . Behind this curtain of apparent freedom from disturbance , the whole nation is remaking . The changes in the United  | States in a year and a half are as great as those of a century and a quarter preceding 1917 . If a magician 's wand could still the guns , cage the airships , and petrify the submarines to-day , those changes would still go on , making of the United States of America a new country . By no possibility can we ever go back to be the United States of a year ago . Our country is changed in internal conditions and external relations , changed in the organization of its man power , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service , in its conception of playing a great part in the world . That the ideals of America have been altered is a thing far surpassing in significance the little cataclysms from day to day . Acts of Congress , speeches of the President , decisions of draft boards , edicts of the Fuel Lord , plans of field campaign , methods of warfare ? all these are only outward evidences of an inward feeling . Now , inward feelings are the real substance of life . Calvin and his fellow theologians were absolutely right in insisting that what a man believes is much more important than what he does , in the sight of God and man . The whole war is a striking example of the tremendous effect of national beliefs , ambitions , and guiding principles in forcing men and nations into action which by all ordinary calculation is contrary to their own interests . The great question in American life and American government is not what the authorities and the people are doing , but what American people think is right in national conduct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national policy . Nothing can be clearer than that the most cherished principles of government are ignored ; that the American mind has coined a new set of ideas and ideals , based on the fundamental necessity of keeping democracy alive , notwithstanding many sacrifices of the traditional essentials of democracy . The first and most obvious alteration in the United States arising from the war is in the Federal government . The States and cities have been little disturbed either in their  | form or activities . For instance , in Massachusetts a Constitutional Convention has sat for months in 1917 and 1918 and seems nearly satisfied with the State Constitution of 1780 . It discountenances any serious alterations to fit the Commonwealth to war conditions or to the critical period after the war . The only recognized alterations in state government are the upheaval of the militia and a slight tendency to enlarge the authority and prestige of the Governors . Likewise , city governments have hardly felt the hot breath of war . In New York a man with a high reputation throughout the nation for stubborn loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time had little reputation for anything . Whatever the advantages or defects of state or city governments , they have not as governments seized the opportunity to make the people feel their significance ; they have allowed private societies , clubs , fraternities , and other organizations to appeal to the affection and imagination of the people . This apathy is the more surprising because the Federal government has undergone a tremendous readjustment , although the machinery shows little sign of alteration . We have still , as we had a year ago , a national government conscientiously separated into three co-ordinate departments : ( 1 ) Legislative , the two Houses of Congress ; ( 2 ) Executive , composed of a President with an appointed Cabinet , semiindependent administrative commissions , and a highly specialized system of bureaus , with a classified civil service ; and ( 3 ) Judiciary , culminating in a Supreme Court with power to pass upon , and if necessary to disallow , Acts of Congress . All this machinery is still grinding away in apparent smoothness . But as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has undergone enormous changes , which are approved by the people ; many of which will continue after the war is over . The President has loomed up as the head of the Executive , the government , and the na-  | tion ; his vast powers over foreign relations and as commander-in-chief of the armies and navies give him an ability to make decisions which place him among the most powerful potentates on earth . The Cabinet has always been subject to the President , in the sense that he selects the members , and either by positive pressure or by negative refusal of support may compel them to withdraw . On the face of it , this relation to the Cabinet has not been changed ; but the man who can at this time issue orders to the Secretary of War , Secretary of the Navy , Secretary of the Treasury , and Secretary of State , is to a large degree the government of the United States , both in the eyes of foreign nations and in the minds of his fellow countrymen . This immense power has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , empowering the President to reclassify and reorganize the executive bureaus . Before that measure , a bureau was a kind of Frankenstein created by Act of Congress , and nourished by specific appropriations . To upset a bureau was an act of impiety , though the departments were subdivided in a haphazard fashion . The new law authorizes the President to break up any executive bureaus and to fit them together again so as to do their jobs effectively . It gives him the power inherent in the heads of banks or railroads or trusts . For instance , in the Interior Department was formed a flourishing Chemical Bureau which dealt with noxious gases in mines and had developed into a laboratory of war gases . In the War Department there was a Gas Defense Service . All gas chemists , civilian employees and military men , are now concentrated into one intensive body , which is a part of the War Department . The President has also become the premier of Congress through a long process followed out by President Roosevelt , President Taft , and President Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the heads of Congress to the people at large . When Congress has resisted , the President 's veto power has been used ? or threatened ,  | which is about as effective . In all his war measures the President has demanded and received from Congress everything upon which he has set his heart . He has been the actual legislative authority . When he wanted a single Food Administrator , he stood out against an angry Senate until the point was yielded to him . In open addresses through the two Houses of Congress , in public letters to members of Congress , he states the decisions to which he has come ; and so far they have all been ratified by the nominal legislative branch . As for the third independent department , the Judiciary , it is made up precisely as it was before the war ; nothing has been changed in its constitutional or statutory powers ; yet as the balance wheel in the government , as the automatic detector of aggressions by the other two co-ordinate powers , as the last resort against usurpation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned . And everything is now military which the military holds to be military . The Supreme Court has sustained the Executive in conscription , and shows no disposition to qualify the espionage and other Acts which hew close to the constitutional line . Judging by the experience of the Civil War , the United States courts will not interfere with any laws , military or financial , or with the conduct of the President , or with the acts of military subordinates which he does not disavow . Another extra-constitutional element of our war government is the creation of a new executive service , based very little on positive statutes . For thirty years we have put important features of the Federal administration into the hands of commissions , partly executive , partly legislative , and partly judicial , not easily held responsible to the President , and exercising vast powers over banks , railroads , corporations , trusts , shipping , and labor . When the war came on , that matter speedily adjusted itself ; for , with the exception of the Federal Reserve Bank , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of operation was  | partly absorbed , partly centralized , and partly prohibited by the war administration . Before the war broke out , a Council of National Defense was formed by Act of Congress which , as soon as war began , developed into a giant organization of administrations , and expert administrative counsellors , such as the world never saw before . It includes boards on aircraft production , munition standards , general munitions , commercial economy , inter-departmental advice , shipping , women 's work , coal production , and co-operation with States . A general advisory commission was added with sub-committees on transportation , engineering and education , munitions , supplies , raw material , labor , press , publicity , cost of living , and medicine and surgery ? all this with adjunct state committees and a multitude of sub-committees . Except the main board , this whole machinery is composed of persons not otherwise connected with the government ; that is , the principle is to bring to the aid of the government the experts throughout the nation . The people have requisitioned engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor leaders , and women of great organizing capacity . To be sure , this complex of boards is contrary to all our traditions and practices . It is against the universally received doctrines of American popular government to seek the counsels , still less to accept the authority , of men who have no official place in the government , who perhaps draw no salaries , who take no part in the executive routine and reach their places through no political influence . On the other hand , the nation has had a splendid lesson in the conservation of the highest-geared man power in the land . It has called upon the business experience of laborious lifetimes , the secret of the laboratory , the skill of the engineer , the science of the trained financier and economist , and made them available for a great public need . If this mighty intellectual force helps to save the country in a crisis , why may it not be used to perpetuate the efficiency  | and safety of the country when the immediate crisis is over ? Perhaps the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing are most competent to put it into operation . These alterations in the form and substance of American government correspond to an almost incredible change in the minds of Americans in regard to their relations with the rest of the world . Among the ideals which are handed down from father to son , or rather from aged Fourth-of-July orators to youngsters in the art of making the American eagle scream , are the twin doctrines of " American isolation " and the " two spheres of influence . " Washington , John Quincy Adams , Monroe , and others of our numerous Fathers first stated these doctrines , and it needs no argument to show that they were adapted to the conditions of a century ago . The United States was then actually isolated by a distance measured by over thirty days of average voyaging in small wooden sailing ships to Europe , and about one hundred and twenty days to Asia . After the revolt of the Spanish American Colonies in the second decade of the nineteenth century , there was a further isolation , because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either of territory or of trade . The Monroe Doctrine was right in asserting then : " With the movements in this hemisphere we are , of necessity , more immediately concerned , and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers . The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America . " Isolation was a condition not a theory ; and it was a fortunate condition for the young republic . The Monroe Doctrine was also right in saying : " The citizens of the United States hold sentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow-men on that side of the Atlantic . In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part , nor does it comport with our policy so to do . "  | Even when the European war broke out in 1914 isolation and the belief that the eastern and western hemispheres were two separate fields of international policy were still ruling motives in the minds of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the preservation of Great Britain and France was essential for our preservation , were looked upon as mere Anglophiles . A considerable part of the press took this view . From these old trenches of tradition and outworn phrases it seemed impossible to dislodge the United States . Nevertheless isolation and the " two spheres " have both gone into the dump . This process was hurried a good twenty years because Germany made four rulings in a twelvemonth , each of which was enough to bring the United States eventually to a conception of the tremendous fact that the United States could not be isolated if the Central Powers got into America ; and that the American sphere was wherever American interests extended . Against our will we learned that German ambitions , German views of the rights of other powers , and German ideas of the rights of neutrals were not " isolated " ; but were world questions which it was impossible for the United States of America to avoid ; that , St. Monroe to the contrary , the United States was expected to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these knock-down arguments was the manner of the outbreak of the European war in 1914 . The first impression that the Kaiser and his entourage flung the brand into the pyre , has since been confirmed by the revelations of Italian statesmen and especially of Lichnowsky . If Germany could make war , on a pretext , for secret and ulterior aims of conquest in Europe and Asia , the time would come when similar temptations of rich lands in weak hands would draw her to South America and the Panama Canal . The second lever which the Germans set free to operate against themselves was the conquest of Belgium , a nation whose protest , as paraphrased by a Chinese sage , was " I  | am a country ; I am not a road ! " Here was proof which nothing could erase , that any other country would be liable to German aggression , if it could be made a German stepping stone to desired objects , and if it contained loot . The frightful military despotism set up in Belgium was simply a warning of what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever become " occupied conquests . " The third convincing German argument against trusting Germans was their establishment of military control over three nominal allies , Austria-Hungary , Bulgaria , and Turkey . The Armenian massacre , which was the rooting out of an Asiatic Christian people by the connivance of a Teutonic Christian people , in behalf of Moslem satraps , has sunk deep into the American heart . We are , however , slower to perceive that a Germanic empire reaching from the North Sea to the Caspian , the Persian Gulf , and the Red Sea , is a world threat against civilization , and a warning to the United States to beware of the mastery of Teutons . The fourth and in the end the decisive weapon put into the hands of the enemies of Germany was the submarine warfare on non-combatants , culminating in the Lusitania horror . We see now , as some insisted then , that the Lusitania could have been destroyed without the loss of a life ; that one hundred and thirteen Americans perished in order to enable the German government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to war . The country backed up the protests and threats of the President ; and Germany hesitated , half apologized , yet in 1917 made a second gambler 's cast and lost ; for Uncle Sam " saw the bluff . " If , as the light-fingered gentry say , " a sucker is born every minute , " it is a cheerful thought that an anti-German has been born every minute since the first day of August , 1914 . Germany is making enemies by millions , not only in every land upon which the foot of her soldier has trod but among the whole population of the United States . Her fierce  | disregard of the weak and the helpless whom fate thrusts into the field of war , has convinced the United States that the world can not live with a victorious Germany . In another direction our cherished international doctrines are fading out because of our own extension across wide seas . Isolation tottered when in 1898 Dewey 's fleet entered the Bay of Manila and we became an Asiatic power . It rocked again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference of Algiciras practically made the decision that Germany must keep out of Morocco . The " two spheres " ideal fell in fragments when the American troops burst into Chateau-Thierry , in line with the British , the French , and the Italians . We have known Uncle Sam a good many years , and remember him in his first suit of Nankin trousers strapped under the instep , his blue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons , and his ancient beaver . It is a little hard to recognize him in khaki , with a smart Stetson hat and the latest model Springfield rifle , hurling himself " over the top . " No nation could have been more drab and unwarlike than the United States in 1860 , when the army consisted of 16,400 men and officers , of whom only 1,500 were on the eastern coast ; yet within four years more than three million different men had enlisted in the Northern or the Southern army . Then , a generation after the war , the land fell back into its old apathy on military matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only aroused but reshaped the nation . In spite of the protests of General Wood and other far-seeing military men , the old methods sagged along until Secretary of War Garrison in 1916 resigned rather than take responsibility for keeping up a decayed militia system . Our experience on the Mexican frontier went far to convince the nation that nobody could make real war without soldiers ; and that there was no real soldier except a trained soldier . When real war broke out therefore , the country for the first time in its history was  | ready to accept an army resting on the bed rock of " universal military obligation . " The much advertised drafts of the Civil War netted for the Union Army , in men physically competent and unable to furnish a substitute , a total of 17,000 men ! The selective draft , which has been in operation hardly more than a year , has already furnished about a million and a half of men , and is preparing to supply a million more at once and indefinite millions as they are needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , is called up for the draft , subject to general and easily understood exemptions , then every drafted man is a full American , who , when his name is called , steps out and answers , " Here . " Doubtless when the war is over , a good part of this vast force will dissolve . Secretary Lane need feel no doubt about the ability of the country to absorb and use these " **32;608;TOOLONG . " Men , real men , live men , experienced men , will be as much needed as ever in civil life . The formidable post-bellum question is , how many of the brave boys will remain brave boys in the service ? So long as there is a Germany or a Turkey in the world , some preparation must be made to meet another surprise war . The most devoted lover of peace finds it hard to sketch a world in which there will not be " police " ; and in a community of nations which includes a Samson you can not take too many precautions in the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League to Enforce Peace include an international army to which the United States would hardly be expected to contribute less than 800,000 troops . Conquest is not in the American thought , particularly in view of the territorial hold which the United States now has in the Pacific and the Caribbean . Some triflers have hinted at the Azores ; but what have we to do in that galley ? We see no need to keep up arms in order to extend our boundaries ; but except in a pacified world , we shall need troops and ships to guard our possessions , and still more to protect our  | coast . The destroyer , the submarine , and the seaplane have upset all previous theories of making the ocean a water trench for defense . In fact , the present peace within our borders is possible only because we have had , while we were putting on armor , another army in Europe standing guard for us . Our gallant defenders have been the Englishmen , Frenchmen , and Italians who desperately locked arms and held back the invader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind the appropriate precaution in Revelations : " And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil and Satan , and bound him a thousand years . " Unless Germany can be bound for a thousand years , which seems very unlikely , we shall have to think in the same terms of preparedness to meet an unexpected attack as have pressed upon our European neighbors . In any case , never will the United States again depend for its salvation upon improvised armies . One reason why there must be a large force of American soldiers and sailors after the war , unless there comes a new kind of world peace , is the specialization of the branches of the art of war . We can no longer get on with infantry , cavalry , and artillery , with fast cruisers and battleships , with field guns and siege guns . No army any longer can expect to take the field without plenteous revolvers , rifles , knives , bayonets , grenades , bomb-throwers , machine guns , balloons , airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gas-men , liaison-men , telephoners , radio-men , and a variety of other special weapons and special troops . We might as well improvise a locomotive works out of a yard full of scrap iron as an army out of mere men . The " million volunteers " who were to appear overnight to save the country are non-suited ; they are out of court ; they can not even plead an alibi , for they were and are nowhere . The whole country is now permeated with the knowledge that war is no longer possible except for nations which can furnish this complicated system of defense and offense , which begin  | years in advance to prepare military material and bring up their sons to sound health , vigorous exercise , and an elementary training in arms . At every step we must keep in mind not only that there has been a revolution in American government and American warfare , but that there can be no counter revolution , because to go back to the old ways is to abdicate as a world power . The same conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long practised the methods of large scale production and fabricated parts of a highly organized transport . Bethlehem was making great guns several years before the United States thought it worth while to place large orders . Great steamship lines were accustomed to load thousands of tons in a few hours and despatch thousands of passengers . The railroads were carrying on an enormous business and daily reaching every station in the country with their shipments . These commercial processes , however , had never been applied by the government or for the government . Hence the scandalous experience at Tampa Bay in 1898 , when the War Department struggled with the terrific problem of getting 17,000 men on board a fleet of waiting transports and carrying them two days ' steaming from the coast of Florida . The army practically broke down under that test , which has been multiplied a hundred times during the last year and been invariably carried out with ease and swiftness . The elements in this great military success are two . The first is the use of experts to make the necessary preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have now learned to do what the German general staff has been doing for a half century ? to make plans in advance . The second feature is the skill with which vast bodies of men have been transported , fed on their journey , and ( what is more significant ) fed after they landed . Inasmuch as an army which receives no provision for five successive days would be destroyed then and there , this prob-  | lem of " eats " lies at the basis of all warfare . The Americans have learned that lesson and will never forget it . All that is possible , however , only because and so long as the great industries of the United States are organized to do big things every day . Private ship builders have been working on the task of providing shipments , mostly for foreign orders , ever since the European war began . There is no reason to believe that they could have met the present emergency by any other process than a nationalization of their industry , which should avail itself of the professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of national authority , and backed up by the national treasury . Ever since 1887 we have been trying to carry the doctrine of the " two spheres " into our internal transportation . The state commissions looked after intrastate business and the Federal Civil Service Commission regulated interstate commerce . Along came that well known magician , Uncle Sam , picked up the two systems . kneaded them together and , presto ! there was , for the first time in our history , a national transportation , performing the one job of carrying freight and passengers , directed by one authority , which if you go back far enough is the President of the United States . Out of the midst of the war is slowly evolving a new labor system . The United States was already deeply entangled in the labor question through the Adamson Bill of 1916 ; and has widely increased its area of contact through taking over the railroads and the telegraphs . It is responsible also for the semi-public labor systems of the shipping industry ; and the munitions factories . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been solved by the process which distinguished the tariff of 1909 , namely , " revision upward . " Though the government has been careful to say that it will not meddle with the question of open shop or closed shop during the war , a strong political force is prying the United States out of its long maintained position  | that it will not permit trades unions of government employees . It has taken over the railroads subject to the closest knit unions in the country . The strong support of the labor leaders , particularly of Mr. Gompers , who occupies one of the seats of the mighty , has been cheering to the government . At the other extreme it has freely used its power to break up ( if possible ) the I. W. W. , which is the sworn enemy of the regular trades unions . It is clearly impossible to set back this gain of labor influence and labor organization . We know what we are ; but we know not what we shall be . Taking these various evidences of national feeling one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is a new country . The great question for the future , and the near future at that , is whether these new and grandiose conceptions can be built up together , so as to make a consistent great nation , understood of its own people . Where will the States stand in such a glorified nation ? What will become of that highly prized division of powers ? Will Congress , will the courts , rest comfortably under the supremacy of executive powers ? All we can say is that after the Civil War , which brought about similar , though far lesser , changes , the nation found itself again . So may it be in the Republic which our sons are to carry on . We admit that we must be efficient in war or go under . Must we not also be efficient in the economic rivalries of the future or go under ? The tree will be known by its fruit .
