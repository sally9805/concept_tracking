txt NORMAL . GRADUATES . Publicity of the Percentage Who Qualify as Teachers . As a further contribution to a vexing question I submit that quite a number of those Normal graduates who are among the 87 per cent . who succeed In attaining License No. 1 have been examined two , three , even four times . Very often young women who fail at the examiners ' hands have been excellent students at the Normal , and a re-examination looks like putting them in jeopardy twice for the same offense , so to speak . A year ago about 80 per cent . failed , this year ' half as many , and with a little more publicity none will fall , since it is a good deal of an outrage all around to have any fail after a four-year course when practically none fall after the two-year course in training school . There is considerable gossip going on In school circles about " coaches " who can tell these unlucky young women who fall after the four years just what is lacking in methods and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long course under excellent teachers at Normal . Tho price for the service is largo in itself , and very largo to young women just out of college . It would be - worth inquiring lust how many of the successful 87 per cent . had a coach or got one after a failure had made them wise , or perhaps after two failures had made them cynical . Publicity is a great thing , and sweet are the uses of advertising .
