The comments thus far made by members of Congress and others on Mr. Wilson 's recommendation concerning the method of nominating candidates for the Presidency , relate chiefly to Congressional legislation on the matter . But apart from the question of the agency there is another point involved in the President 's statement which is well worthy of immediate attention . The party convention , he suggests , should be retained , though constituted upon a different plan ; but it should be held " only for the purpose of accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties . " Now , this goes far beyond the " preference " idea which most people have in mind when speaking of Presidential primaries ; for it precludes the possibility of the convention deciding even between the two candidates , say , receiving the highest number of " preference " votes in the event of nobody having a clear majority . One of the most important questions , therefore , that would have to be considered is that of so dealing with the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious mischief . President Wilson 's explanation to the suffragists of the sharp line which he draws between his private opinions and those which he feels at liberty to urge upon Congress would have delighted the heart of Monsieur Distinguo . It inevitably recalls the schoolboy who , when asked to define the art of logic , said that logic was not an aft but a dodge . We say this quite irrespective of the particular demand made upon the President . He would doubtless have made a like statement to a labor delegation asking what he did not - wish to grant ; and , in either case , it does not square with what we believe to be the sound conception of the Presidency as an office in which initiative and leadership are essential . For that matter , it does not square with President Wilson 's own practice . No Executive has been more insistent or more successful than he in impressing we take it that he would not make a quibbling distinction between doing this in a public message and in earnest interviews with members . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican National Committee is precisely such as common-sense would lead any one to expect . The National Committee , it is declared , has not the power to change the basis of representation , but it has the power to direct that elections of delegates in any State shall be conducted in conformity with the laws of that State , even if these be at variance with the rules established by the party . It has also the power to call a special national convention , giving due notice thereof . At the Chicago Convention of 1912 , the snarl over the conflict between California law and Republican Convention rules furnished a great deal of capital to the Rooseveltians , the like of which can be made impossible hereafter by proper action of the National Committee ; but the main difficulty laty in the flagrant Southern-delegate scandal which the Colonel exploited vociferously . The special convention will undoubtedly take radical action in regard to the basis of representation , which will reduce this element of difficulty to a minimum for the future . But it will doubtless do much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking manifestations of progressive weakness in the Progressive party are calculated to add greatly to the interest with which the gathering of the Republican clans will be watched by the country . In the Secretary of the Treasury 's annual report to Congress , particular interest will be attached to the estimates of future public revenue . The ordinary Government receipts , for the fiscal year ending with last June , were $724,111 , - 000 ; of that amount , $318,891,000 was contributed by customs duties and $344 , - 416,000 by the internal revenue , including excise taxes and the corporation tax . Since the new tariff act and the income tax law went into effect in the first week of October , nearly nine months of the provisions . For the full twelve months ending with next June , Secretary McAdoo estimates a customs revenue of $270,000,000 , or $74,400,000 less than was received under the higher duties of the preceding fiscal year . But the internal revenue he estimates as $407,000,000 , or $62,500,000 more than in the fiscal year 1913 ; this being wholly due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $33,000,000 from corporations and $54 , - 000,000 from individuals , offset by an $8,000,000 compensatory reduction in the corporation excise tax , which , since the new law was passed , has been superseded by the income tax . In the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1915 , when the new law will be in force throughout the year , he expects an income tax yield of $105,000,000 , of which $40,000,000 should come from corporations and $65,000,000 from individuals , while customs revenue will be $69,000,000 less than in the twelvemonth ending last June . Our own expectation is that the income tax will be more productive than the Secretary thinks ; though the factors of uncertainty in such a calculation are numerous . As for the customs revenue , that also has elements which confuse the calculation . Last month , for instance , so far as the figures are at hand , produced a customs revenue only four to five million dollars less than November of either 1912 or 1911 , which would hardly indicate as great a reduction , for the whole pending fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the Treasury finances of the year , Mr. McAdoo naturally makes special point of the placing of Government surplus funds with interior banks , against pledge of commercial paper , to avert an autumn stringency . Of the $50,000,000 thus offered by the Treasury , the national banks , up to November 25 , had taken only $34 , - 661,000 . The Secretary , no doubt correctly , lays as much stress on the psychological effect of the Government 's attitude as on the tangible results of the deposits . Observant financiers were aware , when the Treasury made its offer in midsummer , that the danger to the apprehension of imaginary evils than from actual shortage of funds to move the crops . That the Treasury 's earlier offer to provide emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland act , up to $500,000,000 , should have elicited no requests at all from the banking community , is an incident from which various conclusions may be drawn . Some people are smiling at Secretary McAdoo for his discovery that the Treasury can be made a great engine of altruism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making it the home of the sterner virtues . He has given out a letter offering him a bribe for an appointment to office , together with his severe and crushing reply . The man had proposed to pay the Secretary one-third of his first year 's salary . To the honor of the Administration , be it recorded that Mr. McAdoo was not tempted for an instant . He scorned the " $100 lust as soon as appointed , " and then improved the occasion to read a great moral lesson to the writer of the letter , and , incidentally , to the whole country . He roundly declared that the offer to bribe the Secretary of the Treasury " shows your unfitness for public office " ; and added- " You do not seem to realize that the era of graft and corruption in American politics is past . " Some other things appear also to have passed : among them , one might infer , a sense of proportion and of humor in the Treasury Department . Every Secretary for years must have had idiotic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been discharged if they had not wit enough to throw away , but it remained for Mr. McAdoo to seize upon one peculiarly imbecile in order to demonstrate the Roman virtue of this Administration . In spite of all the efforts of those who sought to preserve for the nation the beautiful valley in the Yosemite National Park which goes by the ill-sounding name of Hetch-Hetchy , the Senate on Saturday passed the bill which sacrifices it to the desire of San Franciscans for a cheaper water supply than , as they believe , they could otherwise obtain . But the proceedings in the Senate , and the final vote , showed how much force there was in the arguments and facts adduced against the scheme . Three months ago , the bill was passed in the House almost unanimously ; the vote in the Senate on Saturday stood only 43 to 20 . When the bill was first brought up in the Senate , an attempt was made to rush it through , and the opposition , at that time represented only by two or three Senators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed day . Under this condition , the gain of strength for the defenders of the park did not suffice to defeat the bill ; but the objections to it , not only on the score of the invasion of the Yosemite , but also because of its effect on the farming lands whose irrigation supply will be cut off , were brought out very strikingly . Senator Works , of California , fought the scheme vigorously ; and a letter was read from one ' of the California Representatives who voted for the bill in the House , but who has discovered that he had been misled as to the facts and is now against it . The bill now goes to the President , with whom rests ultimate responsibility for the decision of its fate . And the paramount consideration in regard to that decision is furnished by the fact that the sacrifice of a national possession of this nature is unjustifiable except upon the clearest possible proof of its necessity . What is the per capita cost of city government , and how does it rise or fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on these questions was lately collected by a State Commission in Minnesota , and is analyzed by Prof. Edward V. D. Robinson in the Economic Review . The answer to the second query is stated briefly : " In Minnesota the cost of municipal government increases much less rapidly than wealth . In other words , while average cost per capita varies directly , average cost by true valuation varies inversely , with the population . " For example , to govern every $10,000 true valuation costs $112.68 in Duluth ; in St. Paul but $110.16 ; and in Minneapolis only $107.49 . Lumping these cities in Class 1 , towns between 20,000 and 5,000 in Class 2 , and those below 5,000 in Class 3 , it was found , again , that , while the per capita cost in Class 1 was $16.65 , in Class 2 $12.01 , and in Class 3 $11.42 , the cost per valuation was , in Class 1 , $107 20 , in Class 2 $127.10 , and in Class 3 $133.83 . Thus every increase of 10 per cent . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government by about two cents for each citizen ; but at the same time it increases the valuation per head about three cents , so that the net result is a gain . Professor Robinson has less definite reasons for believing that the same facts hold good throughout the country . The net result of the Minnesota figures is simply to suggest that in a typical State there rests with the great city an economic advantage in government which would tend to make the city greater still . Certainly , they give no support to the theory that " increasing cost of city government will set a limit to the continued and ever-increasing congestion of population in urban centres , " as compared with habitation in villages and small centres . The death of Col. Gaillard , the conqueror of Culebra Cut , comes pathetically close upon the completion of the historic task . In a very real sense he gave his life to his work . Unremitting toil broke his health , and one likes to imagine that it was only a brave spirit which held him on the Isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried on in the manner of the true workman , outside of the glare of publicity and with thought only for the matter in hand . Had Col. Gaillard lived a few months , the nation would have undoubtedly expressed its recognition of his services . His promotion to brigadier-general is contained in a bill which is now pending in Congress and which has been delayed ' in the stress of business . Public recognition , in addition to such posthumous honors as Congress may decide upon , should now take the form of generous provision for those whom Col. Gaillard has left behind him . The merciless manner in which Villa and his fellow-commanders in the north of Mexico signalize their victories has justly stirred public horror and indignation . But those who would fashion out of the " bandit " Villa an argument against the justice of the cause he represents , fail to make out their case . The ferocity of Mexican warfare might be compared with the greater ferocities of Balkan warfare among Christian nations and allies . But assuming that Villa is an outlaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , what becomes of the argument that the salvation of Mexico rests only in the strong hand of a Dictator ? If the iron rule of Porfirio Diaz could not rid Mexico of brigandage , is it not apparent that Permanent peace in Mexico must come in some other way than through the suppression of popular freedom ? Brigandage on a large scale can not flourish anywhere without the secret support of a discontented population . It was Spanish misrule in lower Italy and Sicily that drove the people to support the marauders and secret societies of which they were so frequently the victims . Brigands though they may be , Villa and Zapata are the products of a political system in which the masses are made to feel that the " law " as administered from above is intended not , for their benefit but for their subjection . Announcement that Lord Cromer , Lord Curzon , and Mr. Bryce have under way a movement for an American branch of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Society should arouse interest here . The- abuses that persist in the darker corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . In Africa , in South America , and in Asia it has been found that the attack upon such evils must be through the awakening of indifferent Governments , and exposure of the methods of development companies . The sensitiveness of diplomatic relations and the interlinking of business interests make it important that civilized society join hands in such measures . If the American branch , which is proposed , could be headed by men like ex-Senator Crane and Booker T. Washington , and could throw a public light on the " shocking labor conditions " which investigators allege to exist in Mexico. , Bolivia , and Peru , reforms of real world-value might follow . Representatives of the three chief parties concerned in Home Rule are on record as desiring an amicable conference . Mr. Asquith 's words were : " I invite an interchange of views and suggestions , free , frank , and without prejudice . " Replying to this invitation , Mr. Bonar Law said that " If the Government have any proposals to make , we will consider them carefully , honestly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to the welfare of the nation . " And the leader of the Irish , John Redmond , with both the previous statements before him , declared that he did not " shut any door upon a possible settlement by consent . " Now comes Asquith 's speech at Manchester accepting the basis of agreement suggested by Sir Edward Carson . This makes it highly probable that some way of adjusting the Ulster difficulty Without fighting will be found . One reason for believing this is the fact that , as the Chief Secretary for Ireland , Mr. Birrell , insisted the other day , the Irish question has now reached such a pass that , even if the Conservatives were to come into power next year , one of the first things they would have to do would be to pass a bill giving Ireland self-government . It is not only in the Senate at Washington that the plague of eloquence derogates . Every year in the House of Commons an heroic member moves that " the length of speeches has increased , is increasing , and ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , where a Deputy has introduced a bill for the repression of eloquence in the Chamber . He would not go so far as one of his colleagues , who proposes to compel orators to stand upon a trap-door in the tribune , which should be sprung the instant they passed the allotted limit of time The bill in question would restrict the number of speakers who could be heard on any measure , and would absolutely forbid any one of them to go beyond twenty minutes . This hold Deputy , M. Beauquier , maintains that , unless a man has absolutely nothing to say , he can say it in twenty minutes ; of course if he has neither ideas nor facts , it will take him longer . There is both reason and human experience behind this opinion . In studying the make-up of the new French Cabinet , it is interesting to recall the nature of the discussion attending the election of M. Poincare to the Presidency of the Republic last January . The advent of M. Poincar ? was hailed in a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as marking the end of Radical ascendency in national affairs , the end of factionalism , and the establishment of a policy of comprehensive patriotism embracing all parties . M. Poincare was the " strong man " who might even raise the Presidency to a position of real influence , and to that extent reduce the influence of the Chamber as expressed through the Cabinet . Specifically , under the new Administration the purification of national politics was to be brought about by the introduction of proportional representation in Parliament . The Cabinet that now takes office is headed by M. Doumergue , a Radical-Socialist , and is made up of members of that group , Radicals and straight-out Socialists . Only one out of a dozen Ministers is said to be in favor of electoral reform . The Minister of Education is M. Viviani , Socialist and arch-enemy of the religious influence in the schools . M. Poincare 's election has thus obviously brought about no revolution in French Government policy . Secrets of European diplomacy are brought to light with sufficient frequency to prove that in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally attributes to us , we are amateurs at the game , mere shirt-sleeved amateurs . The Matti ? , of Paris has just published the text of two secret treaties between Servia and Bulgaria , signed in February , 1912 , or more than half a year before the outbreak of the war with Turkey . From these treaties it plainly appears that some of the European Powers were by no means taken by surprise when the conflict broke out . Russia was kept in touch with the plans of the allies , and Austria-Hungary and Germany were also cognizant of the way things were going ; England and France were in the dark . When , therefore , the European Concert in the early autumn of 1912 pleaded and fulminated against war , the majority of the Concert showed themselves admirable actors . There was a certain sincerity in the assertion of the Powers that the war would not be allowed to change the status quo in the Balkans . It should seem to have . been the hope at St. Petersburg , Vienna , and Berlin , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion , with no vital change in the political situation sand a consequently freer hand for the Powers to pursue their game of benevolent guidance in the Balkans .
