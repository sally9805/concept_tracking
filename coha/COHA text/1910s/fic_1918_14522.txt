SCENE : A room in MADAM LOUISE 'S dressmaking establishment . It is a large bare one in what was once evidently the back room of a city house , and it wears that dreary , betwixt and between air common to such places . It contains little except several chairs , a table , and two long mirrors , also forms upon which dresses in various stages of completion are draped . There is a door right back with a velvet curtain ; at the left some screens form a dressing room . At the back center is an outrageous stained-glass window , portraying an Angel  --  ( So called because of his conventional robes and unearthly yellow hair. ) clad in a glaring costume of lemon-yellow and royal purple , with a Nile-green background . TIME : May or early June , 1917 . When the curtain rises a girl , somewhere in the twenties , wearing an unbecoming black dress and apron , is spreading out a dress carefully on one of the chairs . Her face is rather small and plain , wistful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her pocket , which she studies intently , looking up from it to the window , as if she were comparing a picture there to the Angel in the window . At last she hurries over to the back and stands in an absorbed study of the window . She makes the quick suggestion of a bow to it . JENNY SMITH ( Addressing the man in the window ) You need n't try to be so mysterious , Saint Michael ! ( She says this with triumphant emphasis , displaying a picture in the book ) I 'm on to your number ! ( Nodding ) Yes , I know all about you now . It 's no use pretendin ' I do n't , ' cause I do ! I 'm wise to you even if I never had no beau before . ( Studying the picture in the book again ) It 's a different picture , but I could tell your aristocratic features anywhere !

( Spelling out the title of the book ) J-e-a-n-n-e ,  --  if that ai n't French for Jennie , I do n't know what is ! ( She gazes at him wistfully ) I think you might have told me you was a friend of hers .  --  I would n't have minded , she 's been dead so long ,  --  but  --  ( She sighs deeply , and looks a little grieved ) You do n't never tell me nothin ' . ( She lapses into silence , growing more absorbed in the book . Here another girl enters . She is plump and dark , with a rather pretty , stolid face . Her clothes are cheap , but more stylish than JENNIE 'S , and her hair is elaborately arranged . She regards JENNIE disapprovingly , and going to her , touches her on the shoulder . JENNIE , starting guiltily ) Oh , Mabel , you give me an awful start ! p. 3 MABEL Say , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle o ' the mornin ' ! S'pose Madam Louise had come in ' stead o ' me ? JENNY SMITH I guess I 'd ' a got chucked sure ! But I was all through bastin ' an ' I had to wait . MABEL Ai n't Mrs. Reynolds here yet ? Humph , I s'pose you could n't expect it ,  --  oh , she 'll come all right , when she gets good and ready . ( She begins taking off the dress from one of the forms ) JENNY SMITH ( Holding out the book to her ) You 'd ought to read it , Mabel . I got it down to the library the other night . The books they all looked so awful big an ' profound , an ' then I seen this ,  --  ' t was just my size , an ' there was my name  --  least I knew it must be French for Jennie ,  --  see  --   --  MABEL ( Scrutinizing the title , and pronouncing it so that each letter has its face value ) Jeanne d'Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ! JENNY SMITH ( Dreamily ) Saviour of France she was ,  --  and her only sixteen . MABEL ( Examining the picture ) I do n't think much of her looks  --  the movies beat that ! p. 4 JENNY SMITH ( Still under the spell of the book ) ' T was wonderful ,  --  why , St. Michael came down himself  --  ( Here she glances surreptitiously at the window ) an ' he says to her  --  " My girl ! Rise up an ' save France ,  --  go an ' crown the Dolphin ! " MABEL Awful queer dope ! JENNY SMITH ( Admiringly ) Just to think of a Saint 's comin ' down to converse while you was weedin ' cabbages in your father 's garden ! Why , I done that for years , but I never heard none . MABEL ( Scornfully ) ' Course not ! Only loonies do ! I bet she was n't all there ! JENNY SMITH ( Unshaken ) But she saved them all  --  ( Wistfully ) I wish things ' ud happen like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t would give me the creeps ! JENNY SMITH ( Looking towards the window ) I think St. Michael must ' a looked like him , do n't you ? MABEL You 're an awful queer kid ! Gracious , I do n't know !  --  ( She has finished taking down the dress and suddenly exclaims ) Gee , if I did n't clean forget to hem up that train ! For the love o ' Mike , Jennie , give me a hand with it !  --  She 'll be here any minute ! ( JENNIE helps her )  --  Goin ' to get your two weeks off ? p. 5 JENNY SMITH Yes , Madam Louise told me last night  --  I 'm goin ' week after next . MABEL I 'm awful glad . JENNY SMITH ( Ecstatically ) I 'm goin ' to buy my ticket to-night ! MABEL What 's your hurry ? JENNY SMITH I thought I 'd have the ticket to look at  --  ' t would give me an ' awful pleased feelin ' to have it by me evenin 's ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more company than an old green ticket , n ' matter how much it cost ! Ai n't you ever lonesome ? JENNY SMITH ( Hesitating ) I  --  I was  --  when I first come . There was so many of us at home , you could n't move without kinda gettin ' mixed up with somebody ! MABEL ( Sagely ) You 'd oughter get somebody to keep company with  --  it 's awful easy once you get ' em started ! JENNY SMITH ( Hastily ) Oh , I ai n't lonesome  --  not now  --  MABEL ( Her mouth full of pins ) You have n't took up with anyone , have you ? JENNY SMITH ( Nervously ) N  --  n  --  not with anyone you know ! p. 6 MABEL ( Sitting back on her heels and eyeing JENNIE sharply ) Jennie Smith , d ' you mean to tell me you 've hooked a swell or somethin ' on the side ? JENNY SMITH ( Alarmed ) Oh , I ai n't  --  I ai n't  --  Only everybody talks ' bout things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be cross with me , Mabel ! Do n't cast me off forever ! MABEL ( Mystified ) Where 'd you get that dope ? I never said I 'd chuck you ! JENNY SMITH ( Quoting dreamily ) Some folks just plays with you an ' then they casts you off forever !  --  Like  --  like discarded garments ! MABEL Say , I wish you 'd be more plain spoken ! I get you , though ,  --  I seen ' em do it ! They squeezes you and squeezes you , an ' then out you goes like a used-up lemon ! I 'm on to guys like that ! JENNY SMITH I 'm wise , too . I knew you was n't that kind ! MABEL I guess not !  --  Say , what sort o ' jaunt you plannin ' ? JENNY SMITH ( Glowing with eagerness ) I 'm goin ' home .  --  I ai n't been there for three years . It 's along trip ,  --  you start at four o'clock an ' you do n't get there till ten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be terrible expensive all night on the train ! JENNY SMITH It is  --  but I 've been here most three years an ' I have n't took no vacation . Oh , I 've been savin ' up for this . I 'm goin ' in the sleeper , an ' I 'll have dinner in the diner with the black men in white coats waitin ' on me ,  --  an ' when I go out , I 'll leave twenty-five cents on the table ,  --  just careless like , as if ' t was nothin ' to me ! Oh , I 'm goin ' to travel in style ! MABEL ( Admiringly ) My , it 'll cost a lot ,  --  how much d ' you save ? JENNY SMITH ( Trying to look unconscious ) Fifty-three dollars an ' eighty-one cents . MABEL Say , you done well ! JENNY SMITH It took me three years ,  --  ' course I could a done it sooner if Ma had n't run short when the insurance come due , an ' if I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter ! MABEL I could n't have done it in ten ! I just have to take in all the movies ,  --  I ca n't lay round an ' fritter my evenin 's away in light occupation like some do ! JENNY SMITH The movies is terrible fascinatin '  --  but I 've had to save  --   --  p. 8 MABEL Well , I hope you get your money 's worth ,  --  ' course , if I had that much ' t would be roofgardens , an ' the theater , an ' dancin ' every night for mine ! JENNY SMITH They 're nice I s'pose , when you get used to ' em , but someway things from back where I come from seems lots realer ! ( She hugs her arms ecstatically ) Two weeks an ' I 'll be there ,  --  Mabel , I 'll be walkin ' up Uncle Jo 's hill , it lands you all of a sudden in our apple-orchard  --   --  MABEL ( The ever practical ) Too bad there wo n't be no apples so early ! JENNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeny fuzz on ' em ! MABEL Hand me the pins , will you ! JENNY SMITH ( Giving them to her and going on ) They 'll all come runnin ' down to meet me ,  --  Bill 's taller'n Uncle Jo now , an ' Sally wears long dresses an ' goes to high school , an ' Sam an ' Mary 'll be tryin ' to see which of ' em can get to me first ,  --  the baby 'll be four now , an ' runnin ' after ' em  --  an ' mother 'll be waitin ' in the door ready to pop dinner on the table ! MABEL ( Without enthusiasm ) Pleasant life all right ! p. 9 JENNY SMITH An ' I 'll have it for two whole weeks  --  my , it 'll be fine to go by houses again ! MABEL Houses ? Land , ai n't the city full of ' em ? JENNY SMITH ( Puzzled ) Oh , I s'pose so  --  but I always think of ' em as just buildin 's where folks live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' plate glass windows  --  an ' the streets without plate glass windows is worse than the others ! Home , the houses is all mixed in with grass an ' trees , an ' the windows has little panes o ' glass  --  an ' there 's always eyes watchin ' out of ' em  --  ( There is a murmur of voices outside ) MABEL ( Quickly ) Say , get on the band-wagon , Jennie , they 're comin ' ! JENNY SMITH ( Getting up slowly ) Seems as if could n't wait for week after next ! ( A large , well-groomed , expansive lady appears in the curtained doorway . She speaks condescending pleasantry to someone behind her whom the audience does not see . ) MRS . REYNOLDS Thank you , Madam Louise ,  --  how attractive your new rooms are  --  a great improvement on the old quarters ; so much more sun and air . I 'm sure the dresses ought to be more sanitary made under these conditions . Houses are so much pleasanter than regular office buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the old dining room ,  --  ( Noticing the stained-glass window , and eying it with superior amusement ) though how anyone could eat with such a monstrosity ,  --  such hideous , glaring colors ! ( She studies it ) What a figure ! It 's enough to make the Saints turn in their graves ! p. 10 JENNY SMITH ( Incredulously ) You  --  you was n't speakin ' of St. Michael in the window , was you ? MRS . REYNOLDS ( Starting , perceiving the girls ) Oh , good morning . St. Michael , did you say ? Well , I only hope his namesake has n't seen this ,  --  it 's enough to set one 's teeth on edge ! JENNY SMITH I  --  I never noticed nothin ' wrong with it ! MRS . REYNOLDS ( Smiling with superiority ) Well , of course , it 's only dreadfully out of drawing , with horribly crude colors , and as for the expression  --  MABEL ( Grimly ) I do n't have much time for studyin ' its beauty  --  your dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They go into the dressing room behind the screens at the left . JENNIE gazes at the window with a hurt and puzzled look . At length she goes over and speaks to it , softly ) JENNY SMITH Do n't you mind her . It 's awful tough luck when people do n't take to your particular style o ' looks . ( Sighing ) I know ' cause they never do to mine ! St. Michael , they says worse things than that about me ! ( There is a moment of silence as she watches him ) But I do n't mind ,  --  I can see your aristocratic nature shinin ' through the infirmities of the flesh ! ( She makes him another little bow ) We should worry , St. Michael . ( She turns away as MRS . REYNOLDS and MABEL emerge from the dressing room . MRS . REYNOLDS has slipped on a handsome black satin dress with a long train , and much sparkling jet trimming on the front . She stands before one of the mirrors , turning and twisting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me drape this , so you can get the effect . Give me a hand here , Jennie . ( Thy both set to work , JENNIE on her knees pinning , and MABEL hovering over her , directing and adjusting . MRS . REYNOLDS beams upon them , assuming the manner with which she is wont to address " worthy working girls . " ) MRS . REYNOLDS Madam Louise said I might say a few words to you girls about something that is very vital to all of us these days  --  MABEL ( Abstractedly ) Yes , M 'm . MRS . REYNOLDS Of course , I need n't tell you that every girl in this country wants to do her " bit " in the war ,  --  ( To JENNIE ) Wait , not so high ,  --  looser , yes , that 's more like it !  --  You 're both patriotic , I know  --   --  MABEL ( Glibly ) Oh , yes , I 've knit two sweaters an ' a muffler already . MRS . REYNOLDS That is excellent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice ,  --  have you ever really given anything to your country ? MABEL Why , you see , Ma an ' Pa generally gets what I earn , so the U. S. A. do n't have much chance ! p. 12 MRS . REYNOLDS ( Ignoring this ) We 're all supporting the government by buying its bonds  --  ( Impatiently ) Not so near the waist ,  --  drop it two inches !  --  Of course , some of us are doing more than others . ( Impressively ) I 'm giving my two sons to the country . MABEL ( With polite interest ) Is that so ? JENNY SMITH You mean they 're soldiers ? MRS . REYNOLDS ( Hastily ) Practically ,  --  one is in Washington , and the other is collecting statistics for a munition plant . This dress is for his wedding  --  ( Smoothing the lustrous folds ) We wanted everything simple and in keeping with this national crisis . JENNY SMITH Are the bonds you was speakin ' of real expensive ? MRS . REYNOLDS They 're cheap  --  just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  some are a thousand ,  --  a hundred ,  --  and fifty dollars  --  JENNY SMITH Fifty dollars ? MABEL That 's a lot  --  MRS . REYNOLDS ( Reprovingly ) It 's small enough when it 's a chance to serve your country , and Democracy , and  --  and keep Slavery and Oppression from this free land of ours ! Fifty dollars will help equip a soldier to fight for us over there . p. 13 JENNY SMITH ( Interested ) Will there be a soldier for everyone ? MRS . REYNOLDS ( Giving an impatient start ) Oh , that pin  --  it 's sticking in me ,  --  no , the other side !  --  ( Relapsing into her most oratorical manner ) Of course , we ca n't go and fight for our country , but we can give up our little luxuries and extravagances so that Liberty 's flame may burn more clearly and steadily to be a light for the generations that shall follow after us ! ( To JENNIE ) That 's short enough ! MABEL ( Skeptically ) Some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . REYNOLDS ( Sternly ) Everyone can make some sacrifice . ( Drawing out some papers from her bag and putting them on the table ) These will tell you all the details . ( MABEL leads her to the dressing room , but her voice may still be heard , and JENNIE listens , a puzzled frown puckering her face ) I hope you girls will think this over carefully . Your country has enrolled itself in the most supreme issue that has ever faced the peoples of the world .  --  We are siding against injustice and despotism ,  --  are you going to let freedom and enlightenment be trampled out forever ? I know you are both patriotic ,  --  you are , are n't you ? p. 14 MABEL ( Speaking from behind the screen ) yes , m 'm . JENNY SMITH ( Fervently ) Oh , yes , indeed  --   --  MABEL When do you wish the dress sent ? MRS . REYNOLDS Oh , I must have it to-morrow . MABEL We 'll try , but if it could be the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tomorrow . MABEL If the wedding do n't come then  --  MRS . REYNOLDS ( Impatiently ) The wedding has nothing to do with my having that dress tomorrow ! MABEL ( Resignedly ) Well , we 'll do our best , but it 'll mean staying late  --  ( There is an indistinct murmur behind the screens and presently MRS . REYNOLDS appears . She smiles patronizingly to the girls . ) MRS . REYNOLDS I hope you 'll remember about the Liberty Bonds , girls , and do your duty ,  --  it 's a privilege , you know ! ( She goes out majestically ) MABEL ( With spirit ) I notice she do n't offer to pay us for workin ' extra time on that dress ! An ' her precious darlin ' what 's servin ' his country so beautiful in Washington , D. C. , ai n't killin ' himself , I 'll bet ! p. 15 JENNY SMITH ( A worried look creeping into her face ) I guess she meant all right , but I did get kinda mixed up ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MABEL ( With spirit ) She 's a good one to talk about duty  --  she do n't know it by sight ! ( Glancing at the clock ) Well , you comin ' out for lunch ? It 's twelve . If you want I can help you look for the dress an ' hat you 're goin ' to buy with what 's left over from the ticket . I know a real swell place where you can get awful " chick " things ! JENNY SMITH ( Slowly ) I guess I wo n't  --  not this noon , Mabel . I 'll eat some lunch here .  --  Maybe tomorrow  --  MABEL ( Good-naturedly ) Oh , all right , suit yourself , any time  --  ( She exits humming ) ( JENNIE goes behind the screen , returning with a small package of lunch . She seats herself by the table where she commands a good view of St. Michael , and munches a sandwich thoughtfully , gazing at him all the time . ) JENNY SMITH ( Shaking her head sadly ) You talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello " to me ! ( But the Angel makes no sign and at last she turns to the book . She opens it and soon becomes absorbed , the sandwich still half eaten in her hand . JENNIE , reading aloud to herself , rather slowly and painstakingly , stumbling occasionally over some long word . JENNIE , reading ) " Ten centuries of sleep were ended , and heralded by this extraordinary girl , mankind rose to clear away an ac  --  ac  --  cu  --  mul  --  ation of injustices and wrongs , preparin ' the world for a new epoch ! " ( Her face grows puzzled again ) Why that 's what she said they 'd do  --  it 's queer . ( She turns the pages and reads fragments here and there ) " And the voice came almost at the hour of noon , in summer , in her father 's garden . "  --  " And Jeanne answered him and said  --  " I am a poor girl , knowing neither how to bestride a horse , nor how to make war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till by this time nothing is distinct except JENNIE 'S figure bending over the book . Suddenly a brightness begins to show in the place where the window was . This grows steadily brighter , until St. Michael himself appears in the frame of the window . He is dressed as before , only the colors of his robe are no longer crude , but luminous , and his face is grave and beautiful . He stretches out his hand towards JENNIE , who starts up with a cry . He speaks in a low , thrilling voice. ) p. 16 ST . MICHAEL Jennie Smith  --   --  JENNY SMITH ( Dropping on her knees , and speaking in glad awe ) Oh , St. Michael ,  --  you 've spoke to me ! I knew you would sometime ! ST . MICHAEL ( Continuing ) Jennie Smith , ai n't you goin ' to be patriotic ? JENNY SMITH Oh , Sir , I 'd like to be  --  ST . MICHAEL ( Fixing searching eyes upon her ) Are you doin ' your duty ? JENNY SMITH Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ST . MICHAEL I 'm a callin ' of you , Jennie Smith , an ' your country 's a callin ' you  --  to help the war ! JENNY SMITH ( Helplessly ) Oh , St. Michael , I do n't know nothin ' ' bout war . ST . MICHAEL You must serve them that fights for their country with gun and sword . JENNY SMITH I 've never had nothin ' to do with swords ,  --  scissors an ' needle an ' thread 's been my line . ST . MICHAEL ( Commandingly ) Rise up , Jennie Smith ! ( She stumbles to her feet ) It 's up to you to keep the flame o ' Liberty burnin ' bright an ' steady for them that 's comin ' after you . p. 17 JENNY SMITH I  --  I want to  --  ST . MICHAEL ( Searchingly ) Are you goin ' to do your duty an ' keep slavery an ' oppression from this land ? JENNY SMITH Ye  --  es , St. Michael  --  ST . MICHAEL ( Calmly ) You an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pleading as the significance bursts upon her ) Oh , St. Michael , ai n't there no other way ? ST . MICHAEL There is not , Jennie Smith ,  --  I 'll be watchin ' of you to see you performin ' your duty . JENNY SMITH ( Noticing that the light is dimmer ) Oh , you ai n't leavin ' me ,  --  you wo n't go back again ? ST . MICHAEL The time has come when we must part ,  --  but remember , Jennie Smith , remember  --   --  ( The light dies out and for a moment the room is in darkness . When it returns to its normal light , everything is as usual , except that JENNIE is standing with her arms stretched out towards the window ) JENNY SMITH ( Repeating dazedly ) Do n't go back again , St. Michael ! ( He remains passive . She gets up and goes to him , touching him wonderingly ) You 're just the same as ever , but  --  ( Thrilling with awe and pride ) you 've spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I ai n't nothin ' but a dressmaker 's assistant ! ( She moves away still studying his face ) But , no ,  --  you ai n't just the same ! ( In sudden alarm ) Oh , St. Michael , please do n't look at me like that ! Do n't you do it ! ( She covers her face ) If you only would n't look so sorrowful ,  --  is it about one of them bonds ?  --  Oh , dear , I knew it was ! ( She is silent , then gathering up her courage she speaks in a sort of pleading defiance ) Just one fifty dollars ai n't goin ' to make Liberty 's light no brighter , an ' it makes a heap o ' difference to me  --  goin ' home , an ' havin ' store clothes , an ' the dinin ' car , an ' everythin ' ! Do n't you see how ' t is ? ( She looks at him again , but again she turns away , twisting her hands nervously ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? ( Then she turns away and goes to the table , as she stands there fingering the papers idly ,  --  her eyes fall on the Liberty Bond slips MRS . REYNOLDS left . She takes one up and puzzles over the contents ) " To equip one soldier ,  --  item ,  --  socks , trousers , two shirts and a hat and leggins , fifteen dollars ,  --  item ,  --  two pair shoes , five dollars each ,  --  ( Under her breath ) My , they 're terrible dear .  --  One heavy overcoat , ten dollars , one blouse , seven-fifty  --  ( At this she suddenly brightens ) Say , St. Michal , could n't I make him a blouse an ' coat ?  --  I 'd buy the cloth an ' a real good pattern ,  --  an ' you know I can sew ! ( She gazes at him hopefully ) Wo n't you let me do that instead ? ( No change takes place in his expression , and JENNIE is crestfallen ) Oh , I know how that soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes did n't look just like the bought-ent ones . ( Sighing ) I 've known how ' t is not to look like other folks , an ' have ' em laugh . No , you 're right , St. Michael , ' twould n't do ! ( She takes another look at the window to see if her words have produced any effect , then she looks hastily away ) Oh , I ca n't stand seein ' you look so sorrowful an ' know ' t was all because o ' me not doin ' my duty ! If you was to cast me off forever ,  --  an ' you my only beau  --  ( Making a desperate appeal ) I 'm starin ' you in the eye , I am , an ' if there 's any other way o ' keepin ' Liberty 's torch burnin ' ' sides my givin ' the money , you can just stop lookin ' so sad .

But I wo n't say a word if you 'll just look pleased again . ( She writes slowly and painstakingly , and when she has finished , she reaches down and extracts a roll of bills from her stocking . She counts out fifty dollars , replacing the remaining three eighty-one ) There ! ( She puts it all into an envelope , licking it down firmly to avoid further temptation to change her mind . She walks to the window and stands before it , holding out the envelope , hardly daring to look up ) You 'll like me still , wo n't you , St. Michael ? An ' you wo n't feel bad no more ? ( Just as she raises her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights it up ,  --  not with the luminous brightness of the first time , but enough to convince JENNIE , who gives a glad little cry ) p. 18 ST . MICHAEL ( Voice sounding from far away , but kind and pleased )
