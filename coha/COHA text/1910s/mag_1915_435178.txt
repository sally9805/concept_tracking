THE history of criticism is a melancholy one . I have read that in the year NOG , the year in which King Lear and Macbeth were presented to the happy multitude , Ben Jonson , ' who was criticism incarnate , ' who loathed the general public , ' declared that English drama was going to the dogs . For excellent reasons time does not avenge every writer slighted of the critics as it avenged William Shakespeare ; but conflicts between orthodoxy and the despised public have by no means always ended in orthodoxy 's favor . Such issues have taught nothing , however . At Edinburgh sixteen years ago , Mr. Augustine Birrell , who possibly has not a great deal to learn from younger essayists in the criticism of literature , delivered an address entitled , ' Is it possible to tell a good book from a bad one ? ' But what to Mr. Birrell is a feat of fine discrimination , extremely difficult , ' he says , is , and has always been , a simple affair to the conventional appraiser of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spirit goes marching on . Temperamental reactions still assume the airs of the judgments of Olympus . Awful disagreements among the temples , so frequent and so delightful to the ungodly , the ghastly mistakes of predecessors , hanging over all the field of literature like dead men in the trees , these things sound no tinkle of warning in closed doctorial ears . And who would have it otherwise ? This fulfills the law . Dogma was always the truevoice of orthodoxy , and a grave cocksureness is the proper crutch of the lamest of all arts . It is no moment to be trifling with the international comity , but let us remember that it was not we who threw the first stone . And after all , our fatal fascination for the critics of Great Britain is too old a story to draw blood now . If , in the department of letters , the tendency to cousinly correction has seemed unusually active of late , that is a mere psychologic rhythm , no doubt , a wave . The thing might be just worth a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suavest of his compatriots , but clearly with small hope of American literature in this generation . I recall Mr. W. L. George , charging upon us , if memory serves , bare of critical laurels won elsewhere ; his proud and particular contribution being that he knew our literature solely through three contemporary native writers , all of whom he found very national and very inferior . ' More recently I was struck , decidedly so , by the utterances of Mr. Edward Garnett ; 1 of whom more anon . I note in passing that Mr. Garnett hopes to discuss ' us again , at no distant date . Naturally . That he is not alone in England with this hope we may be reasonably confident . Meanwhile , just at the moment of writing , there comes to hand Mr. James Stephens , an Irish author , whose grasp of English grammar is not , I am convinced , displayed to the best POOR AMERICA advantage in the following sentence from his pen : ' It America has not yet had the leisure to evolve a social order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual to itself , and against the background of which every facet of the national existence may be judged . ' But Mr. Stephens , however worried by his whiches , is not the man to mince words . It is a pleasure to spread this example of urbane and well-considered criticism : ' American writers says Mr. Stephens have not learned how to write ; their thoughts are superficial , they have no critical intelligence , and they have the sad courage of these disabilities . ' Now as this sort of thing is not novel , neither is it very important , perhaps . The truth seems to be that casual criticism rarely amounts to more than the disclosure of somebody 's point of view : a disclosure often beautifully unconscious , a point of view of quite variable and uncertain value . Mr. Brown-ell 's apt phrase , the irresponsibility of pure temperament , ' helps to explain many critical curiosities . And certainly the ' condescension in foreigners ' would not be worth mentioning at all at this day , were it not for one striking circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority in this country . It is certainly arresting that the transatlantic attack , however crude or violent , seldom evokes the smallest resentment on this side of the water . The uncommonly quaint specimen quoted was itself first encountered as the text of an editorial article in one of our most respected periodicals ; but the American editor betrayed nowhere any sense that our critic was himself conceivably subject to criticism . No , we take assault and battery with all the tameness becoming to inferiors . So far from rushing to the rescue of our buffered writ ers , our guides and philosophers make haste to declare that it is all true , only more so ; and , not to be caught napping , in dull times dully repeat the tale of our shame , without any foreign incitation whatever . Thus the situation , instead of lightening , is constantly intensified . Language grows harsher as the tale grows more threadbare , as the sense of numbers gives waxing assurance . We may doubt whether Mr. James Stephens would have had the sad courage of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . So , too , in our own country . In a New York newspaper symposium last spring , a young American writer , himself rather popular perhaps than destined for the ages , referred offhand to the present base condition of literature in the United States . ' The youthful judge offered no justification for his vivid language ; one does n't need to justify a commonplace . And all authority , all British orthodoxy and its loyal native following , seems agreed that contemporary American literature is base , ' and contemporary American writers of a character which instinctively produces baseness , as a hen produces an egg. / Such unanimity is uncommon ; it seems overpowering and final . But is it so indeed ? May we not remember the foible of orthodoxy , the critic 's cautious passion to be regular ' ? Should we not even frankly discount the rare unanimity with that known critical tendency toward the congregated and conventional , than which ? it is again Mr. Brownell who speaks ? nothing is more insidious ' ? 1 The spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholson , who , in the October Atlantic , set out with the apparent intention of defending American literature , but actually devoted most of his space to telling what was the matter with it . ? Too AuTnolt . Mr. Edward Garnett was introduced to dark America through the medium of a biographical note in the Atlantic Monthly , last December . We must not jest about the testimonial from Mr. John Galsworthy ; these matters are serious . For the rest , Mr. Garnett introduced himself , surely in no faltering tones . I read his remarks on the subject of American fiction with a hearty and constant sense of opposition . Finishing my perusal in a state of extreme irritation ( for even low Americans have their rudimentary feelings , I suppose ) , I thought : ' Really , somebody ought to reply to our plain-speaking cousin ; some vigorous American writer of high standing and independence . ' Whereon , almost as if at a cue in a play , I was told that just such a person was to reply to Mr. Garnett ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly expectant , I will confess it , of a memorable reprisal upon the insular self-satisfactions of Britain . Naturally , these artless feelings were born but to die . When I came at last upon the promised reply I read with opening eyes and a falling crest . Mr. Owen Wister 's intentions had , of course , been totally misrepresented to me . Unseemly quarreling was , only too obviously , the last thing in his mind . It might indeed have seemed that few persons on earth stood less in need of mere corroboration than Mr. Garnett ; nevertheless Mr. Wister 's merely corroborative purposes became unmistakable from his third paragraph . Here I encountered , with a start , an old acquaintance of mine , in that sentence beginning , as it usually does , ' The reason why Americans are so fond of bamboozle , generally preferring sham to reality . . ' That seemed to settle it ; after bamboozle , I hardly needed to meet , later on , the Subsidized Press , VOL. 116 - NO. 6 that favorite bugaboo of Mr. William Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bamboozle assured me , once for all , that we had but the old sermon again , though charmingly re-trimmed ; the thrice-slain slain again with the odd but delightful high spirits of youth ; no champion at all , but only a lusty new recruit in the respectable chorus which chants forever of the baseness of America . This was no ordinary recruit , however ; far from it . The assailant of the popular American nog el this time was himself an American novelist of extreme popularity : which several facts invested his positions with a significance and weight not attachable to the alien critic , of however recognized authority . ' Moreover there was the remarkable vigor of the new attack , a ruthless ex-terminative vigor , quite eclipsing what had gone before . Space lacks for general comparisons . But at least it must be noted that it was Mr. Wister , not Mr. Garnett , who broadly implied that American novelists are literary prostitutes . And it was Mr. Wister 's sense of proportion , not Mr. Garnett 's , which unlimbered six columns upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Rapids Herald and the Providence Telegram ( whose ' critics ' are possibly also their society editors , ' only too thankfully accepting the canned enthusiasm of the publishers ) , as fair evidence of the critical standards of America . It is Mr. Wister 's singular triumph that he has left Mr. Garnett looking as meek as Moses . But his accomplishment is larger than that . By reason of the several circumstances just noted , he seems to gather into himself , he ousts and replaces , all predecessors in the well-worn field . Nor can we say that such a sweeping of the lists was inadvertent exactly . Glance a moment at that passage , comparatively sweet , in which Mr. Wister hustles large bodies of competing critics off the stage . Lest certain genteel critics he writes who think they practice more discrimination than this , feel slighted , it may be well to explain here why they have so little influence . It was amusing to notice how some of them ? the Chicago Dial , for instance ? hastened to asseverate that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had always said so themselves . So they had . They do , tepidly , discriminate ; they do , after the fact , perceive and praise merit . They all ? the New York Times , the New York Sun , the Boston Evening Transcript , the New York Evening Post ( very typical , this last one ) , with others of less note  --  stand ever ready to be the first to hail a perfectly well-established artist . ' However , to me the really intriguing thing about this passage was not the pointedness of the punitive raid at all . Rather it was the writer 's fine unconsciousness of the fact that his description of ' genteel criticism ' appeared to fit the body of his own remarks ? well , better than a suit from Poole 's , say . I , at least , had found nothing at all in Quack Novels and Democracy ' but that the author of it , strangely like the Chicago Dial , was hastening to asseverate that he has always known what Mr. Garnett said ; that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the fact , perceive and praise merit ; and that , indistinguishably one with all conventional critics of every age and clime , he stood ever ready to be the first to hail a perfectly well-established artist . Is this unfair , mere coarse repartee ? Well , it seems to be largely a question of literal fact . What merit , in truth , has our critic praised before the fact , what sincere but neglected artist does he , more courageous than the genteel , summon to banquet beneath his spotlight ? I have searched his sentences in vain for one reckless championship . To be sure , he is rather more liberal here than the Briton , who has prudently confined his approval of America almost exclusively to the dead . ( 0 happy dead ! ? safe predigested food of timid criticism ! ? surely you must look down sometimes from where you are , and laugh and roar at the belated garlands ! ) But where , among his cited living , are the gallant discoveries ? Margaret Deland , William Allen White , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is it some delusion of the tricksy brain , or am I really right in thinking that the Dial , the Transcript , and the rest of the reproved have long since anticipated Mr. Wister 's guarded celebration of these perfectly well-established artists ' ? III But that is a detail . The American novelist 's preemption of the centre of the stage gives to his argument , as I believe , an importance entitling it to unusual consideration . And his target , of course , is not the critics of America . No , the frontal attack is upon the American people , in extenso ; in chief , upon their national vulgarity as exhibited in their capacity of a Reading Public . In these words ( I mark with capitals the abused but convenient term ) Mr. blister states his thesis for us with splendid lucidity : It is the books that concern Mr. Garnett ; it is their readers that concern me . Publishers cowardly ; critics worthless ; novelists false ; why ? Be- cause it is successful to be so . But why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American people ' ? bamboozle , sham , baseness , and so forth . ' Phrases and falsehood were made bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh ' ? thus our American spokesman historically accounts for us in a graceful passage . Now to say , or imply , that American novelists , generally , falsify their impressions of life , with the low design of tickling dollars from a Public ingrown to falsehood ? this is indeed a charge sufficiently comprehensive and damaging . Novelists and People alike might justly wish to inquire the grounds of so cutting an indictment . And when they come to search , as of right , for the solid bones of the impressionistic argument , ? for what the vulgar would call proof , in fine , ? they find themselves confronted with evidences such as these : 1 . The alleged deterioration of two American writers under the temptation of the cheap magazine . 2 . Several critical sentences taken from the Grand Rapids Herald , the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch , the Oregon Journal , and the Providence Telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 . The popularity of the Cosmopolitan . The first of these evidences of national vulgarity the smitten Public will find , I fear , beyond the reach of argument . It is not for all of us to search the hearts of strangers , and capture their most secret and subtle impulses to point a saying . Perhaps we might doubt at least whether any American geniuses have been tampered with , whether the Cosmopolitan has cost us a single masterpiece . Perhaps we might feel that though the wanton deterioration of two American talents , or four , could be proved unanswerably , that would still be some distance from saying that such prostitution is the habit of American novelists . ' They assail money , ' says the resolute Mr. Wister , in hopes to fill their pockets with it . ' Maybe so ; I have no clairvoyance here . I lack , too , Mr. Wister 's familiarity with the works of Mr. Harold Bell Wright , and must acknowledge that I skipped his long burlesque on them . I believe I have the drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow triumph . Mr. Meredith Nicholson has anticipated me in urging Mr. Wister 's attention to the literary taste of England , as evidenced by the sales figures of Mrs. Barclay , Mr. Hall Caine , and Miss Marie Corelli . The retort appears entirely sufficient . And similarly with the matter of comparative criticism . Whenever Mr. Wister feels inclined to generalize concerning England , I dare say he can match his humorous extracts from obscure American newspapers with kindred bits from the Land 's End Sentinel , say , or the Yarmouth Fisherman . That taste ' runs everywhere in higher and lower levels , and that what we consider the lower levels run wide and deep through all peoples known to history ? this is an observation so jejune that one must apologize for asking attention to it . But the gaze of our critics is not seldom so passionately concentrated that the international aspects of truth , however truistic , seem to elude them altogether . Such oversights are unfortunate in argument ; and Mr. Wister 's whole thesis , as I believe , is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposition that a particular division of the Public , chosen as obviously easy to chastise , is none other than the Public . Of course the fact is that there are a great number of publics , everywhere overlapping indeed , but never by any chance merging in unity to prove a special plea . ' Of this basic oversight ? or should one say this gift of happy selection ? ? Mr. Winter 's remarks about the Cosmopolitan seem to furnish an excellent illustration . That the Cosmopolitan is a considerably meretricious mixture , most cleverly concocted to sell like hot cakes , and that it does meet the taste of a very large number of American readers ( and English readers , if you please ? observe the prevalence of Nash 's on the British bookstalls ) , I , at least , should not think of denying . But why is it assumed that this particular public is the true and representative Public , that it is the American people , in short ? Why , look at the size of it ! we imagine the critic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we immediately observe that if the Cosmopolitan , with its million circulation , ' really represents America , then the Saturday Evening Post , with its two million circulation , must represent America twice as much . My own feeling , indeed , is that the figures quite fail to give the true relation here . I should say that the Satur- day Evening Post was five times , or ten times , as representative of America as the Cosmopolitan . In the Saturday Evening Post we have a periodical sole and unique in the history of periodicals : a magazine which enters a larger proportion of the homes of a people than was ever dreamed of before , which is read four times a month at every crossroads and haystack in America . So far as there is or can be such a homogeneity as the American Reading Public , I should say that the Saturday Evening Post does represent it , truly , nationally , and remarkably . Therefore , I think that Mr. Wister , in setting about his studies of our national taste in periodicals , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not help thinking that if he had only remembered the Saturday Evening Post even for a minute or two , he would not have been nearly so much ashamed of us . Not everything printed in that amazing magazine is literature , certainly . But no one has ever said , to my knowledge , that its appeal was mean , shameful , corrupt , or falsified . It does display , I must confess , a certain amount of miserableAmerican optimism , ' of accursed patriotism even . But then , it never prints the sugared sex stuff ' ; it never toys with scandal , or muckrakes even , throws abroad no vulgar boasts of itself ; and it has let the Cosmopolitan buy away the writers specially named by Mr. Wister as producing quack novels ' for the money there is in it . On the other hand , for its enormous public , the Saturday Evening Post commands , at its pleasure , the services of many of the most distinguished authors of England and America . Prominent among these writers of distinction must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seem , the Saturday Evening Post published from the pen of Mr. Wister an article on the European war , which a certain publisher , reckoned one of the keenest critics we have , advised me to read as the best war piece he had yet seen . I note that the author 's own publisher , in bringing out this article as a book , pays it the same high tribute . But what did the Saturday Evening Post of all periodicals , so frankly catering , not to the Mr. Garnetts of this weary world , but to the gross millions whom they despise , want with so distinguished a piece of writing ? Is it conceivable that the most successful of all American magazines can be right in its belief that the so-called Reading Public of America includes innumerable entirely undistinguished persons who are quite capable of appreciating the best that can be given to them ? IV All of which seems to bring us logically to the great root-question : Is the gulf between orthodox good taste and the taste of the base American quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us believe ? That question is the quintessence of t he disagreement . And it is after all largely a question of literal comparison , of the evidences of taste as each class furnishes them for itself . Luckily too , the material for such comparison is abundantly at hand . Having robbed us of our Harold Bell Wright and our Cosmopolitan , which he appears to consider our principal reading-matter , Mr. Wister joins with Mr. Garnett in indicating a list of worthy and improving authors , all guaranteed guiltless of the crime of democratizing literature . ' This list naturally commands our instant attention and instantly it arrests us with a large surprise . Of what might be called the newer generation of American writers ? that is to say , those whose reputation has been made in the last ten or twenty years , and under contemporary conditions ? the orthodox roster is found to consist of these names : Stephen Crane , Frank Norris , 0 . Henry , Anne Douglas Sedgwick , Edith Wharton , S. Weir Mitchell , Herman K. Vide ; and ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , Judge Grant , Mrs. Watts , and Mr. Nicholson . Here then are no less than twelve contemporary American writers whom , as I understand it , we are authorized to read henceforward without the smallest sense of shame , falseness , or bamboozle . But at once we are bewildered by a strange discovery , deeply disturbing to our eagerness to learn : we are reading all these writers already . We have always been reading them . Each is , or has been , followed by a large and enthusiastic public . Ah , but ? our critics may ' hasten to asseverate ' ? none of them is so popular as Harold Bell Wright ! Good ! And yet ? does that prove anything in particular , after all ? The truth is that we have a great many very poor writers who are not so popular as Mr. Wright , and who , also , are not by any means so popular as the select authors above . The fact remains , astonishing but immovable : each of the elect has figured conspicuously among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no loose sense , either . I mean to say by it , and I think my memory is sound , that every one of them ( with the possible exception of VieI6 , whose record I should have to look up ) has starred in the Bookman 's lists of the six best-selling ' novels in the country ? a list which faithfully represents the tastes of our publics , which no novel enters without being read from one end of America to the other . And most of these distinguished writers have appeared in the vulgar list with what is orthodoxly reckoned their best work , and many of them have appeared in it again and again . The devil is in the business surely . If the authentic good in America is also the widely popular , what is the basis of the unceasing lecture ? And exactly why must we be called falsified and false ? The general popularity of the authentic good : this surely is an idea so unsettling to the conventional attack as to take a deal of explaining . If it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the history of literature , and it does . How is it that our pastors and masters may be counted on never to see it ? Well , sometimes dense ignorance of famous facts seems the critic 's sole reliance . When , for example , Mr. Edward Garnett writes , ' I do not know whether the late 0 . Henry 's marvelous powers . . . have yet received their due in America , ' he makes a staggering , let us say at once a most damaging , admission . Might we not expect that the just critic would wish to inform himself on fundamental points ? I will say for Mr. Garnett 's benefit that if ever there was a rousing American-made success , a common-people-made success anywhere , it was 0 . Henry 's here . He is the unluckiest case for orthodoxy that a week 's search could have produced . Nor was it until this much-loved and deeply regretted American writer was securely dead , that the college professors , in England and America , discovered ' him ; and in his triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding at the extreme tail of the procession , ? a position , let me openly add , by no means unfamiliar to them . ' Or again , the critic eyes the confounding fact , and courageously denies it . Such an one was that distinguished American novelist , ' unnamed , whom Mr. George P. Brett , in an Atlantic article three years ago , quoted as saying that in the present , or base , condition of American literature , he would feel disgraced if any novel of his ' sold ' 100,000 copies . We necessarily assume that the gentleman in question possesses a private system for accounting for the roaring American sales of 0 . Henry and Mrs. Wharton , not to say a word about the classic English best-sellers from Fielding to Rudyard Kipling . But what his system is , alas , and how you work it , remains a deep dark secret to this day . Mr. Wister , it is pleasant to note , shows greater open-mindedness . He senses the knocking contradiction ; he settles it with an offhand whack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' he gayly assures us , was not at all that Mrs. Wharton 's portraits of the rich were brilliantly made , but that they did not happen to be flattering ; the daubs of Mr. Sinclair and the billposters of Mr. Chambers are quite as satisfactory to that audience . ' That audience ! By the way , what audience ? Perhaps the audience ' of The House of Mirth was the very same audience that adored The Common Law ; perhaps it was a very different audience indeed . Perhaps the odd tribute magnifies Mrs. Wharton 's gift ; perhaps it seriously disparages it . No matter . Our interest is in the critical formula , sorely needed , for explaining away the popularity of the good . This formula , as the critic indicates it , is simple , definite , and damning enough . But will it work ? Is it true , to generalize from the particular , that the popularity of good novels is due , or even probably due , not at all ' to their sound merits , but merely to happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the populace ? For if this rule works for The House of Mirth , it should work as well for other novels at once widely popular and orthodoxly approved ; it should work , to take an obvious case near home , for Lady Baltimore , say . Well , I have tested it upon Lady Baltimore , and it gave forth unmistakably a brassy ring . I have satisfied myself , first of all , that Mr. blister 's hypothesis falls to pieces upon Mr. Wister . And if it should be said that the retort is personal and therefore trivial , I should have to reply frankly that , as the distinguished contributor to the Saturday Evening Post seems to me the last person to speak with pertinence of America 's vulgar taste , just so the distinguished American novelist , enormously successful ' 3 et not exactly false , seems to me precisely the person to destroy the lugubrious assistant of Mr. Garnett and strange bedfellow of the New York Evening Post . I suspect that a volunteer spokesman for the despised and indifferent Public lays himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , I shall be supposed to hold that there is no such thing as cultivated taste ; to have maintained that all good novels are popular , even that all popular novels are good ; that a list of best-sellers is a list of the cream of literature ; and many such a merry saying . But I am really not quite so bad as that ; and we recall that it was the voice of orthodoxy which named best-sellers to us as the cream . As for that , perhaps one reason why every best-seller is not a fine work of art is that there are not always enough fine works to go around : even England does n't produce a masterpiece every week . And my contentionhere is merely this , that the constant criticism of American culture , or want of it , has at last reached a point where it automatically reduces itself to absurdity . We have seen that our assailant undertook to convince us that , because of a certain cheapness and falseness in the American temperament , American writers must be cheap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , on the contrary , that no American writer need be in the least afraid to write as deeply and truly as he knows how . He indicated a society in which people read nothing but Mr. Harold Bell Wright . He happens to live in a society in which people in large numbers prefer to read Mrs. Wharton . He hypothesized ? with Mr. Garnett 's assistance ? an atmosphere in which the artist is isolated , " hemmed in , ' and cut off . ' He disclosed an atmosphere in which the artist is followed by a respectable mob . He seemed determined to make us believe that the authentic good is lost , if not detested , in America . But his actual contribution proves nothing so clearly as that the authentic good is widely and persistently popular in America . The phenomenon , as we have noted , remains inadequately explained by orthodoxy . It is time to try to fill it with the one simple hypothesis which our critics never seem to consider : the good is commonly popular in America because our publics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize the good . Once this simple truth is got well into one 's head , it is remarkable how the difficulties roll away . Be it noted , however , this is not saying that every novelist pronounced good by the orthodox is certain to be popular in America . That the guaranteed good novelists above are all popular with us ? well , perhaps there was some luck in that . Certainly I am not forgetting that there are masters partially neglected here , as elsewhere , that there are delicate artists whose appeal for us has been narrow . I am not forgetting Sarah Orne Jewett , cited by Mr. Garnett , an example presumably of the second group . I am not forgetting Meredith and Mr. James , the stock examples of the first and more robustious group . I declare on my own responsibility that Mr. Joseph Conrad , though now enjoying a merited ' boom , ' is by way of becoming a third exemplar of this group . And doubtless those better read than I can produce various other instances of sound and sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is as far as I can go . When masters are neglected , it is a calamity ; but I think we should not necessarily acquit the masters of all responsibility in the matter . It is quite generally assumed that the great and the true are intrinsically too difficult for common understandings . I believe the assumption to be nonsense . If a man thinks he has a story to tell , and deliberately sets to work to tell it in such a manner that only extraordinary and brilliant persons can hope to follow him , that man is a dreary fool . But great novelists , whatever else they are , are never dreary fools ; and their unapproachableness , when they are unapproachable , is never willful , I suppose , and never the proof of their greatness . To employ a manner and a narrative method which ordinary readers find quite impenetrable and even the most cultivated persons at times find irritating to the last degree ? this is no mark of the god , but the limp in a great man 's gait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the reader ? this is a novelist 's crime , no matter who commits it . And the fixed truth seems to be that the biggest episodes , characters , conflicts , morals , and meanings are not at all beyond the mental grasp of ordinary persons ; and the greatest novelists have commonly , and without effort , lodged their intentions in the minds of great masses of plain people . And here we must consider too the purely comparative points in the attack : the point of the superiority of the contemporary English novelist to the contemporary American , with the deduction concerning the inferiority of the so-called American Reading Public . The superiority of the English novelist is herewith cheerfully conceded ; though indeed one might wish it were not considered essential for us to admit it every morning , on our knees . It must be noted that the reported prevalence of genius in Britain has latterly been so great as to startle one at times ; even causing irreverent persons to wonder if the method of diagnosis might conceivably be at fault . Britishers dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every publisher 's list . And by an odd coincidence , we do indeed find that , hand in hand with the strange epidemic of immortality , there has flourished an equally strange theory of the novel . It may be briefly indicated , if we may accept Mr. Henry James as our guide , as the theory which is in practice chiefly characterized by this preposterous pretension to acquit itself of the structural and compositional office . ' Here , we must admit , the gulf between Anglo-American orthodoxy and the common American has sometimes yawned wide and deep . Novels built according to the prevailing mode have rarely failed to win strong successes with our critics , genteel or otherwise ; but not all the little masters of England have been best-sellers with us , by a good deal . However , I have already confessed that , when these little differ- ences of opinion occur , I am in no hurry to say that the Public is necessarily in the wrong . And as to the authenticated best writers of England , we have nothing to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of the ' genuine original ' novelists of England , to the number of over sixty . ' But he has previously indicated to us six more , as being still better than the sixty . These six at the ultimate summit ? or five if we omit Mr. Hardy , who hardly seems to belong with the juniors ? are Mr. Joseph Conrad , Mr. H. G. Wells , Mr. Rudyard Kipling , Mr. Arnold Bennett , and Mr. John Galsworthy . It is noted at once that all these names are rather better known in America than that of Artzibashef , say . I dare say the young lady at the hotel news-stand has heard of all of them . . To bring the point directly to a head : our news-stand , or periodical , literature has been seized upon by our critics as a true gauge of our public taste . Very well ; then the attitude of the American magazine to-. ward the principal artists of the day becomes a subject of no little pertinence to our inquiry . And I recall that within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in Munsey 's Magazine , Mr. Wells 's in Collier 's , Mr. Kipling 's in the Metropolitan , Mr. Bennett 's in the Metropolitan and Mum . sey ' s , and Mr. Galsworthy 's ( heaven help him ! ) in the Cosmopolitan . And this , of course , is speaking only of fiction , saying nothing , for example , of Mr. Kipling 's articles in the Cosmopolitan , and Mr. Bennett 's in the Saturday Evening Post . Perhaps it was facts like these that Mr. Wister had in mind when he said that the artist was ' isolated ' in America , ' hemmed in . ' An artist hemmed in in the Cosmopolitan must be a fascinating sight ! But I will not dwell on the obvious periodical point , meaning as I do to go a good deal further . We all remember that Meredith first found in false America the artistic recognition which had been denied him in his own country ; and I think we can now assert positively , in the face of all assault , that the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't the figures , of course ; no one has ; I am as empty of proofs here as an impressionist . But I will risk nothing less than the statement that each one of the five English novelists particularly recommended by Mr. Garnett has drawn from America , not merely his largest public , but also the largest measure of that cordial and occasionally consummate appreciation which some writers , even some American writers , do literally value above the cash . If this conjecture is true , or anywhere near the truth , what becomes of Mr. Garnett 's axiom , joyfully echoed by Mr. Wister , that the American mind is hostile to the artist in literature ' ? From the Encyclopcedia Britannica to the newest young master of realism , our varied publics are largely supporting the literature of England . If this is true , or if it has any relation to the truth , is it strange that the continual gibes and admonishments of our novel-writing cousins seem to come to us often with a sorry grace ? VI The weaknesses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny them . If they had not been so thoroughly explored and ventilated by many writers ? with Mr. Henry L. Mencken , perhaps , in the lead ? I myself might have some day wished to write something perfectly true , not to say perfectly truistic , about them . Not actively a patriotic person , I too have ofttimes been annoyed by the ways of my country-. men . But the number and the nature of our assailants has had the logical effect of destroying all carping tendencies . And I rise from the latest ' smashing onslaught ' only strengthened in the belief that , if we Americans are indeed uniquely uncultivated , it at all events is certain that we stand uniquely excused . For our admitted artistic backwardness , the substantial and not dishonoring explanation looms very large . It is , in brief , that we are a young country : young with a complicated and involved youthfulness unexampled in the history of the world . Needless to say , Mr. Wister , with his interest in history , perceives this embarrassing excuse for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . We are full grown , ' he declares . ' Four wars and three presidents assassinated make a considerable past , without mentioning anything else . ' How mature must Mexico be , by such reckoning ! How fast has Serbia ripened since 1912 ! But the truth seems to be that pistols and politics neither make for nor indicate national maturity ; the contrary if anything . Ours remains a young country because we remain engaged with the essential preoccupation of youth , ? organizing a living . And our youth is unprecedentedly complicated , and in a sense steadily perpetuated , by our special and colossal commission as the caretaker and the future of the surplus population of Europe . The development of our virgin incalculable resources , material largely but social and political too ; the coincident absorption of vast European swarms asearch for something more substantial than arts and graces : this is not intrinsically a lovely , or cultural , life-story . It is easy to conceive of backgrounds more conducive to an exquisite refinement than our tremendous young busyness . But it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; and in that we have tackled first the mighty job of organizing our living , I dare say that history will not judge that our profound instincts have betrayed us . When we touch national maturity ? which we shall do , I should suppose , when far more Americans have far more leisure ? I , for one , do not despair of us . With true and odious American optimism , ' I venture to hope that in leisure and culture we shall fully express ourselves in a vigorous literature : a literature , I trust , quite free of the continental touch , ' which is Mr. Garnett 's last word of praise for us , but richly , racily , and unashamedly American . And meanwhile , for this present , is it too much to hope that this incessant , and I must say this silly , scolding of us may cease ? It is easy to arrange for chastisement an American Public composed of cheaply sensuous and sentimental vulgarians whose reading is done exclusively under the auspices of Mr. Hearst . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged by our worst ? Why must it be assumed that our most vulgar is our most truly representative ? I , for one , never think of the Reading Public in those low terms . For me , the words call up an altogether different picture . They make me think of Free Libraries , responsible-looking women going in and out with books , old men sitting around the periodical-tables , silent youths prowling among the stacks . They make me think of schoolteachers ; of spectacles sometimes ; of serious young men who write letters to the newspapers ; of wealthy , bored , cynical women , of questioning , tired working-women ; of sober paterfamiliases and materfamiliases by the evening lamp ; of editors and parsons and social servants ; of lady doctors ' assistants ; of critics even ; of educated drummers and beginning lawyers ; of aged scholars and precocious school-girls ; of John , ' the queer one ' who puts books above baseball ; of intellectual Mary , known to be always scribbling away at something in her locked room ; of peace advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this dim vast sober concourse , which is the Reading Public to me , I seem to find much excellent taste and sound sense and good hardy keenness and independence . And even below the sane mixed average ? But no ; never mind . Let me stop here . One day last year , I was riding uptown in New York on a Fourth Avenue street car ? or tram , to give it the continental touch . It was six o'clock ; the factories and wholesale houses were just emptying ; the tram was crowded . Standing beside me was a little working-girl , evidently just released from her job . She looked jaded ; but she had the New York working-girl 's habit of ' dressiness ' ; I am afraid there was powder on her nose . Nevertheless , this girl was reading ; and no matter how much the tram jolted or how much other strap-hangers jostled her , she never raised her eyes from her book . Of course I looked over her shoulder . The book was The Divine Fire , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public is fairly represented by the girl at the Philadelphia Library , who refused Tono-Bungay on the ground that it ' ai n't fresh . ' Well , I shall submit that our representative Public is still better exhibited by the New York working-girl , hanging to a strap at the end of the day 's work , her eyes glued upon one of the ablest novels written in my time .
