The lights are extinguished . The prologue is spoken by a male voice.Frontier ! What images the mere word suggests ! Barbed wire , and sentries , and eternal vigilance , even in times of peace . To the traveler , a place where certain necessary inconveniences must be encountered . To the native , the end of the world . To the statesman , an irksome demarcation , painfully cramping , encroaching , which , some day , for no reason now apparent , must be moved farther off , as a result of which various colored ribbons , jeweled badges , and sonorous titles will accrue to the said statesman , until his alien confrres , in turn , find pretexts to move the line back to the precise degree of longitude which originally marked it , or perhaps , even beyond that point . Then the whole process will commence again , and statesmen will invent new pretexts , and monarchs new color combinations for their ribbons . And in the cloistered seclusion of the colleges , anmic professors will compile learned histories , immortalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their countrymen have played , these same countrymen now sepultured in battleground , cemeteries , and so forth , under long-winded inscriptions which nine tenths of them , lately become heroes , would not have been able to decipher in life.In accordance with treaties of peace , new frontiers will come into existence , with new sentries , new barbed wire , new vigilance.But there are frontiers where no human sentries are needed  --  or possible ; where , in the impenetrable depths of the marshes , bullfrogs swim across the invisible line a thousand times in the course of a day , without troubling themselves to decide whether they are German bullfrogs  --  or French bullfrogs  --  or Austrian bullfrogs  --  or Russian bullfrogs . And such places there are in plenty along the southwestern Russian border , where alternating hill and valley , precipice and abyss , virgin forest and unlit swampland have seen no sentries , save only those whom Nature placed there , since time began.It is near one of these natural barriers that the scene is laid ; a barrier almost impassable to the stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who threads its tortuous windings without fear . Indeed , he looks upon it as a most useful friend ; but for it , townspeople , not so far away , would have reached out cunning hands for the few acres he cultivates with so much labor ; because of it they leave him alone , him , and his similarly situated neighbors.In the neighborhood of such places men are denationalized ; are neither Russian nor Austrian , but are Volhynian  --  or Galician  --  or Podolian , without having a clear idea , in their isolation , of what the terms mean , until war comes and the Volhynian is told that the Podolian is his ally and the Galician his enemy , is given a gun , and told to glorify God and his country by shooting straight and wasting no ammunition . The voice ceases . Chimes . The curtain rises in darkness . Night : near the end of night , before morning . A forest of swampy nature . Here and there , little irregular hummocks of ground . Frogs croaking . Near the center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , casting but little light , so that ten feet away from it there is darkness . Three men are grouped about the fire : Grigor , a Russian peasant in his fifties , bearded , grave , with something of the peculiar dignity which his class acquires as it ages ; Stepan , his older son , enormous , powerful , bearded , stretched out full length on the ground , and the younger son , Ilia , hardly more than a boy . A pause . p. 3 ILIA An hour more , and it will be light . I can tell by the croaking of the frogs . It is as if they were afraid of the light . Their croaking is different . Listen ! A pause . GRIGOR Thirty versts more to Zawichost . ILIA Is it so far ? That is farther than I have ever been . GRIGOR What of that ? By nightfall we will be there . STEPAN ( moving his huge frame lazily ) . And then , God willing , one more day , and we return home ! GRIGOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will there be many people ? STEPAN ( with an indulgent smile ) . More than you have ever seen before . ILIA That will be wonderful ! STEPAN There are streets ; more streets than you can count , and shops , where they sell beautiful things , and great houses all built of stone . ILIA I shall love to see that ! GRIGOR Not I ! ( He shakes his head ) I am afraid of the cities ! Oh , I am afraid of the cities ! ( He addresses Stepan ) Had you not gone to the city , they would have left us alone . p. 4 STEPAN No . GRIGOR They have always left us alone . Here are the marshes , and the quicksands . Who knows his way through them ? Not the city people . They are far too comfortable in their stone houses . STEPAN Nevertheless they would have sent for us . So the police said . GRIGOR The police ? Since when do we talk with the police ? Have I not said that when an honest moujik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses to the other ? STEPAN It was no use . There were too many of them . There were police at every corner . There were signs in the street , and crowds reading the signs . GRIGOR Signs ! Ah , yes ! Signs telling you what to do ! Signs telling you what not to do ! But read ? How should a moujik read ? How to plow a straight furrow in the earth , when to sow , when to reap , how to feed his hen , his cow , that he knows , and that is far better than reading signs ! Pah ! Because you could not read , they told you what they pleased ! STEPAN So I thought at first . GRIGOR Well ? STEPAN Then I asked others . They all said the same . GRIGOR Hm ! We must go to Zawichost. p. 5 STEPAN Yes ; to Zawichost . GRIGOR And lose three days in harvest time . STEPAN So they said ; all of us . GRIGOR While Michael and lame Peter work in their field undisturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we return , when we ask them to help us , they will refuse ; we have not helped them . ( He pauses in disgust ) If there were only a reason it would be otherwise , but for mobilization ? ( With crowning contempt ) What is mobilization ? STEPAN When I asked they pointed me out to each other ; said I was a fine hulk of a man to be asking what was mobilization . They laughed at me . They threw stones at me . ( He is getting angry at the recollection ) Then I took the biggest of them by the arm  --  so  --  and I pressed a little , so that his face went white beneath the dirt , and the sweat stood out in drops on his forehead , and he begged for mercy , and the others , they stopped laughing ! ILIA ( who is listening with breathless interest ) . And then ? STEPAN Then I came away . There is a pause . Then the younger brother , who has been much impressed , takes up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm ? STEPAN ( smiling ) . Yes , little brother . ILIA With one hand only ? STEPAN This selfsame hand . ( The boy feels the horny palm with interest ) Shall I show you ? ILIA ( darting out of his reach ) . No , no ! I do not doubt you ! STEPAN ( laughing ) . For that , thanks ! ILIA Still , if you must show me  --  STEPAN ( with the growl of a good-natured bear ) . What ? ILIA Wait until we come to the city to-day . STEPAN And then ? ILIA Perhaps they will laugh at us  --  STEPAN ( with understanding ) . Yes , little brother ! ILIA Oh , I hope I shall see that ! There is a pause . GRIGOR For fifty years I have been a good Christian . I know every holiday of the orthodox church . But mobilization ? That I have never heard of . p. 7 STEPAN Perhaps the Metropolitan has decreed a new festival . GRIGOR In harvest time ? Pah ! STEPAN Harvest time is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of harvests . ILIA ( suddenly ) . I hear steps . GRIGOR What ? ILIA Listen ! They listen . There is no sound . GRIGOR I hear nothing . STEPAN The boy has quicker ears than you or I. Listen . Still there is no sound . STEPAN ( addressing Ilia ) . What do you hear ? ILIA Two men . STEPAN Which way ? ILIA From there . He points towards the right . GRIGOR But who should come that way ? That is the way we have come . The city is in the other direction . A crackling of branches becomes audible . STEPAN Now I hear them ! Hullo ! Hullo ! p. 8 VOICES Hullo ! Hullo ! ILIA Michael and lame Peter . I know their voices . STEPAN Hullo ! This way ! GRIGOR They will not know where we are . Guide them . Stepan starts off . ILIA Here ! A burning faggot ! STEPAN Since when do I need a light , little brother ? He disappears . GRIGOR Michael and lame Peter ? Are you sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he has found them They are coming this way . GRIGOR Why should they follow us ? Stepan reappears , followed by two more peasants who carry packs , Peter , a farmhand of twenty-two , who walks with a pronounced limp , and Michael , his employer , a robust man near Grigor 's age . GRIGOR ( rising ceremoniously ) . Christ be with you ! MICHAEL Grigor Igntievitch , Christ be with you ! GRIGOR ( as the others drop their packs and draw near to the fire ) . What brings you to the swamp at this time of night ? p. 9 MICHAEL We asked at the farm . They said you had gone this way . PETER We too , we go to the mobilization . GRIGOR You also ? ILIA You go to Zawichost ? PETER No ; to Sandomierz . GRIGOR Oh ! So there is mobilization in more than one place at once ? ILIA It must be a great festival indeed . PETER ( eagerly ) . A festival , is it then ? GRIGOR Who knows ? MICHAEL But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what mobilization may be . But Anna Petrovna said you had gone there . We thought you would know . GRIGOR ( shrugging his shoulders ) . Whatever it is , we will know to-day . PETER But now , you can not tell us ? GRIGOR No . ( He pauses ) Why do you go to the mobilization in Sandomierz while we go to that in Zawichost ? MICHAEL A soldier said we were to go to Sandomierz . STEPAN A soldier here ? In these swamps ? p. 10 MICHAEL All the way to the farm he came . We must go , he said . We were afraid to disobey . GRIGOR He did not tell you why you must go ? MICHAEL He had no time . He had to tell many others . STEPAN And you asked him nothing ? MICHAEL We asked . He swore , and said that if we were not gone when he passed again on his way back , we should be beaten . There is a pause . ILIA And lame Peter , must he go too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have only the one . ILIA But he is lame . PETER ( good-naturedly ) . Lame Peter will travel as far and as fast as any of them ! And if there is to be a festival , why should not lame Peter be there with the others ? GRIGOR But the harvest ? MICHAEL Yes , the harvest ! STEPAN When we return we will reap our fields together , and then lame Peter will have a chance to show what a worker he is ! ILIA ( abruptly ) . A sound ! They stop talking . p. 11 STEPAN What is it ? ILIA ( listening ) . A horse . STEPAN ( incredulously ) . A horse ? This time you are wrong ! GRIGOR What fool would try to ride a horse through the swamp ? ILIA Now I hear it more plainly . PETER Perhaps it is a riderless horse . ILIA No . A rider is using the whip . He is looking off left . GRIGOR ( following his glance ) . A rider from the city ? The peasants look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stepan rises silently , and goes out at the left . MICHAEL As if there were no better use for a good animal than that ! To ride through the swamp , where the ground is hardly firm enough to carry a man ! PETER And quicksands , quicksands to right and left of him ! The horse knows better than his master . There is the sound of a drunken voice raised in anger . ILIA Listen to him ! p. 12 PETER Swearing at his horse , as if the poor beast could do any more ! ILIA He 's afraid ! I know he 's afraid ! He feels the earth crumbling under his hoofs ! How he must tremble ! The sound of a whip being used unmercifully . ILIA Now he 's beating him ! I hope he throws him ! Oh , I hope he throws him ! There is a loud crash . GRIGOR He has thrown him ! ILIA I knew he would ! PETER It serves him right ! To treat a good horse like that ! ILIA And into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I should love to see that ! There is the report of a revolver . The peasants rise ; look at each other in terrified inquiry . GRIGOR What was that ? MICHAEL A shot ! ILIA And Stepan ! PETER Perhaps Stepan said something ! ILIA Something the rider did n't like ! MICHAEL He was always quick-tempered , your Stepan . He was not the man to stand there and see the horse beaten for no fault of its own . p. 13 GRIGOR ( in horror ) . Christ ! Stepan renters . ILIA ( with a shout of relief ) . Here he comes ! GRIGOR Stepan ! MICHAEL What happened ? STEPAN ( briefly ) . His horse fell . It would n't rise again . He shot it . ILIA Oh ! PETER Shot his horse ! At the left there enters a Russian sergeant , booted , spurred , carrying a whip . He is very muddy and very drunk . PETER ( repeats in horror ) . He shot his horse ! A SERGEANT Well , what of it ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted with it . MICHAEL ( more mildly ) . It must have been worth many roubles . A SERGEANT The rich government will pay for it . ( He stumbles nearer the fire ) Give me something to drink . MICHAEL What would we be doing with drink ? GRIGOR We are only honest moujiks. p. 14 A SERGEANT You have nothing ? Well , then  --  He pulls a flask from a pocket , and applies it to his lips . STEPAN ( to Grigor , as the sergeant drinks ) . He has had too much to drink already . GRIGOR ( shrugging his shoulders ) . A Christian is a Christian . A SERGEANT ( wiping his lips on his sleeve , and replacing his bottle without offering it elsewhere ) . Ah ! That puts the heart in you ! Make place for me at your fire , you ! ( He elbows his way to a seat . The peasants edge away , so that he is alone at one side , and they together at the other ) There ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteously ) . May I ask your name ? A SERGEANT ( warming his hands at the fire ) . What ? GRIGOR Your name and surnames ? A SERGEANT Alexei Ivanovitch Liboff , Sergeant . GRIGOR ( inclining his head ) . I am Grigor Igntievitch Arshin . This is my son Stepan . This is my son Ilia . This is my good neighbor  --  p. 15 A SERGEANT ( interrupts rudely with a drinking song ) . It is n't sleep that bows my head , But the drink , the drink that 's in it ! GRIGOR ( in amazement ) . What ? STEPAN ( starting to rise angrily ) . The boor ! GRIGOR ( laying a hand on his arm ) . A Christian is a Christian . A SERGEANT I 'll up and away to a distant glade ! Where the wild red raspberries grow , And I 'll meet a little Cossack girl , A little Cossack girl from the Don ! ( He stops suddenly ) Well , why do n't you say something ? GRIGOR It is not for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERGEANT Then my excellency graciously grants you permission . ( He rises , bows grotesquely , stumbles , falls ) I 'll meet a little Cossack girl , A little Cossack girl from the Don ! ( He stops ; points at Ilia ) You , speak ! ( Ilia remains silent . He points at Stepan ) You ! ( Stepan folds his arms and glares . He points at Grigor ) You , old man ! Are you all a pack of fools ? p. 16 GRIGOR Your excellency has traveled far ? A SERGEANT My excellency has traveled far . Through these cursed swamps on a stumbling horse all the way from Zawichost . STEPAN ( involuntarily ) . From Zawichost ? A SERGEANT Have I not said so ? All the way from Zawichost , since eleven o'clock this morning . STEPAN ( starting to put the question which is uppermost in all their minds ) . Perhaps , then  --  He breaks off . A SERGEANT Perhaps what ? GRIGOR Perhaps your excellency can tell us something of the mobilization ? A SERGEANT ( yawning ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a festival , is it not ? A SERGEANT ( shutting his mouth with a surprised snap ) . What ? GRIGOR A festival of the holy church ? A SERGEANT Who told you that ? ( He laughs loudly ) A festival of the church ! MICHAEL ( somewhat nettled ) . What , then , is the mobilization ? p. 17 A SERGEANT You do n't know ? PETER How should we ? We live far from the cities . A SERGEANT Then why do you go there ? MICHAEL We do as we are told . A SERGEANT ( very drunkenly ) . Quite right ! Do as you are told ! Obey orders ! That 's the way for a moujik ! GRIGOR But what is mobilization ? A SERGEANT ( turning on him ) . Mobilization is this : they stand you up in rows , the big men in back , and the little men in front . Then they put guns in your hands , and you shoot . ILIA I should love to shoot . MICHAEL But we do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . STEPAN We shoot . Very well , what then ? When we have shot do we go home ? A SERGEANT Oh , no ! It only begins so . When you have shot , you march . Then they stand you up in rows again , and you shoot some more . MICHAEL What do you shoot at ? ILIA Targets ? A SERGEANT Better than that ! p. 18 PETER Animals ? A SERGEANT Still better than that ! ( He pauses for his effect ) How would you like to shoot at men ? ILIA Shoot at men ? MICHAEL What have they done that they should be shot at ? GRIGOR What have we done that we should shoot at them ? A SERGEANT ( amused ) . You do n't believe me ? He laughs ; produces his bottle , drinks again . STEPAN ( to Grigor ) . He is very drunk . He does n't know what he is saying . PETER ( with a sudden laugh ) . I have found it ! A SERGEANT What have you found ? PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , but not with real bullets ! A SERGEANT ( laughing , as the others laugh , but for a different reason ) . Not with real bullets ? Wait a minute . ( He fumbles in his bandolier ) Here 's one of them ! He tosses them a loaded cartridge . p. 19 MICHAEL ( while they all examine it with curiosity ) . What is it ? A SERGEANT Give it to me . ( He demonstrates ) This is full of powder . The hammer strikes here , and the powder explodes . And this  --  this  --  ( he bites it out )  --  is the bullet . He passes it to them . ILIA What a cruel thing ! PETER How heavy it is ! GRIGOR And is this what we shoot at men ? A SERGEANT Bullets like this  --  and bigger . GRIGOR But if we hit them ? A SERGEANT What ? GRIGOR ( repeating his question ) . If we hit them ? A SERGEANT You want to hit them . GRIGOR And hurt them ? A SERGEANT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? A SERGEANT ( reaching his climax ) . You want to kill them ! The peasants look at one another blankly . The sergeant is immensely pleased with the impression he has produced . p. 20 STEPAN We are peaceable moujiks . MICHAEL We want to kill nobody . PETER They must have sent for the wrong men . They could not have wanted us . GRIGOR ( voicing the general opinion ) . We , we want to kill no man . For fifty years I have been a good Christian . I have killed nothing except that which I was to eat ; I and my children . We do not eat men ; we do not kill men . A SERGEANT All right , then . You will learn how . GRIGOR I do not wish to learn how . A SERGEANT So they say in the beginning . So was I in the beginning . The first time you pull your trigger , the first time you see a strong man fall , you are afraid , oh , you are afraid ! But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot , and shoot , while the metal of your gun burns the flesh of your hands , and you scream with joy , and are glad , and you kill ! You kill ! GRIGOR Far rather would I be killed myself ! A SERGEANT That may happen also ! He drinks . STEPAN ( to Grigor ) . He lies . MICHAEL He is a soldier . Soldiers always lie . p. 21 ILIA And he is drunk ! Pah ! GRIGOR ( to the sergeant , as he corks his bottle ) . These men , whom we shoot at  --  He stops . A SERGEANT Yes ? GRIGOR They have stolen ? They have murdered ? The sergeant laughs . GRIGOR ( patiently ) . They must be great criminals . What crime have they done ? A SERGEANT No crime . GRIGOR Then why do they let us shoot at them ? A SERGEANT They do not let you . GRIGOR No ? A SERGEANT You shoot . GRIGOR And what do they do ? A SERGEANT They shoot also . GRIGOR At us ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GRIGOR But we , we have no enemy . A SERGEANT You will learn otherwise . These men , these men whom you shoot at and who shoot at you , they are your enemy . There is a pause . The peasants exchange signs of incredulity . p. 22 ILIA ( reflectively ) . To shoot , that is not so bad . But to be shot at , that I should not like at all ! GRIGOR ( silencing him ) . And who are these men ? PETER ( sarcastically ) . Yes , our enemies , who are they ? A SERGEANT ( waving his hand ) . Prussians . Germans . Austrians . GRIGOR And what are Prussians ?  --  Germans ?  --  Austrians ? A SERGEANT Men who live on the other side of the border . Men who live on the other side of the swamps . GRIGOR On the other side of the swamps ? ( He glances meaningly at Michael and Peter ) What do you mean ? A SERGEANT ( growing drunkenly expansive ) . Well , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) here are the swamps , ( a gesture in front ) that is , the border , and there is Austria . ( A gesture to the right ) Here we are . There is the enemy . Rather unaccountably the peasants begin to laugh , a hearty laugh of relief , as if the sergeant has finally exposed the falsehood of everything that he has said by venturing upon a glaringly untrue statement . p. 23 A SERGEANT ( irritated ) . Well , what are you laughing at ? MICHAEL A good joke ! PETER Yes , a fine joke ! MICHAEL A liar ! Such a liar as there never was ! STEPAN When a man has had too much to drink he should stay home ! GRIGOR ( relaxing his dignity ) . And for a time we believed him ! We believed him ! A SERGEANT What ? STEPAN Instead of telling lies to honest moujiks  --  A SERGEANT ( interrupting ) . What do you mean ? PETER We ( indicating Michael ) , we live on the other side of the swamps ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to the mobilization also ! A SERGEANT ( with superiority ) . Here is the border line . But the line bends . PETER You said they shot at us ! Because we lived on the other side of the swamps ! Old Grigor , and Stepan , and Ilia ! They shoot at us ! p. 24 STEPAN ( laughing ) . Rather would we shoot at you , Alexei Ivanovitch ! A SERGEANT ( growing angry ) . Laugh , if you like ! Laugh , but to-morrow , when you reach Zawichost , when you find that I am your superior officer , then I laugh ! PETER To Zawichost ? But we do not go there ! MICHAEL We go to Sandomierz ! A SERGEANT ( thunderstruck ) . To Sandomierz ! PETER ( snapping his fingers at him ) . Where you are not my superior officer ! A SERGEANT ( with sudden awakening ) . No , that I am not ! But you , you are the enemy ! PETER What ? ILIA Did you hear what he said ? STEPAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tilled our fields together ? A SERGEANT ( balancing himself with difficulty ) . Sandomierz , that is in Austria ! GRIGOR ( disregarding him ) . Enemies ! When we live a single verst apart from each other ! p. 25 MICHAEL When we have helped each other with the harvest , aye , since we were children ! A SERGEANT ( shouting ) . We are Russians ! You are Austrians ! There is war between us ! ( He draws his revolver ) I command you to surrender . PETER ( mimicking him , dancing up and down in front of him ) . I command you to surrender ! A SERGEANT Surrender ! PETER Listen to the drunken fool ! Surrender ! The Sergeant shoots . Peter falls . There is a sudden and dreadful pause . STEPAN ( laying his hand over Peter 's heart ) . Dead ! Dead as his horse ! GRIGOR ( rising to his feet like a prophet of old ) . Are we men or are we beasts of the field ? A SERGEANT ( turning triumphantly on Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender ? But Stepan is already advancing upon him , breathing deep , slowly , massively , like some awful engine of destruction . At first the Sergeant does not see him , but something in the expression of the others warns him . He wheels . p. 26 A SERGEANT Back ! Stop where you are ! Stepan continues grimly , his great hands rising slowly from his sides . A SERGEANT ( in an ecstasy of fear ) . Back , I say ! He fires . Stepan shakes himself , as if stung by a hornet , and throws his towering bulk upon the Sergeant . There is a sigh of satisfaction from the moujik as his fingers lock about his adversary 's throat . And there is a scream from the Sergeant , a scream ending in a choke . The struggling figures fall outside of the circle of light . For a moment there is a threshing , as when some small animal is caught in a trap . Then quiet . GRIGOR ( almost sobbing ) . And not so long ago I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with staring eyes ) . Murder ! That I have lived to see a murder ! ILIA Lame Peter ! Poor lame Peter ! There is a pause . Then Stepan rises , holding the Sergeant 's revolver between two fingers . STEPAN What shall I do with this ? GRIGOR ( raising his head ) . What ? Stepan hands him the revolver . p. 27 GRIGOR Pah ! He flings it away . A pause . ILIA ( in a trembling voice ) . I so wanted to see you use your strength , and now that I have seen it  --  how horrible it is , how horrible ! Stepan does not reply . Instead , he turns to Grigor . STEPAN The bodies ? GRIGOR The swamp will swallow them up . Stepan beckons to Ilia . Silently they raise Peter 's body , carry it out at the back . They return . GRIGOR ( rises , bows his head , folds his hands . The others follow his example ) . May we all be happy . May the dead reach God 's kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen . The others repeat the Amen . He makes the sign of the cross . The others follow his example . A little light begins to filter through the trees . GRIGOR ( turning to Michael ) . And now , you on your way , we on ours . MICHAEL Farewell , brother . GRIGOR Brother , farewell ! Michael takes up two packs , his own , and Peter 's ; goes out at the back . Grigor , Stepan , Ilia , take up their own packs , go out at the left .                                                                                              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
