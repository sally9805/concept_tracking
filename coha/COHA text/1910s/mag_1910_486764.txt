The next great step in the advancement of the merit system in the Federal civil service was clearly indicated by President Eliot in his address at the opening of the thirtieth annual meeting of the National Service Reform League , in session at Baltimore . It is natural that the great extensions given to the system by successive Presidents , and the gradual but complete dying out of the futile opposition to it so long manifested in Congress , should have brought about a general feeling that there is nothing of much consequence left to do ; but such is by no means the case . The number of offices outside the classified service is , indeed , not very great  --  only some 9,000 as against 294,000 in the classified service  --  but their exclusion is nevertheless a matter of unquestionable significance : Being of a high class , and therefore much sought after , they furnish a very considerable supply of spoils for the politicians ; a part , by the way , that is also played by the large number of special exemptions within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is more important still that , so long as they are filled by favor , there can not be within the classified service that spirit of ambition , that incentive to superior excellence , which is indispensable to the maintenance of the work at a high level ; and , as a rule , it will also be true that the persons in the higher posts will not themselves possess the qualificationsthat would be regarded as indispensable for such posts if they were treated as the natural goal of successful effort in the lower positions . How great a stimulus would be given to the whole body of the service if these 9,000 posts , or all but a few of them , Were thrown open to proved merit  --  if they were filled , as a rule , by promo-tion , and when not by promotion by competitive examination  --  can easily be imagined by any one who knows how the same kind of incentive operates in railways , in manufacturing concerns , in financial institutions , indeed in any calling where a salaried man may look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . That is what the classified service , great as has been the advance over the old spoils system , does not do . As President Eliot says : However meritorious these servants of the government may prove themselves to be , they can not reach higher posts without procuring the active influence of a patron or without commending themselves in some way to the persons in whose gift the higher offices lie . In the promotion of this extremely important advance in our official system , the Civil Service ' Reform , League will be able to point- to the unequivocal support-of- - President-  Taft , shown in more ways-than one . Dr. Eliot referred to the President 's recommendation in his message that the first , second , and third class postmasterships should be placed in the classified list ; and Mr. R. H. Dana spoke of . the programme of civil-service legislation laid . before Congress by the President as not only showing Mr. Taft 's clear comprehension of the needs of the service , but also as in-. dicating that public opinion has " advanced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor employees are selected for merit , while the superior officers - in charge of the work are to a large extent chosen with regard to their political qualifications . " In commenting thus on the President 's position , Mr. Dana doubtless had in mind the sweeping recommendation made in the message that the Executive should be empowered to include in the classified service " all local officers " under the Departnients of the Treasury , Justice , the Post Office , the Interior , and Commerce and Labor , the necessity of confirmation by the-Senate to be in all these cases done away with . Although Mr. Dana may be too sanguine in thinking that public sentiment at this time calls for such a change , experience clearly shows that it will require only a vigorous and continued effort to educate public opinion to the point of effectively demanding it . While the application of sound principles has thus been making continuous and splendid progress in the Federal service , it has to be recognized with regret that in the States there has been little advance to record for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , to be explained by the circumstance that public attention has been directed so much to the overshadowing question of corporation abuses . But whatever the explanation , the fact itself is to be deplored . New York State  --  which furnished the great leaders of the civil service reform movement in the days of its militant youth  --  was a pio neer in the introduction of the merit system in State and municipal office ; but that system has not grown in strength as it should have grown with the needs of the time and with the progress made in the Federal service . One of the tests of the quality of the incoming Governor will , be . furnished . by his handling of thiksubjegt. - Whether it be viewed as one of the means or procuring economy and efficiency , oras an element in that upbuilding of State powers which is part of the general . programme of the Democratic party , , the strengthening of the Civil Service Commission and the determined enforcement of the civil service laws are among the objects which , we trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , he would greatly strengthen his hold on that independent sentiment to which he largely owes his election , and at the same time get rid of a considerable part of the office-seeking pressure which threatens to make life a burden to him . WHAT THE ENGLISH ELECTION SETTLED . As the close of the pollings in the English general elections leaves the strength of the respective parties in the House of Commons almost exactly what it was before the dissolution , there naturally are dissonant voices interpreting the result . If editors and public men were to be held to what they said before the election , or during its progress , it would be easy to decide what had been . settled by the voting . Thus the London Spectator declared on November 12 that the Government did not need to procure so large a majority as they had before , in order " to place the Constitution- at their disposal , " for " we may dismiss as idle the notion that the King could resist . " But - this was merely meant- to frighten people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should be thought of the election after it was over . So , too , Prof. A. V. Dicey wrote in advance that the " true issue laid before the electorate " was simply this : " Shall the Parliament bill the abolition of the veto of the House of Lords become the law of the land ? " We presume - that the Oxford professor would not now admit that it must be . After the first day 's voting , When it looked as if the Government might lose thirty seats , Lord Rosebery asserted that , if they - lost no more than five seats , . they " could not go on with their proposals . " Yet his Lordship , no doubt , will still be found fighting those proposals , although no seats were lost . " The veto of the Lords is dead , " affirms John Redmond . Winston Churchill 's phrase is : " The veto of the House of Lords has been referended . " On the other hand , Mr. Balfour takes the view that the election has been indecisive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors on the spot thus disagreeing , it would be rash for an outsider to venture an opinion . What the course and order of business will be in the new Parliament ; what the Government will attempt to do ; what will be the attitude of the Lords ; what position the King will take  --  about all these things it is impossible to make any safe prediction . But one result is assured . The election has taken one thing out of the realm of political controversy : it has made an end of the hereditary principle as the basis of the House of Lords . The actual change may be written into legislation and made a part of the British Constitution , slowly ; it may be enacted in one of several ways ; but the decree of the nation has now gone forth , and the House , of Lords as we have known it is henceforth a thing of the past . It is the culmination of a movement long pursued . In 1884 , when the Lords had thrown out a franchise bill designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech at Birmingham in which he directly attacked the hereditary principle as the basis of any legislative body . " Privilege , " he maintained , " everywhere begets ignorance and selfishness and arrogance . " While Bright admitted that some of the members of the House of Lords were able and hard-working legislators , he had nothing but scorn for the mass of the Peers who never showee their face in Westminster except when they were summoned to reject some popular measure . Bright was strongly then for either making over the House of Lords or limiting its veto . The proposal which he made was so nearly like the one which Campbell-Bannerman and Mr. Asquith later introduced that it is altogether probable that they drew their inspiration direct from that tribune of the English people . Bright 's exact language is worth quoting : The proposition that I should make would be this  --  that they should have , unimpaired , all the power they have now with regard to any bill that has passed the House of Commons for the first time during the session in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , in the case of this bill , they would be at liberty to amend it , and send it back to the Commons . If the Commons did not like the amendments , and would not accept them , the bill would go back to the Lords , and if the Lords chose , they might reject it But in a second session , if practically the same bill was sent up to the Lords , they would then also have a right to debate and to amend ; but when the bill came down to the House of Commons in this second session , and the Commons would not agree to the amendments of the Lords , then the Lords should be bound to accept the bill . It was virtually on this issue , as defined by John Bright in 1884 , that a Liberal Government went to the people in 1910 and were sustained . Important events had , of course , come between . Chief among them must be reckoned the action of the Lords themselves , under severe political pressure , in voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to be alone sufficient for membership . That was the knell of a passing regime . The details of the reform remain to be worked out . The plan of the Conservatives is to reconstitute the Lords but to leave their powers virtually as they are . In its naked form , the Liberal proposal is to have nothing to do with a reformed House of Lords , but to leave that body as it is and then practically paralyze it by taking away its veto on legislation . Yet if English statesmen have not lost their open-mindedness and their instinct for compromise , there ought to be found some way of adjusting the matter , by another conference or otherwise , so that what both parties profess to desire may be procured  --  namely , a dignified and efficient Second Chamber , as ready to consider Liberal measures on their merits as Conservative . MR . CARNEGIE 'S GREATEST GIFT . Had the world not been , of late , somewhat accustomed to vast gifts from Messrs . Rockefeller and Carnegie , it would to-day be fairly dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to the cause of peace . Surely no great foundation was ever inspired by a better motive , or dedicated to a higher cause . There is no issue of greater importance before the world today , from the financial , the economic , and the moral point of view , than this of doing away , not only with war itself , but with that preparation for war which is becoming quite as deadly ta social and ethical progress as actual slaughter . All this Mr. Carnegie has for years seen and clearly understood . In season and out of season , by the influence of his pen and his prestige , as well as by his wealth , he has furthered every movement to open Men 's eyes to the truth that war can no more be justified among those who profess to follow the doctrines of Christ than it can be ' justified among brothers of the same State or nation . So , with unfailing generosity , Mr. Carnegie gave the $1,500 , - 000 Peace Palace at The Hague , and built also the noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lately destroyed international court in Central America , which he is new to rebuild . For the Heroes of Peace in America , he gave a fund of $5,000,000 , and for those in France $1,000,000 ; yet these are but a few of the moves in his high-minded and unselfish war upon war . What war really is , Mr. Carnegie has described repeatedly , but never in terser or better form than in his deed of gift . We wish that every school house and library in America might have inscribed upon its walls these sentiments : war is " the foulest blot upon our civilization . " Although we no longer eat our fellowmen , nor torture prisoners , nor sack cities , killing their inhabitants , we still kill each-other in war like barbarians . Only wild beasts are excusable for doing that in this the twentieth century of the Christian era , for the crime of war is inherent , since it decides not in favor of the right , but always of the strong . And it would be only right to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nation is criminal which refuses arbitration . To his truth that " honor is the most dishonored word in the language , " we Might add that patriotism ranks next so long as it is held to be synonymous with a readiness to die for one 's country while blotting out the existence of other men who are themselves innocent of blame or hate . The truth is that the making , of war and the killing of the warmaker 's pawns by the hundred thousand is but another form of the slavery of the masses to their rulers , from which the world has been so rapidly emerging . Is it not inevitable that in the years to come the monstrosity of the Franco-Prussian war , which made of two nations the pitiful victims of a half-dozen politicians , will be a source of amazement ? Will future generations not find it utterly incomprehensible that the power of life and death over millions should have been delegated to an Emperor or a Chancellor ? . How is this great gift of Mr. Carnegie to be utilized ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause ? The newly appointed trustees themselves have no definite plan , and beyond indicating a few forms of activity , Mr. Carnegie himself rightly says : " Lines of future action can not be wisely laid down . " Yet , as soon as the trustees and their agents apply themselves to their task , provided they do so with the honest intention of a radical campaign against the common enemy , a thousand avenues of activity are certain to open up . Already the million dollar foundation made by Edwin F. Ginn in Boston is at work in education , carrying on a vigorous propaganda . This the Carnegie Foundation can increase in volume ; it can carry the facts as to war and peace into every household and into every school . It can undertake a wise political prOpaganda of a national and an international character . How much education is needed here at home , the flaring headlines in the press , about the annual " war scare " in Washington , amply testify . Mr. Taft has withdrawn the alarmist report of his Secretary of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration ; but one of the first things the Carnegie Foundation can do is to pour the daylight upon these perpetual war-scares , and apply calm reason to such absurd statements as that of Congressman McLachlan that 200,000 foreigners could calmly land and intrench themselves on the Pacific Coast . Patriots of this kind , whether in England or in America , can usually figure out just to the dollar or , shilling what such a fearful invasion will cost their respective fatherlands . And then the Foundation should certainly reveal the connection of ammunition , armor plate , ship and gunbuilding concerns with navy leagues and boy scouts , and the war propaganda of every kind . Much will , of course , depend upon the trustees themselves , and there we confess to one disappointment in connection with Mr. Carnegie 's gift . Not a single radical opponent of war is on the list , but many who ( as did Mr. Joseph II . Choate at the Root peace dinner of Feb ruary , 1908 , and Mr. Roosevelt in Cambridge only last week ) express an intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Great as are the services Mr. Root has rendered as a Peace Secretary of State , he has himself reached the time of life when the forces of conservatism are at their height , and with him are a number of trustees of much greater age  --  for instance , two of seventy-four , one of seventy-six , two of seventy-eight , and one of eighty-tWo years . Much will be accomplished in the matter of arbitration treaties , international courts , and conferences . But if the cause of peace is really to be advanced rapidly , it must be not by lip-service or by voicing the tiresome compromises that run , " Of course , there are worse things than war " ; " there are times when people have to fight . " Uncompromising opposition to war is what is needed  --  in the spirit of Tolstoy . However , no such regret can prevent the Nation from recording its deliberate belief that this gift of Mr. Carnegie 's is an event of great importance for the world . IN COLLEGE AND AFTER . President Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Grad-uates ' Magazine , undertakes to use , as a basis for judgment on the oft-dis-cussed question of the relation between college-student rank and after success , certain statistics of the standing at-tained by Harvard A.B . ' s in their sub-sequent studies in the Harvard schools of law and medicine . Two classifications are involved , the one according to the nature of the studies chiefly pursued by the student while at college , the other according to the rank attained by him upon his graduation as A.B . Under each of these classifications , the question is asked , what percentage of students of a given type took their professional degree cum laude . And this is President Lowell 's summing up : The conclusions to be drawn from the whole matter are these : that it makes comparatively little difference to what subject a man devotes himself in college , but it makes an immense difference how good a scholar he is , and that the men who are destined to take the highest rank in the Law and Medical Schools are markedly better scholars both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual power , as in other things , the boy is father to the man . From the second of these conclusions ? that it does make a great difference whether a young man has or has not been a good student at college  --  there is no room for dissent ; and this not only because the statistics are themselves conclusive , but also because the conclusion might well have been regarded as established as a result of common observation . It may be , as President Lowell says , that there is a " popular prejudice " in favor of the opposite view  --  the view that a poor student at college is as likely as a good one to be a success in professional work ; but , like the similar prejudice to the effect that precocious children are likely to be stupid or commonplace adults , and that the children of men of genius are not likely to be much more gifted than those of ordinary persons , it has never rested on any respectable basis of fact , but has on the contrary been in manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the " popular prejudice " on this last head , Galton 's " Hereditary Genius " may be regarded as having given the coup de grace nearly half a century ago ; and the figures adduced by President Lowell should go far toward removing such misapprehension as may exist on the subject of the relation between a creditable record of scholarship at college and a like record in professional studies . Thus the figures show that of men who simply got a plain degree at college only 6.6 per cent . succeeded in getting a cum . laude at the Law School , whereas this success was attained by 22.7 per cent , of those who , at college , had graduated cum Made , by 39.2 per cent . of those who had won a magna cum laude , and by 64.7 per cent . of the gamma cum laude men . As the statistics cover twenty years , and more than a thousand men , this is a pretty conclusive case of concomitant variations . Concerning the first of President Low-ell 's conclusions , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the conclusiveness of the statistics and as to the true significance of the conclusion itself . The four great divisions under which the men are classified according to the studies to which they were chiefly devoted are Language and Literature , Natural Science , History and Political Science , and Philosophy and Mathematics . Now , to begin with , President Lowell himself rules out the fourth of these divisions , because the whole number of students . under it in the Law School was only nineteen , and in the Medical School only eight . There remain , then , at best , only the three other groups as a basis for judgment . But an extremely important objection must be entered against this conclusion ; namely , that each of these large groups includes an enormous range , and that studies chosen within the group may be of the most diametrically opposite character ' as regards mental discipline . In Language and Literature , it may make all the difference in the world whether one takes Greek or English ; in Natural Science , whether the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it is political economy eir modern history . In a word , the classification is too loose to be made the basis of any confident conclusion as to the indifference of choice of subjeCts . It is quite possible that if a subdivision were made which would segregate the highly disciplinary subjects , these groups would show the same extremely high average of after-success that is shown in the figures of the little mathematical group actually contained in the tables . Apart from the question of the conclusiveness of the result , there is , as we have intimated , the further question of its significance . We do not refer to the distinction between selection and causation  --  between what is to be ascribed to the kind of men who choose a given group of studies and what is to be ascribed to the effect upon them of that choice  --  which is somewhat touched upon by Dr. Lowell . Waiving this , we must still regard the subject from two distinct standpoints. ? The studies pursued by a student in his college course may influence his success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , by the amount of direct equipment he gets for his professional work through the acquired knowledge ; secondly , by the mental discipline which they impart and the mental habits which they engender . Upon the first ? point , the Harvard statistics may be regarded as throwing some light , and perhaps justifying the negative conclusion ; on the second , for the reason already mentioned , they throw no immediate light , and if they justify any inference it is the opposite of that which would be read on their face . It does appear , from the statements of detail made by Dr. Lowell , that the amount of knowledge acquired at college in the direction of one 's profession makes little or no difference in the end , at the professional school ; whence if any inference can be drawn it is that what the student gains at college turns on the general development conferred by the mental discipline . As we have pointed out , the figures throw no light whatever on the relation between success in professional studies and severity of previous training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of general departments of knowledge makes no difference , they should leave unimpaired the conviction , seemingly based on abundant experience , and still entertained , we trust , by many , that a training in exact scientific thinking and accurate study of language is not an idle exercise of useless intellectual muscles , but the most bracing and effective preparation for a career of intellectual exertion in any field . A REVOLUTION IN GREEK . Now and then a book is written which shows that , however Greek may be dwindling in the classroom , it is still very much alive in the minds of a few solitary scholars . Such was James Adam 's " Religious Teachers of Greece , " published two years ago , the posthumous work of one . who was himself a much-regretted teacher . Such is the volume of " Lectures on Greek Poetry , " jest published by J. W. Mackail , the professor of poetry in the University of Oxford . The book is a fit companion to his " Springs of Helicon " issued last year ; if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litL:rature and life come together than we did in the essays on Chaucer and Spenser and Milton . If we were criticising the book in detail we might indeed point to certain deficiencies , and especially to a false note that has its origin in Professor Mackail 's too great fondness for the ' luscious style of Morris and Swinburne and in his constant use of these poets for comparison with the ancients . But there is life in these pages . The poets of Greece still speak here the tongue of living men ; not only do their words carry the everlasting consolation which we are willing to accord to the memory of something beautiful and lost , but their criticism of life cuts into actual problems of the day and all days . In some ways the most significant of the lectures is that which deals with tlu , vexations of the Homeric Question ? deals with them somewhat in the manner of Dante 's Virgil with certain noxious souls : " Speak not of them , but look and pass . " The very gist of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a century and more has muddied the waters of classical scholarship and has been the occasion of a library of indescribable books and dissertatiuneulm . The trouble began back in the early days of Hellenic critic-ism , when the school of " Separaters " tried to prove that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed by two different poets . Suspicions of the authorship of the poems crop out two or three times at the Renaissance and after ; but the real debate , " die homerieche Frage , " Die Frage , was started in 1795 , when Friedrich August Wolf published his " Prolegomena , " and attempted to prove that there was properly speaking no Homer at all , nor any two Homers , but only a number of rhapsodes whose unwritten recitations got finally run together somehow into the Iliad and the Odyssey . The effect was startling . It disturbed Olympian repose of Goethe ; it ' created what the manuals love to call the neuere Altertumswissenschaft , the new science of antiquity ; it was the source of innumerable theories and counter-theories . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another phicked out for you the heart of the poem , the Ur-Ilias , about which successive centuries had attached layers of easily distinguished accretions ; another rewrote the poem in its original dialect and by the variation of forms could tell you nicely when and where ' the various members were composed . They worried the poems into rags , and themselves into rage . Their treatises remain on the shelves of every " sir ell equipped classical library as one of the stupendous monuments of pedantry . In general , the German universities were the centres of the storm . But it spread . For some time England , owing as much to her backwardness in erudition as to her common sense , ignored the Question , but later it swept both Oxford and Cambridge . A genial man of letters , ? line Andrew Lang , might continue to scoff at the theorizers , but the university men who had a scholastic reputation to maintain , soon grew ashamed of such old-fashioned ignorante . French scholars followed suit , and so generally , admirable a work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a volume to disjointing the Iliad and Odyssey and takes up the significance and value of poems which are the fountain-head of European literature , as quite a secondary matter . Then came America . Only the other year a school history of Greek literature gave most of what little space it had for Homer to an account of the Question , and to-day a translator of the Iliad has prefaced his hexameters , with his own theory of authorship . But a change has come at last , and a scholar like Professor Mackail can now assume without apology or fierce argument that the Iliad was in the main written by one real poet ( written , for the old notion that writing was then unknown has been quite discredited ) , and that the Odyssey was probably from the same hand . It would be an exaggeration to say that this simple acceptance of tradition has ended the horrid dispute , for many scholars , especially in Germany , still cling to their respective creeds of impersonal composition ; but the trend is undoubtedly away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be able to pass by the Question unafraid . In part . this return to common sense is due to more precise knowledge ; in part it is connected with a larger movement . The Homeric Question was in reality only an aspect of German romanticism ; it sprang up with the distinction between naive and artificial poetry , and with the whole sentimental glorification of 70/1cadichtung , which in turn was merely one outcome of the Roussellian cry , Back to the primitive , back to nature . If the Homeric poems were great , it must , be just because they were authorless , the unconscious creation of the people . For a century criticism in Europe , with some notable exceptions , has been repeating in various disguises the dicta of Herder and the Schlegel brothers , and the revolt from the Homeric Question may lead to a sounder view of literature in general . It is a pleasant irony that the exaltation of primitive balladry should have resulted in so huge and so artificial a body of scholasticism . And there is another and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubted fact that the Homer ic Question has been one of the contributing causes to the decline of Greek . Its effect was two-edged . On the one hand , in itself and as part of the Teutonic system , it has tended to exclude from the professional study of the classics such men as had a clear vision of the relation of literature to life , and , on the other hand , it has helped to desiccate the teaching of those who have remained . It is almost an impossibility that a student who reads and digests the mass of books on this and similar questions should be able with the fag end of his strength to put any vigor into his teaching of Greek as a human document . It is in this sense that we judge Professor Mackail 's chapter interesting in itself and significant of better things to come . NEW YORK 'S NEED OF AN ART GAL-LERY . In varying year by year the display in its crowded galleries , the National Academy of Fine Arts merely rings the changes upon a distressful situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to house a representative annual show . The Pennsylvania Academy exhibits regularly from seven to eight hundred numbers under favorable conditions . The National Academy can show , under the worst conditions of space , only about three hundred , and fails to hang at all a matter of a hundred pictures accepted on their merits . In the course of twenty years high buildings have cut off the sunlight from the Fine Arts building , so that a tolerable gallery light exists only for a few hours each day . This year , in order to give sculpture its due of a single gallery , the walls are so crowded with pictures that a visit is a penance to any sensitively organized taste . What can be done to liberalize the membership and policy of the Academy has been clone , but from the sheer unattractiveness of its shows a venerable and useful public body must either shut up shop or linger on in artistic insignificance . Of this emergency two views are held . Your esthete is likely to say , What of it ? Academies were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average public-spirited man is likely to dwell warmly upon the shame of not supporting an ancient institution devoted to the art of the land . As is so frequently the case , both the esthete and the publicspirited man are right , each merely taking partial views of a somewhat complicated subject . It is perfectly true that no sensitive lover of art would care either to support handsomely or attend frequently any big annual art exhibition , be it National or Royal Academy , Salon or Societe . These omnibus shows , esthetically considered , are at best necessary evils . One who loves painting or sculpture will naturally go for his delight to a place where he can see a few things of choice quality under good conditions . More sensations of art may be had in an hour at a museum or at any good Fifth Avenue dealer 's than may be gathered from the academies of a score of years . Admitting this frankly , there remains every reason why the National Academy should continue to exhibit and why it should have a proper building . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic or artistic functions ; they are necessary civic institutions having to do with the fostering of certain fine handicrafts which we over-ambitiously designate as the fine arts . Let us recall that the terms of admission to the great exhibitions are not solely artistic , but technical and professional . To be accepted means not that , on a universal scale , the contributor has made a fine work of art , but that on the temporary scale of the day  --  the current art-school standard  --  he has attained a considerable proficiency in painting or sculpture . The public exhibition is , under the system that prevails , about the only chance a young man has of winning the formal approbation of his elder colleagues . Now , since it is very desirable for the adornment and dignifying of our life that all the fine handicrafts should be practised , the fixed exhibition renders an evident public service , and rightly claims public support . But that support should be asked and given in the light of what can actually be done , and without raising false aesthetic hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the trained artist , the large exhibition is valuable because it affords him the only comprehensive opportunity he gets for measuring himself against his strongest contemporaries . In an age too busy to seek the artist , the exhibition grants at least the possibility of public notice and private patronage . It gives to the middlemen , the official and unofficial art critics , the privilege of celebrating new talent and marking the progress of established talent . If properly managed , the more ambitious exhibitions serve a useful purpose as a market and keep alive public interest in the arts . No fine or profound knowledge of art can in the nature of the case be gathered from annual exhibitions . Their scope is too narrow . They may , however , create that diffused enthusiasm without which the economic basis of art is lacking . If ever the time comes when pea ple care enough for art to frequent the studios , big shows will become superfluous , but there is no indication that such a day is dawning . Meanwhile , we should face the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . A calm estimate of values ought to shake hesitating patrons of the National Academy out of their misgivings . There is no question that , on a money basis merely , or considering more broadly the production and patronage of art , the great exhibitions of London , Paris , Munich , Venice , Philadelphia , do a valuable service to their respective cities . If their wealthy men were met with a proposal to withdraw support from such exhibitions , the suggestion would be scouted with wrath . Yet New York incomprehensibly withholds such aid from an exhibiting body equally deserving . The public worth of an annual exhibition clearly depends on its comprehensive and representative character . A small show pleases neither the esthete nor the public-spirited man . As things stand to-day , our most important branch of painting  --  mural decoration  --  is seldom shown in New York . The presence of the better decorative pieces of each year in the Academy would immediately add character and distinction to the display . The National Academy needs , and needs now , a building with abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little shameful that in this age of profuse benefactions no donor should yet have seized upon so evident an opportunity for public usefulness . NEWS FOR BIBLIOPHILES . Merle Johnson 's " Bibliography of the - Works of Mark Twain , " just published by the Harpers , is an admirable piece of work . In it collectors for the first time have in an accessible form exact particulars of thefirst editions of many of ? Mark Twain 's books . Even when Mark Twain was writing for the Virginia City Enterprise and for the San Francisco Alta-Californian his material was freely copied by other newspapers . After his return from the " Quaker City " excursion and the publication of " Innocents Abroad , " the English and Canadian pirates reprinted everything of his they could lay their hands upon .

A comparison of the two editions shows that the American was actually the earlier text , which was edited more or less before it was printed in England . For example , in the fence-w , hitewashing episode ( one of the best-known scenes in any of Mark Twain 's books ) all mention of Tom 's sore toe is emitted in the English edition . In the case of " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " the London edition , published December 10 , 1884 , is dated 1884 on the title-page , whereas the American edition , published only three days later , is dated 1885 .

And while the total number printed of many of the books ran far into the thousands , the first printings seem to have been small in number , and to identify these first issues has been Mr. Johnson 's task . The special features of the actual first issues of some of these books were described in this column on September 22 last . The Bibliography is divided into four sections : ( 1 . ) Books or pamphlets entirely by Mark Twain , and containing an important contribution by him ; ( 2. ) books containing speeches by him ; ( 3. ) books containing letters ; ( 4. ) books containing anecdotes attributed to Mark Twain . The first section includes nearly all of the items of importance . Few of Mark Twain 's speeches achieved contemporary printing outside of newspaper columns , though about a hundred of them have been collected in a volume since his death . Following the Bibliography are a series of interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and book of every one of Mark Twain 's pieces , which can now be identified , whether collected or uncollected . An examination of this Index shows that there is still considerable material not included in any of the uniform editions . The following titles ought to be added to Mr. Johnson 's Bibliography .

In No. xvii of " Chapters from my Autobiography , " published in the North American Review , for May 3 , 1907 , Mark Twain tells over again the story of " Jim Wolf and the Cats , " and states that it was an actual adventure of his boyhood days .

In 1873 , when he was lecturing in London , an impecunious American came to him for- assistance ; and , besides giving , hirer money , Mark Twain ' introduced him : to Tom Hood . The young man , who turned out to be a swindler , wrote out this anecdote of Jim Wolf , signed his own name to it , and sold it to Hood for three guineas .
