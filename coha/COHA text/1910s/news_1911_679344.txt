txt Andrew Carnegie , in a speech in the auditorium of the Carnegie Laboratory of New York University yesterday , intimated that the Medical School of that institution would receive another large donation from him if the need of a fund were shown . This half promise was received with great applause by the audience which had assembled to celebrate the opening of the new Carnegie Laboratory extension , the new building toward the construction of which Mr. Carnegie gave $75,000 . The ironmaster 's remark came at the close of his address . Mr. Carnegie had just referred to the fact that the original Carnegie Laboratory had been built twenty-five years ago and that it was one of the first of his public gifts . Turning to Dr. Biggs of the New York University Faculty , who had just spoken and who sat at his side , he said : " This institution is one of my very first children . I have not seen as much of it as I should have liked to , but I assure you that to-day has brought back all nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget that it is in the honored list of universities of America . If some beggar comes around with the proper insinuating manner , as I believe . Dr. Biggs could most successfully assume , I assure you that I will give the matter very careful consideration . " When Dr. Biggs was asked by a TIMES reporter after the meeting whether he ' , would call On , Mr. Carnegie , as suggested , 1 he smiled and declared that Tie could says nothing definite . Dr. MacCracken , Syn-die of the university , was equally reticent , but it is believed that negotiations for another bequest for the Medical School from the Carnegie coffers will soon initiated . Mr. Carnegie was introduced by the Rev , George Alexander , President of the lJniversity Council and Chairman of the meeting , as " Doctor of Laws , apostle of peace , benefactor of New York University , and the rest of mankind . " Mr. Carnegie , replying , said : " It is a very great privilege for me to be present upon this occasion . The vat-lops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , however , has not been mentioned . He is Dr. Dennis , the first beggar who ever approached me on behalf of New , York University . " I have been ruminating upon the past 25 years since Dr. Dennis first spoke to me about an institution for the study of bacteriology . Imagine what has taken place since that time . Can you believe that twenty-five years ago there was no such institution , and that this is the first of its kind ? The wonders that are going on around us make one wish that he could live forever . I should like to live to see that future day when man will be perfect . Whatever comes must be improvement on the past . There is no limit to the triumphs of man . My opinion is that our race will , continue to live on this earth and reach absolute perfection here . " Since leaving business , I have been associated a great deal with people whose thoughts are not of self . I can name scores of men and women who are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would be good for nothing . " I fully agree with the estimate which Dr. Alexander has placed upon the medical profession . Years ago when war was the only trade , the heroes were killing or maiming their fellowmen when they were not eating them . Now , those of the medi. cal profession spend their lives in saving their fellows . I believe that the highest worship of God IS the service of man , and those two men certainly served mankind . " Referring to his motives in granting bequests to institutions , Dr. Carnegie con-tinued : " Dr. Billings is the greatest beggar ever met . He convinced me that New York needed seventy-eight branch libraries , and before he left me , I promised him a $5,000,000 gift . When , later , people began to congratulate me on making the gift , I said ' Do n't congratulate me on that , but congratulate me rather upon the bargain which I made with New York City to support those libraries . I deserve no credit for giving my money away , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the erection of great institutions . Libraries are not my work alone . Every man in the city , has unconsciously , to contribute his share in their support . I believe in making people contribute their money and services , and I give my money away on those condi-tions , " Mr. Carnegie paid a high tribute to Drs . Welch and Billings . On the subject of simplified spelling , he said : " When the girls of Wellesley College got into difficulties over spelling and they argued that they should be permitted to use the simplified system , the President of that institution replied : ' You have your arguments , but we have our prejudices . ' " Will , " added Mr. Carnegie , " a man who knows he has prejudices will soon get over them . " Other speakers of the afternoon were Dr. William H. Welch , M. D. LL . D. , and President of the American Medical Society ; Herman M. Biggs , M. D. LL . Demi Secretary of the New York University Medical Faculty , and Jerome D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physicians have enormous opportunities for doing harm or good , and it is largely a matter of preparation and medical training , " observed Dr. Biggs . " The Carnegie Laboratory has always been a teaching laboratory . It has not been one of attract scientific investigators , Rs aim has been to train men to be successful practicloners . " Dr. Biggs then referred to the New York City Health laboratories , saving : " Those were the first municipal laboratortes of the world and their construction followed and was inspired by the original Carnegie Laboratory . There are 50,000 less deaths every year in New York City ' than would occur if the death rate were the same as it was eighteen or twenty ' years ago . " In closing Dr. Biggs hinted that other bequests to the New York University Medical School would be very welcome . This is what led Mr. Carnegie to intimate that he would be willing to give more . Jerome D. Greene , General Manager of the Rockefeller Institute , made a short I address in which he said : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field of medicine , and in all other fields of human experience . After a long period of misjudgment and ' injustice the community is beginning to realize that the spirit of science so far from being arrogant , unimaginative and self-assertive , is characterized by qualities which are quite the opposite of these . The man of scientific temper is - modest , quiet , patient , disinterested and forever open-minded . If he is to be a productive worker he must have a fertile imagination , with improbable , and often impossible . visions before his eyes , as the Incentive by which , working patiently from Step to step and fact to fact , he presses on to the goal which he finally realizes , but which at the beginning was illuminated not by scientific perception but by imagination . Dean Egbert Le Fevre of the Ikledical School presented to Mr. Carnegie . on behalf of the laboratory staff , four volumes containing . researches in medical science Which have been published by members of the staff during the last few years .
