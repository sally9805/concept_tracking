 | IT was at our centennial in 1876 that German manufactures were first brought to our notice . The impression they made was not favorable and the Germans themselves acknowledged that there was a reason , for the articles in general were schlecht und billig . The British translated this into their own vernacular as " cheap and nasty , " and they assumed , quite too hastily , that these adjectives would always be applicable to German products . They still complain of the low prices charged by their German rivals , but they no longer decry their appearance . Quite the contrary ; in one of the numerous " War on German Trade " articles now appearing in the British press the explanation given of the crowding of British machinery out of the market is the superior finish of the German make . The British machine is really better , says one writer , but it is sent out with a rough coat of paint , while its German rival is tricked out with colors and gilt lines and has neat letters and arrows showing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which extraneous adornment deceives the inexpert purchaser into a belief in the superiority of the German make . But while they were laboring under their original delusion that German goods were necessarily inferior and that nobody would knowingly buy them , the British manufacturers got Parliament to pass a law requiring all German products to be so branded . This legislation proved a boomerang . The British public showed an unpatriotic preference f o r the foreign product , and the label , " Made in Germany , " came to be a distinction rather than a reproach . As the crowning insult there steamed into Southampton one fine day an ocean liner , larger , faster and handsomer than anything the British shipyards had turned out , and strung along its side hung a banner with the strange device , " Made in Germany . " Then there was a clamor for the repeal of the act , even for the prohibition instead of the compulsory use of the label , and , if we may believe their commercial rivals , certain unscrupulous firms of Manchester or Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in order to make them more saleable to Englishmen at home and over seas . The war has revealed to the public in America and England what the scientific press of both countries has for years urged in vain , that Germany had obtained a monopoly in the manufacture of the complex organic compounds used for dyeing , medicine and photography which placed the rest of the world in a humiliating and dangerous state of dependence . The Government commission appointed since the war began to ' investigate the situation in Great Britain reported that industries which employed a million and a half men and produced annually goods worth a billion dollars were dependent upon aniline dyes , ninetenths of which were imported , mostly from Germany . In 1906 England celebrated a melancholy anniversary , a discovery made fifty years before by an Englishman , which had added hundreds of millions of dollars to the world 's wealth but of which Germany had reaped most of the profit . W. H. Perkin , working in the London laboratory of the German chemist , Hoffmann , happened , while endeavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aniline dye . The English at that time led the world in the chemical products and might easily have exploited this new field , but to do so required an application of science to industry which the English were then incapable of making . The English universities frowned upon scientific research , and the English manufacturers turned a cold shoulder toward the man from the laboratory . The German universities , on the contrary , graduated trained chemists , and the German manufacturers established research laboratories for them . There are now about two thousand artificial dyestuffs known , and most of them bear the label " Made in Germany . " We have seen during the past year the cotton mills of the United States closing down for lack of aniline just when they might be most busy , and great is the rejoicing here whenever a ship from Holland is allowed to pass thru the line of British warships with a million dollars ' worth of German dyes . The English textile works are unable to take advantage of their opportunity because they are dependent on Germany for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German patents , but it will be some time before they can train chemists and establish factories capable of supplying their needs , even with the aid of Government subsidies . It is amusing to see that the British Government , while putting an embargo upon all commerce to and from Germany , direct or ' indirect , including even foodstuffs , is obliged to make an exception in favor of synthetic dyes and these are still allowed to be imported from Germany to England . Another curious result of the situation is that the bright red trousers which have made the French a  | conspicuous target for German bullets have had to assume a more somber hue , not from motives of safety , for the French disdain to adopt protective coloration , but because the alizarin to dye them is pretty nearly a German monopoly . In 1868 , when two German chemists discovered the chemical constitution of alizarin , it was made from madder root chiefly grown in France and exported by that country to the value of $600,000 a year . The French Government , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the artificial product in dyeing the army uniforms , but the effort was in vain and madder raising became a thing of the past . Not only is the French soldier likely to lose his red legs , but the Highlander , genuine or imitation , must discard the kilts of which he has been equally proud . There is a shortage of tartan plaid since the colors of this , too , have been " made in Germany . " It is also amusing to see that the most British of institutions , the Encyclopedia Britannica , is held up for lack of the " India paper " which came from Germany . In this perpetual warfare between the farmers and the chemists which is now being waged in the fields of medicines , dyes , textiles , flavors , perfumes and foods , the chemists are bound to win in the long run , in spite of the fact that the farmers , by their command of more votes , are usually able to invoke the arm of the law in their behalf . How greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be seen by the example of that most favored of flavors , the extract of vanilla . In 1876 its essential principle , vanillin , cost $1800 a pound . Now it is sold for $8 . Coal tar , which when I was a boy was mostly used for roofing barns and celebrating election returns , has since added hundreds of millions of dollars to the world 's wealth . The progress of industrial chemistry has been so rapid that its importance is not generally realized , yet it is one of the great prizes at stake in the present war . In 1913 Germany exported dyes to the value of $170,000,000 and other chemicals to the value of $70,000,000 . The reader who wants to know how this industry has been built up and what we might do to emulate it may be referred to the series of articles on German invention published in the Scientific American in 1912 . We have space here for only one instance . In 1897 , Germany imported $3 , - 200,000 worth of indigo . Ten years later she exported $2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially the same , but in the first case it came from the farm and in the second from the laboratory . The change of the current of trade in Germany 's favor was due solely to invention of the method of making indigo artificially . I say invention , not discovery , because there was nothing accidental about it . The Badische Anilin and Soda Fabrik kept their large corps of chemists at work on the problem year after year until they had worked it out . It cost the company four million dollars before they got any returns , but it paid . Whenever ? and not before ? the American and English manufacturers have sufficient faith in scientific research to plan and support a systematic campaign on this scale , they may win a similar success in some of the many fields , equally profitable , still awaiting development . In 1897 , the indigo crop brought in twenty million dollars a year , largely going to British India . It is now only a sixth of that because of the competition of the synthetic product , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indigo plant will eventually join the madder plant in the limbo of forgotten things . We have heard a great deal about the marvelous efficiency of the German spies in col lecting information about the countries likely to be invaded by German armies . But the German trade strategy is based upon an intelligence service quite as efficient , and this we can imitate with a clear conscience . Here again we find that close cooperation between government , education and industry which is so characteristic of Germany and so strange to us . It is no exaggeration to say that German commercial leaders have more accurate information about the natural resources and trade possibilities of many a country than its own rulers . The representatives of Germany abroad are on the lookout for new openings for German products . If a big contract is awarded in any part of the world and no German bids are in , the manufacturers of that line are likely to get a telegram calling them to Berlin to explain to the Kaiser why they did not try for it . Every German consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special training in international law , languages and business . Several of our universities have undertaken to educate men for the consular and diplomatic service , but have found it useless , for these positions are still regarded as party spoils , and training and experience count for nothing . It is merely by luck that we occasionally get a good man into the service , and he is not likely to survive a change of administration . In the proceedings of the National Conference on Universities and Public Service , published at Madison last  | December , the statement is made that there is at the present time " not the slightest outlook " for educated men in the consular service . The Commerce Reports , issued daily by the Department of Commerce at Washington , indicate what might be done in extending our trade opportunities in this way if we had a corps of thoroly competent and well-trained representatives abroad . It is the German theory that their foreign trade can only succeed if it is carried largely by German ships . Accordingly they have developed within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tho still far outstripped by the increase in the British . We , on the other hand , have never recovered from the destruction of our shipping during the Civil War by cruisers " made in England . " Great Britain paid us $15,000,000 , in accordance with the decision of the Geneva tribunal , for the direct losses due to the " Alabama , " but she declined to compensate for the indirect injuries to our commerce . We could not fairly expect that she should , for these are inestimable and continuous . The tonnage of American vessels engaged in over-sea commerce in 1910 was less than a hundred years before . One other factor in the German industrial system must be mentioned , because it is one of the most important , altho there is no space here to discuss it , that is , the protection of the workingman . The system of state or municipal insurance against accident , o 1 d age , disability and even unemployment and the constant effort to prevent men being thrown out of their jobs by the extinction of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency . The evils of unemployment and vagrancy , which are serious in Great Britain and are becoming so here , have been alleviated , if not moved , in Germany . As the result of scientific management , applied to manufacture , salesmanship and administration , Germany has made greater proportionate gains in wealth than any other country except the United States . But while the wealth of the United States has come largely from the exploitation of natural resources , such as the mines , oil deposits and the fertility of the virgin soil , the Germans have made their gains largely by the importation of raw material and exportation of finished products . In other words , the chief commodity they have been exporting is the intangible and inexhaustible output of their brains . T h e Germans are still a poor people compared with the English , French , Americans or Belgians , b u t they were rapidly catching up . Fifteen years ago the aggregate savings , the increase in total wealth , in Germany was a little over a billion dollars a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * which is probably not far below the annual increment of surplus wealth in Great Britain . The electrical industry has , like the chemical , been from the start under the control of scientific men , so here again the Germans have had the advantage and made the most of it . In 1913 , the German exports of dynamos , motors , lamps and other electrical appliances amounted to $40,000,000 , while the exports of Great Britain in this line were only $10,000,000 . That the English cities are dark now is not altogether for fear of Zeppelins , but partly because they have been dependent upon Germany for their arc light carbons . The London Times estimates that the prize of German trade , which it is striving to capture , amounts to a hundred million dollars a year for machinery alone , and reminds its readers that Great Britain owes in large part her economic supremacy of the world to taking advantage of two similar opportunities , one in 1814 , when Europe was ravaged by the Napoleonic war , and again in 1870 , when France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of the Civil War . It will be seen that the Germans have made their greatest gains in those industries where knowledge and skill count for most . If this proved the possession of superior brain power there would be nothing for us to do except to become resigned to our permanent state of congenital inferiority . But there is no reason to think that the modern Germans are superior in natural ability to other nations or to their ancestors of the days when Germany counted for little in the commercial world . Their advantage lies in t h e fact that they are better educated . This is true whichever end of the educational system we consider . More of them can read and write . More of them have received the highest technical training , fitting them for the advancement o f science or commerce . The percentage of illiteracy among the young men entering the army is .02 per cent . Among the corresponding class in the United Kingdom the percentage of illiteracy is 70 times as great , in France 165 times , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3000 times as great as in Germany . This handicap of ignorance becomes in- creasingly burdensome to a nation as it enters the more technical field of modern industry . More new books are published in Germany every year than in Great Britain , France and the United States all-three together . And if we go by substance instead of by numbers the Germans are much farther in the lead . I am not here venturing an opinion on the vext question of relative literary merit or frequency of original genius . But if we cut out from the book lists fiction and all literature of a frivolous character and consider only those books which contribute directly to national efficiency by giving information about the past and present of the world we live in , we shall find that the German has a much better chance to get such knowledge than the reader of any other language . In fact , it was easier to obtain German books in this country than American because of our lack of means of getting publisher and reader together . For instance , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while a package of books from Germany without my asking for them , all new , attractive , real contributions to the subjects I was interested in , and cheap . I could not bear to send them all back , so I bought many more German books than I had money to afford or time to read . But to buy an American book I should have first to hear of it , then to guess whether it was good for anything from the advertisement or the review , neither of which is altogether dependable . Then I had to hunt up the publisher and his address and the price in case these were not mentioned in the review , and finally ? perhaps ? would order and pay two to five times as much as for a German book of equivalent character . Nowadays it would be still harder , since our Government , by putting books in the parcel post , has made the people in the western half of the United States pay two or three times o as much for getting their books , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can usually buy a book ouicker than he can get it from a public library . Consequently one buys books . The German Government also aids in the circulation of periodicals by making every postmaster a subscription agency . Anybody can walk into any post office any time and lay down his money for any paper or magazine for any number of months . That 's all . The Government does the rest . In the United States one has to hunt up the address of the publisher , write him a letter and make out a money order ; afterward , perhaps , he finds he could have got it cheaper by clubbing it with some periodical he did not want . So much has been said about the superior efficiency of the German school system that it is not necessary to consider it here . The American school year contains about 180 days . The German boy goes to school 240 days in the year and , counting in time saved in other ways , he gains from two to three years in his school life . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which we have few counterparts . The adoption in Germany of the metric system and simplified spelling a 1 s o means a saving of time and mental tissue comparable to throwing out the spelling book and compound numbers f r o m our schools and a gain in efficiency thruout life . It is lucky for the rest of the world that the Germans still stick to their cumbrous grammatical forms a n d Gothic type . Bearing more directly upon the matter of trade expansion is the German system of foreign schools , which numbered 1200 , with 60,000 pupils in China , South America , Asia Minor and at strategic points elsewhere . These schools have proved so valuable in extending German influence in foreign lands that a plan had been pre- ernment remitted the Boxer indemnity with the understanding that it be spent in educating Chinese in the United States , it was not only a generous act but a very shrewd piece of commercial strategy . The establishment of schools in foreign parts and the education of foreign students in home universities constitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which is especially suited to the genius of the American people . There is now being matured in private conferences a very comprehensive plan for the educational invasion of Mexico and South America by the united efforts of educational , missionary and philanthropic agencies , and in this movement our commercial interests and even our Government might profitably cooperate . When we come to the question of whether we can adopt German methods to advantage we are struck by the curious fact that the prosperity of Germany has been built up on principles in many respects quite the opposite of those generally held with us . For instance , the American Government intervenes in business to prevent combination and restore competition . The German Government intervenes to prevent competition and restore combination . Even the labor men and socialists of Germany favor the formation of syndicates because it makes the conditions of employment more stable and increases wages and number of men employed thru expanding the industry . The industries which have made most progress in Germany have been those most completely syndicated , like the steel , potash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored in Germany is not the American trust , but the cartel , which is essentially a marketing syndicate , regulating prices , output and share of production . The cartel does not destroy or absorb small producers , but , on the contrary , enables them to survive by protecting them from the competition of the big ones . But the cartel is just what the Sherman act was designed to pro " PERFECTLY NEUTRAL " A soap label that shows how the legend , Made in Germany , is added with a rubber stamp in order to comply with our customs regulations when the original label lacks it hibit . In America protective duties are attacked on the ground that they favor the formation of trusts . In Germany they are advocated for that same reason . Our Government prohibits railroad rebates in behalf of special industries . The German Government grants rebates or manipulates freight rates on the State railroads to help industries that are endangered or are ambitious of foreign expansion . In this country it is regarded as an unanswerable argument against the tariff if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Germany duties are imposed with the express purpose of enabling the manufacturer to sell cheaper abroad . In this country it is considered an absurdity , if not a crime , to maintain a duty on a product , especially agricultural , which can never hope to be produced as cheaply as it can be imported . In Germany it is regarded as the duty of the Government to permanently protect an industry like agriculture , which is necessary for the economic independence of the state . In America it is thought desirable that the different branches of an industry be kept in separate hands . In Germany it is thought desirable that each industry should control all its sources of raw material and turn out a completely finished product ; for instance , that a steel plant should own its own iron mines , coal mines , railroads and ships . Our cities are ruled strictly and in detail by the state ; the German cities are self-managed and branch out into many enterprises considered improper in America . In Germany office-holding is a life job for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occupation for amateurs and believe in rotation in office . Americans think it wrong for any department of the government to make a profit . The German Empire gets over thirty per cent of its income from its remunerative enterprises , and the annual gross receipts of the Empire and states from such sources is $700,000,000 . In America the combination of railroads and steamship lines is forbidden ; in Germany it is encouraged . The German Government is the partner and promoter of German business ; the American Government aims rather to regulate , to correct and to chastise . In short , the German strives for organization ; the American for disorganization . The German ideal is cooperation ; the American is competition . The Germans believe that competition is a sort of industrial warfare , and as such should give place to a permanent peace . The Americans hold that competition is " the life of trade , " a normal state of affairs . Germans virtually say , " strife with other countries but peace at home . " Americans say , " peace with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by acting upon these principles , become one of the foremost commercial nations of the world it does not of course follow that we should repudiate such American views as I have crudely sketched in the paragraphs above . But it seems that our traditional views and practises can not have the universal validity we customarily ascribe to them when we find success achieved by pursuing courses quite the opposite .
