txt Friends in this country have solicited the aid of the Government of Norway to establish beyond doubt the death of George H. F. Schrader , a wealthy manufacturer of Brooklyn and a philanthropist so modest that he sought to keep his gifts to charity unknown to any but his closest friends . Mr. Schrader fs supposed to have died on Nov. 15 last aboard a fishing trawler en route from Iceland to Norway . and Dr. H. E. 5Schmid of White Plains , Mr. Schrader 's physician and almost life-long friend . believes that Mr. Schrader 's death was caused by his tremendous love for humanity , which drove him constantly to strive for ways to improve the condition of those less ' fortunate than himself until he succumbed to nervous prostration . Mr. Schrader was formerly head of the firm of A. Schrader 's Son at 783 Atlantic Avenue , which he incorporated In 1904. withdrawing at that time from the active management of the company which his father had established in 1844 . Mr. Schrader was  --  an inventor , and created and manufactured the Schrader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . He also invented and made diving armor with fastenings that could not be corroded by sea water . Before him his father had made light armor plate and brass ' Slid metal products , and the Son continued this maunafcture . His fortune , partly inherited from his father , increased under his management , and he is known to have had great wealth , though no estimate of his estate has been made yet . He was a bachelor , and , so far as , is known , had only one relative , a sister now supposed to be in Germany . Mr. Schrader , according to his friends , was a mechanical genius , and , like other men of his type , was eccentric to a degree . His mind appeared never to be at rest , and in addition to numerous inventions , he was constantly advancing ideas which could only be called visionary . Mr. Schrader was passionately fond of children and their welfare interested him above all else . In 1007 he gave to the New York Association for Improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Y. , new know as Caroline Rest , and named in honor of Mr. , Schrader 's mother . The land and the buildings , including a Country Club for Social Workers , were worth about $350 , - 000 , and since 1007 Mr. Schrader had supported them uaaided by an annual contribution which brought the Income of a small endowment fund created by him , up to about $30,000 . It was at the Rest that he suent his last night in this country about six years ago . He spent the early evening playing with the children and , on his depa/ ture. - made such a ceremony of his farewell to . the attendants that some one remarked it . " Yes , " said Mr. Schraddr , " I am sailing for England in tile morning and I shall probably never return to this country . ' ' Trip to Iceland Sudden . It was the first any one knew of his ' intention , for he had not told even his closest friends . He departed as he had planned , and he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly went to Iceland . , He kept in constant communication with Mr. Burritt and with William T. Hunter , formerly his private secretary and now secretary of his company . In Iceland his passion for helping turned his interest to the Iceland pontes of which , he wrote , about 50,000 were turned out to fend for themselves each Winter . He found that the animals cracked their hoofs pounding at the snow and ice in search of grass beneath , and he wrote a book on the care of the animals , employing ' German , a tongue with which he was thoroughly familiar . Then he paid to have his ' work translated into words that could be understood 131. the Icelanders and distributed his book among them . He created a new Caroline Rest on a smaller scale at Akureyri , Iceland , and also built shelters there for the ponies . He had gone through one siege of nervous prostration here before his departure and three months ago he wrote to Dr. Schmid , saying his health was failing and was again so poor he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iceland , however , and he feared to traVel without one to England lest he be interned as a German , because of his appearance and his accent , although lie was an American citizen . No steamships , he wrote , left for other ports , so he intended to take passage aboard a trawler for Norway , where he could establish his identity . " While this letter was in transit here Mr. Schrader sailed , so that the New Year 's greetings which Mr. Hunter cabled on last Dec. 21 ' brought back the reply that no Mr. Schrader could be found in Iceland . Then came the letter , and Mr. Hunter communicated with the Government of Norway . Thus he heard of Mr. Schrader 's death aboard the trawler . Now , the Norwegian Government has been asked to send the necessary proofs of death for the probating of Mr. Schrader 's will , including the affidavits of the sailors with- whom he sailed . - Mr . Schrader was a few months less than CO years old . He was born in Hoboken.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
