Miles away she could see a little cloud of dust travelling behind the microscopic stage , which moved toward her almost as imperceptibly as the minute-hand of a clock . A bronco was descending the hill trail from the Flagstaff mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice young and glad . " My love has breath o ' roses , O ' roses , o ' roses , And cheeks like summer posies All fresh with morning dew , " floated the words to her across the sunlit open . If the girl heard , she heeded not . One might have guessed her a sullen , silent lass , and would have done her less than justice . For the storm in her eyes and the curl of the lip were born of a mood and not of habit . They had to do with the gay vocalist who drew his horse up in front of her and relaxed into the easy droop of the experienced rider at rest . " Do n't see me , do you ? " he asked , smiling . Her dark , level gaze came round and met his sunniness without response . " Yes , I see you , Tom Dixon . " " And you do n't think you see much then ? " he suggested lightly . She gave him no other answer than the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flash of her dark eyes . " Mad at me , Phyl ? " Crossing his arms on the pommel of the saddle he leaned toward her , half coaxing , half teasing . The girl chose to ignore him and withdrew her gaze to the stage , still creeping antlike toward the hills . " My love has breath o ' roses , O ' roses , o ' roses , " he hummed audaciously , ready to catch her smile when it came . It did not come . He thought he had never seen her carry her dusky good looks more scornfully . With a movement of impatience she brushed back a rebellious lock of blue-black hair from her temple . " Somebody 's acting right foolish , " he continued jauntily . " It was all in fun , and in a game at that . " " I was n't playing , " he heard , though the profile did not turn in the least toward him . " Well , I hated to let you stay a wall-flower . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dignity . " Sho , Phyl ! I told you ' t was only in fun , " he justified himself . " A kiss ai n't anything to make so much fuss over . You ai n't the first girl that ever was kissed . " She glanced quickly at him , recalling stories she had heard of his boldness with girls . He had taken off his hat and the golden locks of the boy gleamed in the sunlight . Handsome he surely was , though a critic might have found weakness in the lower part of the face . Chin and mouth lacked firmness . " So I 've been told , " she answered tartly . " Jealous ? " " No , " she exploded . Slipping to the ground , he trailed his rein . " You do n't need to depend on hearing , " he said , moving toward her . " What do you mean ? " she flared . " You remember well enough -- at the social down to Peterson 's . " " We were children then -- or I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I 'm not . " " Here 's congratulations , Miss Sanderson . You 've put away childish things and now you have become a woman . " Angrily the girl struck down his outstretched hand . " After this , if a fellow should kiss you , it would be a crime , would n't it ? " he bantered . " Do n't you dare try it , Tom Dixon , " she flashed fiercely . Hitherto he had usually thought of her as a school girl , even though she was teaching in the Willow 's district . Now it came to him with what dignity and unconscious pride her head was poised , how little the home-made print could conceal the long , free lines of her figure , still slender with the immaturity of youth . Soon now the woman in her would awaken and would blossom abundantly as the spring poppies were doing on the mountain side . Her sullen sweetness was very close to him . The rapid rise and fall of her bosom , the underlying flush in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all joined in the challenge of her words . Mostly it was pure boyishness , the impish desire to tease , that struck the audacious sparkle to his eyes , but there was , too , a masculine impulse he did not analyse . " So you wo n't be friends ? " If he had gone about it the right way he might have found forgiveness easily enough . But this did not happen to be the right way . " No , I wo n't . " And she gave him her profile again . " Then we might as well have something worth while to quarrel about , " he said , and slipping his arm round her neck , he tilted her face toward him . With a low cry she twisted free , pushing him from her . Beneath the fierce glow of her eyes his laughter was dashed . He forgot his expected trivial triumph , for they flashed at him now no childish petulance , but the scorn of a woman , a scorn in the heat of which his vanity withered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare insult . " How dare you ! " she gasped . Straight up the stairs to her room she ran , turned the lock , and threw herself passionately on the bed . She hated him ... hated him ... hated him . Over and over again she told herself this , crying it into the pillows where she had hidden her hot cheeks . She would make him pay for this insult some day . She would find a way to trample on him , to make him eat dirt for this . Of course she would never speak to him again -- never so long as she lived . He had insulted her grossly . Her turbulent Southern blood boiled with wrath . It was characteristic of the girl that she did not once think of taking her grievance to her hot-headed father or to her brother . She could pay her own debts without involving them . And it was in character , too , that she did not let the inner tumult interfere with her external duties . As soon as she heard the stage breasting the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panther and at her dressing-table dabbing with a kerchief at the telltale eyes and cheeks . Before the passengers began streaming into the house for dinner she was her competent self , had already cast a supervising eye over Becky the cook and Manuel the waiter , to see that everything was in readiness , and behind the official cage had fallen to arranging the mail that had just come up from Noches on the stage . From this point of vantage she could cast an occasional look into the dining-room to see that all was going well there . Once , glancing through the window , she saw Tom Dixon in conversation with a half-grown youngster in leathers , gauntlets , and spurs . A coin was changing hands from the older boy to the younger , and as soon as the delivery window was raised little Bud Tryon shuffled in to get the family mail and that of Tom . Also he pushed through the opening a folded paper evidently torn from a notebook . " This here is for you , Phyl , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it . " " It 's from Tom , " he further volunteered . " Is it ? " She took the paper quietly but with a swift , repressed passion , tore it across , folded the pieces together , rent them again , and tossed the fragments through the window to the floor . " Do you want the mail for the Gordons , too , Mr. Purdy ? " she coolly asked the next in line over the tow head of Bud . The boy grinned and ducked from his place through the door . Through the open window there drifted to her presently the sound of a smothered curse , followed by the rapid thud of a horse 's hoofs . Phyllis did not look , but a wicked gleam came into her black eyes . As well as if she had seen him she beheld a picture of a sulky youth spurring home in dudgeon , a scowl of discontent on his handsome , boyish face . He had come down the mountain trail singing , but no music travelled with him on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without deigning to notice it , she caught a wink and a nod from one vaquero to another . It was certain they would not forget to " rub it in " when next they met Master Tom . She promised herself , as she handed out newspapers and letters to the cowmen , sheep-herders , and miners who had ridden in to the stage station for their mail , to teach that young man his place . " I 'll take a dollar 's worth of two 's . " Phyllis turned her head in the slow , disdainful fashion she had inherited from her Southern ancestors and without a word pushed the sheet of stamps through the window . That voice , with its hint of sardonic amusement , was like a trumpet call to battle . " Any mail for Buck Weaver ? " " No , " she answered promptly without looking . " Sure ? " " Yes . " " Could n't be overlooking any , could you ? " Her eyes met his with the rapier steel of hostility . He was mocking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was her father 's enemy . He had no business here . His coming was of a piece with all the rest of his insolence . Phyllis hated him with the lusty healthy hatred of youth . She had her father 's generosity and courage , his quick indignation against wrong and injustice , and banked within her much of his passionate lawlessness . " I know my business , sir . " Weaver turned from the window and came front to front with old Jim Sanderson . The burning black eyes of the Southerner , set in sockets of extraordinary depths , blazed from a grim , hostile face . Always when he felt ugliest Sanderson 's drawl became more pronounced . His daughter , hearing now the slow , gentle voice , ran quickly round the counter and slipped an arm into that of her father . " This hyer is an unexpected pleasure , Mr. Weaver , " he was saying . " It 's been quite some time since I 've seen you all in my house before , makin ' you'self at home so pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't get buck ague , Sanderson . I 'm here because I 'm here . That 's reason a-plenty for me , " Weaver told him contemptuously . " But not for me , seh . When you come into my house --  --  " " I did n't come into your house . " " Why -- why --  --  " " Father ! " implored the girl . " It 's a government post-office . He has a right here as long as he behaves . " " H 'm ! " the old fire-eater snorted . " I 'd be obliged just the same , Mr. Weaver , if you 'd transact your business and then light a shuck . " " Dad ! " the girl begged . He patted her head awkwardly as it lay on his arm . " Now do n't you worry , honey . There ai n't going to be any trouble -- leastways none of my making . I ai n't a-forgettin ' my promise to you-all . But I ai n't sittin ' down whilst anybody tromples on me neither . " " He would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weaver laughed in grim irony . " I 'm surely much obliged to you for protecting me . " And to the father he added carelessly : " Keep your shirt on , Sanderson . I 'm not trying to break into society . And when I do I reckon it wo n't be with a sheep outfit I 'll trail . " With which parting shot he turned on his heel , arrogant and imperious to the last virile inch of him . CHAPTER II THE NESTER With the jingle of trailing spur Buck Weaver passed from the post-office to the porch , where public opinion was wont to formulate itself while waiting for the mail to be distributed . Here twice a week it had sat for many years , had heard evidence , passed judgment , condemned or acquitted . For at this store the Malpais country bought its ammunition , its tobacco , and its canned goods ; and on this porch its opinions had sifted down to convictions . From this common meeting ground the gossip of Cattleland was scattered far and wide . Weaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the owner of the Twin Star outfit , the biggest cattle company in that country . Nearly twenty years ago , while still a boy of eighteen , he had begun in a small way . The Malpais had been a wild and lawless place then , but in all the turbid days that followed Buck Weaver had held his own ruthlessly by adroit manipulation , shrewd sense , and implacable daring . Some outfits he had bought out ; others he had driven away . Those that survived were at a respectable distance from him . Only the settlers in the hills remained to trouble him . He had come to be the big man of the district , dominating its social , business , and political activities . " What 's this I hear about another settler up on Bear Creek ? " he asked curtly after he had gathered up his bridle and swung to the saddle . " That 's the way Jim Budd 's telling it , Mr. Weaver . Another nester homesteaded there , " old Joe Yeager answered casually , chewing tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be a right smart settlement up near the headwaters of the creeks , I should n't wonder . The cow business is getting to be a mighty profitable one when you do n't own any , " Buck said dryly . The others laughed , but with small merriment . They were either small cattle owners themselves or range riders whose living depended on the business , and during the past two years a band of rustlers had operated so boldly as to have wiped out the profits of some of the ranchers . Most of them disliked Buck extremely for his overbearing ways . But they did not usually tell him so . On this particular subject , too , they joined hand with him . " You 're dead right , Mr. Weaver . It ce'tainly must be stopped . " The man who spoke rolled a cigarette and lit it . Like the rest he was in the common garb of the plains . The broad-brimmed felt hat , the shiny leather chaps , the loosely knotted bandanna , were as much a matter of course as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untempered sun . But Brill Healy claimed a distinction above his fellows . He was a black-haired , picturesque fellow , as supple as a panther , reckless and yet wary . " We 'll have rustling as long as we have nesters , Brill , " Buck told him . " If that 's the case we 'll serve notice on the nesters to get out , " Healy replied . Buck grinned . Indomitable fighter though he was , he had been unable to roll back the advancing tide of settlement . Here and there homesteaders had taken up land and had brought in small bunches of cattle . Most of these were honest men , others suspected rustlers . But Buck 's fiat had not sufficed to keep them out . They had held stoutly to their own and -- he suspected -- a good deal more than their own . Calves had been branded secretly and cows killed or driven away . " Go to it , Brill , " Weaver jeered . " I 'm wishing you all the luck in the world . " He touched his pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud of white dust . Not till he had disappeared did conversation renew itself languidly , for Seven Mile Ranch was lying under the lethargy of a summery sun . " I expect Buck 's got the right of it , " volunteered a brawny youth known as Slim . " All you got to do is to take up a claim near a couple of big outfits with easy brands , then keep your iron hot and industrious . There 's sure money in being a nester . " Despite the soft drawl of his voice , he spoke with bitterness , as did the others . Every day the feeling was growing stronger that the rustling must be stopped if they were going to continue to run cattle . The thieves had operated with a boldness and a shrewdness that fairly outwitted the ranchers . Enough horses and cattle had been driven across the line to stock a respectable ranch . Not one of the established ranches had escaped heavy losses ; so heavy , indeed , that the owners faced the option of going broke or of exterminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught red-handed , but the leader of the outlaws had saved the men by the most daring strategy . Healy , until lately foreman of the Twin Star outfit , had organized the ranchmen as a protective association . In this he had represented Weaver , himself not popular enough to cooeperate with the other ranchmen . Once Brill had led the pursuit of the rustlers and had come back furious from a long futile chase . For among the cattle being driven across to Sonora were five belonging to him . Other charges also lay against the hill outlaws . A stage had been robbed with a gold shipment from the Diamond Nugget mine . A cattleman had been held up and relieved of two thousand dollars , just taken as part payment for a sale of beef steers . The sheriff of Noches County , while trying to arrest a rustler , had been shot dead in his tracks . Brill Healy leaned forward , gathered the eyes of those present , and lowered his voice to a whisper . " Boys , this thing has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody can run the coyotes to earth he can . Anyhow , that 's the reputation he 's got . " Yeager nodded . " Good for you , Brill . He 's ce'tainly got an A-one rep. as a cattle detective , and likewise as a man hunter . When is he coming ? " " He writes that he 's got a job on hand that will keep him busy a couple of weeks , anyhow . After that we 'll hear from him . I 'm going to drop everything else , if necessary , and stay right with him on this job till he finishes it right , " Healy promised . " Now you 're shoutin ' , Brill . Here , too . It 's money in our pocket to stop this thing right now , even if we pay big for it . No use jest sittin ' around till we 're stole blind , " assented Slim . " It wo n't cost us anything . Buck , he pays the freight . The waddies have been hitting him right hard lately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . Course we expect help from you boys when we call on you . " " Sure . We 'll all be with you till the cows come home , Brill , " nodded one little fellow called Purdy . He was looking at a dust patch rising from the Bear Creek trail , and slowly moving toward them . " What 's the name of this new nester , Jim ? " Budd , by way of being a curiosity on the range , was a fat man with a big double chin . He was large as well as fat , and , by queer contrast , the voice that came from that mountain of flesh was a small falsetto scarce above a whisper . " Did n't hear his name . Had no talk with him . Hear he is called Keller , " he said . " What 's he look like ? " " You-all can see for yourself . This here 's the gent rolling a tail this way . " The little cloud of dust had come nearer and disclosed as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Drawing up in front of the porch , the man swung himself easily from the saddle and glanced around . " Evening , gentlemen , " he said pleasantly . Some nodded grimly , some growled an acknowledgment of his greeting . But the lack of cordiality , the presence of hostility , could not be doubted . The young man stood at supple ease before them , one hand resting on his hip and the other on the saddle . He let his unabashed gaze travel from one to another , understood perfectly what those expressionless eyes of stone were telling him , and , with a little laugh of light derision , trailed debonairly into the store . " Any mail for Larrabie Keller ? " he inquired of the postmistress . The girl at the window glanced incuriously at him and turned to look . When she pushed his letter through the grating he met for an instant a flash of dark eyes from a mobile face which the sun and superb health had painted to a harmony of gold and russet , with the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the picture magnetized his gaze . Admiration , frank and human , shone from the steel-gray eyes that had till now been only a mask . Beneath his steady look she flushed indignantly and withdrew from the window . Convicted of rudeness , the last thing he had meant , Keller returned to the porch and leaned against the door jamb while he opened his letter . His appearance immediately sandbagged conversation . Stony eyes were focused upon him incuriously , with expressionless hostility . He noted , however , an exception . Another had been added to the group , a lad of about eighteen , slim and swarthy , with the same dark look of pride he had seen on the face at the stamp window . It was easy to guess that they were brother and sister , very likely twins , though he found in the boy 's expression a sulky impatience lacking in hers . Perhaps the lad needed the discipline that life hammers into those who want to be a law unto themselves . With an insolence extremely boyish , the lad turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these nesters . We 've got more than we can use , I reckon . The range is overstocked now -- both with them and cows . Come a bad year and half of our cattle will starve . " There was a moment of surcharged silence . Phil Sanderson had voiced the growing feeling of them all , but he had flung it out as a stark challenge before the time was ripe . It was one thing to resent the coming of settlers ; it was quite another to set themselves openly against the law that allowed these men to homestead the natural parks in the hills . Brill Healy laughed . " The fat 's in the fire now , sure enough . Just the same , I back your play , Phil . " He turned recklessly to the man in the doorway . " You may tell your friends up on Bear Creek that we own this range and mean to hold it . We do n't aim to let our cattle be starved , and we do n't aim to lie down before rustlers . Understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gayety in his eyes . They met those of the cattleman with a grip of steel , and measured strength with him . Each knew the other would go the limit before Keller made quiet answer : " I think so . " And with that he dismissed the subject and his unfriendly audience . With perfect ease , he read his letter , pocketed it , and whistled softly as he impassively took stock of the scenery . Apparently he had wiped Public Opinion from his map , and was interested only in the panorama before him . Seven Mile Ranch lay rooted at the desert terminus among the foothills , a gateway between the mountains and the Malpais Plain . Below was a shimmering stretch of sand and cactus tortured beneath a blazing sun . Into that caldron with its furnace-cracked floor the sun had poured itself torridly for countless eons . It was a Sahara of mirage and desolation and death . To the left was a flat-topped mesa eroded to fantastic mockery of some bastioned fort . In the round-topped hills behind it was Noches , fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising to the saw-toothed range now painted with orange and mauve and a hint of deepening purple . For dusk was already slipping down over the peaks . " Mail 's been open half an hour , boys , " Phyllis announced through the open window . They dropped in to the store , as noisy as schoolboys , but withal deferential . It was clear the young postmistress reigned a queen among the younger ones , but a queen that deigned to friendship with her subjects . Some of them called her Miss Sanderson , one or two of them Phyllie . Among these last was Healy , who appeared on very good terms with her indeed . He appointed himself a sort of master of ceremonies , and handed to each man his mail with appropriate jocular comments designed to embarrass the recipient . He knew them all , and his hits were greeted with gay laughter . To the man standing in the doorway with his back to them , they seemed all one happy family -- and himself a rank outsider . He trailed down the steps and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of her warm , clear laughter floated after him . CHAPTER III CAUGHT RED-HANDED From a cleft in the hills two riders emerged , following a little gulch to the point where it widened into a draw . The alkali dust of Arizona lay thick upon their broad-brimmed Stetsons and every inch of exposed surface , but through the gray coating bloomed the freshness of youth . It rang from their voices , was apparent in the modelling and carriage of their figures . The young man was sinewy and hard as nails , the girl supple and wiry , of a slender grace , straight-backed as an Indian in the saddle . Just where the draw dipped down into the grassy park they drew rein an instant . Faint and far a sound drifted to them . Somebody down in the park had fired a rifle . " I do n't agree with you , Phil , " the girl said , picking up the thread of their conversation where they had dropped it some minutes earlier . " The nesters have as much right here as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up government land . Why should n't they ? " " Because we got here first , " he retorted impatiently . " Because our cattle and sheep have been feeding on the land they are fencing . Because they close the water holes and the creeks and claim they are theirs . It means the end of the open range . That 's what it means . " " Of course that 's what it means . We 'll have to adapt ourselves to it . You talk foolishness when you make threats to drive out the nesters . That is the sort of thing Buck Weaver has been trying to do . It 's absurd . The law is back of them . You would only come to trouble , and if you did succeed others would take their places . " " And rustle our cattle , " he added sullenly . " It is n't proved they are the rustlers . You have n't a shred of evidence . Perhaps they are , but you should prove it before you make the charge . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " I do n't know . But whoever it is will be caught and punished some day . There is no doubt at all about that . " " You talk a heap of foolishness , Phyl , " he answered resentfully . " My notion is they never will be caught . What makes you so sure they will ? " They had been riding down the draw , and at this moment Phyllis looked up , to see a rider silhouetted against the sky line on the ridge above . " Oh , you Brill ! " she cried , with a wave of her quirt . The man turned , saw them , and rode slowly down . He nodded , after the fashion of the range , first to the girl , and then to her brother . " Morning , " he nodded . " Headed for Mesa ? Here , too . " He fell in with them and rode beside the girl . Presently they topped a little hillock , and looked down into the park . It had about the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as broad . Wooded spurs ran down from the hills into it here and there , and through the meadow leaped a silvery stream . " Hello ! Wonder where that smoke comes from ? " It was Healy that spoke . He pointed to a faint cloud rising from a distance . Even before he began to speak , however , Phyllis had her field glasses out , and was adjusting them to her eyes . " There 's a fire there and a man standing over it , " she presently announced . " There 's something else there , too . I ca n't make it out -- something lying down . " The men glanced at each other , and in the meeting of their eyes some intelligence passed between them . It was as if the younger accused and the older sullenly denied . " Lemme have the glasses , " Phil said to his sister almost roughly . Healy glanced at Phil swiftly , covertly , as the latter adjusted the glasses . " She 's right about the fire and the man . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The boy looked long , lowered the glasses , and met his friend 's eye with a kind of shamefaced hesitation . But apparently he gathered reassurance from the quiet steadiness with which the other 's gaze met him . He handed the glasses to Healy . When the latter lowered them his face was grave . " There 's a man and a fire and a cow and a calf . When these four things meet up together , what does it mean ? " " Branding ! " cried the girl . " That 's right -- branding . And when the cow is dead what does it mean ? " Brill asked , his eyes full on Phil . " Rustling ! " she breathed again . " You 've said it , Phyl . We 've got one of them at last , " he cried jubilantly . Phil , hanging between doubt and suspicion and shame , brightened at the enthusiasm of the other . " Right you are , Brill . We 'll solve this mystery once for all . " Healy , unstrapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the boy . " Armed , Phil ? " The lad nodded . " I brought my six-gun for rattlesnakes . " " Are you going to -- to --  --  " cried Phyllis , the color gone from her face . " We 're going to capture him alive if we can , Phyl . You 're to wait right here till we come back . You may hear shooting . Do n't let that worry you . We 've got the drop on him , or will have . Nobody is going to get hurt if he acts sensible , " Healy reassured . " Do n't you move from here . You stay right where you are , " her brother ordered sharply . " Yes , " she said , and was aware that her throat was suddenly parched . " You 'll be careful , wo n't you , Phil ? " " Sure , " he called back , as he put his horse at a canter to follow his friend up the draw . The sound of the hoofs died away , and she was alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangle of hills until they were opposite the miscreant , she knew , but in spite of Brill 's promise she had a heart of water . With trembling fingers she raised the glasses again , and focused them on that point which was to be the centre of the drama . The man was moving about now , quite unconscious of the danger that menaced him . What she looked at was the great crime of Cattleland . All her life she had been taught to hold it in horror . But now something human in her was deeper than her detestation of the cowardly and awful thing this man had just done . She wanted to cry out to him a warning , and did in a faint , ineffective voice that carried not a tenth of the distance between them . She had promised to remain where she was , but her tense interest in what was doing drew her forward in spite of herself . She rode along the ridge that bordered the park , at first slowly and then quicker as the impulse grew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . She saw him look round quickly , and in an instant his pony was at the gallop and he was lying low on its neck . A shot rang out , and another , but without checking his flight . He turned in the saddle and waved a derisive hand at the shooters , then plunged into a wash and disappeared . What inspired her she could never tell . Perhaps it was her indignation at the thing he had done , perhaps her anger at that mocking wave of the hand with which he had vanished . She wheeled her horse , and put it at a canter down the nearest draw so as to try to intercept him at right angles . Her heart beat fast with excitement , but she was conscious of no fear . Before she had covered half the distance , she knew she was going to be too late to cut off his retreat . Faintly , she heard the rhythm of hoofs striking the rocky bottom of the draw . Abruptly they ceased . Wondering what that could mean , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloping broncho had renewed itself , and closer . The man was riding up the gulch toward her . He had turned into its mesquite-laced entrance for a hiding place . Phyllis drew rein , and waited quietly to confront him , but with a pulse that hammered the moments for her . A white-stockinged roan , plowing a way through heavy sand , labored into view round the bend , its rider slewed in the saddle with his whole attention upon the possible pursuit . Not until he was almost upon her did the man turn . With a startled exclamation at sight of the motionless figure , he pulled up sharply . It was the nester , Keller . " You , " she cried . " Happy to meet you , Miss Sanderson , " he told her jauntily . His revolver slid into its holster , and his hat came off in a low bow . White , even teeth gleamed in a sardonic smile . " So you are a -- rustler , " she told him scornfully . " I hate to contradict a lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw something else , a deepening stain that soaked slowly down his shirt sleeve . " You are wounded . " " Am I ? " " Are n't you ? " " Come to think of it , I believe I am , " he laughed shortly . " Badly ? " " I have n't got the doctor 's report yet . " There was a gleam of whimsical gayety in his eyes as he added : " I was going to find him when I had the good luck to meet up with you . " He was a hunted miscreant , wounded , riding for his life as a hurt wolf dodges to shake off the pursuit , but strangely enough her gallant heart thrilled to the indomitable pluck of him . Never had she seen a man who looked more the vagabond enthroned . His crisp bronze curls and his superb shoulders were bathed in the sunpour . Not once , since his eyes had fallen on her , had he looked back to see if his hunters had picked up the lost trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thought at meeting her were the pleasure of the encounter . " Can you ride ? " she demanded . " I can stick on a hawss if it 's plumb gentle . Leastways I 've been trying to for twenty years , " he drawled . Her impatient gesture waved his flippancy aside . " I mean , are you too much hurt to ride ? I 'm not going to leave you here like a wounded coyote . Can you follow me if I lead the way ? " " Yes , ma'am . " She turned . He followed her obediently , but with a ghost of a smile still flickering on his face . " Am I your prisoner , Miss Sanderson ? " he presently wanted to know . " I 'm not thinking of prisoners just now , " she answered shortly , with an anxious backward glance . Presently she pulled up and wheeled her horse , so that when he halted they sat facing each other . " Let me see your arm , " she ordered . Obediently he held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the unwounded one . An angry spark gleamed in her eye . " This is no time to be fresh . Give me the other . " " Yes , ma'am . " he answered , with deceptive meekness . Without comment , she turned back the sleeve which came to the wrist gauntlet , and discovered a furrow ridged by a rifle bullet . It was a clean flesh wound , neither deep nor long enough to cause him trouble except for the immediate loss of blood . To her inexperience it looked pretty bad . " A plumb scratch , " he explained . She took the kerchief from her neck , and tied it about the hurt , then pulled down the sleeve and buttoned it over the brown forearm . All this she did quite impersonally , her face free of the least sympathy . " Thank you , ma'am . You 're a right friendly enemy . " " It is n't a matter of friendship at all . One could n't leave a wounded jack rabbit in pain , " she retorted coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two abreast , and he chose to ride beside her . " So you tied me up because it was your Christian duty , " he soliloquized aloud . " Just the same as if I had been a mangy coyote that was suffering . " " Exactly . " He let his cool eyes rest on her with a hint of amusement . " And what were you thinking of doing with me now , ma'am ? " " I 'm going to take you up to Jim Yeager 's mine . He is doing his assessment work now , and he 'll look out for you for a day or two . " " Look out for me in a locked room ? " he wanted to know casually . " I did n't say so . It is n't my business to arrest criminals , " she told him icily . His eyes gleamed mischief . " Is it your business to help them to escape ? " " I 'm not helping you to escape . I 'll not risk your dying in the hills alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend ? " " Yes . " " And you guarantee he 'll keep his mouth padlocked and not betray me ? " " He 'll do as he pleases about that , " she said indifferently . " Then I do n't reckon I 'll trouble his hospitality . Good-by , Miss Sanderson . I 've enjoyed meeting you very much . " He checked his pony and bowed . " Where are you going ? " the girl exclaimed . " Up Bear Creek . " " It 's twenty miles . You ca n't do it . " " Sure I can . Thanks for your kindness , Miss Sanderson . I 'll return the handkerchief some day , " and with a touch swung round his pony . " You 're not going . I wo n't have it , and you wounded ! " He turned in the saddle , smiling at her with jaunty insouciance . " I 'll answer for Jim . He wo n't betray you , " she promised , subduing her pride . " Thanks . I 'll take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . I 've had all the Christian charity that 's good for me this mo'ning , " he drawled . At that she flamed out passionately : " Do you want me to tell you that I like you , knowing what you are ? Do you want me to pretend that I feel friendly when I hate you ? " " Do you want me to be under obligations to folks that hate me ? " he came back with his easy smile . " You have lost a lot of blood . Your arm is still bleeding . You know I ca n't let you go alone . " " You 're ce'tainly aching for a chance to be a Good Samaritan , Miss Sanderson . " With this he left her . But he had not gone a hundred yards before he heard her pony cantering after his . One glance told him she was furious , both at him and at herself . " Did you come after your handkerchief , ma'am ? I 'm not through with it yet , " he said innocently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave you till we meet some one that will take charge of you , " she choked . " It is n't necessary . I 'm much obliged , ma'am , but you 're overestimating the effect of this pill your friend injected into me . " " Still , I 'm going . I wo n't have your death on my hands , " she told him defiantly . " Sho ! I ai n't aimin ' to pass over the divide on account of a scratch like this . There 's no danger but what I can look out for myself . " She waited in silence for him to start , looking straight ahead of her . He tried in vain to argue her out of it . She had nothing to say , and he saw she was obstinately determined to carry her point . Finally , with a little chuckle at her stubbornness , he gave in and turned round . " All right . Yeager 's it is . We 're acting like a pair of kids , seems to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she disdained to answer . Yeager saw them from afar , and recognized the girl . " Hello , Phyllis ! " he shouted down . " With you in a minute . " The girl slipped to the ground , and climbed the steep trail to meet him . Her crisp " Wait here , " flung over her shoulder with the slightest turn of the head , kept Keller in the saddle . Halfway up she and the man met . The one waiting below could not hear what they said , but he could tell she was explaining the situation to Yeager . The latter nodded from time to time , protested , was vehemently overruled , and seemed to leave the matter with her . Together they retraced their way . Young Yeager , in flannel shirt and half-leg miner 's boots , was a splendid specimen of bronzed Arizona . His level gaze judged the man on horseback , approved him , and met him eye to eye . " Better light , Mr. Keller . If you come in we 'll have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward thing to happen to a man on the trail . It 's right fortunate Miss Sanderson found you so soon after it happened . " The nester knew a surge of triumph in his blood , but it did not show in the impassive face which he turned upon his host . " It was right fortunate for me , " he said , swinging from the saddle . Incidentally he was wondering what story had been narrated to Yeager , but he took a chance without hesitation . " A fellow ought n't to be so careless when he 's got a gun in his hand . " " You 're right , seh . In this country of heavy underbrush a man 's gun is liable to go off and hit somebody any time if he ai n't careful . You 're in big luck you did n't shoot yourself up a heap worse . " Yeager led the way to his cabin , and offered Phyllis the single chair he boasted , and the nester a seat on the bed . Sitting beside him , he examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invalid I 'm a false alarm , " Keller said apologetically . " I did n't want to come , but Miss Sanderson would bring me . " " She was dead right , too . Time you had ridden twenty miles through the hot sun with that wound you would have been in a raging fever . " " One way and another I 'm quite in her debt . " " That 's so , " agreed Yeager , intent on his work . She refused to meet the nester 's smile . " Fiddlesticks ! You talk mighty foolish , Jim . I would n't go away and leave a wounded dog if I could help it . " " Suppose the dog were a sheep-killer ? " Keller asked with his engaging , impudent smile . A dust cloud rose from her skirt under a stroke of the restless quirt . " I 'd do my best for it and let it settle with the law afterward . " " Even if it were a wolf caught in a trap ? " " I should put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I detested it , I would n't leave it there to suffer . " " I 'm quite sure you would n't , " the wounded man agreed . Yeager looked from one to the other , not quite catching the drift of the underlying meaning . Another thing puzzled him , too . But , like most men of the unfenced Southwest , Yeager had a large capacity for silence . Now he attended strictly to his business , without mentioning what he had noticed . The wound dressed , Phyllis rose to leave . " You 'll be down for your mail to-morrow , Jim , " she suggested , as she sauntered toward the door . " Sure . I 'll let you know how our patient is getting along . " " Oh , he 's yours . I do n't want any of the credit , " she returned carelessly . Then , the words scarce off her lips , she gave a little cry of alarm , and stepped quickly back into the room . What she had seen had sapped the color from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " It 's Phil and Brill Healy . You 've got to hide us , Jim , " she told him tensely . The nester began to grin . He always did when he faced a difficulty apparently insurmountable . Also his fingers slid toward the butt of his revolver . CHAPTER IV " I 'M A RUSTLER AND A THIEF , AM I ? " Jim swept the cabin with a gesture . " Where can I hide you ? Anyhow , there are the horses in plain sight . " Phyllis took imperious control . " Get a coat on him , Jim , " she ordered . At the same time she caught up the basin of bloodstained water and flung its contents through the open window . The torn linen and the stained handkerchief she tossed into a corner and covered with a gunny sack . " Not a word about the wound , Jim . Mr. Keller is here to help you do your assessment work , remember . And whatever I say , do n't give me away . " Yeager nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was straightening out the shoulders . The nester 's eyes were shining with excitement . Alone of the three , he was enjoying himself . " Remember now . Do n't talk too much . Let me run this , " the girl cautioned , and with that she stepped to the door , caught sight of her brother with a glad little cry of apparent relief , and ran swiftly to him . " Oh , Phil ! " she almost sobbed , and the stress of her emotion was genuine enough , even if she dissembled as to the cause . The boy patted her dark hair gently . They were twins , without other near relatives except their father , and the tie between them was close . " What is it , Phyllie ? Why did n't you stay where we left you ? " " I was afraid for you . And I rode a little nearer . Then he came straight toward me -- and I rode away . I could hear him crashing through the mesquite . When I reached the trail of Jim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be here . " " Sure . Course she was scared . What woman would n't be ? We ought n't both to have left her . But there was n't one chance in a thousand of his stumbling on the very spot where she was , " said Healy . Phil gentled her with a caressing hand . " It 's all right now , sis . Did you happen to see the fellow at all ? " " Yes . At a distance . " " I do n't suppose you would know him , " Healy said . She gave a strained little laugh . " I did n't wait to get a description of him . Did n't you boys recognize him ? " After Phil 's answer she breathed freer . " We did not get near enough , though Brill got two shots at him as he pulled out . He was going hell-for-leather and Brill missed both times . " He lowered his voice and asked angrily : " What 's he doing here ? " For Keller had followed Yeager from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pockets . He wore no hat , and had the manner of one very much at home . " He 's helping Jim with his assessment work , " she answered in the same low tone . " It 's too bad you lost the rustler . He must have broken for the hills . " Healy 's eyes had narrowed to slits . Now he murmured a question : " What about this man Keller ? Was he here when you came , Phyl ? " The girl turned to Yeager , who had sauntered up . " Did n't you say he came this morning , Jim ? " Yeager 's eyes were like a stone wall . " Yep . This mo'ning . I needed some husky guy to help me , so I got him . " " Funny you had to get a fellow from Bear Creek to help you , Jim . " " Are you looking for a job , Brill ? " " No . Why ? " " Because I ai n't noticed any stampede this way among the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can find him , Brill , and I do n't ask you to O.K. him . " " I see you do n't , Jim . The boys are n't going to like it very well , though . " " Then they know what they can do about it , " Yeager answered evenly , level eyes steadily on those of his critic . " What time did this nester get here , Jim ? " broke in Phil . Yeager 's opaque eyes passed from Healy to Sanderson . " It might have been about eight . " " Then he could n't be the man , " the boy said to Healy , almost in a whisper . " What man ? " Jim asked . " We ran on a rustler branding a C.O. calf . We got close enough to take a shot at him . Then he slid into some arroyo , and we lost him , " Phil exclaimed . " How long ago was this ? " asked Yeager . " About an hour since we first saw him . Beats all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him when he gave us the slip . " " Oh , he gave you the slip , did he ? " " Dropped into some hole and pulled it in after him . These hills are built for hide and seek , looks like . " " Notice the color of his horse ? " " It was a roan , Jim . Something like that nester 's . " Phil nodded toward the animal Keller had ridden . All eyes focused hard on the horse with the white stockings . " What brand was he putting on the calf ? That 'll tell you who the man was . " Phil and Healy looked at each other , and the latter laughed . " That 's one on us . We did n't stay to look , but got right out for Mr. Rustler . " " Did he kill the cow ? " Phil nodded . " Then you 'll find the calf still hanging around there unless he had a pal to drive it away . " " That 's right . We 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " She stepped to her horse , and swung to the saddle . Meanwhile Healy rode forward to the cabin . Through narrowed lids he looked down at the man standing in the doorway . " Give that message to your friends ? " he demanded insolently . There are men who have to look at each other only once to know that there is born between them a perpetual hostility . Each of these men had felt it at the first shock of meeting eyes . They would feel it again as often as they looked at each other . " No , " the nester answered . " Why not ? " " I did n't care to . You may carry your own messages . " " When I do I 'll carry them with a gun . " " Interesting if true . " Keller 's gaze passed derisively over him and dismissed the man . " And I hope when I come I 'll meet Mr. Keller first . " The nester 's attention was focused indolently upon the hills . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped out a sudden oath , drove the spurs in , and went down the trail with his broncho on the buck . Keller looked at Yeager and laughed , but that young man met him with a frosty eye . " I 've got some questions to ask you , Mr. Keller , " he said . " Unload ' em . " Yeager led the way inside , offered his guest the chair , and sat down on the bed with his arms on the table which had been drawn close to it . " In the first place , I 'll announce myself . I do n't hold with rustlers or waddies . I 'm a white man . That being understood , I want to know where we 're at . " " Meaning ? " " Miss Phyllis unloads a story on me about you shooting yourself up accidental . Soon as I looked at you that looked fishy to me . You ai n't that kind of a durn fool . Would you mind handing me a dipper of water ? Thanks . " Yeager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipper back into the pail . " I noticed you handed me that water with your right hand . Your gun is on your right side . Then how in Mexico , you being right-handed , did you manage to shoot yourself in the right arm below the elbow ? " Keller laughed dryly , and offered no information . " Quite a Sherlock Holmes , ai n't you ? " " Hell , no ! I got eyes in my head , though . Moreover , that bullet went in at right angles to your arm . How did you make out to do that ? " " Sleight of hand , " suggested the other . " No powder marks , either . And , lastly , it was , a rifle did it , not a revolver . " " Anything more ? " " Some . That side talk between you and Miss Phyllis was n't over and above clear to me then . I savez it now . She hates you like p'ison , but she 's too tender-hearted to give you up . Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She lied for you to me . She lied again to Phil . So did I. Oh , we did n't lie in words , but it 's the same thing . Now , I would n't lie to save my own skin . Why then should I for yours , and you a rustler and a thief ? " " I 'm a rustler and a thief , am I ? " " Ai n't you ? " " Would you believe me if I said I was n't ? " Yeager debated an instant before he answered flatly , " No . " " Then I wo n't say it . " The wounded man tossed his answer off so flippantly that Yeager scowled at him . " Mr. Keller , you 're a newcomer here . I wonder if you know what the Malpais country would be liable to do to a man caught rustling now . " " I can guess . " " Let me tell what I know and your life would n't be worth a plugged quarter . " " Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on the table . " Because of Phyl Sanderson . That 's why . She put it up to me , and I played her game . But I ai n't sure I 'm going to keep on playing it . I 'm a Malpais man . My father has a ranch down there , and I 've rode the range all my life . Why should I throw down my friends to save a rustler caught in the act ? " " You 've already tried and convicted me , I see . " " The facts convict you , seh . " " Your understanding of the facts , I reckon you mean . " " I have n't noticed that you 're giving me any chance to understand them different , " Yeager cut back dryly . The nester took from his pocket a little pearl-handled knife , picked up a potato from a basket beside him , and began to whittle on it absently . He looked across the table at the man sitting on the bed , and debated a question in his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he keep his own counsel ? " I see you 've got Miss Sanderson 's knife . Did you forget to return it ? " Yeager made comment . For just an instant Keller 's eye confessed amazement . " Miss Sanderson 's knife ! Why -- how did you know it was hers ? " he asked , gathering himself together lamely . " I ought to know , seeing as I gave it to her for a Christmas present . Sent to Denver for that knife , I did . Best lady 's knife in the market , I 'm told . Made in Sheffield , England . " " Ye-es . It 's sure a good knife . I 'll ce'tainly return it next time I see her . " " Funny she ever let you get away with it . She 's some particular who she lends that knife to , " Jim said proudly . Keller wiped the blade carefully , shut it , and put the knife back in his pocket . Nevertheless , he was worried in his mind . For what Yeager had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility , even a probability , very distasteful to him . He was in trouble himself , and before he was through he expected to get others into deep water , too . But not Phyllis Sanderson -- surely not this impulsive girl with the blue-black hair and dark , scornful eyes . Wherefore he decided to keep silent now and let Yeager do what he would . " I reckon , seh , you 'll have to do your own guessing at the facts , " he said gently . " Just as you say , Mr. Keller . I reckon if you had anything to say for yourself you would say it . Now , I 'll do what talking I 've got to do . You may stay here twenty-four hours . After that you may hit the trail for Bear Creek . I 'm going down to Seven Mile to tell what I know . " " That 's all right . I 'll go along and return the pocketknife . " Yeager viewed him with stern disgust . " Do n't make any mistake , seh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never go back . " " Sure . Life 's full of chances . There 's even a chance I 'm not a rustler . " " Then I 'd advise you not to go down to Seven Mile with me . I 'd hate to find out too late I 'd helped hang the wrong man , " Yeager dryly answered . CHAPTER V AN AIDER AND ABETTOR Having come to an understanding , Yeager and Keller wasted no time or temper in acrimony . Both of them belonged to that big outdoors West which plays the game to the limit without littleness . They were in hostile camps , but that did not prevent them from holding amiable conversation on the common topics of Cattleland . Only one of these they avoided by mutual consent . Neither of them had anything to say about rustling . Together they ate and smoked and slept , and in the morning after breakfast they saddled and set out for Seven Mile . A man might have traveled far without seeing finer specimens of the frontier , any more competent , self-restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and loose seat , breaking long silences with occasional drawling comment . For in the cow country strong men talk only when they have something to say . The stage had just left when they reached Seven Mile , and Public Opinion was seated on the porch as per custom . It regarded Keller with a stony , expressionless hostility . Yeager with frank disapprobation . Just before swinging from the saddle , Jim turned to the nester . " I 'm giving you an hour , seh . After that , I 'm going to speak my little piece to the boys . " " Thank you . An hour will be plenty , " Keller answered , and passed into the store , apparently oblivious of the silent observation focused upon him . Phyllis , busy unwrapping a package of papers , glanced up to see his curly head in the stamp window . " Anything for L. Keller ? " he wanted to know , after he had unburdened himself of a friendly " Mornin ' , Miss Sanderson . " Her impulse was to ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took the letters from the K pigeonhole and found two for him . " Thank you , I 'm feeling fine , " he laughed , gathering up his mail . " I did n't ask you how you were feeling , " she answered , turning coldly to her newspapers . " I thought mebbe you 'd want to know about my punctured tire . " " It 's very good of you to relieve my anxiety . " " Let me relieve it some more , Miss Sanderson . Here 's the knife you lost . " She glanced up carelessly at the pearl-handled knife he pushed through the window . " I did n't know it was lost . " " Well , now you know it 's found . When do you remember seeing it last , ma'am ? " " I lent it to a friend two days ago . " " Oh , to a friend -- two days ago . " His eyes were on her so steadily that the girl was aware of some significance he gave to the fact , some hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Miss Sanderson ? " He asked it casually , but his question irritated her . " I did n't say , sir . " " That 's so . You did n't . " " Where did you get it ? " she demanded . He grinned . " I 'll tell you that if you 'll tell me who you lent it to . " Her curt answer reminded him that he was in her eyes a convicted criminal . " It 's of no importance , sir . " " That 's what you think , Miss Sanderson . " She sorted the newspapers in the bundle , and began to slip them into the private boxes where they belonged . Presently , however , her curiosity demanded satisfaction . Without looking at him , she volunteered information . " But there 's no mystery about it . Phil borrowed the knife to fix a stirrup leather , and forgot to give it back to me . " " Your brother ? " " Yes . " He was taken aback . There was nothing for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeager 's mine yesterday . I reckon he must have dropped it on his way there . " " I do n't see anything very mysterious about that , " she said frostily . She looked so definitely unaware of him as she worked that he fell back from the window and passed out to the porch . He had found out more than he wanted to know . Jim Yeager 's drawling voice came to him , gentle and low as usual , but with an edge to it . " I been discoverin ' I 'm some unpopular to-day , Brill . Malpais has been expressin ' its opinion right plain . You 've arrived in time to chirp in with a ' Me , too . ' " Healy had evidently just ridden up , for he was still in the saddle . He relaxed into one of the easy attitudes used by men of the plains to rest themselves without dismounting . " You know my sentiments , Jim , " he replied , not unamiably . " Sure I know them . Plumb dissatisfied with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jim was sailing into the full tide of his sarcasm when Keller touched him on the shoulder . " I 'd like to see you for a moment , Mr. Yeager , if you can give me the time , " he said . Healy took in the nester with an eye of jade . " Your twin brother wants you , Jim . Run along with him . Do n't mind us . " " I wo n't , Brill . " The young man rose , and sauntered off with the Bear Creek settler . At the corral fence , some fifty yards from the house , he stopped under the shade of a live oak , and put his arms on the top rail . He had allowed himself to show no sign of it , but he resented this claim upon him that seemed to ally him further with the enemy . " Here I am , Mr. Keller . What can I do for you ? " " You 're a friend of Miss Sanderson . You would stand between her and trouble ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then find out for me what Phil Sanderson did with the knife his sister lent him two days ago . Find out whether he lent it to anybody , and , if so , who . " " What for ? " It had come to a show-down , and the other tabled his cards . " I found that knife yesterday mo'ning . It was lying beside the dead cow in the park where your friends happened on me . I reckon the rustlers must have heard me coming and drove the calf away just before I arrived . In his hurry one of them forgot that knife . If you 'll tell me the man who had it in his pocket yesterday when he left-home , I 'll tell you who one of the Malpais rustlers is . " Jim considered this , his gaze upon the far-away range . When he brought it back to Keller , he was smiling incredulously . " I hear you say so , seh . But what a man with , a halter round his neck says do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about that . " " Then I have n't disappointed you . " He continued presently , with cold hostility : " That story you cooked up is about the only one you could spring . What surprises me is that a man with as good a head as yours took twenty-four hours to figure out your explanation . I want to tell you , too , that it do n't make any hit with me that you 're trying to throw the blame on a boy I 've known all my life . " " Who happens to be a brother of Miss Sanderson , " Keller let himself suggest . Yeager flushed . " That ai n't the point . " " The point is that I 'm trying to clear this boy , and I want your help . " " Looks to me like you want to clear yourself . " " If I prove to you that I 'm not a rustler , will you padlock your tongue and help me clear young Sanderson ? " " I sure will -- if you prove it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two letters he had just received . " Read these . " When he had read , Yeager handed them back , and offered his hand . " That clears you , seh . Truth is , I never was satisfied you was a rustler . My mind was satisfied ; but , durn it , you did n't look like a waddy . It 's lucky I had n't spoke to the boys yet . " " I want to keep this quiet , " the Bear Creek settler explained . " Sure . I 'm a clam , and at your service , seh . " " Then find out the truth about the knife . " Yeager 's eye chiselled into that of Keller . " Mind , I ai n't going to help you bring trouble to Phyllie , and I ai n't going to stand by and see it , either . " The other smiled . " I do n't ask it of you . What I want is to clear the boy . " " Good enough , " agreed Yeager , and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , a figure dropped from the foliage of the live oak under which they had been standing , and rolled like a ball from the fence into the deep dust of the corral . It picked itself up in a gray cloud , from which shone as a nucleus a black face with beady eyes and flashing-white teeth . Swiftly it scampered across the paddock , disappeared into the rear of the stable , and reappeared at the front door . " Here you , ' Rastus , where you been ? " demanded the wrangler . " Did n't I tell you to clean Miss Phyl 's trap ? I 've wore my lungs out hollering for you . Now , you git to work , or I 'll wear you to a frazzle . " ' Rastus , general alias for his baptismal name of George Washington Abraham Lincoln Randolph , grinned and ducked , shot out of the stable like a streak of light , and appeared ten seconds later in the kitchen presided over by his rotund mother , Becky . His abrupt entrance disturbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky rolled affronted eyes at him . " What you doin ' here , Gawge Washington ? Ai n't I done tole you sebenty times seben to keep outa my kitchen at dis time o ' day ? " " I wanter see Miss Phyl . " " Then I low you kin take it out in wantin ' . Think she got time to fool away on a nigger sprout like you-all ? Light a shuck back to the stable , where you belong . " ' Rastus grinned amiably , flung himself at a door , and vanished into that part of the house which was forbidden territory to him , the while Becky stared after him in amazement . " What in tarnation got in dat nigger child ? " she gasped . Phyllis , having arranged the mail and delivered most of it , had left the store in charge of the clerk and retired to her private den , a cool room finished in restful tints at the northeast corner of the house . She was sitting by a window reading a magazine , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Rastus and the whites of his rolling eyes . She nodded and smiled . " What can I do for you , George Washington Abraham Lincoln Randolph ? " " I done come to tell you somepin I heerd whilst I was asleep in de live oak at the corral . " " Something you dreamed . It is very good of you , George Wash --  --  " " Now , do n't you call me all dat again , Miss Phyl . And I did n't dream it nerrer . I woke up and heerd it . Mr. Jim Yeager and dat nester they call Keller wuz a-talkin ' , and Mr. Jim he allowed dat Keller wuz a rustler , and den Keller he allowed dat Mr. Phil wuz de rustler . " " What ! " The girl had sprung to her feet , amazed , her dark eyes blazing indignation . " Tha 's what he said . He went on to tell how he done found a knife by the dead cow , an ' ' twuz yore knife , an ' you done loan it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was a creature transformed by passion . The hot blood of Southern ancestors raced through her veins clamorously . She wanted to strike down this man , to annihilate him and the cowardly lie he had given to shield himself . And pat to her need came the very person she could best use for her instrument . Healy stood surprised in the doorway , confronted by the slender young amazon . The storm of passion in the eyes , the underlying flush in the dusky cheeks , indicated a new mood in his experience of this young woman of many moods . " Come in and shut the door , " she ordered . Then , " Tell him , ' Rastus . " The boy , all smiles gone now , repeated his story , and was excused . " What do you think of that , Brill ? " the girl demanded , after the door had closed on him . The stockman 's eyes had grown hard . " I think Keller 's covering his own tracks . Of course we 've got no direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in . " I ca n't see it . According to Jim Yeager --  --  " " Jim lied . I asked him to . " " You -- what ? " " I asked him to say that this man had come there to work for him . Jim was not to blame . " " But -- why ? " She threw out a gesture of self-contempt . " Why did I do it ? I do n't know . Because he was wounded , I suppose . " " Wounded ! Then I did hit him ? " " Yes . In the arm -- a flesh wound . I met him riding through the mesquite . After I had tied up his wound , I took him to Jim 's . " His eyes narrowed slightly . " So you tied up his wound ? " " Yes , " she answered defiantly , her head up . " That tender heart of yours , " he murmured , with almost a sneer . " Yes . I 'm a fool . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Oh , well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on Phil . Hunt him down , Brill . Bring him to me . I 'll tell all I know against him , " she cried vindictively . " I 'll get him , Phyl , " he promised , and the sound of his laughter was not pleasant . " I 'll get him for you , or find out why . " " Think of him trying to put it on Phil , and after I stood by him and kept his secret . Is n't that the worst ever ? " the girl flamed . " He rode away not five minutes ago as big as coffee on that ugly roan of his with the white stockings ; knew what we thought about him , but did n't pay any more attention to us than as if we were bumps on a log . " Healy strode out to the porch , told his story , and within five minutes had organized his posse and appointed a rendezvous for two hours later at Seven Mile . At the appointed time his men were on hand , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grim business . From her window Phyllis saw them ride away , and persuaded herself that she was glad . Vengeance was about to fall upon this insolent freebooter who had not even manhood enough to appreciate a kindness . But as the hours passed she was beset by a consuming anxiety . What more likely than that he would resist ! If so , there could be only one end . She could not keep her thoughts from those seven men whom she had sent against the one . There was nobody to whom she could talk about it , for Phil and her father were away at Noches . Restless as a caged panther , she twice had her horse brought to the door , and rode into the hills to meet her posse . But she could not be sure which way they would come , and after venturing a short distance she would return for fear they might arrive in her absence . Night had fallen over the country , and the stars were out long before she got back the second time . Nine -- ten -- eleven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she waited . At last they came , their prisoner riding in the midst , bareheaded and with his hands tied . " I 've got him , Phyl ! " Healy cried in a voice that told the girl he was riding on a wave of triumph . " I see you have . " Nevertheless she looked not at the victor , but at the vanquished , and never had she seen a man who looked more master of his fate than this one . He was smiling down at her whimsically , and she saw they had not taken him without a struggle . The marks of it were on them and on him . Healy 's cheek bone was laid open in a nasty cut , and Slim had a handkerchief tied round his head . As for Keller , his shirt was in ribbons and dyed with the stains of blood from the wound that had broken out again in the battle . The hair on the left side of his head was clotted with dried blood , and his cheeks were covered with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched badly . But his mien was as jaunty , his smile as gallant , as if he had come at the head of a conquering army . " Good evenin ' , Miss Sanderson , " he bowed ironically . She looked at him , and turned away without answering . She heard Healy curse softly and knew why . This man contrived somehow to rob him of his triumph . " You are none of you hurt , Brill ? " the girl asked in a low voice . " No . He fought like a wild cat , but we took him by surprise . He had only his bare fists . " " How about him ? Is he hurt ? " " I do n't know -- or care , " the man answered sullenly . " But he must be looked to . " " I do n't know why . It ai n't my fault we had to beat him up . " " I did n't say it was your fault , Brill , " she answered gently . " But any one can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds are full of dust . They must be washed . I want him brought into the house . Aunt Becky and I will look after him . " " No need of that . Slim will fix him up . " She shook her head . " No , Brill . " His eyes gave way first , but his surrender came with a bad grace . " All right , Phyl . But he 's going to be covered by a gun all the time . I 'm not taking chances on him . " " Then have him taken into my den . I 'll wake Aunt Becky and we 'll be there in a few minutes . " When Phyllis arrived with Aunt Becky she found the nester sitting on the lounge , Healy opposite him with a revolver close to his hand . The prisoner 's arms had been freed . His sardonic smile still twitched at the corners of his mouth . " You 've ce'tainly begun your practice on a disreputable patient , Doctor Sanderson . I have n't had time to comb my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure did have a sociable time . They 're all good mixers . " He looked into the long glass opposite , laughed at sight of his swollen face , then rattled into a misquotation of some verses he remembered : " There 's many a black black eye , they say , but none so bright as mine ; For I 'm to be Queen o ' the May , mother , I 'm to be Queen o ' the May . " " Put the water and things down on that table , Becky , " her mistress told her , ignoring the man 's blithe folly . " I 'm giving you lots of chances to do the Good Samaritan act , " he continued . " Honest , I hate to be so much trouble . You 'll have to blame Mr. Healy . He 's the responsible party for these little accidents of mine . " " I 'm going to be responsible for one more , " the stockman told him darkly . " I understand your intentions are good , but I 've noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back promptly . " Not this time , I think . " Phyllis understood that Brill was threatening the nester and that the latter was defying him lightly , but what either meant precisely she did not know . She proceeded to business without a word except the necessary directions to Becky . Not until the arm was dressed and the wound on the head washed and bandaged did she address Keller . " I 'll send you a powder that will help you get to sleep . The doctor left it here for Phil , and he did not need it , " she said . " Mebbe I wo n't need it , either . " Keller laughed hardily , at his enemy it seemed to the girl , and with some hint of a sinister understanding between them from which she was excluded . " Thanks just the same , for that and for everything else you 've done for me . " Phyllis said " Good night " stiffly , and followed the old negress out . She went directly to her bedroom , but not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to her a day full of excitement . She had much to think of . Going to the open window , she sat down in a low chair with her arms across the sill . Two men met beneath her window . " Gim me the makings , Slim , " one said to the other . While he was shaking the tobacco from the pouch to the paper , Slim spoke . " The boys ought all to be here in another hour , Budd . After that , it wo n't take us long . " " Not long , " the fat man answered uneasily . There was a silence . Slim broke it . " We got to do it , o ' course . " " Looks like . Got to make an example . No peace on the range till we do . " " I hate like sin to , Budd . He 's so damn game . " " Me , too . But we got to . No two ways about it . " " I reckon . Brill says so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for his life . " They moved off together in troubled silence , Budd 's cigarette glowing red in the darkness . Behind them they left a girl shocked and rigid . They were going to lynch him ! She knew it as certainly as if she had been told it in set words . Her blood grew cold , and she shivered . While the confused horror of it raced through her brain , she noticed subconsciously that her fingers on the sill were trembling violently . What could she do ? She was only a girl . These men deferred to her in the trivial pleasantries , but she knew they would go their grim way no matter how she pleaded . And it would be her fault . She had betrayed the rustler to them . It would be the same as if she had murdered him . He had known while she was tending his wounds that she had delivered him to death , and he had not even reproached her . Courage flowed back to her heart . She would save him if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how ? For of course he was guarded . She stepped out into the corridor . All was dark there . She tiptoed along it to the guest room , and found the door unlocked . Nobody was inside . She canvassed in her mind the possibilities . They might have him outdoors or in the men 's bunk house with them under a guard , or they might have locked him up somewhere until the arrival of the others . If the latter , it must be in the store , since that was the only safe place under lock and key . Phyllis slipped out of the back door into the darkness , and skirted the house at a distance . There were lights in the bunk house of the ranch riders , and through the window she could see a group gathered . Creeping close to the window , she looked in . Their prisoner was not with them . In front of the store two men were seated in the darkness . She was almost upon them before she saw them . Each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " one of them cried sharply . It was Tom Dixon . Phyllis came forward and spoke . " That you , Tom ? I suppose you are guarding the prisoner . " " Yep . Ca n't you sleep , Phyl ? " He walked a dozen yards with her . " I could n't , but I see you 're keeping watch , all right . I probably can now . I suppose I was nervous . " " No wonder . But you may sleep , all right . He wo n't trouble you any . I 'll guarantee that , " he promised largely . " Oh , Phyl ! " She had turned to go , but she stopped at his call . " Well ? " " Do n't you be mad at me . I was only fooling the other day . Course I had n't ought to have got gay . But a fellow makes a break once in a while . " Under the stress of her deeper anxiety she had forgotten all about her tiff with him . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his affairs had been relegated to second place in her mind . He was only a boy , full of the vanity that was a part of him . Somehow , her anger against him was all burnt out . " If you never will again , Tom , " she conceded . " I 'll be good , " he smiled , meaning that he would be good as long as he must . " All right , " she said , without much enthusiasm . She left him and passed into the house without haste . But once inside she fairly flew to Phil 's room . On a nail near the head of his bed hung a key . She took this , descended to the kitchen , and from there noiselessly down the stairway to the cellar . She groped her way without a light along the adobe wall till she came to a door which was unlocked . This opened into another part of the cellar , used as a room for storing supplies needed in their trade . Past barrels and boxes she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of eight or nine steps a door barred progress . Very carefully she found the keyhole , fitted in the key , and by infinitesimal degrees unlocked the door . The night seemed alive with the noise of her movements . Now the door creaked as it swung open before her . She waited , heart beating like a trip hammer , and stared into the blackness of the store . " Who is it ? " a voice asked in a low tone . " It 's me , Phyl Sanderson . Are you alone ? " she whispered . " Yes . Tied to a chair . Guards are just outside . " She went toward him softly with hands outstretched in the darkness , and presently her fingers touched his face . They travelled downward till they found the ropes which bound him . For a moment she fumbled at the knots before she remembered a swifter way . " Wait , " she breathed , and stole back of the counter to the case where pocketknives were kept . Finding one , she ran to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rose and stretched his cramped limbs . " This way . " Phyllis took him by the hand , and led him to the stairs . Together they descended , after she had locked the door . Another minute , and they stood in the kitchen , still hand in hand . The girl released herself . " You will find Slim 's horse tied to the fence of the corral . When you reach it , ride for your life , " she said . " Why have you saved me after you betrayed me ? " he demanded . " I save you because I did betray you . I could n't have your blood on my head . Now , go . " " Not till I know why you betrayed me . " " You can ask that . " Her indignation gathered and broke . " Because you are what you are . Because I know what you told Jim Yeager this afternoon . Why do n't you go ? " " What did I tell Yeager ? About the knife , you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save yourself . " " Did Yeager tell you that ? " " No , but I know it , " She pushed him toward the door . " Go , while there is still a chance . " " I 'm not going -- not yet . Not till you promise to ask Yeager what I said . " A footstep sounded , and the door opened . The intruder stopped , his hand still on the handle , aware that there were others in the room . " Who is it ? " Phyllis breathed , stricken almost dumb with terror . " It 's Slim . Hope I ai n't buttin ' in , Phyllie . " Unconsciously he had given her the cue she needed . " Well , you are . " She laughed nervously , as might a lover caught unexpectedly . " It's -- it 's Phil , " she pretended to pretend . " Oh , it 's Phil . " Slim laughed in kindly derision , and declared before he went out : " I expect you would spell his name B-r-i-double l . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile I 'll be mum as a clam till you say the word . " With which he jingled away . The door was scarce closed before the girl turned on Keller . " There ! You see . They may catch you any moment . " " Will you ask Yeager ? " " Yes , if you 'll go . " " All right . I 'll go . " Still he did not leave . The magic of this slim girl had swept him from his feet . In imagination he still felt the touch of her warm fingers , soft as a caress , the thrill of her hair as it had brushed his cheek when she had stooped over him . The drag of sex was upon him and had set him trembling strangely . " Why do n't you go ? " she cried softly . He snatched himself away . But before he had reached the door he came back in two strides . Startled and unnerved , she waited on him . He caught both her hands in his , and opened them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing of the motion . There for an instant he stood , looking down into her eyes by the faint light that sifted through the window upon her . " What -- what do you want ? " she demanded tremulously , emotion flooding her in waves . " Why are you saving me , girl ? " " I -- do n't know . I 've told you why . " " I 'm a villain , by your way of it , yet you save my life even while you think me a skunk . I ca n't thank you . What 's the use of trying ? " He looked down into her eyes , and that gaze did more than thank her . It told her he would never forget and never let her forget . How it happened she could not afterward remember , but she found herself in his arms , his kiss tingling through her blood like wine . She thrust him from her -- and he was gone . She sank into a chair beside the kitchen table , her pulses athrob with excitement . Scorn herself she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole capacity for emotion was keyed to an agony of apprehension for this prince of scamps . By the beating of her galloping heart she timed his steps . He must have reached the horse now . Already he would have it untied , would be in the saddle . Surely by this time he had eluded the sentries and was slipping out of the danger zone . Before him lay the open road , the hills , and safety . A cry rang out in the stillness -- and another . A shot , the beat of running feet , a panted oath , more shots ! The silent night had suddenly become vocal with action and the fierce passions of men . She covered her face with her hands to shut out the vision of what her imagination conjured -- a horse flying with empty saddle into the darkness , while a huddled figure sank together lifeless by the roadside . CHAPTER VI A GOOD FRIEND How long she remained there Phyllis did not know . Fear drummed at her heart . She was sick with apprehension . At last her very terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to the front of the house and saw a light in the store . Swiftly she ran across and up the steps to the porch . Three men were inside examining the empty chair by the light of a lantern one held in his hand . " Did -- did he get away ? " the girl faltered . The men turned . One of them was Slim . He held in his hand pieces of the slashed rope and the open pocket-knife that had freed the prisoner . " Looks like it , " Slim answered . " With some help from a friend . Now , I wonder who that useful friend was and how in time he got in here ? " Her eyes betrayed her . Just for an instant they swept to the cellar door , to make sure it was still shut . But that one glance was enough . Slim , about to speak , changed his mind , and stared at her with parted lips . She saw suspicion grow in his face and resolve itself to certainty , helped to decision by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairway from the store connect with the kitchen cellar , Phyllie ? " he asked . " Ye-es . " He nodded , then laughed without mirth . " I reckon I can tell you , boys , who Mr. Keller 's friend in need is . " " Who ? I 'd like right well to know . " Brill Healy , in a pallid fury , had just come in and was listening . Phyllis turned and faced him . " I was that friend , Brill . " " You ! " He stared at her in astonishment . " You ! Why , it was you sent me out to run him down . " " I did n't tell you that I wanted you to murder him , did I ? " " I guess there 's a lot between him and you that you did n't tell me , " he jeered . Slim grinned , not at all maliciously . " I reckon that 's right . I do n't need to ask you now , Phyllie , who it was I found with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " she protested . " Sure , and I busted into the good-bys right inconsiderate . " " Go ahead , Slim . I 'm only a girl . You and Brill say what you like , " she flashed at him , the nails of her fingers biting into the palms of her hands . " Only do n't say it out loud , " cautioned a new voice . Jim Yeager was at the door , and he was looking very pointedly at Healy . " I say what I think , Jim , " Brill retorted promptly . " And you think ? " Healy slammed his fist down hard on the counter . " I think things ai n't right when a Malpais girl helps a hawss thief and a rustler to escape twice . " " Take care , Brill , " advised Phyllis . " Not right how ? " asked Yeager quietly , but in an ominous tone . " Do n't you two go to twisting my meaning . All Malpais knows that no better girl than Phyl Sanderson ever breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grateful for this indorsement , sir , " she murmured with mock humility . " Do I understand that Keller has made his getaway ? " Jim Yeager asked . " He sure has -- clean as a whistle . " " Then you idiots want to be plumb grateful to Phyllie . He ai n't any more a rustler than I am . If you had hanged him you would have hanged an innocent man . " " Prove it , " cried Healy . Jim looked at him quietly . " I cay n't prove it just now . You 'll have to take my word for it . " " Yore word goes with me , Jim , even if I am an idiot by yore say-so , " his father announced promptly . Jim smiled and let an arm fall across the shoulders of James Yeager , Senior . " I ai n't countin ' you in on that class , dad . You got to trailing with bad company . I 'll have to bring you up stricter . " " I hate to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own eyes before your indorsement , " Healy sneered . " That 's your privilege , Brill . " " I reckon Jim knows what he 's talking about , " said Yeager , Senior , with intent to conciliate . " Of course I know you 're right friendly with him , Jim . There 's nobody more competent to pass an opinion on him . Like enough you know all about his affairs , " conceded Healy with polite malice . The two young men were looking at each other steadily . They never had been friends , and lately they had been a good deal less than that . Rival leaders of the range for years , another cause had lately fanned their rivalry to a flame . Now a challenge had been flung down and accepted . " I expect I know more about them than you do , Brill . " " Sure you do . Ai n't he just got through being your guest ? Did n't he come visiting you in a hurry ? Did n't you tie up his wound ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antedate his arrival about six hours ? I 'm not denying you know all about him . What I 'm wondering is why you did n't tell all you knew . Of course , I understand they are your reasons , though , not mine . " " You 've said it . They 're my reasons . " " I ai n't saying they are not good reasons . Whyfor should a man round on his friend ? " The innuendo was plain , and Yeager put it into words . " I 'd be right proud to have him for a friend . But we all know what you mean , Brill . Go right ahead . Try and persuade the boys I 'm a rustler , too . They have n't known me on an average much over twenty years . But that does n't matter . They 're so durned teachable to-day maybe you can get them to swallow that with the rest . " With which parting shot he followed Phyllis out of the store . She turned on him at the top of the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that Phil was the rustler ? " " You mean did Keller tell me ? " he said , surprised . " Yes . ' Rastus was in the live oak and heard all you said . " " No . He did n't tell me that . We neither of us think it was Phil . It could n't be , for he was riding with you at the time . But he found your knife there by the dead cow . Now , how did it come there ? You let Phil have the knife . Had he lent his knife to some one ? " " I do n't know . " She went on , after a momentary hesitation : " Are you quite sure , Jim , that he really found the knife there ? " " He said so . I believe him . " She sighed softly , as if she would have liked to feel as sure . " The reason I spoke of it was that I accused him of trying to throw the blame on Phil , and he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Nothing to it . If you want my opinion , Keller is white clear enough . He would n't try a trick like that . " The girl 's face lit , and she held out an impulsive hand . " Anyhow , you 're a good friend , Jim . " " I 've been that ever since you was knee high to a duck , Phyl . " " Yes -- yes , you have . The best I 've got , next to Phil and Dad . " Her heart just now was very warm to him . " Do n't you reckon maybe a good friend might make a good -- something else . " She gasped . " Oh , Jim ! You do n't mean --  --  " " Yep . That 's what I do mean . Course I 'm not good enough . I know that . " " Good . You 're the best ever . It is n't that . Only I do n't like you that way . " " Maybe you might some day . " She shook her head slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never will . " " Is there -- someone else , Phyl ? " If it had been light enough he could have seen a wave of color sweep her face . " No . Of course there is n't . How could there be ? I 'm only a girl . " " It ai n't Brill then ? " " No . It's -- it is n't anybody . " She carried the war , womanlike , into his camp . " And I do n't believe you care for me -- that way . It 's just a fancy . " " One I 've had two years , little girl . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . I do like you , better than any one else . You know that , dear old Jim . " He smiled wistfully . " If you did n't like me so well I reckon I 'd have a better chance . Well , I must n't keep you here . Good night . " Her ringers were lost in his big fist . " Good night , Jim . " And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you be . It 's all right with me , Phyl . I just thought I 'd mention it . You never can tell , though I most knew how it would be . Buenos noches , nina . " He released her hand , and without once looking back strode to his horse , swung to the saddle , and rode into the night . She carried into the house with her a memory of his cheerful smile . It had been meant as a reassurance to her . It told her he would get over it , and she knew he would . For he was no puling schoolboy , but a man , game to the core . The face of another man rose before her , saturnine and engaging and debonair . With the picture came wave on wave of shame . He was a detected villain , and she had let him kiss her . But beneath the self-scorn was something new , something that stung her blood , that left her flushed and tingling with her first experience of sex relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chrysalis of childhood . But in the Southland flowers ripen fast . Adolescence steals hard upon the heels of infancy . Nature was pushing her relentlessly toward a womanhood for which her splendid vitality and unschooled impulses but scantily safeguarded her . The lank , shy innocence of the fawn still wrapped her , but in the heart of this frank daughter of the desert had been born a poignant shyness , a vague , delightful trembling that marked a change . A quality which had lain banked in her nature like a fire since childhood now threw forth its first flame of heat . At sunset she had been still treading the primrose path of youth ; at sunrise she had entered upon the world-old heritage of her sex . CHAPTER VII A SHOT FROM AMBUSH From the valley there drifted up a breeze-swept sound . The rider on the rock-rim trail above , shifting in his saddle to one of the easy , careless attitudes of the habitual horseman , recognized it as a rifle shot . Presently , from a hidden wash rose little balloon-like puffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if somebody had touched off a bunch of firecrackers . Men on horseback , dwarfed by distance to pygmy size , clambered to the bank -- now one and then another firing into the mesquite that ran like a broad tongue from the roll of hills into the valley . " Looks like something 's broke loose , " the young man drawled aloud . " The band 's sure playing a right lively tune this glad mo'ning . " Save for one or two farewell shots , the firing ceased . The riders had disappeared into the chaparral . The rider did not need to be told that this was a man hunt , destined perhaps to be one of a hundred unwritten desert tragedies . Some subtle instinct in him differentiated between these hurried shots and those born of the casual exuberance of the cow-puncher at play . He had a reason for taking an interest in it -- an interest that was more than casual . Skirting the rim of the saucer-shaped valley , he rode forward warily , came at length to a canon that ran like a sword cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail , its scarred slope . Through the defile ran a mountain stream , splashing over and round boulders in its swift fall . " I reckon we 'll slide down , Keno , and work out close to the fire zone , " the rider said to his horse , as they began to slither down the precipitous slope , starting rubble at every motion . Man and horse were both of the frontier , fit to the minute for any call that might be made on them . The broncho was a roan , with muscles of elastic leather , sure-footed as a mountain goat . Its master -- a slim , brown man , of medium height , well knit and muscular -- looked on the world , quietly and often humorously , with shrewd gray eyes . As he reached the bottom of the gulch , his glance fell upon another rider -- a woman . She crossed the stream hurriedly , her pony flinging water at every step , and cantered up toward him . Her glance was once and again over her shoulder , so that it was not until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the cottonwoods , and drew her pony to an instant halt . The rifle that had been lying across her saddle leaped halfway to her shoulder , covering him instantly . " Buenos dios , senorita . Are you going for to shoot my head off ? " he drawled . " The rustler ! " she cried . " The alleged rustler , Miss Sanderson , " he corrected gently . " Let me past , " she panted . He observed that her eyes mirrored terror of the scene she had just left . " It 's you that has got the drop on me , is n't it ? " he suggested . The rifle went back to the saddle . Instantly the girl was in motion again , flying up the canon past the white-stockinged roan , her pony 's hindquarters gathered to take the sheep trail like those of a wild cat . Keller gazed after her . As she disappeared , he took off his hat , bowed elaborately , and remarked to himself , in his low , soft drawl : " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , mebbe , when you ai n't in such a hurry . " But though he appeared to take the adventure whimsically his mind was busy with its meaning . She was in danger , and he must save her . So much he knew at least . He had scarcely turned the head of his horse toward the mouth of the canon when the pursuit drove headlong into sight . Galloping men pounded up the arroyo , and came to halt at his sharp summons . Already Keller and his horse were behind a huge boulder , over the top of which gleamed the short barrel of a wicked-looking gun . " Mornin ' , gentlemen . Lost something up this gulch , have you ? " he wanted to know amiably . The last rider , coming to a gingerly halt in order not to jar an arm bandaged roughly in a polka-dot bandanna , swore roundly . He was a large , heavy-set man , still on the sunny side of forty , imperious , a born leader , and , by the look of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our man , boys . We 'll take him alive if we can ; but , dead or alive , he 's ours . " He gave crisp orders . " Oh ! It 's me you 've lost ? Any reward ? " inquired the man behind the rock . For answer , a bullet flattened itself against the boulder . The wounded man had whipped up a rifle and fired . Keller called out a genial warning . " I would n't do that . There 's too many of you bunched close together , and this old gun spatters like hail . You see , it 's loaded with buckshot . " One of the cowboys laughed . He was rather a cool hand himself , but such audacity as this was new to him . " What 's ailing you , Pesky ? It do n't strike me as being so damned amusing , " growled his leader . " Different here , Buck . I was just grinning because he 's such a cheerful guy . Of course , I ai n't got one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wo n't be so gay about it when he 's down , with a couple of bullets through him , " predicted the other grimly . " But we 'll take his advice , just the same . You boys scatter . Cross the creek and sneak up along the other wall , Ned . Curly , you and Irwin climb up this side until you get him in sight . Pesky and I will stay here . " " Hold on a minute ! Let 's get at the rights of this . What 's all the row about ? " the cornered man wanted to know . " You know dashed well what it 's about , you blanked bushwhacker . But you did n't shoot straight enough , and you did n't fix it so you could make your getaway . I 'm going to hang you high as Haman . " " Thank you . But your intentions are n't directed to the right man . I 'm a stranger in this country . Whyfor should I want to shoot you ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Douglas . " " What doing here ? " " Homesteading . " " Name ? " " Keller . " " Killer , you mean , I reckon . You 're a hired assassin , brought in to shoot me . That 's what you are . " " No . " " Yes . The man we want came into this gulch , not three minutes ahead of us . If you 're not the man , where is he ? " " I have n't got him in my vest pocket . " " I reckon you 've got him right there in your coat and pants . " " I ai n't so dead sure , Buck , " spoke up Pesky . " We did n't see the man so as to know him . " " Riding a roan , was n't he ? " snapped the owner of the Twin Star outfit . " Looked that way , " admitted the cowpuncher . " Well , then ? " " Keller ! Why , that 's the name given by the rustler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curly spoke out . " No use jawing . I 'm going to hang his skin up to dry , " Weaver ground out between set teeth . " By his own way of it , he 's only one of them dashed nesters , " Irwin added . Keller was putting two and two together , in amazement . The would-be assassin had , during the past few minutes , been driven into this gulch , riding a roan horse . He could swear that only one person had come in before these pursuers -- and that one was a woman on a roan . Her frightened eyes , the fear that showed in every motion , her hurried flight , all contributed to the same inevitable conclusion . It was difficult to believe it , but impossible to deny . This wild , sylvan creature , with the shy , wonderful eyes , had lain in ambush to kill her father 's enemy , and was flying from the vengeance on her heels . His lips were sealed . Even if he were not under heavy obligations to her he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sylph than he could have testified against his own mother . " All right . If you feel lucky , come on . You 'll get me , of course , but it may prove right expensive , " he said quietly . " That 's all right . We 're footing our end of the bill , " Pesky retorted . By this time , he and Weaver had dismounted , and were sheltered behind rocks . Already bullets were beginning to spit back and forth , though the flankers had not yet got into action . " Durn his hide , I hate like sin to puncture it , " Pesky told his boss . " I tell you we 're making a mistake , Buck . This fellow 's a pure -- he ai n't any hired killer . You can tie to that . " " He 's the man that pumped a bullet into my arm from ambush . That 's enough for me , " the cattleman swore . " No use being revengeful , especially if it happens he ai n't the man . By his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loaded with buckshot , he claims . What hit you was a bullet from a Winchester , or some such gun . Mighty easy to prove whether he 's lying . " " We 'll be able to prove it afterward , all right . " " What 's the matter with proving it now ? I do n't stand for any murder business myself . I 'm going to find out what 's what . " The cow-puncher tied the red bandanna from his neck round the end of his revolver , and shoved it above the rock in front of him . " Flag of truce ! " he shouted . " All right . Come right along . Better leave your gun behind , " Keller called back . Pesky waddled forward -- a short , thick-set , bow-legged man in chaps , spurs , flannel shirt , and white sombrero . When he took off this last , as he did now , it revealed a head bald as a billiard ball . " How 're they coming ? " he inquired genially of the besieged man , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed to a hint of a friendly smile . He knew this type of man like a brother . " Fine and dandy here . Hope you 're well yourself , seh . " " Tol'able . Buck 's up on his ear , o ' course . Ca n't blame him , can you ? Most any man would , with that kind of a pill sent to his address so sudden by special delivery . Was n't that some inconsiderate of you , Mr. Keller ? " " I thought I explained it was another party did that . " Pesky rolled a cigarette and lit it . " Right sure of that , are you ? Would n't mind my taking a look at that gun of yours ? You see , if it happens to be what you said it was , that kinder lets you out . " Keller handed over the gun promptly . The cow-puncher broke it , extracted a shell , and with his knife picked out the wad . Into his palm rolled a dozen buckshot . " Good enough ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , I 'll go back and have a powwow with him . I reckon you 'll be willing to surrender on guarantee of a square deal ? " " Sure -- that 's all I ask . I never met your friend -- did n't know who he was from Adam . I ai n't got any option to shoot all the red-haided men I meet . No , sir ! You 've followed a cross trail . " " Looks like . Still , it 's blamed funny . " Pesky scratched his shining poll , and looked shrewdly at the other . " We certainly ran Mr. Bushwhacker into the canon . I 'd swear to that . We was right on his heels , though we could n't see him very well . But he either come in here or a hole in the ground swallowed him . " He waited tentatively for an answer , but none came other than the white-toothed smile that met him blandly . " I reckon you know more than you aim to tell , Mr. Keller , " continued Pesky . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you out of this thing , to whack up any information you 've got ? The kind of reptile that kills from ambush do n't deserve any consideration . " Half an hour ago , the other would have agreed with him . The man that shot his enemy from cover was a coyote -- nothing less . But about that brown slip of a creature , who had for three minutes crossed his orbit , he wanted to reserve judgment . " I expect I have n't got a thing to tell you that would help any , " he drawled , his eye full on that of the cowpuncher . Pesky threw away his cigarette . " All right . You 're the doctor . I 'll amble back , and report to the boss . " He did so , with the result that a truce was arranged . Keller gave up his post of vantage , and came forward to surrender . Weaver met him with a hard , wintry eye . " Understand , I do n't concede your innocence . You 're my prisoner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your guilt , you 've got to stand the gaff . " The other nodded quietly , meeting him eye to eye . Nor did his gaze fall , though the big cattleman was the most masterful man on the range . Keller was as easy and unperturbed as when he had been holding half a dozen irate men at bay . " No kick coming here . But , if it 's just the same to you , I 'll ask you to get the proof first and hang me afterward . " " If you 're homesteading , where 's your place ? " " Back in the hills , close to the headwaters of Salt Creek . " " Huh ! You 'll make that good before I get through with you . And I want to tell you this , too , Mr. Keller . It does n't make any hit with me that you 're one of those thieving nesters . Moreover , there 's another charge against you . In the Malpais country we hang rustlers . The boys claim to have you cinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Curly ? " Pesky called out . " By Moses , it 's a woman ! " " It is the Sanderson girl , " Weaver said in surprise . Keller swung round as if worked by a spring . The cow-puncher had told the truth . Curly 's companion was not only a woman , but the woman -- the same slim , tanned creature who had flashed past him on a wild race for safety , only a few minutes earlier . All eyes were focused upon her . Weaver waited for her to speak . Instead , Curly took up the word . He was smiling broadly , quite unaware of the mine he was firing . " I found this young lady up on the rock rim . Since we were rounding up , I thought I 'd bring her down . " " Good enough . Miss Sanderson , you 've been where you could see if anyone passed into the canon . How about it ? Anybody go up in last ten minutes ? " Phyllis moistened her dry lips and looked at the prisoner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Keller , his eyes hard as jade . " That ties the rope round your neck , my man . " " No , " Phyllis cried . " He did n't do it . " The cattleman 's stone wall eyes were on her now . " Did n't ? How do you know he did n't ? " " Because I -- I passed him here as I rode up a few minutes ago . " " So you rode up a few minutes ago . " Buck 's lids narrowed . " And he was here , was he ? Ever meet Mr. Keller before ? " " Yes . " " When ? Speak up . Mind , no lying . " This , struck the first spark of spirit from her . The deep eyes flashed . " I 'm not in the habit of lying , sir . " " Then answer my question . " " I 've met him at the office when he came for his mail . And the boys arrested him by mistake for a rustler . I saw him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know it was by mistake ? " " It was I accused him . But I did it because I was angry at him . " " You accused an innocent man of rustling because you were sore at him . You 're ce'tainly a pleasant young lady , Miss Sanderson . " Her look flashed defiance at him , but she said nothing . In her slim erectness was a touch of feminine ferocity that gave him another idea . " So you just rode into the canon , did you ? " " Yes . " " Meet up with anybody in the valley before you came in ? " " No . " His eyes were like steel drills . They never left her . " Quite sure ? " " Yes . " " What were you doing there ? " She had no answer ready . Her wild look went round in search of a friend in this circle of enemies . They found him in the man who was a prisoner . His steadfast eyes told her to have no fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver . " I was -- riding . " " Alone ? " The answer came so slowly that it was barely audible . " Yes . " " Riding in Antelope Valley ? " " Yes . " " Let me see that gun . " Weaver held out his hand for the rifle . Phyllis looked at him and tried to fight against his domination ; then slowly she handed him the rifle . He broke and examined it . From the chamber he extracted an empty shell . Grim as a hanging judge , his look chiselled into her . " I expect the lead that was in here is in my arm . Is n't that right ? " " I -- I do n't know . " " Who does , then ? Either you shot me or you know who did . " Her gaze evaded his , but was forced at last to the meeting . " I did it . " She was looking at him steadily now . Since the thing must be faced , she had braced herself to it . It was amazing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of iron saw it , and , seeing , admired hugely the gameness that dwelt in her slim body . But none of his admiration showed in the hard , weather-beaten face . " So they make bushwhackers out of even the girls among your rustling , sheep-herding outfit ! " he taunted . " My people are not rustlers . They have a right to be on earth , even if you do n't want them there . " " I 'll show them what rights they have got in this part of the country before I get through with them . But that ai n't the point now . What I want to know is how they came to send a girl to do their dirty killing for them . " " They did n't send me . I just saw you , and -- and shot on an impulse . Your men have clubbed and poisoned our sheep . They wounded one of our herders , and beat his brother when they caught him unarmed . They have done a hundred mean and brutal things . You are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you riding there , looking like the lord of all the earth , I just --  --  " " Well ? " " Could n't help -- what I did . " " You 're a nicely brought up young woman -- about as savage as the rest of your wolf breed , " jeered Weaver . Yet he exulted in her -- in the impulse of ferocity that had made her strike swiftly , regardless of risk to herself , at the man who had hounded and harried her kin to the feud that was now raging . Her shy , untamed beauty would not itself have attracted him ; but in combination with her fierce courage it made to him an appeal which he conceded grudgingly . " What in Heaven 's name brought you back after you had once got away ? " Weaver asked . The girl looked at Keller without answering . " I reckon I can tell you that , seh , " explained that young man . " She figured you would jump on me as the guilty party . It got on her conscience that she had left an innocent man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got to seeing a picture of you-all hanging me or shooting me up . So she came back to own up , if she saw you had caught me . " Weaver nodded . " That 's the way I figure it , too . Gamest thing I ever saw a woman do , " he said in an undertone to Keller , with whom he was now standing a little apart . The latter agreed . " Never saw the beat of it . She 's scared stiff , too . Makes it all the pluckier . What will you do with her ? " " Take her along with me back to the ranch . " " I would n't do that , " said the young man quickly . " Would n't you ? " Weaver 's hard gaze went over him haughtily . " When I want your advice , I 'll ask you for it , young man . You 're in luck to get off scot-free yourself . That ought to content you for one day . " " But what are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attacking you ? " " I 'll do as I dashed please , and do n't you forget it , Mr. Keller . Better mind your own business , if you 've got any . " With which Buck Weaver turned on his heel , and swung slowly to the saddle . His arm was paining him a great deal , but he gave no sign of it . He expected his men to game it out when they ran into bad luck , and he was stoic enough to set them an example without making any complaints . The little group of riders turned down the trail , passed through the gateway that led to the valley below , and wound down among the cow-backed hills toward the ranch roofs , which gleamed in the distance . They were the houses of the Twin Star outfit , the big concern owned by Buck Weaver , whose cattle fed literally upon a thousand hills . It suited Buck 's ironic humor to ride beside the girl who had just attempted his life . He bore her no resentment . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his life with as little remorse as he would a guttering candle . But her sex and her youth , and some quality of charm in her , had altered the equation . He meant to show her who was master , but he would choose a different method . What sport to tame the spirit of this wild desert beauty until she should come like one of her own sheep dogs at his beck and call ! He had never yet met the woman he could not dominate . This one , too , would know a good many new emotions before she rejoined her tribe in the hills . He swung from the saddle at the ranch plaza , and greeted her with a deep bow that mocked her . " Welcome , Miss Sanderson , to the best the Twin Star outfit has to offer . I hope you will enjoy your visit , which is going to be a long one . " To a Mexican woman , who had come out to the porch in answer to his call , he delivered the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman nodded her understanding , and led Phyllis inside . Weaver noticed with delight that his captive 's eye met his steadily , with the defiant fierceness of some hunted wild thing . Here was a woman worth taming , even though she was still a girl in years . His exultant eye , returning from the last glimpse of the lissom figure as it disappeared , met the gaze of Keller . That young man was watching him with an odd look of challenge on his usually impassive face . The cattleman felt the spur of a new antagonism stirring his blood . There was something almost like a sneer on his lips as he spoke : " Sorry to lose your company , Mr. Keller . But if you 're homesteading , of course , we 'll have to let you go back to the hills right away . Could n't think of keeping you from that spring plowing that 's waiting to be done . " " You 're putting up a different line of talk from what you did . How about that charge of rustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold me while you investigate it ? " " No , I reckon not . Your lady friend gives you a clean bill of health . She may or may not be lying . I 'm not so sure myself . But without her the case against you falls . " Keller knew himself dismissed cavalierly , and , much as he would have liked to stay , he could find no further excuse to urge . He could hardly invite himself to be either the guest or the prisoner of a man who did not want him . " Just as you say , " he nodded , and turned carelessly to his pony . Yet he was quite sure it would not be as Weaver said if he could help it . He meant to take a hand in the game , no matter what the other might decree . But for the present he acquiesced in the inevitable . Weaver was technically within his rights in holding her until he had communicated with the sheriff . A generous foe might not have stood out for his pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for the reputation of the girl , it was safe at the Twin Star ranch . Buck 's sister , a maiden lady of uncertain years , was on hand to play chaperone . Larrabie swung to the saddle . His horse 's hoofs were presently flinging dirt toward the Twin Star as he loped up to the hills . CHAPTER VIII MISS-GOING-ON-EIGHTEEN Time had been when the range was large enough for all , when every man 's cattle might graze at will from horizon to horizon . But with the push of settlement to the frontier had come a change . The feeding ground became overstocked . One outfit elbowed another , and lines began to be drawn between the runs of different owners . Water holes were seized and fenced , with or without due process of law . With the establishment of forest reserves a new policy dominated the government . Sanderson had been one of the first to avail himself of it by leasing the public demesne for his stock . Later , learning that the mountain parks were to be thrown open as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and driven them up , having first arranged terms with the forestry service . Buck Weaver , fighting the government reserve policy with all his might , resented fiercely the attitude of Sanderson . A sharp , bitter quarrel had resulted , and had left a smoldering bad feeling that flamed at times into open warfare . Upon the wholesome Malpais country had fallen the bitterness of a sheep and cattle feud . The riders of the Twin Star outfit had thrice raided the Sanderson flocks . Lambing sheep had been run cruelly . One herd had been clubbed over a precipice , another decimated with poison . In return , the herders shot and hamstrung Twin Star cows . A herder was held up and beaten by cowboys . Next week a vaquero galloped home to the Twin Star ranch with a bullet through his leg . This was the situation at the time when the owner of the big ranch brought Phyllis a prisoner to its hospitality . Nothing could have been more pat to his liking . He was , in large measure , the force behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had elected to office would be conveniently deaf to any illegality there might be in his holding the girl , would if necessary give him an order to hold her there until further notice . The attempt to assassinate him would serve as excuse enough for a proceeding even more highhanded than this . Her relatives could scarce appeal to the law , since the law would then step in and send her to the penitentiary . He could use her position as a hostage to force her stiff-necked father to come to terms . But it was characteristic of the man that his reason for keeping her was , after all , less the advantage he might gain by it than the pleasure he found in tormenting her and her family . To this instinct of the jungle beast was added the interest she had inspired in him . Untaught of life she was , no doubt , a child of the desert , in some ways primitive as Eve ; but he perceived in her the capacity for deep feeling , for passion , for that kind of fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Weaver took charge of the comfort of her guest . Her manner showed severe disapproval of this girl so lost to the feelings of her sex as to have attempted murder . That she was young and pretty made matters worse . Alice Weaver always had worshipped her brother , by the law of opposites perhaps . She was as drab and respectable as Boston . All her tastes ran to humdrum monotony . But turbulent , lawless Buck , the brother whom she had brought up after the death of their mother , held her heart in the hollow of his hard , careless hand . " Have you had everything you wish ? " she would ask Phyllis in a frigid voice . " I want to be taken home . " " You should have thought of that before you did the dreadful thing you did . " " You are holding me here a prisoner , then ? " " An involuntary guest , my brother puts it . Until the sheriff can make other arrangements . " " You have no right to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my brother . " " Mr. Weaver will do as he thinks best about that . " The spinster shut her lips tight and walked from the room . Supper was brought to Phyllis by the Mexican woman . In spite of her indignation she ate and slept well . Nor did her appetite appear impaired next morning , when she breakfasted in her bedroom . Noon found her promoted to the family dining room . Weaver carried his arm in a sling , but made no reference to the fact . He attempted conversation , but Phyllis withdrew into herself and had nothing more friendly than a plain " No " or " Yes " for him . His sister was presently called away to arrange some household difficulty . At once Phyllis attacked the big man lounging in his chair at his ease . " I want to go home . I 've got to be at the schoolhouse to-morrow morning , " she announced . " It wo n't hurt you any to miss a few days ' schooling , my dear . You 'll learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured her pleasantly . Buck was cracking two walnuts in the palm of his hand and let his lazy smile drift her way only casually . She stamped her foot . " I tell you I 'm the teacher . It is necessary I should be there . " " You a schoolmarm ! " he repeated , in surprise . " How old are you ? " Her dress was scarcely below her shoe tops . She still had the slimness of immature girlhood , the adorable shy daring of some uncaptured wood nymph . " Does that matter to you , sir ? " " How old ? " he reiterated . " Going-on-eighteen , " she answered -- not because she wanted to , but because somehow she must . There was something compelling about this man 's will . She would have resisted it had she not wanted to gain her point about going home . " So you teach the kids their A B C 's , do you ? And you just out of them yourself ! How many scholars have you ? " " Fourteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you take me for a scholar , Miss Going-On-Eighteen ? " " No ! " she flamed . " You 'd find me right teachable . And I would promise to love you , too . " Color came and went in her face beneath the brow . How dared he mock her so ! It humiliated and embarrassed and angered her . " Are you going to let me go back to my school ? " she demanded . " I reckon your school will have to get along without you for a few days . Your fourteen scholars will keep right on loving you , I expect . ' To memory dear , though far from eye . ' Or , if you like , I 'll send my boys up into the hills , and round up the whole fourteen here for you . Then school can keep right here in the house . How about that ? Ai n't that a good notion , Miss Going-On-Eighteen ? " She could stand his ironic mockery no longer . She faced him , fearless as a tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her heel , she passed swiftly into her little bedroom , and slammed the door . He heard the key turn in the lock . " She 's sure got some devil in her , " he laughed appreciatively , and he cracked another walnut . Already he had struck the steel of her quality . She would be his prisoner because she must , but the " no compromise " flag was nailed to her masthead . " I wonder why you are so fond of me ? " he mused aloud next day when he found her as unresponsive to his advances as a block of wood . He was lying in the sand at her feet , his splendid body relaxed full length at supple ease . Leaning on an elbow , he had been watching her for some time . Her gaze was on the distant line of hills ; on her face that far-away expression which told him that he was not on the map for her . Used as he was to impressing himself upon the imagination of women , this stung his vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flamed out at him . Now he lost his sardonic mockery in a flash of anger . " Do you hear me ? I asked you a question . " She brought her head round until her eyes rested upon him . " Will you ask it again , please ? I was n't listening . " " I want to know what makes you hate me so , " he demanded roughly . " Do I hate you ? " He laughed irritably . " What else do you call it ? You wo n't hardly eat at the same table with me . Last night you would n't come down to supper . Same way this morning . If I sit down near you , soon you find an excuse to leave . When I speak , you do n't answer . " " You are my jailer , not my friend . " " I might be both . " " No , thank you ! " She said it with such quick , instinctive certainty that he ground his teeth in resentment . He was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He began to covet this girl mightily , even while he told himself that he was a fool for his pains . What was she but an untaught , country schoolgirl ? It would be a strange irony of fate if Buck Weaver should fall in love with a sheepman 's daughter . " Many people would go far to get my friendship , " he told her . Quietly she looked at him . " The friends of my people are my friends . Their enemies are mine . " " Yet you said you did n't hate me . " " I thought I did , but I find I do n't . " " Not worth hating , I suppose ? " She neither corrected nor rejected his explanation . He touched his wounded arm as he went on : " If you do n't hate me , why this compliment to me ? I reckon good , genuine hate sent that bullet . " The girl colored , but after a moment 's hesitation answered : " Once I shot a coyote when I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not hate that coyote . " " Thank you , " he told her ironically . Her gaze went back to the mountains . She had always had a capacity for silence . But it was as extraordinary to her as to him how , in the past few days , she had sloughed the shy timidity of a mountain girl and found the enduring courage of womanhood . Her wits , too , had taken on the edge of maturity . He found that her tongue could strike swiftly and sharply . She was learning to defend herself in all the ways women have acquired by inheritance . Weaver 's jaw set like a vise . Getting to his feet , he looked down at her with the hard , relentless eyes that had made his name a terror . " Good enough , Miss Phyllis Sanderson . You 've chosen your way . I 'll choose mine . You 've got to learn that I 'm master here ; and , by God , I 'll teach it to you . Before I get through with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap my fingers . From to-day things will be different . You 'll eat your meals with us and not in your room . You 'll speak when you 're spoken to . Set yourself up against me , and I 'll bring you to your knees fast enough . There 's no law on the Twin Star Ranch but Buck Weaver 's will . " He strode away , almost herculean in figure , and every inch of him forceful . She had never seen such a man , one so virile and , at the same time , so wilful and so masterful . Before he was out of her sight , she got an instance of his recklessness . A Mexican vaquero was driving some horses into a corral . His master strode up to him , and dragged him from the saddle . " Did n't I tell you to take the colts down to the long pasture ? " " Si , senor , " answered the trembling native . Weaver 's great fist rose and fell once . The Mexican sank limply down . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strode to the house . As the owner of the Twin Star had said , so it was . Thereafter Phyllis sat at the table with him and his sister , while Josephine , the Mexican woman , waited upon them . The girl came and went at his bidding . But she held herself with such a quiet aloofness that his victory was a barren one . " Do you want to go home ? " he taunted her one morning , while at breakfast . " Is it likely I would want to stay here ? " she retorted . " Why not ? What have you to complain of ? Are n't you treated well ? " " Yes . " " What , then ? Are you afraid ? " " No ! " she answered , with a flash of her fine eyes . " That 's good , because you 've got to stay here -- or go to the pen . You may take your choice . " " You 're very generous . I suppose you do n't expect to keep me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm gets well . Since you wounded it you ought to nurse it . " " Which I am not doing , even while I am here . " " Anyhow it soothes the temper of the invalid to have you around . " He grinned satirically . " So I judge , from the effects . " " Meaning that I 'm always in a rage when I leave you ? " " I notice your men are marked up a good deal these days . " " I 'll tell them to thank you for it , " he flung back . Two days later , he scored on her hard for the first time . She came down to breakfast just as two of the Twin Star riders brought a boy into the hall . She flew instantly into his arms , thereby embarrassing him vastly . " Phil ! How did you come here ? " Her brother nodded toward Curly and Pesky . " They found me outside and got the drop on me . " " You were here looking for me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there . He do n't know . " " But -- what are they going to do with you ? " " What would you suggest , Miss Phyllis ? " a voice behind her gibed . The speaker was Weaver . He filled the doorway of the dining room triumphantly . She had had no fears for herself ; he would see if she had none for her brother . The boy whirled on the ranchman like a tiger whelp . " I do n't care what you do . Go ahead and do your worst . " Weaver looked him over negligently , much as he might watch a struggling calf . To him the boy was not an enemy -- merely a tool which he could use for his own ends . Phyllis , watching anxiously the hard , expressionless face , felt that it was cruel as fate . She knew that somehow she would be made to suffer through her love for her brother . " You dare n't touch him . He 's done nothing , " she cried . " He shot at one of my riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a peaceable man , me , " grinned Buck . " You did n't , Phil , " his sister reproached . " Sure I did . He tried to take my gun from me , " the boy explained hotly . " Take him out to the bunk house , boys . I 'll attend to him later , " nodded Buck , turning away indifferently . Stung to fury by the cavalier manner of his enemy , the boy leaped at him like a wild cat . Weaver whirled round again , caught him by the shoulder with his great hand , and shook him as if he had been a puppy . When he dropped him , he nodded again to his men , who dragged out the struggling boy . Phyllis stood straight as an arrow , but white to the lips . " What are you going to do to him ? " she asked . " How would a good chapping do , to start with ? That is always good for an unlicked cub . " " Do n't ! " she implored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for his good ? " Passion unleashed leaped from her . " You coward ! " He shrugged his shoulders . " I 'm right desolated to have your bad opinion . But you say it almost as if you did hate me . That 's a compliment , you know . You did n't hate the coyote , you mentioned . " Her eyes flamed . " Hate you ! If wishes could kill , you would be a thousand times dead ! " " You disappoint me , my dear . I expected more than wishes from you . There 's a loaded revolver in that table drawer . It 's yours , any time you want it , " he derided . " Do n't tempt me ! " she cried wildly . " If you lay a hand on Phil , I 'll use it -- I surely will . " His eyes shone with delight . " I wonder . By Jove , I 've a mind to flog the colt and see . I 'll do it . " The passion sank in her as suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know him -- or us . We are from the South . " " That settles it . I will , " he exulted . " You have called me a coward . Would a coward do this , and defy your whole crew to its revenge ? " " Would a brave man break the pride of a high-spirited boy for such a mean motive ? " she countered . " His pride will have to look out for itself . He took his chance of it when he tried to assault me . What he 'll get is only what 's coming to him . " " Please do n't ! I'll -- I 'll be different to you . Take it out on me , " she begged . He laughed harshly . " Do you suppose I 'm such a fool as not to know that the way to take it out on you is to take it out of him ? " She had come nearer , a step at a time . Now she threw her hand out in a gesture of abandon . " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful will come of it . " She broke down and struggled with her tears . He watched her for a moment without speaking . " Good enough . I 'll be generous and let you pay his debt for him , if you want to do it . " Her eyes were glad with the swift joy that leaped into them . " That is good of you ! And how shall I pay ? " she cried . " With a kiss . " She drew back as if he had struck her , all the sparkling eagerness driven from her face . " Oh ! " she moaned . " Just one kiss -- I do n't ask anything more . Give me that , and I 'll turn him loose . Honor bright . " He held her startled gaze as a snake holds that of a fascinated bird . " Choose , " he told her , in his masterful way . Her imagination conceived a vision of her young brother being tortured by this man . She had not the least doubt that he would do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what he deserved . " Take it , " she told him , and waited . Perhaps he might have spared her had it not been for the look of deep contempt that bit into his vanity . He kissed her full on the lips . Instantly she woke to life , struck him on the cheek with her little , brown fist , and , with a sob of woe , turned and ran from the room . Weaver cursed himself in a fury of anger . He felt himself to be a hound because of the thing he had done , and he hated the instinct in him that drove him to master her . He had insulted and trampled on her . Yet he knew in his heart that he would have killed another man for doing it . Illustration : SHE DREW BACK AS IF HE HAD STRUCK HER , ALL THE SPARKLING EAGERNESS DRIVEN FROM HER FACE . Page 116 CHAPTER IX PUNISHMENT The cattleman strode into the bunk house , where young Sanderson sat sulkily on a bed under the persuasion of Curly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought around , Curly . " " You 're the doctor , " answered the cowboy promptly , and forthwith vanished outdoors to obey instructions . Phil looked sullenly at his captor , and waited for him to begin . One of his hands was under the pillow of the cot upon which he sat . His fingers circled the butt of a revolver he had found there , where one of the riders had chanced to leave it that morning . " I 'm going to turn you loose to go home to the hills , " Weaver told him . " And my sister ? " " She stays here . " " Then so do I. " " That 's up to you . There 's no law against camping on the plains -- that is , out of range of the Twin Star . " " What are you going to do with her ? " the boy demanded ominously . " If you ask no questions , I 'll tell you no lies . " " You 'll let her go home with me -- that 's what you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got a license to feel lucky you 're going yourself . " " By God , I say you shall ! " The cattleman 's eyes took on their stony , snake-like look . His hand did not move by so much as an inch toward the scabbarded revolver at his side . " All right . Come a-shooting . I see you 've got a gun under that pillow . " The weapon leaped into sight . " You 're right I have ! I 'll drill you full of holes as soon as wink . " Weaver laughed contemptuously . " Begin pumping , son . " " I 'm going to take my sister home with me . You 'll give orders to your men to that effect . " " Guess again . " " I tell you I 'll shoot your hide full of holes if you do n't ! " cried the excited boy . " Oh , no , you wo n't . " Buck Weaver was flirting with death , and he knew it . The very breath of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for he was a man who revelled in his sensations . He laughed into the very muzzle of the six-shooter that covered him . " Quit your play acting , boy , " he jeered . " I give you one more chance before I blow out your brains . " The cattleman put his unwounded hand into his trousers pocket and lounged forward , thrusting his smiling face against the cold rim of the blue barrel . " I reckon you 'll scatter proper what few brains I 've got . " With a curse , the boy flung the weapon down on the bed . He could not possibly kill a man so willing as this . To draw guns with him , and chance the issue , would have suited young Sanderson exactly . But this way would be no less than murder . " You devil ! " he cried , with a boyish sob . Weaver picked up the revolver , and examined it . " Mighty careless of Ned to leave it lying around this way , " he commented absently , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell when a gun is going to get into the wrong hands . " " What are you letting me go for ? You 've got a reason . What is it ? " Phil demanded . Weaver looked at him through narrowed , daredevil eyes . " The ransom price has been paid , " he explained . " Paid ! Who paid it ? " " Miss Phyllis Sanderson . " " Phyllis ? " repeated the boy incredulously . " But she had no money . " " Did I say she paid it in money ? " " What do you mean ? " " She asked me to set you free . I named my price , and she agreed . " " What was your price ? " the boy asked hoarsely . " A kiss . " At that , Phil struck him full in the sardonic , mocking face . Blood crimsoned the lips that had been crushed against the strong , white teeth . " Again , " said Weaver . The brown fist went back and shot forward like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the cheek bone . " Much obliged . Once more . " The young man balanced himself carefully , and struck hard and true between the eyes . A third , a fourth , and a fifth time Phil lashed out at the disfigured , grinning face . " Let 's make it an even half dozen , " the cattleman suggested . But Phil had had enough of it . This was too much like butchery . His passion had spent itself . He struck , but with no force behind the blow . Weaver went to the washstand , dashed some water on his face , and pressed a towel against the raw wounds . He flung the red-soaked towel aside just as Curly cantered up on Sanderson 's horse . The cow-puncher stared at his boss in amazement , opened his lips to speak , and thought better of it . He looked at Phil , whose knuckles were badly barked and bleeding . Curly had seen his master marked up before , but on such occasions the other man was a sight for the gods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other was untouched . In view of Buck 's reputation as a rough-and-tumble fighter , this seemed no less than a miracle . Curly departed with the wonder unexplained , for Weaver dismissed him with a nod . " Like to see your sister before you go ? " the cattleman asked curtly of Phil , over his shoulder . " Yes . " Buck led the way across the plaza to the house , and clapped his hands in the hall . Josephine answered the summons . " Tell Miss Sanderson that her brother would like to see her . " The woman vanished up the stairway , and the two men waited in silence . Presently Phyllis stood in the door . Her eyes ignored Weaver , and were only for her brother . Her first glance told her that all was well so far as he was concerned , even though it also let her know that the boy was anxious . " Phil ! " she breathed . " So you bought my freedom for me , did you ? " the boy said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . " Yes . Did he tell you ? " " You ought n't to have done it . I 'll have no such bargains made . Understand that ! " cried her brother , emotion in his high tones . " I could n't help it , Phil . I did it for the best . You do n't know . " " I know that you 're to keep out of this . I 'll fight my own battles . In our family the girls do n't sell kisses . Remember that . " Phyl hung her head . She felt herself disgraced , but she knew that she would do it again in like circumstances . Weaver broke in roughly : " You young fool ! She 's worth a dozen of you , who have n't sense enough to sabe her kind . " The girl glanced at him involuntarily . At sight of his swollen and beaten face , she started . Her gaze clung to him , eyes wild and fluttering with apprehension . " I 've been taking a massage treatment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the ranchman . The thing was beyond comprehension . Ten minutes ago , this ferocious Hercules had left her , sound and unscratched . Now he returned with a face beaten and almost beyond recognition from bloodstains . " What -- what is it ? " The appeal was to her brother . " He let me beat him , " Phil explained . " Let you beat him ! Why ? " " I do n't know . " What the boy said was true , yet it was something less than the truth . He was dimly aware that this man knew himself to have violated the code , and that he had submitted to punishment because of the violation . " Tell me , " Phyllis commanded . Phil told her in three sentences . She looked at Weaver with eyes that saw him in a new light . He still sneered , but behind the mask she got for the first time a glimpse of another man . Only dimly she divined him ; but what she visioned was half devil and half hero , capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to leave you here in this house , " young Sanderson told her . " I 'll not go . If you stay , I stay . " She shook her head . " No , Phil -- you must go . I 'm all right here -- as safe as I would be at home . You know , he has a right to send me to prison if he wants to . I suppose he is holding me as a hostage against our friends in the hills . " The boy accepted her decree under protest . He did not know what else to do . Decision comes only with age , and he could hit on no policy that would answer . Reluctantly he gave way . " If you so much as touch her , you 'll die for it , " he gulped at Weaver , in a sudden boyish passion . " We 'll shoot you down like a dog . " " Or a coyote , " suggested Buck , with a swift glance at Phyllis . " It seems to be a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyl was in her brother 's arms , frankly in tears . It was all very well to tell him to go ; it was quite another thing to let him go without a good cry at losing him . " Just say the word , and I 'll see it out with you , sis , " he told her . " No , no ! I want you to go . I would n't have you stay . Tell the boys it 's all right , and do n't let them do anything rash . " Sanderson clenched his teeth , and looked at Weaver . " Oh , they 'll do nothing rash . Now they know you 're here , they wo n't do a thing but sit down and be happy , I expect . " The twins whispered together for a minute , then the boy kissed her , put her from him suddenly , and strode away . From the door he called back two words at the cattleman . " Do n't forget . " With that , he was gone . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse 's hoofs . " Why did you tell him ? " Phyllis asked . " It will only anger them . Now they will seek vengeance on you . " The man shrugged his shoulders . " Search me . Perhaps I wanted to prove to myself that a man may be a mean bully , and not all coyote . Perhaps I wanted to get under his hide . Who knows ? " She knew , in part . He had treated her abominably , and wanted blindly to pay for it in the first way that came to his mind . Half savage as he sometimes was , that way had been to stand up to personal punishment , to invite retaliation from his enemies . " You must have your face looked to . Shall I call Josephine ? " " No , " he answered harshly . " I think I will . We can help it , I 'm sure . " That " we " saved the day . He let her call the Mexican woman , and order warm water , towels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a fancy that there was healing in the cool , soft fingers which washed his face and adjusted the bandages . His eyes , usually so hard , held now the dumb hunger one sees in those of a faithful dog . They searched hers for something which he knew he would never find in them . CHAPTER X INTO THE ENEMY 'S COUNTRY A man lay on the top of Flat Rock , stretched at supple ease . By his side was a carbine ; in his hand a pair of field glasses . These last had been trained upon Twin Star Ranch for some time , but were now focused upon a pair of approaching riders . At the edge of the young willow grove the two dismounted and came forward leisurely . " Looks like the mountains are coming to Mahomet this trip , " the watcher told himself . One figure was that of a girl -- a brown , light-stepping nymph , upon whom the checkered sunlight filtered through the leaves . The other was a finely built man , strong as an ox , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of it in his step , in spite of his nearly twoscore years . He stopped at the foot of Flat Rock , and turned to his companion . " I 've been wondering why you went riding with me yesterday and again to-day , Miss Phyllis . I reckon I 've hit on the reason . " " I like to ride . " " Yes , but I expect you do n't like to ride with me so awful much . " " Yet you see I do , " answered the girl with her swift , shy smile . " And the reason is that you know I would be riding , anyway . You do n't want any of your people from the hills to use me as a mark . With you along , they could n't do it . " " My people do n't shoot from ambush , " she told him hotly . It was easy to send her gallant spirit out in quick defense of her kindred . He looked at his arm , still resting in a sling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impulse , " she told him . " And you 're guarding me from any more family impulses like it . " He grinned . " Not that it flatters me so much , either . I 've got a notion tucked in the back of my head that you 're watching me like a hen does her one chick , for their sake and not for mine . Right guess , I 'll bet a dollar . How about it , Miss Sanderson ? " " Yes , " she admitted . " At least , most for them . " " You 'd like to call the chase off for the sake of the hunters , and not for the sake of the coyote . " " I wish you would n't throw that word up to me . I ought n't to have said that . Please ! " " All right -- I wo n't . It is n't your saying it , but thinking it , that hurts . " " I do n't think it . " " You think I 'm entirely to blame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know you think I 'm a bully . " " I think you 're very arbitrary , " she replied , flushing . " Same thing , I reckon . Maybe I am . Did you ever hear my side of the story ? " " No . I 'll listen , if you will tell me . " Weaver shook his head . " No -- I guess that would n't be playing fair . You 're on the other side of the fence . That 's where you belong . Come to that , I 'm no white-winged angel , anyhow . All that 's said of me -- most of it , at least -- I sure enough deserve . " " I wonder , " she mused , smiling at him . Scarcely a week before , she had been so immature that even callow Tom Dixon had seemed experienced beside her . Now she was a young woman in bloom , instinctively sure of herself , even without experience to guide her . Though he had never said so , she knew quite well that this berserk of the plains had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untamed heart . She would have been less than human had it not pleased her , even though , at the same time , it terrified her . Buck swept his hand around the horizon . " Ask anybody . They 'll all give me the same certificate of character . And I reckon they ai n't so far out , either , " he added grimly . " Perhaps they are all right , and yet all wrong too . " He looked at her in surprise . " What do you mean ? " " Maybe they do n't see the other side of you " said Phyllis gently . " How do you know there 's another side ? " " I do n't know how , but I do . " " I reckon it must be a right puny one . " " It has a good deal to fight against , has n't it ? " " You 're right it has . There 's a devil in me that gets up on its hind legs and strangles what little good it finds . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on inside a sweep like me . " " You forget . I 'm not very good myself . You know my temper runs away with me , too . " " You blessed lamb ! " she heard him say under his breath ; and the way he said it made the exclamation half a groan . For her naive confession emphasized the gulf between them . Yet it pleased him mightily that she linked herself with him as a fellow wrongdoer . " I suppose you 've been wondering why your people have made no attempt to rescue you , " he said presently ; for he saw her eyes were turned toward the hills beyond which lay her home . " I 'm glad they have n't , because it must have made trouble ; but I am surprised , " she confessed . " They have tried it -- twice , " he told her . " First time was Saturday morning , just before daylight . We trapped them as they were coming through the Box Canon . I knew they would come down that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . " " And what happened ? " Her dilated eyes were like those of a stricken doe . " Nothing that time . I let them see I had them caught . They could n't go forward or back . They laid down their arms , and took the back trail . There was no other way to escape being massacred . " " And the second time ? " Buck hesitated . " There was shooting that time . It was last night . My riders outnumbered them and had cover . We drove them back . " " Anybody hurt ? " cried Phyllis . " One of them fell . But he got up and ran limping to his horse , I figured he was n't hurt badly . " " Was he -- could you tell --  " She leaned against the rock wall for support . " No -- I did n't know him . He was a young fellow . But you may be sure he was n't hit mortally . I know , because I shot him myself . " " You ! " She drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " he answered doggedly . " They were shooting at me -- aiming to kill , too . I shot low on purpose , when I might have killed him . " " Oh , I must go home -- I must go home ! " she moaned . " I 've got the sheriff 's orders to hold you pending an investigation . What harm does it do you to stay here a while ? " he asked doggedly . " Do n't you see ? When my father hears of it he will be furious . I made Phil promise not to tell him . But he 'll hear when he comes back . And then -- there will be trouble . He 'll drag me from you , or he 'll die trying . He 's that kind of man . " A pebble rolled down the face of the wall against which she leaned . Weaver looked up quickly -- to find himself covered by a carbine . " Hands up , seh ! No -- do n't reach for a gun . " " So it 's you , Mr. Keller ! Homesteading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of speaking . You remember I asked you a question . " " And I told you to go to Halifax . " " Well , I came back to answer the question myself . You 're going to turn the young lady loose . " " If you say so . " Weaver 's voice carried an inflection of sarcasm . " That 's what I say . Miss Sanderson , will you kindly unbuckle that belt and round up the weapons of war ? Good enough ! I 'll drift down that way now myself . " Keller lowered himself from Flat Rock , keeping his prisoner covered as carefully as he could the while . But , though Keller came down the steep bluff with infinite pains , the rough going offered a chance of escape to one so reckless as Weaver , of which he made not the least attempt to avail himself . Instead , he smiled cynically and waited with his hand in the air , as bidden . Keller , coming forward with both eyes on his prisoner , slipped on a loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , almost at the feet of the cattleman . He got up as swiftly as a cat . Weaver and his derisive grin were in exactly the same position . Keller lowered his carbine instantly . This plainly was no case for the coercion of arms . " We 'll cut out the gun play , " he said . " Better rest the hand that 's reaching for the sky . I expect hostilities are over . " " You certainly had me scared stiff , " Weaver mocked . From the first roll of the pebble that had announced the presence of a third party , Phyl had experienced surprise after surprise . She had expected to see one of the Seven Mile boys or her brother instead of Keller -- had looked with a quaking heart for the cattleman to fling back the swift challenge of a bullet . His tame surrender had amazed her , especially when Keller 's fall had given him a chance to seize the carbine . His drawling , sarcastic badinage pointed to the same conclusion . Evidently he had no desire to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fathom . " Elected yourself chaperon of the young lady , have you , Mr. Keller ? " Buck asked pleasantly . The young man smiled at the girl before he answered . " You 've been losing too much time on the job , Mr. Weaver . Subject to her approval , I got a notion I 'd take her back home . " " Best place for her , " assented Weaver promptly . " I 've been thinking for a day or two that she ought to get back to those school kids of hers . But I 'm going to take her there myself . " " Yourself ! " Phyllis spoke up in quick surprise . " Why not ? " The cattleman smiled . " Do you mean with your band of thugs ? " " No , ma'am . You and I will be enough . " The suggestion was of a piece with his usual audacity . The girl knew that he would be quite capable of riding with her into the hills , where he had a score of bitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion should come into his head , even in their stronghold . Within twenty-four hours he had shot one of them ; yet he would go among them with his jaunty , mocking smile and that hateful confidence of his . " You would not be safe . They might kill you . " " Would that gratify you ? " " Yes ! " she cried passionately . He bowed . " Anything to give pleasure to a lady . " " No -- you ca n't go ! I wo n't go with you . I would n't be responsible for what might happen . " " What might happen -- another family impulse ? " " You know as well as I do -- after what you 've done . And there 's bad blood between you already . Besides , you are so reckless , so intemperate in what you say and do . " " All right . If you wo n't go with me , I 'll go alone , " he said . She appealed to Keller to support her , but the latter shook his head . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he says he 's going , I reckon he 'll go . But whyfor should I be euchred out of my ride . Let me go along to keep the peace . " Her eyes thanked him . " If you are sure you can spare the time . " " Do n't incommode yourself , if you 're in a hurry . We wo n't miss you . " Weaver 's cold stare more than hinted that three would be a crowd . The younger man ignored him cheerfully . " Time to burn , Miss Sanderson . " " You do n't want to let that spring plowing suffer , " the cattleman suggested ironically . " That 's so . Glad you mentioned it . I 'll try to pick up some one to do it at the store , " returned the optimist . " Seems to me there are a pair of us , Mr. Keller , who may not be welcome at Seven Mile . Last time you were down there , were n't you the guest of some willing lads who were arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " reproached Phyllis , flushing . But the reference did not embarrass the nester in the least . He laughed hardily , meeting his rival eye to eye . " The boys did have notions , but I expect maybe they have got over them . " " Nothing like being hopeful . Now I 'd back my show against yours every day in the week . " The girl handed his revolver back to Weaver , after first asking a question of the homesteader with her eyes . " Oh , I get my hardware back , do I ? " Buck grinned . Keller brought his horse round from back of Flat Rock , where it had been picketed . They started at once , cutting across the plain to a flat butte , which thrust itself out from the hills into the valley . Two hours of steady travel brought them to the butte , behind which lay Seven Mile ranch . At the first glimpse of the roofs shining in the golden sunlight Phyllis gave a cry of delight . " Home again . I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " echoed Weaver grimly . " That little fellow riding into the corral is one of my scholars , " she told them . " One of the fourteen that loves you , Miss Going-On-Eighteen . My , there 'll be joy in Israel over the lost that is found . I reckon by to-morrow you 'll be teaching the young idea how to shoot . " He glanced down at his bandaged arm with a malicious grin . Phyllis looked at him without speaking . It was Keller who made application of the remark . " There are others here beside her pupils . Some of them are right quick and straight on the shoot , Mr. Weaver . Now you 've seen Miss Sanderson home , there 's still time to make your getaway without trouble . How about hitting the trail while travelling is good , seh ? " " What 's the matter with you taking your own advice , Keller ? " " I do n't figure the need is pressing in my case . Different with you . " " I told you I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing pat on that . " " The road will be open to me to-morrow . I wonder will it be open to you then . " " My friend , who elected you guardeen to Buck Weaver ? " drawled the big man carelessly . " I wish you would go , " Phyllis pleaded , plainly troubled over his obstinacy . " Me , I always hated to disoblige a lady , " Buck admitted . " Then go , " she cried eagerly . " But I hate still more to go back on my word . So I 'll stay . " There was nothing more to be said . They rode forward to the ranch . ' Rastus , at the stables , raised a shout and broke for the store on the run . " Hyer 's Miss Phyl done come home . " At his call light-stepping dusty men poured from the building like seeds from a squeezed orange . There was a rush for the girl . She was lifted from her saddle and carried in triumph to the porch . Jim Sanderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his arms . She broke down and began to cry a little . " Oh , Dad -- Dad , I 'm so glad to be home . " The old Confederate veteran was close to tears himself . " Honey , I jes ' got back from town . Phil , he done wrong not letting me know . I come pretty nigh giving that boy the bud . Wait till I meet up with Buck Weaver . It 's him or me for suah this time . " " No , Dad , no ! You must let me explain . I 've been quite safe , and it 's all over now . Everything is all right . " " Is it ? " Sanderson laughed harshly . " The sheriff telephoned him to keep me , but you see he brought me home . " " Brought you home ? " The sheepman 's black eyes lifted quickly and met those of his enemy . " So you 're there , Buck Weaver . I reckon you and I will settle accounts . " Phil and Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver 's retreat in case he attempted one . " He 's got the rustler with him , " Tom Dixon cried quickly . " Goddlemighty , so he has . We 'll make a clean sweep , " the Southerner cried , his eyes blazing . " Then you 'll destroy the man who was ready to give his life for mine , " his daughter said quietly . " What 's that ? How 's that , Phyllie ? " " It 's a long story . I want you to hear it all . But not here . " Her voice fell . A sudden memory had come to her of one thing at least that she could not tell even to him -- the story of that moment when she had lain in the arms of the nester with his heart beating against her breast . The old man caught her by the shoulder , holding her at arm 's length , while the deep eyes under his shaggy , grizzled brows pierced her . " What have you got to tell me , gyurl ? Out with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came reassurance . A tide of color poured into her face , but her eyes met his quietly . They let him understand , more certainly than words , that all was well with his ewe lamb . Putting her gently to one side , he strode toward his enemy . " What are you doing here , Buck Weaver ? " The cattleman swept the circle of lowering faces , and laughed contemptuously . " A man might think I was n't welcome if he did n't know better . " " Oh , you 're welcome -- I reckon nobody on earth is more welcome right now , " retorted Sanderson grimly . " We were starting right out after you , seh . But seeing you 're here it saves trouble . Better ' light , you and your friend , both . " The declining sun flashed on three weapons that already covered the cattleman . He looked easily from one to another , without the least concern , and swung lightly from his horse . " Much obliged . Glad to accept your hospitality . But about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere pick-up acquaintance , in fact . You must n't accept him on my say-so . Of course , you know I 'm all right , but I ca n't guarantee him , " Buck drawled , with magnificent effrontery . Phyllis spoke up unexpectedly . " I can . " Keller looked at her gratefully . It was not that he cared so much for the certificate of character as for the friendly spirit that prompted it . " That 's right kind of you , " he nodded . " We have n't heard yet what you are doing here , Buck Weaver , " old Jim Sanderson said , holding the cattleman with a hard and hostile eye . " And after you 've explained that , there are a few other things to make clear . " " Such as --  --  " suggested the plainsman . " Such as keeping my daughter a captive and insulting her while she was in your house , " the father retorted promptly . " I held her captive because it was my right . She admitted shooting me . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right politely for it ? I want to tell you that some folks would be right grateful because I did n't send her to the penitentiary . " " You could n't send her there . No jury in Arizona would convict -- even if she were guilty , " Tom Dixon broke out . " That 's a frozen fact about the Arizona jury , " the cattleman agreed , with a swift , careless look at the boy . " Just the same , I had a license to hold her . About the insult -- well , I 've got nothing to say . Nothing except this , that I would n't be wearing these decorations "  - -  he touched the scars on his face --  " if I did n't agree with you that nobody but a sweep would have done it . " " Everybody unanimous on that point , I reckon , " said Jim Yeager promptly . Phyllis had been speaking to her father in a low voice . The old man listened with no great patience , but finally nodded a concession to her importunity . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that boy you shot up ? Looks like you 're a fool to come drilling in here , with him still lying there on his bed . " " He took his fighting chance . You ai n't kicking because I played out the game the way you-all started to play it ? If you are , I 'll have to say I might have expected a sheep herder to look at it that way , " Weaver retorted insolently . The old man took a grip on his rising wrath . " No -- we 're not kicking , any more than you 've got a right to kick when we settle accounts with you . " " As we 're liable to do right shortly , now we 've got you , " said Dixon , vindictively . " All right -- go ahead with the indictment , " Weaver acquiesced quietly , ignoring the boy . " Keep still , Tom , " Sanderson ordered , and went on with his grievance . " You try to run this valley as if you were God Almighty . By your way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to ask you if he may take up land here . The United States says we may homestead , but Buck Weaver says we sha n't . Uncle Sam says we may lease land to run sheep . Buck Weaver has another notion of it . We 're to take orders from him . If we do n't he clubs our sheep and drives off our cattle . " " Cattle were here first , " retorted Weaver . " The range is overstocked , and they 've got a prior right . Nesters in the hills here are making money by rustling Twin Star calves . That 's another thing . " " Some of them . You 'll not find any rustled calves with the Seven Mile brand on them . And we do n't recognize any prior right . We came here legally . We intend to stay . Every time your riders club a bunch of our sheep , we 'll even up on Twin Star cattle . You take my daughter captive ; I hold you prisoner . " " You 'll be in luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " broke out Phil . " You came here to please yourself , but you 'll stay to please us . " " So ? " Buck smiled urbanely . He was staying because he wanted to , though they never guessed it . " Unbuckle his gun belt , Tom , " ordered the old man . " Save you the trouble . " Weaver unbuckled the belt and tossed it , revolver and all , to Yeager . " Now , Mr. Weaver , we 'll adjourn to the house . " " Anything to oblige . " " What about Mr. Keller ? " Phyllis asked , in a low voice , of her father . The old man 's keen , hard eyes surveyed the stranger . " Who is he ? What do you know about him ? " As shortly as she could , she told what she knew of Keller , and how he had rescued her from captivity . Her father strode forward and shook hands with the young man . " Make yourself at home , seh . We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . What you have done for my daughter puts us everlastingly in your debt . " " Not worth mentioning . And , to be fair , I think Weaver was going to bring her home , anyhow . " " The way the story reached me , he did n't mention it until you had the drop on him , " answered Sanderson dryly . " That 's right , " nodded the cattleman ironically , from the porch . " You 're the curly-haired hero , Keller , and I 'm the red-headed villain of this play . You want to beware of the miscreant , Miss Sanderson , or he 'll sure do you a meanness . " Tom Dixon eyed him frostily . " I expect you 'll not do her any meanness , Buck Weaver . From now on , you 'll go one way and she 'll go another . You 'll be strangers . " " You do n't say ! " Buck answered , looking him over derisively , as he passed into the house . " You 're crowing loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that proposition , my friend . " CHAPTER XI TOM DIXON With whoops and a waving of caps boys burst out of one door , while girls came out of the opposite one more demurely , but with the piping of gay soprano voices . For school was out , and young America free of restraint for eighteen hours at least . Resilient youth , like a coiled spring that has been loosed , was off with a bound . Horses were saddled or put to harness . The teacher came to the door , hand in hand with six-year-olds , who clung to her with fond good-bys before they climbed into the waiting buggies . The last straggler disappeared behind the dip in the road . The girl teacher turned from waving her fare-wells -- to meet the eyes of a young man fastened upon her . Light-blue eyes they were , set in a good-looking , boyish face , that had somehow an effect of petulancy . It was not a strong face , yet it was no weaker than nine out of ten that one meets daily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man asked , with an air of cheerful confidence that seemed to be assumed to cover a doubt . Her eyes narrowed slightly . " They have just gone -- all but little Jimmie Tryon . He rides home with me . " " Hang it ! We never seem to be alone any more since you came back , " complained the man . " Why should we ? " asked the young woman , her gaze apparently as frank and direct as that of a boy . But he understood it for a challenge . " You did n't use to talk that way . You used to be glad enough to see me alone , " he flung out . " Did I ? One outgrows childish follies , I suppose , " she answered quietly . " What 's the matter with you ? " he cried angrily . " It 's been this way ever since --  --  " He broke off . A faint , scornful smile touched her lips . " Ever since when , Tom ? " " You know when well enough . Ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay forfeit , " she suggested quickly , and as quickly broke off . " Had n't we better talk of something else ? I 've tried to avoid this . Must we thrash it out ? " " You ca n't throw me over like that , after what 's been between us . I reckon you pretend to have forgotten that I used to keep company with you . " A flush of annoyance glowed through the tan of her cheeks , but her eyes refused to yield to his . " Nonsense ! Do n't talk foolishness , Tom . We were just children . " " Do you mean that everything 's all off between us ? " " We made a mistake . Let us be good friends and forget it , Tom , " she pleaded . " What 's the use of talking that way , Phyl ? " He swung from the saddle , and came toward her eagerly . " I love you -- always have since I was knee-high to a grasshopper . We 're going to be married one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back . " No -- we 're not . I know now that you 're not the right man for me , and I 'm not the right girl for you . " " I 'm the best judge of that , " he retorted . She shook her head with certainty . It seemed a lifetime since this boy had kissed her at the dance and she had run , tingling , from his embrace . She felt now old enough in experience to be his mother . " No , Tom -- let us both forget it . Go back to your other girls , and let me be just a friend . " " I have n't any other girls , " he answered sullenly . " And I wo n't be put off like that . You 've got to tell me what has come between us . I 've got a right to know , and I 'm going to know . " " Yes , you have a right -- but do n't press it . Just let it go at this : I did n't know my own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something about the shooting of Buck Weaver , " he growled uneasily . She was silent . " Well ? " he demanded . " Out with it ! " " I could n't marry a man I do n't respect from the bottom of my heart , " she told him gently . " That 's a dig at me , I reckon . Why do n't you respect me ? Is it because I shot Weaver ? " " You shot him from ambush . " " I did n't ! " he protested angrily . " You know that ai n't so , Phyl . I saw him riding down there , as big as coffee , and I let him have it . I was n't lying in wait for him at all . It just came over me all of a heap to shoot , and I shot before --  --  " " I understand that . But you should n't have shot without giving warning , even if it was right to shoot at all -- which , of course , it was n't . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow for making a mistake ? " " It is n't a question of forgiveness , Tom . Somehow it goes deeper than that . I ca n't tell you just what I mean . " " Have n't I told you I 'm sorry ? " he demanded , with boyish impatience . " Being sorry is n't enough . If you ca n't see it then I ca n't explain . " " You 're sore at me because I left you , " he muttered , and for very shame his eyes could not meet hers . " No -- I 'm not sore at you , as you call it . I have n't the least resentment . But there 's no use in trying to hide the truth . Since you ask for it , you shall have it . I do n't want to be unkind , but I could n't possibly marry you after that . " The young man looked sulkily across the valley , his lips trembling with vexation and the shame of knowing that this girl had been a witness of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her to bear the brunt of what he had done . " You told me to go , and now you blame me for doing what you said , " he complained bitterly . She realized the weakness of his defense -- that he had saved himself at the expense of the girl he claimed to love , simply because she had offered herself as a sacrifice in his place . She thought of another man , who , at the risk of his life , had held back the half dozen pursuers just to give a better chance to a girl he had not known a week . She thought of the cattleman who had ridden gayly into this valley of enemies , because he loved her , and was willing to face any punishment for the wrong he had done her . Her brother , too , pointed the same moral . He had defied the enemy , though he had been in his power . Not one of them would have done what Tom Dixon , in his panic terror , had allowed himself to do . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clings to self-respect rather than to life . This youth had met the acid test , and had failed in the assay . She had no anger toward him -- only a kindly pity , and a touch of contempt which she could not help . " No -- I do n't blame you , Tom , " she told him , very kindly . " But I ca n't marry you . I could n't if you explained till Christmas . That is final . Now let us be friends . " She held out her hand . He looked at it through the tears of mortification that were in his eyes , dashed it aside with an oath , swung to the saddle , and galloped down the road . Phyllis gave a wistful sigh . Tears filmed her eyes . He was her first lover , had given her apples and candy hearts when he was in the third grade and she learning her A , B , C. So she felt a heartache to see him go like this . Their friendship was shattered , too . Nor had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save as a form , after the wrench he had given it . Yet she knew him well enough now to be sure that it was his vanity and self-esteem that were hurt , and not his love . He would soon find consolation among the other ranch girls , upon whom he had been used to lavish his attentions at intervals when she was not handy to receive them . " Was Tom Dixon mean to you , teacher ? " Little five-year-old Jimmie Tryon was standing before her , feet apart , fists knotted , and brow furrowed . She swooped upon her champion and snatched him up for a kiss . " Nobody has been mean to teacher , Jimmie , you dear little kiddikins , " she cried . " It 's all right , honey . Tom thinks it is n't , but before long he 'll know it is . " " Who 'll tell him ? " Jimmie wanted to know anxiously . " Some nice girl , little curiosity box . I do n't know who yet , but it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laughed . She harnessed the horse and hitched it to the trap in which Jimmie and she came to school . But before she had gathered up the reins to start , another young man strolled upon the scene . This one was walking and carried a rifle . At sight of him a glow began to burn through her dark cheeks . They had not been alone together before since that moment when the stress of their emotion had swept them to a meeting of warm lips and warm bodies that had startled her by the electric pulsing of her blood . Her eyes could not hold to his . Shame dragged the lashes down . With him it was not shame . The male in him rode triumphant because he had moved a girl to the deeps of her nature . But something in him , some saving sense of embarrassment , of reverence for the purity and innocence he sensed in her , made him shrink from pressing the victory . His mind cast about for a commonplace with which to meet her . He held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who says I ca n't shoot ? " he wanted to know boisterously . " Where did you buy them ? " she scoffed , faintly trying for sauciness . " That 's a fine reward for honest virtue , after I tramped five miles to get them for your supper , " protested Keller . She recovered her composure quickly , as women will . " If they are for my supper , we 'll have to ask him to ride home with us -- wo n't we , Jimmie ? It would never do to have them reach the ranch too late , " she said , making room for Keller in the seat beside her . It was after she had driven several hundred yards that he said , with a smile : " I met a young man on horseback as I was coming up . He went by me like a streak of light . Looked like he found this a right mournful world . You had ought to scatter sunshine and not gloom , Miss Phyllis . " " Am I scattering gloom ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But looks like you have been . " She flicked a fly from the flank of her horse before she answered : " Some people are so noticing . " " It was hanging right heavy on him . Had the look of a man who had lost his last friend , " the young man observed meditatively . " Dear me ! How pathetic ! " " Yes -- he sure looked like he 'd rejoice to plug another cattleman . I ' most arranged to send for Buck Weaver again , " said Keller calmly . Phyllis turned on him eyes brilliant with amazement . " What 's that you say ? " " I said he looked some like he 'd admire to go gunning again . " " Yes , but you said too --  --  " " Sho ! I 've been using my eyes and ears . I never did find that story of yours easy to swallow . When I discovered from your brother that you was riding with Tom Dixon the day Buck was shot , and when I found out from ' Rastus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I surely smelt a mouse . Come to mill the thing out , I knew you led Buck 's boys off on a blind trail , while the real coyote hunted cover . " " He is n't a coyote , " she objected . Larrabie thought of the youth with a faint smile of scorn . He knew how to respect an out-and-out villain ; but there was no bottom to a man who would shoot from cover without warning , and then leave a girl to bear the blame of his wrongdoing . " No -- I reckon coyote is too big a name for him , " he admitted . " Buck Weaver ruined his father and drove him from his homestead . It was natural he should feel a grudge . " " That 's all right , too . We 're talking about the way he settled it . How come you to let him do it ? " " I was riding about twenty yards behind him . Suddenly I saw his gun go up , and stopped . I thought it might be an antelope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me he had shot Weaver . The poor boy was crazy with fear , now that he had done it . I took his gun and made him hide in the big rocks , while I cut across toward the canon . The men saw me , and gave chase . " " They fired at you . Thank God , none of them hit you , " said Keller , with emphasis . Her swift gaze appreciated the deep feeling that welled from him . " Of course they did not know I was a woman . All they could see was that somebody was riding through the chaparral . " " Jimmie , what do you think of a girl game enough to take so big a chance to save a friend ? Deserves a Carnegie medal , do n't you reckon ? " Keller put the question to the third passenger , using him humorously as a vent to his feelings . Phyllis did not look at him , nor he at her . " And what do you think of a man game enough to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a friend ? " the girl asked of little Jimmie , as lightly as she could . " Was n't she ? Well , if my friends will save my life every time I need them to , like this enemy did , I 'll be satisfied with them a-plenty . " " He stood by her , too , " she answered , trying to keep the matter impersonal . " Perhaps he wanted to make her his friend , " Larrabie suggested . " There is no perhaps about his success , " she said quietly , her gaze just beyond the ears of her horse . The young man dared now to look at her -- a child of the sun despite her duskiness . Eagerly he awaited the deep , lustrous eyes that would presently sweep round upon him , big and dark and sparkling . When she turned her head , they were full of that new womanly dignity that yet did not obscure the shy innocence . " Look ! " Jimmie Tryon pointed suddenly to the figure of a man disappearing from the road into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's odd . I reckon you 'd better wait here , and let me investigate a few , " suggested Keller . " Be careful , " she said anxiously . " It 's all right . Do n't worry , " the young man assured her . He got down from the trap and dived into the underbrush , rifle in hand . The two in the buggy waited a long time . No sound came to them from the cactus-covered waste to indicate what was happening . When Phyllis ' watch told her that he had been gone ten minutes , a cheerful hail came from the road in front . " All right . Come on . " But it was far from all right . Keller had with him an old Mexican herder , called Manuel Quito -- a man in the employ of her father . A bandanna was tied round his shoulder , and it was soaked with bloodstains . He told his story with many shrugs and much excited gesticulation . He and Jesus Menendez had been herding on Lone Pine when riders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheep . He and Menendez had elected to fight , and Jesus had been shot down ; he himself had barely escaped with his life -- and that not without a wound . The cow-punchers had followed him , and continued to fire at him , but he had succeeded in escaping . Yes -- he felt sure that Menendez was dead . Even if he had not been dead at first , they would have killed him . Keller consulted Miss Sanderson silently . He knew that she was thinking the thought that was in his own mind . It would never do to let this story reach her father and her brother , while Buck Weaver was still in their power . Inflamed as they already were against him , they would surely do in hot blood that which they would repent later . Somehow , Keller and she must hold back the news until they could contrive a way to free the cattleman . " Best leave Manuel at the Tryon place till morning . They will look out for him as well as you can . That will give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But what about poor Jesus , lying out there alone ? " " We 'll get Bob Tryon to drive out . But you need n't worry about Jesus . If they found him still living , the Twin Star boys will attend to him just as kindly as we could . Cowboys have tender hearts , even though they go off at half cock . " They did as Keller had suggested , and left the old Mexican under the care of Mrs. Tryon , having pledged the family to a reluctant silence until morning . Manuel 's wound was not a bad one , and there seemed to be no reason why he should not do well . It was difficult to decide upon a plan for the release of Weaver . He was confined in an old log cabin and watched continually by some one of the riders ; but a tentative plan was accepted , subject to revision if a better chance of escape should occur . The success of this depended upon the possibility of Keller drawing off the guard by a diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outlook was not roseate , but nothing better occurred to them . One thing was sure -- if Buck Weaver was not out of the hands of his enemies before the news of this last outrage of his cowboys reached them , his chance of life was not worth even an odds-on bet . For the hot blood of the South raced through the veins of the sheepmen . They would strike first and think about it afterward . And without doubt that first swift blow would be a deadly one . CHAPTER XII THE ESCAPE For the sixth time since the three-quarters , Phyllis looked at her watch by the light of a full moon , which shone through the window of her bedroom . The hands indicated five minutes to one . In her stocking feet she stole out of the room , downstairs , and along the porch to the heavy shadows cast by the cucumber vines that screened one end of it . Here she waited , heart in mouth and pulse beating like a trip hammer . Presently came the mournful hoot of an owl from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , melodious voice flung back the signal . Again the minutes drummed eternally in silence . But when at last this was shattered , it was with a crash to wake the dead . The girl marvelled that one man could fire so rapidly , and so often . The night seemed to crackle with rifle and revolver shots . To judge from the sound , there might be a company engaged . The expected happened . The door of the cabin , in which lay the prisoner and Tom Dixon , was flung open . A dark form filled the doorway , and the moonlight gleamed on the shining barrel of a rifle . For an instant Tom stood so , trying to locate the source of the firing . He disappeared into the cabin , then reappeared . The door was closed and locked . Taking what cover he could find , Tom slipped over the fence , and into the mesquite on the other side of the road . Phyllis darted forward like a flame . Her trembling fingers fitted a key to the lock of the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it behind her . " Where are you ? " her young voice breathed . " Over here by the fireplace . What is it all about , Miss Sanderson ? " She groped her way to him . " Never mind now . We 've got to hurry . Are you tied ? " " Yes -- hands and feet . " A beam of light through the window showed the flash of a knife . With a few hacks of the blade , she had freed him . He was about to rise when the door opened and a head was thrust in . " What 's the row , Tom ? " Weaver growled an answer . " He is n't here . Pulled out when the firing began . I wish you 'd tell me what it is all about . " But the head was already withdrawn , and its owner scudding toward the fray . Phyllis rose from the foot of the cot , where she had crouched . " Come ! " she told the cattleman imperiously , and led the way from the cabin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely reached these when another half-clad figure emerged from the house , rifle in hand , and plunged across the road into the cacti . He , too , headed for the scene of the now intermittent shooting . " Now ! " cried Phyllis , and gave her hand to the man huddled beside her . She led him into the dark house , up the stairs , and into her room . He would have prolonged the sweet intimacy of that minute had it been in his power ; but , once inside the chamber , she withdrew her fingers . " Stay here till I come back , " she ordered . " I must show myself , so as not to arouse suspicion . " " But tell me -- what does it mean ? " demanded Buck . " It means we 're trying to save your life . Whatever happens , do n't leave this room or let yourself be seen at the window . If you do , we 're lost . " With that she was gone , flying down the stairs to show herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard the returning warriors as they reached the door of the log cabin . They had thrashed through the live-oak grove and found nothing , and were now hurrying back to the prison house , full of suspicions . " He 's gone ! " she heard Phil cry from within . Came then the sound of excited voices , and presently the shaft of light from a kerosene lamp . Feet trampled in the cabin . Phyllis heard the cot being kicked over . This moment she chose for her entrance . " What in the world is the matter ? " she asked innocently , from the doorway . " He 's got away -- we 've been tricked ! " Tom told her furiously . " But -- how ? " " Never mind , Phyl . Go back to your room . There may be trouble yet . By God , there will be if we find him , or his friends ! " her father swore . Another figure blocked the doorway . This time it was Keller , hatless and coatless , as if he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired blandly the inevitable : " What 's the trouble ? " " Nothing -- except that we are a bunch of first-class locoed fools , " snapped Tom . " We 've lost our prisoner -- that 's what 's the matter . " Larrabie came in and looked inquiringly from one to another . " I thought you kept him guarded . " " We did , but they drew Tom off on a false trail , " explained Phil . " I notice they worked the rest of us , too , " retorted his father tartly . " I heard the shooting , " Keller said innocently . His eyes drifted to a meeting with those of Phyllis . His telegraphed a question , and hers answered that the prisoner was safe so far . " A dead man could have heard it , " suggested Phil , not without sarcasm . " Sounded like a battle -- and when we got there not a soul could be found . Beats me how they got away so slick . " Annoyance , disappointment , disgust were in the air . Keller remained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , as she had been told to do . She found Weaver sitting by the window looking out . He turned his head quickly when she entered . " Now , if you 'll kindly tell me what 's doing , I 'll not die of curiosity , " he began . " It 's all your wicked men , " she told him bluntly . " They have killed one of our herders and wounded another . Mr. Keller and I met the wounded man as he was coming back to the ranch . We stopped him and took him to a neighbor 's . If they had known , my people would have revenged themselves on you . They are hot-blooded men , quick to strike . I was afraid -- we were both afraid of what they would do . So we planned your escape . Mr. Keller slipped into the chaparral , and feigned an attack upon the ranch , to draw the boys off . I had got the other key to the cabin from the nail above father 's bed . When Tom left , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what am I to do here ? " " They will scour the valley and watch the pass . If we had let you go , the chances are they would have caught you again . " " And if they had caught me , you think they would have killed me ? " " Does n't the Bible say that he who takes the sword shall perish by the sword ? Are you a god , that you should kill when you please and expect to escape the law that has been written ? " " You say I deserve death , yet you save my life . " " I do n't want blood on the hands of my people . " " Personally , then , I do n't count in the matter , " said Weaver , with his old sneer . She had saved him , but her anger was hot against the slayers of poor Jesus Menendez . " Why should you count ? I am no judge of how great a punishment you deserve ; but my father and my brother shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carry the curse of Cain on them . " " But Cain killed a brother , " he jeered . " I am not a brother , but a wolfish Amalekite . Come -- the harvest is ripe . Send me forth to the reapers . " He arose as if to go ; but she was at the door before him , arms extended to block the way . " No , no , no ! Are you mad ? I tell you they will kill you to-morrow , when the news comes . " " The judgment of the Lord upon the wicked , " he answered , with his derisive smile . " You do nothing but mock -- at your own death , at that of others . But you sha n't go . I 've saved you . Your life belongs to me , " she cried , a little wildly . " If you put it that way --  --  " " You know what I mean , " she broke in fiercely . " Do n't dare to pretend to misunderstand me . I 've saved you from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spite or dare-deviltry . " " Just as you say . " " I should think you 'd be ashamed to be so trivial : You seem to think all our lives are planned for your amusement . " " I wish yours were planned --  --  " He pulled himself up short . " You 're right , Miss Sanderson , I 'm acting like a schoolboy . I 'll put myself in your hands . Whatever you want me to do , I 'll do . " " I want you to stay here until they come back from searching for you . You may have to spend all day in this room . Nobody will come here , and you will be quite safe . When night comes again , we 'll arrange a chance for you to get away . " " But I 'll be driving you out , " he protested . " I 'm going to sleep with Anna -- the daughter of our housekeeper , Mrs. Allan . She 'll suppose me nervous on account of the shooting . Lock the door . I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else knocks , do n't answer . You may sleep without fear . " " Just a moment . " He flung up a hand to detain her , then poured out in a low voice part of the feeling pent up in him . " Do n't think I have n't the decency to appreciate this . I do n't care why you do it . The point is that you have saved my life . I ca n't begin to tell you what I think of this . You 'll surely have to take my thanks for granted till I get a chance to prove them . " She nodded , her eyes grown suddenly shy . " That 's all right , then . " And with that she left him to himself . Buck Weaver could not sleep for the thoughts that crowded upon him ; but they were not of his danger , great as that still was . The joy of her , and of the thing she had done , flooded him . He might pretend to cynicism to hide his deep pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly . The night wore itself away , but before morning had broken he saw her again . She came with her three light taps , and he opened the door to find her in the passage with a tray of food . " I did n't dare cook you any coffee . There 's nothing hot -- just what happened to be in the pantry . Mrs. Allan wo n't miss it , because the boys are always foraging at all hours . She 'll think one of them got hungry . Of course , I could n't wait till morning , " she explained , as she put the tray on the table . Weaver experienced anew the stress of humility and emotion . He caught up her little hand and crushed it with a passion of tenderness in his great fist . She looked at him in the old , startled , shy way ; then snatched her hand from him , and , with a wildly beating heart , scudded along the passage and down the back stairs . He sank into a chair , with a groan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heiress of all that youth had to offer in daintiness and charm , was not -- could not be for such as he . He had gone too far on the road to hell , ever to find such a heaven open to him . How long he sat so , he did not know . Probably , not long , but gray morning was sweeping back the curtain of darkness when he came from his absorption with a start . Somebody had tapped thrice for admittance . He arose and unlocked the door . A young woman stood outside the threshold , peering into the semi-darkness toward him . " Is it you , Phyl ? " she asked . The cattleman said nothing . On the spur of the moment , he could not think of the fitting speech . The eyes of his visitor , becoming accustomed to the dim light , saw before her the outline of a man . She let out a startled little scream that ended in a laugh of apology . " It 's Phil , is n't it ? " There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come in , ma'am , and I 'll explain , " said Buck Weaver . Instead , she turned and ran headlong , along the passage , down the stairs , and into the kitchen . Here she came face to face with her young mistress . " What 's the matter ? You look as if you had seen a ghost . " " I have ! At least , I 've seen a man in your room . " " In my room ? What were you doing there ? " demanded Phyllis sharply . " Looking for you . I wakened and found you gone . I thought -- oh , I do n't know what I thought . " Phyllis knew perfectly how it had come about . Anna Allan was a very curiosity box and a born gossip . She had to have her little pug nose in everybody 's business . " So you think you saw somebody in my room ? " her mistress said quietly . " I do n't think . I saw him . " " Saw whom ? Phil , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of gentle scorn . " No -- he was a stranger . I think it was Mr. Weaver , but I 'm not sure . " " Nonsense , Anna ! Do n't be foolish . What would he be doing there ? I 'll go and see myself . You stay here . " She went , and returned presently . " It must have been one of the boys . I would n't say anything about it , Anna . No use stirring up bogeys now , when everybody is excited over the escape of that man . " " All right , ma'am . But I saw somebody , just the same , " the girl maintained obstinately . " No doubt it was Phil . He was up to see me . " Anna said no more then ; but she took occasion later to find out from Phil , without letting him know that she was pumping him , that he had been searching the hills until after six o'clock . One by one she eliminated every man in the house as a possibility . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears . Her young mistress had lied to her to save the man in her room . CHAPTER XIII A MISTAKE At breakfast , a ranchman brought in the news of the attack upon the sheep camp , and by means of it set fire to a powder magazine . The Sandersons went ramping mad for the moment . They saw red ; and if they could have laid hands on their enemy , they would undoubtedly have made an end of him . Phyllis , seeing the fury of their passion , trembled for the safety of the man upstairs . He might be discovered at any moment . Yet she must go to school as if nothing were the matter , and leave him to whatever fate might have in store . When the time came for her to go , she could hardly bring herself to leave . She was in her room , putting in the few minutes she usually spent there , rearranging her hair and giving the last few touches to her toilet after the breakfast . " I hate to go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a sound or open the door to anybody while I 'm away . " " I promise , " he told her . She was very greatly troubled , and could not help showing it . Her face was wan and drawn , all the youthful life stricken out of it . " It will be all right , " he reassured her . " I 'll sit here and read , without making a sound . Nothing will happen . You 'll see . " " Oh , I hope not -- I hope not ! " she cried in a whisper . " You will be careful , wo n't you ? " " I sure will . A hen with one chick wo n't be a circumstance to me . " Larrabie Keller had hitched her horse and brought it round to the front door . She leaned toward him after she had gathered the reins . " You 'll not go far away , will you ? And if anything happens --  --  " " But it wo n't . Why should it ? " " Anna knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quiet ? " " I think so , but she 's a born gossip . Do n't leave her alone with the boys . " " All right , " he nodded . " I feel as if I ought to stay at home , " the young teacher said piteously , hoping that he would encourage her to do so . He shook his head . " No -- you 've got to go , to divert suspicion . It will be all right here . I 'll keep both eyes open . Do n't forget that I 'm going to be on the job all day . " " You 're so good ! " " After I 've been around you a while . It 's catching . " He tucked in the dust robe , without looking at her . But she looked at him , as she started , with that swift , shy glance of hers , and felt the pink tint her cheeks beneath the tan . He was much in her thoughts , this slender brown man with the look of quiet competence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had impressed himself upon her imagination . She had fallen into the way of comparing him with Tom Dixon , with her own brother , with Buck Weaver -- and never to his disadvantage . He talked with a drawl . He walked and rode with an air of languid ease . But the man himself , behind the indolence that sat upon him so gracefully , was like a coiled spring . Sometimes she could see this force in his eyes , when for the moment some thought eclipsed the gay good humor of them . Winsome he was . He had already won her father , even as he had won her . But the touch of affection in his manner never suggested weakness . From the porch Tom Dixon watched her departure sullenly . Since he could not have her , he let himself grow jealous of the man who perhaps could . And because he was what he was -- a small man , full of vanity and conceit -- he must needs make parade of himself with another girl in the role of conquering squire . Larrabie smiled as the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Anna Allan , but he learned soon that it was no smiling matter . Half an hour later , the girl came flying back along the trail the two had taken . Catching sight of Keller , she ran across to him , plainly quivering with excitement and fluttering with fears . " Oh , Mr. Keller -- I 've done it now ! I did n't think --  -- I thought --  " " Take it easy , " soothed the young man , with one of his winning smiles . " Now , what is it you have done ? " Already his eyes had picked out Dixon returning , not quite so impetuously , along the trail . " I told him about the man in Phyllis ' room . " Larrabie 's eyes narrowed and grew steely . " Yes ? " " I told him -- I do n't know why , but I never could keep a secret . I made him promise not to tell . But he is going to tell the boys . There he comes now . And I told Phyllis I would n't tell ! " Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess of things . " I just begged him not to tell -- and he had promised . But he says it 's his duty , and he 's going to do it . Oh , Mr. Keller -- if Mr. Weaver is there they will hurt him , and I 'll be to blame . " " Yes , you will be , " he told her bluntly . " But we may save him yet -- if you can go about your business and keep your mouth shut . " " Oh , I will -- I will , " she promised eagerly . " I 'll not say a word -- not to anybody . " " See that you do n't . Now , run along home . I 'm going to have a quiet little talk with that young man . Maybe I can persuade him to change his mind , " he said grimly . " Please -- if you could . I do n't want to start any trouble . " Larrabie grinned , without taking his eyes from the man coming down the trail . It was usually some good-natured idiot , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . " Well , you be a good girl and padlock your tongue . If you do , I 'll fix it up with Tom , " he promised . He sauntered forward toward the path . Dixon , full of his news , was hurrying to the ranch . He was eager to tell it to the Sandersons , because he wanted to reinstate himself in their good graces . For , though neither of them knew he had fired the shot that wounded Weaver , he had observed a distinct coolness toward him for his desertion of Phyllis in her time of need . It had been all very well for him to explain that he had thought it best to hurry home to get help . The fact remained that he had run away and left her alone . Now he was for pushing past Keller with a curt nod , but the latter stopped him with a lift of the hand . " What 's your sweat ? " " Want to see me , do you ? " Keller nodded easily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you but a minute . " " Press of business on to-day ? " " It 's my business . " " I 'm going to make it mine . " " What do you mean ? " came the quick , suspicious retort . " Let 's walk back up the trail and talk it over . " " No . " " Yes . " Their eyes clashed , and those of the stronger man won . " We can talk it over here , " Dixon said sullenly . " We can , but we wo n't . " " I do n't know as I want to go back up the trail . " " Come . " Larrabie let a hand fall on the shoulder of the other man -- a brown , strong hand that showed no more uncertainty than the steady eyes . Dixon cursed peevishly , but after a moment he turned to go back . He did not know why he went , except that there was something compelling about this man . Besides , he told himself , his news would keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a mile before he stopped . " Now get busy , Mr. Keller . I 've got no time to monkey , " he stormed , attempting to regain what he had lost by his concession . " Sho ! You 've got all day . This rush notion is the great failing of the American people . We had n't ought to go through life on the lope -- no , sir ! We need to take the rest cure for that habit , " Larrabie mused aloud , seating himself on a flat boulder between Tom and the ranch . Dixon let out an oath . " Did you bring me here to tell me that durn foolishness ? " " Not only to tell you . I figured we would try out the rest cure , you and me . We 'll get close to nature out here in the sunshine , and not do a thing but rest till the cows come home , " Keller explained easily . His voice was indolent , his manner amiable ; but there was a wariness in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that when Dixon made the expected dash into the chaparral Keller nailed him in a dozen strides . " Let me alone ! Let me go ! " cried Tom furiously . " You 've got no business to keep me here . " " I 'm doing it for pleasure , say . " The other tried to break away , but Larrabie had caught his arm and twisted it in such a way that he could not move without great pain . Impotently he writhed and cursed . Meanwhile his captor relieved him of his revolver , and , with a sudden turn , dropped him to the ground and stepped back . " What 's eating you , Keller ? Have you gone plumb crazy ? Gim me back that gun and let me go , " the young fellow screamed . " You do n't need the gun right now . Maybe , if you had it , you might take a notion to plug me the way you did Buck Weaver . " " What -- what 's that ? " Then , in angry suspicion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not finished speaking before he regretted it . The look in the face of the other told him that he had gone too far and would have to pay for it . " Stand up , Tom Dixon ! You 've got to take a thrashing for that . There 's been one coming to you ever since you ran away and left a girl to stand the gaff for you . Now it 's due . " " I do n't want to fight , " Tom whined . " I reckon I ought n't to have said that , but you drove me to it . I 'll apologize --  --  " " You 'll apologize after your thrashing , not before . Stand up and take it . " Dixon got to his feet very reluctantly . He was a larger man than his opponent by twenty pounds -- a husky , well-built fellow ; but he was entirely without the fighting edge . He knew himself already a beaten man , and he cowered in spirit before his lithe antagonist , even while he took off his coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did anybody who looked at him carefully , that Keller was a game man from the marrow out . Men who knew him said of Larrabie Keller that he could whip his weight in wild cats . Get him started , and he was a small cyclone in action . But now he went at his man deliberately , with hard , straight , punishing blows . Dixon fought back wildly , desperately , but could not land . He could see nothing but that face with the chilled-steel eyes , but when he lashed out it was never there . Again and again , through the openings he left , came a right or a left like a pile driver , with the weight of one hundred and sixty pounds of muscle and bone back of it . He tried to clinch , and was shaken off by body blows . At last he went down from an uppercut , and stayed down , breathing heavily , a badly thrashed man . " For God 's sake , let me alone ! I 've had enough , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've pretty near killed me . " Larrabie laughed grimly . " You did n't get half enough . I 'll listen to that apology now , my friend . " With many sighs , the prostrate man came through with it haltingly . " I did n't mean -- I had n't ought to have said --  --  " Keller interrupted the tearful voice . " That 'll be enough . You will know better , next time , how to speak respectfully of a lady . While we 're on the subject , I do n't mind telling you that nobody told me . I 'm not a fool , and I put two and two together . That 's all . I 'm not her brother . It was n't my business to punish you because you played the coyote . But when you said she lied to me , that 's another matter . " For very shame , trampled in the dust as he had been , Tom could not leave the subject alone . Besides , he had to make sure that the story would be kept secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shot Buck Weaver , we saw they would kill me if I was caught ; so we figured I had better hunt cover . ' Course I knew they would n't hurt a girl any , " he got out sullenly . " You do n't have to explain it to me , " answered the other coldly . " You ai n't expecting to tell the boys about me shooting Buck , are you ? " Dixon asked presently , hating himself for it . But he was afraid of Phil and his father . They had told him plainly what they thought of him for leaving the girl in the lurch . If they should discover that he had done the shooting and left her to stand the blame for it , they would do more than talk . " I certainly ought to tell them . Likely they may want to see you about it , and hear the particulars . " " There ai n't any need of them knowing . If Phyl had wanted them to know , she could have told them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and was nursing his face with a handkerchief . " We 'll go and break our news together , " suggested the other cheerfully . " You tell them you think Weaver is in her room , and I 'll tell them my little spiel . " " There 's no need telling them about me shooting Weaver , far as I can see . I 'd rather they did n't know . " " For that matter , there 's no need telling them your notions about where Buck is right now . " Tom said nothing , but his dogged look told Larrabie that he was not persuaded . " I tell you what we 'll do , " said Keller , then : " We 'll unload on them both stories , or we wo n't tell them either . Which shall it be ? " Dixon understood that an ultimatum was being served on him . For , though his former foe was smiling , the smile was a frosty one . " Just as you say . I reckon it 's your call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to you , " grinned Larrabie . The man he had thrashed looked as if he would like to kill him . " We 'll close-herd both stories , then . " " Good enough ! Do n't let me keep you any longer , if you 're in a hurry . Now we 've had our little talk , I 'm satisfied . " But Dixon was not satisfied . He was stiff and sore physically , but mentally he was worse . He had played a poor part , and must still do so . If he went down to the ranch with his face in that condition , he could not hope to escape observation . His vanity cried aloud against submitting to the comment to which he would be subjected . The whole story of the thrashing would be bound to come out . " I ca n't go down looking like this , " he growled . " Do you have to go down ? " " Have to get my horse , do n't I ? " " I 'll bring it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't care to talk of it any more than you do . I 'll be a clam . " " All right -- I 'll wait here . " Tom sat down on a boulder and chewed tobacco , his head sunk in his clenched palms . Keller walked down the trail to the ranch . He was glad to go in place of Dixon ; for he felt that the young man was unstable and could not be depended upon not to fall into a rage , and , in a passionate impulse , tell all he knew . He saddled the horse , explaining casually to the wrangler that he had lost a bet with Tom , by the terms of which he had to come down and saddle the latter 's mount . He swung to the back of the pony and cantered up the trail . But before he had gone a hundred yards , he was off again , examining the hoofmarks the animal left in the sand . The left hind mark differed from the others in that the detail was blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to interest Keller greatly . He picked up the corresponding foot of the cow pony , and found the cause of the irregularity to be a deformity or swelling in the ball of the foot , which apparently was now its normal condition . The young man whistled softly to himself , swung again to the saddle , and continued on his way . The owner of the horse had his back turned and did not hear him coming as he padded up the soft trail . The man was testing in his hand something that clicked . Larrabie swung quietly to the ground , and waited . His eyes were like tempered steel . " Here 's your horse , " he said . Before the other man moved , he drawled : " I reckon I 'd better tell you I 'm armed , too . Do n't be hasty . " Dixon turned his swollen face to him in a childish fury . He had picked up , and was holding in his hand , the revolver Larrabie had taken from him and later thrown down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my own gun , ai n't it ? Mean to say I 'm a murderer ? " " I happen to know you have impulses that way . I thought I 'd check this one , to save you trouble . " He was standing carelessly with his right hand resting on the mane of the pony ; he had not even taken the precaution of lowering it to his side , where the weapon might be supposed to lie . For an instant Tom thought of taking a chance . The odds would be with him , since he had the revolver ready to his fingers . But before that indomitable ease his courage ebbed . He had not the stark fighting nerve to pit himself against such a man as this . " I do n't know as I said anything about shooting . Looks like you 're trying to fasten another row on me , " the craven said bitterly . " I 'm content if you are ; and as far as I 'm concerned , this thing is between us two . It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixon mount . The hillman took his spleen out on the horse , finding that the safest vent for his anger . He jerked its head angrily , cursed it , and drove in the spurs cruelly . With a leap , the cow pony was off . In fifty strides it reached the top of the hill and disappeared . Keller laughed grimly , and spoke aloud to himself , after the manner of one who lives much alone . " There 's a nice young man -- yellow clear through . Queer thing she could ever have fancied him . But I do n't know , either . He 's a right good looker , and has lots of cheek ; that goes a long way with girls . Likely he was mighty careful before her . And he 'd not been brought up against the acid test , then . " His roving eyes took in with disgust the stains of tobacco juice plastered all over the clean surface of the rocks . " I 'll bet a doughnut she never knew he chewed . Did n't know it myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buck Weaver told me he came on a dead cow of his just after the rustlers had left . Fire still smoldering . Tobacco stains still wet on the rocks . And one of the horses had a hind hoof that left a blurred trail . Surely looks like Mr. Tom Dixon is headed for the pen mighty fast . " He turned and strolled back to the house , smiling to himself . CHAPTER XIV A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION Breakfast finished , Weaver cast about for some diversion to help him pass the time . This room , alone of those he had seen in the house , seemed to reflect something of the teacher 's dainty personality . There were some framed prints on the walls -- cheap , but , on the whole , well selected . The rugs were in subdued brown tints that matched well the pretty wall paper . To the cattleman , it was pathetic that the girl had done so much with such frugal means to her hand . For plainly her meagre efforts were circumscribed by the purse limitation . Ranging over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verse by Markham , and , turning the leaves aimlessly , chanced on " A Satyr Song . " I know by the stir of the branches , The way she went ; And at times I can see where a stem Of the grass is bent . She 's the secret and light of my life , She allures to elude ; But I follow the spell of her beauty , Whatever the mood . " Knows what he 's talking about -- some poet , that fellow , " Buck cried aloud to himself , for it seemed to him that the Californian had put into words his own feeling . He read on avidly , from one poem to another , lost in his discovery . It was perhaps an hour later that he came back to a realization of a gnawing desire . He wanted a pipe , and the need was an insistent one . It was of no use to argue with himself . He surely had to have one smoke . Longingly he fingered his pipe , filled it casually with the loose tobacco in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind . From behind the window curtain he examined the plaza . " Not a soul in sight . Do n't believe there 's a man about the place . No risk at all , looks to me . " With that , he swept the match to a flame , and lit the pipe . He sat close to the open window , so that the smoke could drift out without his being seen . The experiment brought no disaster . He finished his smoke undisturbed , and went back to reading . The hours dragged slowly past . Noon came and went ; mid-afternoon was upon him . His watch showed a few minutes past four when he decided on another smoke . From the corner of his pocket he raked the loose tobacco into the bowl of his pipe , and pressed it down . Presently he was again puffing in pleasant serenity . Suddenly there came a blinding flash and a roar . Buck started to his feet in amazement , the stem of the pipe still in his mouth , the bowl shattered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the target for a sharpshooter . There was a neat hole through the framework of the window case , showing where the bullet had plowed . But an investigation left him in the air ; for the direction of the bullet hole was such that , if anybody from outside had fired it , he must have been up in a balloon . The explanation came to him like a flash . In raking the tobacco into his pipe with his fingers , he must have pressed into the bowl a stray cartridge left some time in the pocket . This had gone off after the heat had reached the powder . By the time he had reached this conclusion some one came running along the passage and tried the locked door . After some rattling at the knob , the footsteps retreated . Buck could hear excited voices . " Coming back in force , I 'll bet , " he told himself , with a dubious grin . The fat was surely in the fire now . Footsteps made themselves heard again , this time in numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittance sharply . Buck opened the door and gazed at the intruders in mild surprise . Old Sanderson and Phil were there , together with Slim and a cow-puncher known as Cuffs . All of them were armed . " Want to come in , gentlemen ? " Weaver asked . " So you 're here , are you ? " spoke up Phil . " That 's right . I 'm here , sure enough . " " How long you been here ? " " Been hanging round the place ever since my escape . You kept so close a watch I could n't make my getaway . Some time the other side of noon I drifted in here , figuring some of you would drive me from cover by accident during the day if I stayed out in the chaparral . This room looked handy , so I made myself right at home and locked the door . I hate to shoot up a lady 's boudoir , but looks like that 's what I 've done . " " You durn fool ! Who were you shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped forward , and with a certain austere dignity , more menacing than threats , took the words out of the mouth of his son . " I think I 'll negotiate this , Phil . " Buck explained the accident amiably , and relieved himself of the imputation of idiocy . " Serves a man right for smoking without permission in a lady 's room , " he admitted humorously . A man came up the stairway two steps at a time , panting as if he had been running . It was Keller . That the cattleman must have been discovered , he knew even before he saw him grinning round on a circle of armed foes . Weaver nodded recognition , and Larrabie understood it to mean also thanks for what he had done for him last night . " We 'll talk this over downstairs , " old Sanderson announced grimly . They went down into the big hall with the open fireplace , and the old sheepman waved his hand toward a chair . " Thanks . Think I 'll take it standing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully his precarious situation ; he knew that these men had already condemned him to death . The quiet repression they imposed on themselves told him as much . But his gaze passed calmly from one to another , without the least shrinking . All of them save Keller and Phil were unusually tall men -- as tall , almost , as he ; but in breadth of shoulder and depth of chest he dwarfed them . They were grim , hard men , but not one so grim and iron as he when he chose . " Your life is forfeit , Buck Weaver , " Sanderson said , without delay . " Made up your mind , have you ? " " Your own riders made it up for us when they murdered poor Jesus Menendez . " " A bad break , that -- and me a prisoner here . Some of the boys had been out on the range a week . I reckon they did n't know I was the rat in your trap . " " So much the worse for you . " " Looks like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I expect there would n't be any use mentioning the law to you ? It 's here to punish the man that shot Menendez . " " Not a bit of use . You own the sheriff and half the juries in this county . Besides , we 've got the man right here that is responsible for the killing of poor Jesus . " " Oh ! If you look at it that way , of course --  --  " " That 's the way to look at it I do n't blame your riders any more than I blame the guns they fired . You did that killing . " " Even though I was locked up on your ranch , more than twenty miles away . " " That makes no difference . " " Seems to me it makes some , " suggested Keller , speaking for the first time . " His riders may have acted contrary to orders . He surely did not give any specific orders in this case . " " His actions for months past have been orders enough , " said Cuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Larrabie urged . " We 've done all the investigating we 're going to do . This man has set himself up like a czar . I 'm not going through the list of it all , but he has more than reached the limit months ago . He 's passed it now . He 's got to die , by gum , " the old sheepman said , his eyes like frozen stars . " We all have to do that . Just when does my time come ? " Weaver asked . " Now , " cried Sanderson , with a bitter oath . Phil swallowed hard . He had grown white beneath the tan . The thing they were about to do seemed awful to him . " Good God ! You 're not going to murder him , are you ? " protested Larrabie . " He murdered poor Jesus Menendez , did n't he ? " " You mean you 're going to shoot him down in cold blood ? " " What 's the matter with hanging ? " Slim asked brutally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man nodded agreement . " No -- they did n't hang Menendez . " " Your sheep herder died -- if he died at all , and we have no proof of it -- with a gun in his hands , " Larrabie said . " That 's right , " admitted Phil quickly . " That 's right . We got to give him a chance . " " What sort of a chance would you like to give him ? " Sanderson asked of the boy . " Let him fight for his life . Give him a gun , and me one . We 'll settle this for good and all . " The eyes of the old Confederate gleamed , though he negatived the idea promptly . " That would n't be a square deal , Phil . He 's our prisoner , and he has killed one of our men . It would n't be right for one of us to meet him on even terms . " " Give me a gun , and I 'll meet all of you ! " cried Weaver , eyes gleaming . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , " Sanderson retorted promptly . " Lets us out , too . I do n't fancy killing in cold blood , myself . Of course we 'll get you , but you 'll have a run for your money first , by gum . " " Maybe you 'll get me , and maybe you wo n't . Is this little vendetta to be settled with revolvers , or rifles ? " " Make it rifles , " Phil suggested quickly . There was always a chance that , if the battle were fought at long range , the cattleman might reach the hill canons in safety . Keller was helpless . He lived in a man 's world , where each one fought for his own head and took his own fighting chance . Weaver had proposed an adjustment of the difficulty , and his enemies had accepted his offer . Even if the Sandersons would have tolerated further interference , the cattleman would not . Moreover Keller 's hands were tied as to taking sides . He could not fight by the side of the owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyllis . There was only one thing to do , and that offered little hope . He slipped quietly from the room and from the house , swung to the back of a horse he found saddled in the place and galloped wildly down the road toward the schoolhouse . Phyllis had much influence over her father . If she could reach the scene in time , she might prevent the duel . His pony went up and down the hills as in a moving-picture play . Meanwhile terms of battle were arranged at once , without haggling on either side . Weaver was to have a repeating Winchester and a belt full of cartridges , the others such weapons as they chose . The duel was to start with two hundred and fifty yards separating the combatants , but this distance could be increased or diminished at will . Such cover as was to be found might be used . " Whatever 's right suits me , " the cattleman said . " I ca n't say more than that you are doing handsomely by me . I reckon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't mind . " The horse wrangler and the Mexican waiter were sent for , and to them the owner of the place explained what was about to occur . Their eyes stuck out , and their chins dropped , but neither of the two had anything to say . " We 're telling you boys so you may know it 's all right . I proposed this thing . If I 'm shot , nobody is to blame but myself . Understand ? " Weaver drove the idea home . The wrangler got out an automatic " Sure , " and Manuel an amazed " Si , senor , " upon which they were promptly retired from the scene . Having prepared and tested their weapons , the parties to the difficulty repaired to the pasture . " I 'd like to try out this gun , if you do n't mind . It 's a new proposition to me , " the cattleman said . " Go to it , " nodded Slim , seating himself tailor-fashion on the ground and rolling a cigarette . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of gameness appealed to him . Weaver glanced around , threw the rifle to his shoulder , and fired immediately . A chicken , one hundred and fifty yards away , fell over . " Accidents will happen , " suggested Slim . " That accident happened through the neck , you 'll find , " Weaver retorted calmly . " Betcher . " Buck dropped another rooster . " You ai n't happy unless you 're killing something of ours , " Slim grinned . " Well , if you 're satisfied with your gun , we 'll go ahead and see how good you are on humans . " They measured the distance , and Sanderson called : " Are you ready ? " " I reckon , " came back the answer . The father gave the signal -- the explosion of a revolver . Even as it flashed , Buck doubled up like a jack rabbit and leaped for the shelter of a live oak , some thirty yards distant . Four rifles spoke almost at the same instant , so that between the first and the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time . But the runner did not stop until he reached the tree and dropped behind its spreading roots . " Hunt cover , boys ! " the father gave orders . " Do n't any of you expose yourself . We 'll have to outflank him , but we 'll take our time about it . " He got this out in staccato jerks , the last part of it not until all were for the moment safe . The strange thing was that Weaver had not fired once as they scurried for shelter , even though Phil 's foot had caught in a root and held him prisoner for an instant while he freed it . But as they began circling round him carefully , he fired -- first at one of them and then at another . His shooting was close , but not one of them was hit . Recalling the incident of the chickens , this seemed odd . In Slim 's phrasing , he did not seem to be so good on " humans . " Behind his live oak , Buck was so well protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies should outflank him . How long that would have taken nobody ever found out ; for an intervention occurred in the form of a flying Diana , on horseback , taking the low fence like a huntress . It was Phyllis , hatless , her hair flying loose -- a picture long to be remembered . Straight as an arrow she rode for Weaver , flung herself from the saddle , and ran forward to him , waving her handkerchief as a signal to her people to cease firing . " Thank God , I 'm in time ! " she cried , her voice deep with feeling . Then , womanlike , she leaned against the tree , and gave way to the emotion that had been pent within her . Buck patted her shoulders with awkward tenderness . " Do n't you ! Do n't you ! " he implored . Her collapse lasted only a short time . She dried her tears , and stilled her sobs . " I must see my father , " she said . The old man was already hurrying forward , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phyl would not move a single step of the way to meet him , lest they take advantage of her absence to keep up the firing . " How under heaven did you get here ? " Buck asked her . " Mr. Keller came to meet me . I took his horse , and he is bringing the buggy . I heard firing , so I cut straight across , " she explained . " You should n't have come . You might have been hit . " She wrung her hands in distress . " It 's terrible -- terrible ! Why will you do such things -- you and them ? " she finished , forgetting the careful grammar that becomes a schoolmarm . Buck might have told her -- but he did not -- that he had carefully avoided hitting any of her people ; that he had determined not to do so even if he should pay for his forbearance with his life . What he did say was an apologetic explanation , which explained nothing . " We were settling a difference of opinion in the old Arizona way , Miss Phyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ? " she asked sharply . " He 's covering ground right lively for a dead one , " Buck said dryly . " I 'm speaking of your intentions . You ca n't deny you would have done it . " " Anyhow , I have n't denied it . " Sanderson , almost breathless , reached them , caught the girl by the shoulders , and shook her angrily . " What do you mean by it ? What are you doing here ? Goddlemighty , girl ! Are you stark mad ? " " No , but I think all you people are . " " You 'll march home to your room , and stay there till I come . " " No , father . " ' " Yes , I say ! " " I must see you -- alone . " " You can see me afterward . We 'll do no talking till this business is finished . " " Why do you talk so ? It wo n't be finished -- it ca n't , " she moaned . " We 'll attend to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand . " Her voice fell to the lowest murmur . " He came here for me . " " For you-all ? " " Oh , do n't you see ? He brought me back here because he -- cared for me . " A tide of shame flushed her cheeks . Surely no girl had ever been so cruelly circumstanced that she must tell such things before a lover , who had not declared himself explicitly . " Cared for you ? As a wolf does for a lamb ! " " At first , maybe -- but not afterward . Do n't you see he was sorry ? Everything shows that . " " And to show that he was sorry , he had poor Jesus Menendez killed ! " " No -- he did n't know about that till I told him . " " Till you told him ? " " Yes . When I freed him and took him to my room . " " So you freed him -- and took him to your room ? " She had never heard her father speak in such a voice , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look at me like that , father ! Do n't you see -- ca n't you see --  -- Oh , why are you so cruel to me ? " She buried her face in her forearm against the rock . Her father caught her arm so savagely that a spasm of pain shot through her . " None of that ! Give me the truth . Now -- this instant ! " Anger at his injustice welled up in her . " You 've had the truth . I knew of the attack on the sheep camp -- heard of it on the way home from school , from Manuel . Do you think I 've lived with you eighteen years for nothing ? I knew what you would do , and I tried to save you from yourself . There was no place where he would be safe but in my room . I took him there , and slept with Anna . I did right . I would do it again . " " Slept with Anna , did you ? " She felt again that furious tide of blood sweep into her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Goddlemighty , gyurl , I wisht you 'd keep out of my business . " " And let you do murder ? " " Why did you save him ? Because you love him ? " demanded Sanderson fiercely . " Because I love you . But you 're too blind to see it . " " And him -- do you love him ? Answer me ! " " No ! " she flamed . " But if I did , I would be loving a man . He would n't take odds of five to one against an enemy . " Her father 's great black eyes chiselled into hers . " Are you lying to me , girl ? " Weaver spoke out quietly . " I expect I can answer that , Mr. Sanderson . Your daughter has given me to understand that I 'm about as mean a thing as God ever made . " But Phyl was beyond caution now . Her resentment against her father , for that he had forced her to drag out the secret things of her heart and speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into words -- quick , eager , full of passion . " I take it all back then -- every word of it ! " she cried . " You are braver , kinder , more generous to me than my own people -- more chivalrous . You would have gone to your death without telling them that I took you to my room . But my own father , who has known me all my life , insults me grossly . " " I was wrong , " Sanderson admitted uneasily . Keller climbed the pasture fence , and came running up at the same time as Phil and Slim . " Menendez is alive ! " he cried . " He is at the Twin Star Ranch . The boys there are taking care of him , and the doctor says he will pull through . " " Who told you ? " " Bob Tryon . I met him not five minutes ago . He is on his way here . " This put a new face on things . If Menendez were still alive , Weaver could be held to await developments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Twin Star Ranch , retaliation would follow any measures taken against the cattleman . Phyllis gave a glad little cry . " Then it 's all right now . " Weaver 's face crinkled to a leathery grin . " Mighty unfortunate -- ai n't it , boys ? Puts a kind of a kink in our plans for the little entertainment we were figuring on pulling off . But maybe you 've a notion of still going on with it . " " If we do n't , it wo n't be on your account , seh , I do n't reckon , " Sanderson answered reluctantly . But though he would not admit it , the old man was beginning to admire this big fellow , who could afford to miss his enemies on purpose even in the midst of a deadly duel . He was coming to a grudging sense of quality in Weaver . The cattleman might be many things that were evil , but undeniably he possessed also those qualities which on the frontier count for more than civilized virtues . He was game to the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right time , no matter what it was going to cost him . On the whole Buck Weaver would stand the acid test , the old soldier was coming to think . And because he did not want to believe any good of his enemy , old Jim Sanderson , when he was alone in the corral with the horses or on a hillside driving his sheep , would shake his gnarled fist impotently and swear fluently until his surcharged feelings were relieved . CHAPTER XV THE BRAND BLOTTER Two riders followed the trail to Yeager 's Spur -- one a man , brown and forceful ; the other a girl , with sunshine in her dancing eyes and a voice full of the lilt of laughter . What they might come to be to each other both were already speculating about , though neither knew as yet . They were the best of friends -- good comrades , save when chance eyes said unguardedly too much . For the girl that sufficed , but it was not enough for the man . He knew that he had found the one woman he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her thoughts rove over many things . For instance , why queer throbs and sudden shyness swept her soft young body . She liked Larrabie Keller -- oh , so much !  - -  but her untutored heart could not quite tell her whether she loved him . His eyes drilled into her electric pulsations whenever they met hers . The youth in him called to the youth in her . She admired him . He stirred her imagination , and yet -- and yet --  --  They rode through a valley of gold and russet , all warm with yellow sunlight . In front of them , the Spur projected from the hill ridge into the mountain park . " Then I think you 're a cow-puncher looking for a job , but not very anxious to find one , " she was hazarding , answering a question . " No . That leaves you one more guess . " " That forces me to believe that you are what you say you are , " she mocked ; " just a plain , prosaic homesteader . " She had often considered in her mind what business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after week and rode trail with the cowboys ; but it had not been the part of hospitality to ask questions of her friend . This might seem to imply a doubt , and of doubt she had none . To-day , he himself had broached the subject . Having brought it up , he now dropped it for the time . He had shaded his eyes , and was gazing at something that held his attention -- a little curl of smoke , rising from the wash in front of them . " What is it ? " she asked , impatient that his mind could so easily be diverted from her . " That is what I 'm going to find out . Stay here ! " Rifle in hand , Keller slipped forward through the brush . His imperative " Stay here ! " annoyed her just a little . She uncased her rifle , dropped from the saddle as he had done , and followed him through the cacti . Her stealthy advance did not take her far before she came to the wash . There Keller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite motionless and silent -- watching now the bushes that fringed the edge of the wash , and now the smoke spiral rising faintly from the embers of a fire . Slowly the man 's tenseness relaxed . Evidently he had made up his mind that death did not lurk in the bushes , for he slid down into the wash and stepped across to the fire . Phyllis started to follow him , but at the first sound of slipping rubble her friend had her covered . " I told you not to come , " he reproached , lowering his rifle as soon as he recognized her . " But I wanted to come . What is it ? Why are you so serious ? " His eyes were busy making an inventory of the situation , his mind , too , was concentrated on the thing before him . " Do you think it is rustlers ? Is that what you mean ? " she asked quickly . " Wait a minute and I 'll tell you what I think . " He finished making his observations and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , something that nobody in the neighborhood knows but you and Jim Yeager . I belong to the ranger force . Lieutenant O'Connor sent me here to clean up this rustling that has been going on for several years . " " And a lot of the boys thought you were a rustler yourself , " she commented . " So did one or two of the young ladies , " he smiled . " But that is not the business before this meeting . Because I 'm trained to it I notice things you would n't . For instance , I saw a man the other day with a horse whose hind hoof left a trail like that . " He pointed to one , and then another track in the soft sand . " Maybe that might be a coincidence , but the owner of that horse had a habit of squirting tobacco juice on clean rocks -- like that -- and that . " " That does n't prove he has been rustling . " " No ; but the signs here show he has been branding , and Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who surely was making free with a Twin Star calf . " " How long has he been gone ? " " There were two of them , and they 've been gone about twenty minutes . " " How do you know ? " He pointed to a stain of tobacco juice still moist . " Who is he ? " she asked . He knew her stanch loyalty to her friends , and Tom Dixon had been a friend till very lately . He hesitated ; then , without answering , made a second thorough examination of the whole ground . " Come -- if we have any luck , I 'll show him to you , " he said , returning to her . " But you must do just as I say -- must be under my orders . " " I will , " she promised . Forthwith , they started . After they had ridden in silence for some distance , covering ground fast , they drew to a walk . " You know by the trail for where they were heading , " she suggested in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently , at the entrance to a little canon , Keller swung down and examined the ground carefully , seemed satisfied , and rode with her into the gully . But she noticed that now he went cautiously , eyes narrowed and wary , with the hard face and the look of a coiled spring she had seen on him before . Her heart drummed with excitement . She was not afraid , but she was fearfully alive . At the other entrance to the canon , Larrabie was down again for another examination . What he seemed to find gave him pleasure . " They 've separated , " he told Phyllis . " We 'll give our attention to the gentleman with the calf , and let his friend go , to-day . " They swung sharply to the north , taking a precipitous trail of shale that Phyllis judged to be a short cut . It was rough going , but their mountain ponies were good for anything less than a perpendicular wall . They clambered up and down like cats , as sure-footed as wild goats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the valley below -- a rider on horseback , driving a calf . " There goes Mr. Waddy , as big as coffee . " " He 's going to swing round the point . You mean to drop down the hill and cut him off ? " Illustration : " DROP THAT GUN ! " Page 205 " That 's the plan . Better do no more talking after we pass that live oak . See that little wash ? We 'll drop into it , and hide among the cottonwoods . " The rustler was pushing along hurriedly , driving the calf at a trot , half the time twisted in the saddle , with anxious eyes to the rear . Revolvers and a rifle garnished him , but quite plainly they gave him no sense of safety . When the summons came to him to " Drop that gun ! " it was only a confirmation of his fears . Yet he jumped as a boy jumps under the unexpected cut of a cane . The rifle went clattering to the stony trail . Without being ordered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyward . " Why , it 's Tom Dixon ! We 've made a mistake , " Phyllis discovered ; and moved forward from her hiding place . " We 've made no mistake . I told you I 'd show you the rustler , and I 've shown him to you , " Keller answered , as he too stepped forward . And to Tom , whose hands dropped at sight of Phyllis : " Better keep them reaching till I get those guns . That 's right . Now , you may ' light . " " What 's got into you ? " demanded Dixon , his teeth still chattering . " Holding up a man for nothing . Take away that gun you got bent on me ! " " You 're under arrest for rustling , seh , " the cattle detective told him sternly . " Prove it . Prove it ! " Dixon swung from the saddle , and faced the other doggedly . " That calf you 're driving now is rustled . You branded it less than two hours ago in Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Yeager 's Spur . " " How do you know ? " cried the startled youth . And on the heels of that : " It 's a lie ! " He was getting a better grip on his courage . He spat defiantly a splash of tobacco juice on a flat pebble which his eye found . " No such thing ! This calf was a maverick . Ask Phyl . She 'll tell you I 'm no rustler . " Phyllis said nothing . Her gaze was very steadily on Tom . Keller pointed to the evidence which the hoof of the horse had printed on the trail , and to that which the man had written on the pebble . " We found both these signs once before . They were left by one of the rustlers operating in this vicinity . That time it was a Twin Star brand you blotted . You 've done a poor job , for I can see there has been another brand there . Your partner left you with the cow at the entrance to the canon . Caught red-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll find all this aggregates evidence enough to send you to the penitentiary . Buck Weaver will attend to that . " " It 's a conspiracy . You and him mean to railroad me through , " Tom charged sullenly . " I tell you , Phyllis knows I 'm no rustler . " " I 've known you were one ever since the day you wanted to go back and tell where Weaver was hidden . You and your pony scattered the evidence around then , just as you 're doing here , " the ranger answered . " You 've got it cooked up to put me through , " Dixon insisted desperately . " You want to get me out of the way , so you 'll have a clear track with Phyl . Think I do n't sabe your game ? " The angry color sucked into Keller 's face beneath the tan . He avoided looking at Phyllis . " We 'll not discuss that , seh . But I can say that kind of talk wo n't help buy you anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was very angry , so that for the moment her embarrassment was swamped . But she did not choose to dignify his spleen by replying to it . There was no iron in Dixon 's make-up . When he saw that this attack had reacted against him , he tried whining . " Honest , you 're wrong about this calf , Mr. Keller . I do n't say , mind you , it ai n't a rustled calf . It may be ; but I do n't know it if it is . Maybe the rustlers were scared off just before I happened on it . " " We 'll see how a jury looks at that . You 're going to get the chance to tell that story to one , I expect , " Larrabie remarked dryly . " Pass it up this time , and I 'll get out of the country , " the youth promised . " Take care ! Whatever you say will be used against you . " " Suppose I did rustle one of Buck Weaver 's calves -- mind , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bust my father up in business ? Ai n't he aiming to do the same by your folks , Phyl ? " He was almost ready to cry . The girl turned her head aside , and spoke in a low voice to Keller . She was greatly angered and disgusted at Tom ; but she had been his friend , and on this occasion there had been some justification for him in the wrong the cattleman had done his family . " Do you have to report him and have him prosecuted ? " " I 'm paid to stop the rustling that has been going on , " answered Keller , in the same undertone . " He wo n't do it again . He has had his scare . It will last him a lifetime . " Even while she promised it for him , it was not without contempt for the poor-spirited craven who could be so easily driven from his evil ways . If a man must do wrong , let it be boldly -- as Buck Weaver did it . " Yes , but his pals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know them . " " I can guess one man in it with him . We 've got to root the thing out . " " Why not serve warning on him by Tom ? Then they would both clear out . " Dixon divined that she was pleading for him , and edged in another word for himself . " Whatever wrong I 've done I 've been driven to . There 's been an older man to lead me into it , too . " " You mean Red Hughes ? " Keller said sharply . Tom hesitated . He had not got to the point of betraying his accomplice . " I ai n't saying who I mean . Nor , for that matter , I ai n't admitting I 've done any particular wrong -- no more than other young fellows . " Keller brought him sharply to time . " You 've used your last wet blanket . I 've got the evidence that will put you behind the bars . Miss Phyllis wants me to let you off . I ca n't do it unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through with what I want to know , and do as I say , or you 'll have to stand the gaff . " " What do you want to know ? " " How many pals had you in this rustling ? " " You said you would use against me anything I said . " " I say now I 'll use it for you if you tell the truth and meet my conditions . " " What are your conditions ? " " Never mind . You 'll learn them later . Answer my question . How many ? " " One "  - -  very sullenly . " Red Hughes ? " " That 's the one thing I ca n't tell you , " the lad cried . " Do n't you see I ca n't ? " " It 's the one thing I do n't need to know . I 've got Red cinched about as tight as you , my boy . How long has this been going on ? " The information came from Dixon as reluctantly as a tight cork comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incisive questions followed , one after another ; and at the end of the quiz Tom was pumped nearly dry . Those who heard his confession listened to the story of how and why he had first started rustling -- the tale of each exploit , the location of the mountain cache where the calves had been driven , even the name of the Mexican buyer who once had come across the line to receive a bunch of stolen cattle . Keller laid down his conditions . " You 'll go to Red muy pronto , and tell him he 's got thirty-six hours to get across the line . He and you will go to Sonora , and you 'll stay there . We 've got you dead to rights . Show up in this country again , and you 'll both go to Yuma . Understand ? " Tom understood well enough . He writhed under it , but he was up against the need of surrender . Sullenly he waited until the other had laid down the law , then asked for his weapons . Keller emptied the chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to the magazine of the rifle before he handed it back . Without a word , without even a nod or a glance , Dixon rode out of the gulch . The eyes of the remaining two met , and became tangled at once . Hastily both pairs withdrew . " We 'll have to drive the calf back , wo n't we ? " said Phyllis , seizing on the first irrelevant thing that occurred to say . " Yes -- as far as Tryon 's . " Presently she said : " Do you think they will leave the country ? " " No . " Her glance swept him in surprise . " Then -- why did you let him go so easily ? " He smiled . " Did n't you ask me to let him off ? " " Yes ; but --  --  " How could she explain that by lapsing from his duty so far , even at her request , he had disappointed her ! " No , ma'am ! I 'm a false alarm . It was n't out of gallantry I unroped him . Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his partner . But Hughes ai n't in this . He has been in Sonora for a year . When Tom goes back all worried and tells what has happened to him , the gentleman who is the brains for the outfit is going to be right pleased I 'm following a false trail . That 's liable to make him more careless . If we had had the evidence to cinch Dixon it would have been different . But a roan calf is a roan calf . I do n't expect the owner could swear to it , even if we knew who he was . So I made my little play and let him go . " " And I thought all the time you were doing it for me , " she laughed , and on the heels of it made her little confession : " And I was blaming you for giving way . " " I 'll know now that the way to please you is not to do what you want me to do . " " You know a lot about girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a wiz , " he agreed with her derision . Keller spoke absently , considering whether this might be the propitious moment to try his luck . They had been comrades together in an adventure well concluded . Both were thinking of what Dixon had said . It seemed to Larrabie that it would be a wonderful thing if they might ride back through the warm sunlight with this new miracle of her love in his life . It was at the meeting of their fingers , when he gave her the bridle , that he spoke . " I 've got to say it , Miss Phyllis . I 've got to know where I stand . " She understood him of course . The touch of their eyes had warmed her even before he began . But " Stand how ? " she repeated feebly . " With you . I love you ! We both know that . What about you ? Could you care for me ? Do you ? " Her shy , deep eyes met his fairly . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes I think I don't -- that way . " The touch of affection that made his face occasionally tender as a woman 's , lit his warm smile . " Could n't you make that first sometimes always , do n't you reckon , Phyllis ? " " Ah ! If I knew ! But I don't -- truly , I do n't . I -- I want to care , " she confessed , with divine shyness . " That 's good listening . Could n't you go ahead on those times you do , honey ? " " No ! " She drew back from his advance . " No -- give me time . I'm -- I 'm not sure -- I 'm not at all sure . I ca n't explain , but --  --  " " Ca n't decide between me and another man ? " he suggested , by way of a joke , to lighten her objection . Then , in a flash , he knew that by accident he had hit the truth . The startled look of doubt in her eyes told him . Perhaps she had not known it herself before , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the running -- one not to be thrust aside easily . Phyllis ' first impulse was to be alone . She turned her face away and busied herself with a stirrup leather . " Do n't say anything more now -- please . I 'm such a little goose ! I do n't know -- yet . Wo n't you wait and -- forget it till -- say , till next week ? " He promised to wait , but he did not promise to forget it . As they rode home , he made cheerful talk on many subjects ; but the one in both their minds was that which had been banned . Every silence was full charged with it . Its suppression ran like quicksilver through every spoken sentence . CHAPTER XVI A WATERSPOUT Almost imperceptibly , Buck Weaver 's relation to his jailers changed . It was still understood that their interests differed , but the personal bitterness was largely gone . He went riding occasionally with the boys , rather as a guest than as a prisoner . At any time he might have escaped , but for a tacit understanding that he would stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Twin Star . One pleasure , however , was denied him . He saw nothing of Phyllis , save for a distant glimpse or two when she was starting to school or returning from a ride with Larrabie Keller . He knew that her father and her brother were studiously eliminating him , so far as she was concerned . Certain events had been of a nature to induce whispered gossip . Fortunately , such gossip had been nipped in the bud . They intended that there should be no revival of it . Weaver had sent word to the riders of the Twin Star that there was to be nothing doing in the matter of the feud until his return . He had at the same time ordered from them a change of linen , a box of his favorite cigars , and certain papers to be found in his desk . These in due time were delivered by Jesus Menendez in person , together with a note from the ranch . TWIN STAR RANCH , Tuesday Morning . DERE BUCK : You 've sure got us up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the whole Seven Mile outfit in a big drive , but looks like you got other notions . Wise us if you want the cooperation of PESKY and the other boys . With a smile , Weaver showed it to Phil . " Shall I send word to the boys to start on the round-up ? " " It wo n't be necessary . You do n't need their cooperation . Fact is , now Menendez is back , you 're free to go . ' Rastus is getting your horse right now . " The cattleman realized instantly that he did not want to go . Business affairs at home pressed for his attention , but he felt extremely reluctant to pull out and leave the field in possession of Larrabie Keller , even temporarily . He could not , however , very well say so . " Good enough , " he said brusquely . " Before I go , we 'd better settle the matter of the range . Send for your father , and I 'll make him a proposition that looks fair to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map of the county spread before him upon the table . With a pencil he divided the range in a zigzag , twisting line . " How about that ? I 'll take all on the valley side . You take what is in the hills and the parks . " Sanderson looked at him in astonishment . " That 's all we 've been contending for ! " Buck nodded . " Since you get what you want , you ought to be satisfied , " he said gruffly . " Of course , there will have to be some give-and-take about this . My cattle will cross the line . So will yours . That ca n't be helped . I 've worked out this problem of the range feed pretty thoroughly . My territory will feed just about as many as yours . Each year we can arrange together to keep the number of cattle down . " Under his shaggy brows , Sanderson looked at him in perplexity . The proposition was more than generous . It meant that Weaver would have to sell off about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , could increase their holdings . " What about sheep ? " the old man asked bluntly . Buck 's stony gaze met his steadily . " I 'm going to leave those sheep on your conscience , Mr. Sanderson . You 'll have to settle that matter for yourself . " " You mean you 'll not stand in the way , if I want to keep them ? " " That 's what I mean . It 's up to you . " Phil , who was sitting on the porch sewing on a pair of leather chaps , indulged in a grin . " I see this is where we go out of the sheep business , " he said . " The market 's good . I do n't know but what it would be the right thing to sell , " his father agreed . " I want to meet you halfway in settling this trouble , Mr. Weaver . " The matter was discussed further at some length , after which the cattleman shook hands all round and departed . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse at the stables . " Think I 'll beat you out of that ride with the schoolmarm to-day , my friend . A steady diet of rides like that is liable to intoxicate a man , " he told himself , with his grim smile . In plain sight of all , he turned the head of his horse toward the road that led to the schoolhouse . Presently he met pupils galloping home , calling to each other joyously as they rode . Others followed more sedately in buggies . Nearer the schoolhouse he came on one walking . After Phyllis had looked over some papers , made up her weekly report , and outlined on the board work for next day , she saddled her pony and set out homeward . Not in ten years had the country been so green and lovely as it was now . There had been many winter snows and spring rains , so that the alfilaria covered the hills with a carpet of grass . Muddy little rivulets , pouring down arroyos on their way from the mountains , showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Del Oro , a creek which was dry in summer but was now full to its banks . She followed the river into the canon of the same name , a narrow gulch with sheer precipitous walls . So much water was in the river that the trail along the bank scarce gave the pony footing . Half a mile from the point where she had entered the Del Oro the trail crept up the wall and escaped to the mesa above . Phyllis was nearing the ascent when a sound startled her . She swung round in her saddle , to see a wall of water roaring down the lane with the leap of some terrible wild beast . Somewhere in the hills there had been a waterspout . She called upon her pony with spur and voice , racing desperately for the place where the trail rose . Of that wild dash for life she remembered nothing afterward save the overmastering sense of peril . She knew that the roan was pounding forward with the best speed in him , and presently she knew too that no speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew louder as it swept upon her . With a cry of terror she dragged the pony to its haunches , slipped from the saddle , and attempted to climb the rock face . Catching hold of outcropping ledges , mesquit , and even cactus bushes , she went up like a mountain goat But the water swept upon her , waist high , and dragged at her . She clung to a quartz knob her fingers had found , but her feet were swept from her by the suction of the torrent . Her hold relaxed , and she slid back into the river . Like a flash of light a rope descended over her outstretched arms , tightened at her waist , and held her taut . She felt the pain of a tremendous tug that seemed to tear her in two . Dimly her brain reported that somebody was shouting . A long time afterward , as it seemed to her then , a strong arm went round her . Inch by inch she was dragged from the water that fought and wrestled for her . Phyllis knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then her perceptions blurred . " I 'll never make it this way , " he told himself aloud , half way up . In fact , he had come to an impasse . Even without the burden of her weight , the sheer smooth wall rose insurmountable above him . He did the one thing left for him to do . Leaving her unconscious body in a sort of trough formed by the juncture of two strata , he lowered himself into the rushing stream , searched with his foot for a grip , and swung to the left into the niche formed by a mesquit bush growing from the rock . From here , after stiff climbing , he reached the top . He found , as he had expected , his cow pony with feet braced to keep the rope taut . Old Baldy was practising the lesson learned from scores of roped steers . No man in the Malpais country was stronger than this one . In another minute he had drawn up the girl and laid her on the grass . Soon she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Weaver , " she breathed in faint surprise . " Where am I ? " But her glances were already answering the question . They took in the rope under her arms , followed it to the horn of the saddle , around which the other end was tied , and came back to the leathery weather-beaten face that looked down into hers . " You have saved my life . " " Not me . Old Baldy did it . I never could have got you out alone . When I roped you , he backed off same as if you had been a steer , and pulled for all there was in him . Between us we got you up . " " Good old Baldy ! " She let it go at that for the moment , while she thought it out . " If you had n't been right here --  --  " She finished her sentence with a shudder . She could not guess how that thought stabbed him , for he replied cheerfully : " I heard you call , and Baldy brought me on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was badly shaken and could not quite control herself . " It was awful -- awful . " And short staccato sobs shook her . Buck put his arm around her shoulders , and soothed her gently . " Do n't you care , Phyllis . It 's all past now . Forget it , little girl . " " It was like some tremendous wild beast -- a thousand times stronger and crueller than a grizzly . It leaped at me , and --  -- Oh , if you had n't been here ! " She caught at his sleeve and clung to it with both hands . " If a fellow sticks around long enough he is sure to come in handy , " Buck told her lightly . She did not answer , but presently she walked across a little unsteadily and put her arms around the neck of the white-faced broncho . Her face she buried in its mane . Weaver knew she was crying softly , and he wisely left her alone while he recoiled the rope . Presently she recovered her composure and began to pat the white silken nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , Baldy . Even he could n't have done it without you . How can I ever pay you for it ? " Weaver had an inspiration . " He 's yours from this moment . You can pay him by taking him for your saddle horse . Baldy will never ride the round-up again . We 'll give him a Carnegie medal and retire him on a good-service pension so far as the rough work goes . " Without looking at him , the girl answered softly : " Thank you . I know I 'm taking from you the best cow-pony in Arizona , but I ca n't help it . " " A cow-pony is a cow-pony , but a horse that saves the life of Miss Phyllis Sanderson is a gentleman and a hero . " " And what about the man who saves her life ? " Her voice was very small and weepy . " Tickled to death to have the chance . We 'll forget that . " Still she did not look at him . " Never ! Never as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him that if he was ever going to put his fortune to the test now was the time . He strode across and swung her round till she faced him . " As long as you live , Phyllis . And you 're only eighteen . Me , I 'm thirty-seven . I lack just a year of being twice as old . What about it ? Am I too old and too hard and tough for you , little girl ? " " I -- don't -- understand . " " Yes , you do . I 'm asking you to marry me . Will you ? " " Oh , Mr. Weaver ! " she gasped . " I ought to wrap it up pretty , ought n't I ? But there 's nothing pretty about me . No woman should marry me if she can help it , not unless her heart brings her to me in spite of herself . Is it that way with you ? " Never before had she met a man like him , so masterful and virile . He took short cuts as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She read in him a passion clamped by a will of iron , and there thrilled through her a fierce delight in her power over this splendid type of the male lover . She lived in a world of men , lean , wide-shouldered fellows , who moved and had their being in conditions that made hickory withes of them physically , hard close-mouthed citizens mentally . But even by the frontier tests of efficiency , of gameness , of going the limit , Weaver stood head and shoulders above his neighbors . She had lifted her gaze to meet his , quite sure that her answer was not in doubt , but now her heart was beating like a triphammer . She felt herself drifting from her moorings . It was as though she were drowning forty fathoms deep in those calm , unwinking eyes of his . " I do n't think so , " she cried desperately . " You 've got to be sure . I do n't want you else . " " Yes -- yes ! " she cried eagerly . " Do n't rush me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't be any too sure to suit me . " " I -- I do n't think it will be yes , " she told him shyly . " I 'm betting it will , " he said confidently . " And now , little girl , it 's time we started . You 'll ride your Carnegie horse and I 'll walk . " Her eyes dilated , for this brought to her mind something she had forgotten . " My roan ! What do you think has become of it ? " He shook his head , preferring not to guess aloud . As he helped her to the saddle his eyes fell on a stain of red running from the wrist of her gauntlet . " You 've hurt your hand , " he cried . " It must have been when I caught at the cactus . " Gently he slipped off the glove . Cruel thorns had torn the skin in a dozen places . He drew the little spikes out one by one . Phyllis winced , but did not cry out . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly round the wounds and drew on the gauntlet again . It had been only a small service , nothing at all compared to the great one he had just rendered , but somehow it had tightened his hold on her . She wondered whether she would have to marry Buck Weaver no matter what she really wanted to do . With her left hand she guided Baldy , while Buck strode beside , never wavering from the easy , powerful stride that was the expression of his sinuous strength . " Were you ever tired in your life ? " she asked once , with a little sigh of fatigue . He stopped in his stride , full of self-reproach . " Now , ai n't that like me ! Pluggin ' ahead , and never thinking about how played out you are . We 'll rest here under these cottonwoods . " He lifted her down , for she was already very stiff and sore from her adventure . An outdoor life had given her a supple strength and a wiry endurance , of which her slender frame furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her . To Buck she looked pathetically wan and exhausted . He put her down under a tree and arranged her saddle for a pillow . Again the girl felt a net was being wound round her , that she belonged to him and could not escape . Nor was she sure that she wanted to get away from his possessive energy . In the pleasant sun glow she fell asleep , without any intention of doing so . Two hours later she opened her eyes . Looking round , she saw Weaver lying flat on his back fifty yards away . " I 've been asleep , " she called . He leaped to his feet and walked across the sand to her . " I suspected it , " he said with a smile . " I feel like a new woman now . " " Like one of them suffragettes ? " " That is n't quite what I meant , " she smiled . " I 'm ready to start . " Half an hour later they reached her home . It was close to supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you next week , " he said quietly , and turned his horse toward the Twin Star ranch . CHAPTER XVII THE HOLD-UP From the wash where the sink of the Mimbres edges close to Noches two riders emerged in mid-afternoon of a day that shimmered under the heat of a blazing sun . They travelled in silence , the core of an alkali dust cloud that moved with them and lay thick upon them . Well down over their eyes were drawn the broad-rimmed hats . One of them wore sun goggles and both of them had their lower faces covered by silk bandannas as if to keep out the thick dust their ponies stirred . For the rest their costumes were the undistinguished chaps , spurs , shirt , neckerchiefs , and gauntlets of the range . With one distinction , however : these were better armed than the average cow-puncher jaunting to town for the quarterly spree . Revolver butts peeped from the holsters of their loosely hung cartridge belts . Moreover , their rifles were not strapped beneath the stirrup leathers , but were carried across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall announced three o'clock as they reached the First National Bank at the corner of San Miguel and Main Streets . Here one of the riders swung from the saddle , handed the reins and his rifle to the other man , and jingled into the bank . His companion took the horses round to the side entrance of the building , and waited there in such shade as two live oaks offered . He had scarce drawn rein when two other riders joined him , having come from a direction at right angles to that followed by him . One of them rode an iron-gray , the other a roan with white stockings . Both of these dismounted , and one of them passed through the side door into the bank . Almost instantly he reappeared and nodded to his comrade , who joined him with his own rifle and that of the first man that had gone in . There was an odd similarity in arms , manner , and dress between these and the first arrivals . Once inside the building , each of them slipped a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and closed and locked it , while the other simultaneously covered the teller with a revolver . The cashier , busy in conversation with the first horseman about a loan the other had said he wanted , was sitting with his back to the cage of the teller . The first warning he had of anything unusual was the closing of the door by a masked man . One glance was enough to tell him the bank was about to be robbed . His hand moved swiftly toward the drawer in his desk which contained a weapon , but stopped halfway to its destination . For he was looking squarely into the rim of a six-shooter less than a foot from his forehead . The gun was in the hands of the client with whom he had been talking . " Do n't do that , " the man advised him brusquely . Then , more sharply : " Reach for the roof . No monkeying . " Benson , the cashier , was no coward , but neither was he a fool . He knew when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even while he obeyed , his eyes were carrying to his brain a classification of this man for future identification . The bandit was a stranger to him , a heavy-set , bandy-legged fellow of about forty-five , with a leathery face and eyes as stony as those of a snake . " What do you want ? " the bank officer asked quietly . " Your gold and notes . Is the safe open ? " Before the cashier could reply a shot rang out . The unmasked outlaw slewed his head , to see the president of the bank firing from the door of his private office . The other two robbers were already pumping lead at him . He staggered , clutched at the door jamb , and slowly sank to the floor after the revolver had dropped from his hand . Benson seized the opportunity to duck behind his desk and drag open a drawer , but before his fingers had closed on the weapon within , two crashing blows descended with stunning force on his head . The outlaw covering him had reversed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 'll hold him for a while , " the bandit remarked , and dragged the unconscious man across the floor to where the president lay huddled . One of the masked men , a lithe , sinuous fellow with a polka-dot bandanna round his neck , took command . " Keep these men covered , Irwin , while we get the loot , " he ordered the unmasked man . With that he and the boyish-looking fellow who had ridden into town with him , the latter carrying three empty sacks , followed the trembling teller to the vault . No sound broke the dead silence except the loud ticking of the bank clock and an occasional groan from the cashier , who was just beginning to return to consciousness . Twice the man left on guard called down to those in the vault to hurry . There was need of haste . Somebody , attracted by the sound of firing , had come running to the bank , peered in the big front window , and gone flying to spread the alarm . Outside a shot and then another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left on guard ran to the door and looked out . An upper window down the street was open , and from it a man with a rifle was firing at the outlaw left in charge of the horses . The wrangler had taken refuge behind a bulwark of horseflesh , and was returning the fire . " Hurry the boys , Brad ! Hell 's broke loose ! " he called to his companion . The town was alarmed and buzzing like a hornet 's nest . Soon they would feel the sting of the swarm unless they beat an immediate retreat . One sweep of his eyes told the bandy-legged fellow as much . He could hear voices crying the alarm , could see men running to and fro farther down the street . Even in the second he stood there a revolver began potting at him . " Back in a moment , " he cried to the wrangler , and disappeared within to shout an urgent warning to the looters . Three men came up from the vault , each carrying a sack . The teller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A scattering fire began to converge at once upon them . The roan with the white stockings showed a red ridge across its flank where a bullet had furrowed a path . The teller dropped , wounded by his friends . Two of the robbers loaded the horses , while the others answered the townsmen . In the inevitable delay of getting started , every moment seemed an hour to the harassed outlaws . But at last they were in the saddle and galloping down the street , firing right and left as they went . At the next street crossing two men , one fat and the other lean , came running , revolvers in hands , to intercept them . They were too late . Before they reached the corner the outlaws had galloped past in a cloud of white dust , still flinging bullets at the invisible they were escaping . The big lean cow-puncher stopped with an oath as the riders disappeared . " Nothing doing , Budd , " he called to the fat man . " The show 's moved on to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perspiration , nodded the answer he could not speak . Presently he got out what he wanted to say . " Notice that leading hawss on the nigh side , Slim ? " he asked . " So you noticed it , too , Jim . I could swear to that roan with the four stockings . It 's the hawss Mr. Larrabie Keller mavericks around on , durn his forsaken hide ! And the man on it wore a polka-dot bandanna . So does Keller . He 'll have to go some to explain away that . I reckon the others must be nesters from Bear Creek , too . " " We 've got ' em where the wool 's short this time , " Budd agreed . " They been shootin ' around right promiscuous . If anybody 's dead , then Keller has put a rope round his own neck . " Men were already saddling and mounting for the first unorganized pursuit . Slim and his friend joined these , and cantered down the dusty street scarce ten minutes after the robbers . The suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the fall and rise of the foothills that merged to the left in the wide , flat , shimmering plain of the Malpais , and on the other side in the saw-toothed range that notched the horizon from north to south . Somewhere in that waste of cow-backed hills , in that swell of endless land waves , the trail of the robbers vanished . Men rode far and wide , carrying the pursuit late into the night , but the lost trail was not to be picked up again . So one by one , or in pairs , under the yellow stars , they drifted back to Noches , leaving behind the black depths of blue-canopied hills that had swallowed the fleeing quartette . CHAPTER XVIII BRILL HEALY AIRS HIS SENTIMENTS To Phyllis , riding from school near the close of a hot Friday afternoon along the old Fort Lincoln Trail , came the voice of Brill Healy from the ridge above . She waved to him the broad-brimmed hat she was carrying in her hand , and he guided his pony deftly down the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at Three Pines , " he explained . " Awful glad I met you . " " Where were you going now ? " she asked . " Home , I reckon ; but I 'll ride with you to Seven Mile if you do n't mind . " She looked at her watch . " It 's just five-thirty . We 'll be in time for supper , and you can ride home afterward . " " I guess you know that will suit me , Phyllis , " he answered , with a meaning look from his dark eyes . " Supper suits most healthy men so far as I 've noticed , " she said carelessly , her glance sweeping keenly over him before it passed to the purple shadowings that already edged the mouth of a distant canon . " I 'll bet it does when they can sit opposite Phyl Sanderson to eat it . " She frowned a little , the while he took her in out of half-shut , smoldering eyes , as one does a picture in a gallery . In truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture more vital and more suggestive of the land that had cradled and reared her . His gaze annoyed her , without her quite knowing why . " I wish you would n't look at me all the time , " she told him with the boyish directness that still occasionally lent a tang to her speech . " And if I ca n't help it ? " he laughed . " Fiddlesticks ! You do n't have to say pretty things to me , Brill Healy , " she told him . " I do n't say them because I have to . " " Then I wish you would n't say them at all . There 's no sense in it when you 've known a girl eighteen years . " " Known and loved her eighteen years . It 's a long time , Phyl . " Her eyes rained light derision on him . " It would be if it were true . But then one has to forget truth when one is sentimental , I reckon . " " I 'm not sentimental . I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Brill . With yourself . I 've known that a long time , but not quite eighteen years , " she mocked . " With you , " he made answer , and something of sullenness had by this time crept into his voice . " I 've got as much right to love you as any one else , have n't I ? As much right as that durned waddy , Keller ? " Fire flashed in her eyes . " If you want to know , I despise you when you talk that way . " The anger grew in him . " What way ? When I say anything against the rustler , do you mean ? Think I 'm blind ? Think I ca n't see how you 're running after him , and making a fool of yourself about him ? " " How dare you talk that way to me ? " she flamed , and gave her surprised pony a sharp stroke with the quirt . Five minutes later the bronchos fell again to a walk , and Healy took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying out like that , Phyl . I only say what any one can see . Take a look at the facts . You meet up with him making his getaway after he 's all but caught rustling . Now , what do you do ? " " I do n't believe he was rustling at all . " " Course you do n't believe it . That proves just what I was saying . " " Jim does n't believe it , either . " " Yeager 's opinion do n't have any weight with me . I want to tell you right now that the boys are getting mighty leary of Jim . He 's getting too thick with that Bear Creek bunch . " " Brill Healy , I never saw anybody so bigoted and pig-headed as you are , " the girl spoke out angrily . " Any one with eyes in his head could see that Jim is as straight as a string . He could n't be crooked if he tried . Long as you 've known him I should think you would n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so , " he growled sullenly . " Everybody says so . Jim Yeager of all men , " she scoffed . Then , with a flash of angry eyes at him , " How would you like it if your friends rounded on you ? By all accounts , you 're not quite a plaster saint . I 've heard stories . " " What about ? " " Oh , gambling and drinking . What of it ? That 's your business . One does n't have to believe all the talk that is flying around . " She spoke with a kind of fine scorn , for she was a girl of large generosities . " We 've all got enemies , I reckon , " he said sulkily . " You 're Phil 's friend , and mine , too , of course . I dare say you have your faults like other men , but I do n't have to listen to people while they try to poison my mind against you . What 's more , I do n't . " She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defensive , but now Healy brought the question back to his original point . " That 's all very well , Phyl , but we were n't talking about me , but about you . When you found this Keller making his escape you buckled in and helped him . You tied up his wound and took him to Yeager 's and lied for him to us . That 's bad enough , but later you did a heap worse . " " In saving him from being lynched by you ? " " Before that you made a fuss about him and had to tie up his wounds . I had a cut on my cheek , but I notice you did n't tie it up ! " " I 'm surprised at you , Brill . I did n't think you were so small ; and just because I did n't let a wounded man suffer . " " You can put it that way if you want to , " he laughed unpleasantly . Her passion flared again . " You and your insinuations ! Who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were my father . If you 've got to reform somebody , let it be yourself . " " I 'm the man that is going to be your husband , " he said evenly . " That gives me a right . " " Never ! Do n't think it , " she flung back . " I 'd not marry you if you were the last man on earth . " " You 'll see . I 'll not let a scoundrel like Keller come between us . No , nor Yeager , either . Nor Buck Weaver himself . I notice he was right attentive before he went home . " Resentment burned angrily on her cheek . " Anybody else ? " she asked quietly . " That 's all for just now . You 're a natural-born flirt , Phyllis . That 's what 's the matter with you . " " Thank you , Mr. Healy . You 're the only one of my friends that has been so honest with me , " she assured him sweetly . " I 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't think I 'll let Keller butt in . Not on your life . " Her rage broke bounds . " I never in my life heard of anything so insolent . Never ! You 'll not let me do this or that . Who are you , Brill Healy ? " " I 've told you . I 'm the man that means to marry you , " he persisted doggedly . " You never will . I 'm not thinking of marrying , but when I do I 'll not ask for your indorsement . Be sure of that . " " I 'll not stand it ! He 'd better look out ! " " Who do you mean ? " " Keller , that 's who I mean . This thing is hanging over his head yet . He 's got to come through with proofs he ai n't a rustler , or he 's got to pull his freight out of the Malpais country . " " And if he wo n't ? " " We 'll finish that little business you interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feelings . " You would n't , Brill ! Not when there is a doubt about it . Jim says he is innocent , and I believe he is . Surely you would n't ! " " You 'll see . " " If you do I 'll never speak to you again ! Never , as long as I live ; and I 'll never rest till I have you in the penitentiary for his murder ! " she cried tensely . " And yet you do n't care anything about him . You 've just been kind to him out of charity , " he mocked . For some minutes they had seen Seven Mile Ranch lying below them in the faint twilight . They rode the rest of the way in silence , each of them too bitter for speech . When they reached the house , she swung from the saddle and he kept his seat , for both of them considered her supper invitation and his acceptance cancelled . He bowed ironically and turned to leave . " Just a moment , Brill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of news that will make you sit up . " The speaker was the young mule skinner known as Cuffs . He came running out to the porch and fired his bolt . " The First National Bank at Noches was held up two hours ago , and the robbers got away with their loot after shooting three or four men ! " " Two hours ago , " the girl repeated . " You got it over the phone , of course . " " Yep . Slim called me up just now . He got back right this minute from following their trail . They lost the fellows in the hills . Four of ' em , Slim says , and he thinks they 're headed this way . " " What makes him think so ? " asked Healy . " He figures they are Bear Creek men . One of them was recognized . It was that fellow Keller . " " Keller ! " Phyllis and Healy cried the word together . Cuffs nodded . " Slim says he can swear to his hawss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wants we should organize a posse and nail them as they go into the Pass for Bear Creek . He figures we 'll have time to do it if we jump . Noches is fifty-five miles from here , and about forty from the Pass . " With their bronchs loaded they ca n't make it in much less than five hours . That gives us most three hours to reach the Pass and stop them . What think , Brill ? Can we make it ? " " We 'll try damned hard . I 'm not going to let Mr. Rustler Keller slip through my fingers again ! " Healy cried triumphantly . " I do n't believe it was Bear Creek men at all . I 'm sure it was n't Mr. Keller , " Phyllis cried , with a face like parchment . There was an unholy light of vindictive triumph in Healy 's face . " We 'll show you about that , Miss Missouri . Get the boys together , Cuffs . Call up Purdy and Jim Budd and Tom Dixon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . Start ' em for the Pass just as soon as they get here . I 'm going right up there now . Probably I ca n't stop them , but I may make out who they are . Notify Buck Weaver , so he can head them off if they try to cross the Malpais . And get a move on you . Hustle the boys right along . " And with that he put spurs to his horse and galloped off . CHAPTER XIX THE ROAN WITH THE WHITE STOCKINGS Unerringly rode Healy through the tangled hills toward a saddle in the peaks that flared vivid with crimson and mauve and topaz . A man of moods , he knew more than one before he reached the Pass for which he was headed . Now he rode with his eyes straight ahead , his face creased to a hard smile that brought out its evil lines . Now he shook his clenched fist into the air and cursed . Or again he laughed exultingly . This was when he remembered that his rival was trapped beyond hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened to purple with the coming night he climbed canons , traversed rock ridges , and went down and up rough slopes of shale . Always the trail grew more difficult , for he was getting closer to the divide where Bear Creek heads . He reached the upper regions of the pine gulches that seamed the hills with wooded crevasses , and so came at last to Gregory 's Pass . Here , close to the yellow stars that shed a cold wintry light , he dismounted and hobbled his horse . After which he found a soft spot in the mossy rocks and fell asleep . He was a light sleeper , and two hours later he awakened . Horses were laboring up the Pass . He waited tensely , rifle in both hands , till the heads of the riders showed in the moonlight . Three -- four -- five of them he counted . The men he saw were those he expected , and he lowered his rifle at once . " Hello , Cuffs ! Purdy ! That you , Tom ? Well , you 're too late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep . Did n't get here in time myself to see who any of them were except the last . It was right dark , and they were most through before I reached here . " " But you knew one , " Purdy suggested . Healy looked at him and nodded . " There were four of them . I crept forward on top of that flat rock just as the last showed up . He was ridin ' a hawss with four white stockings . " " A roan , mebbe , " Tom put in quickly . " You 've said it , Tom -- a roan , and it looked to me like it was wounded . There was blood all over the left flank . " " O ' course Keller was riding it , " Purdy ventured . " Rung the bell at the first shot , " Healy answered grimly . " The son of a gun ! " " How long ago was it , Brill ? " asked another . " Must a-been two hours , anyhow . " " No use us following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've gone to cover . " They turned their horses and took the back trail . The cow ponies scrambled down rocky slopes like cats , and up steep inclines with the agility of mountain goats . The men rode in single file , and conversation was limited to disjointed fragments jerked out now and again . After an hour 's rough going they reached the foothills , where they could ride two abreast . As they drew nearer to the ranch country , now one and now another turned off with a shout of farewell . Healy accepted Purdy 's invitation , and dismounted with him at the Fiddleback . Already the first glimmering of dawn flickered faintly from the serrated range . The men unsaddled , watered , fed , and then walked stiffly to the house . Within five minutes both of them lay like logs , dead to the world , until Bess Purdy called them for breakfast , long after the rest of the family had eaten . " What devilment you been leading paw into , Brill ? " demanded Bess promptly when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to three when you got home . " She flung her challenge at the young man with a flash of smiling teeth . Bess was seventeen , a romp , very pretty , and hail-fellow-well-met with every range rider in a radius of thirty miles . " We been looking for a beau for you , Bess , " Healy immediately explained . Miss Purdy tossed her head . " I can find one for myself , Brill Healy , and I do n't have to stay out till three to get him , either . " " Come right to your door , do they ? " he asked , as she helped him to the ham and eggs . " Maybe they do , and maybe they do n't . " " Well , here 's one come right in the middle of the night . Somehow , I jest could n't make out to wait till morning , Bess . " " Oh , you , " she laughed , with a demand for more of this sort of chaffing in her hazel eyes . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After breakfast he stayed and helped her wash the dishes , romping with her the whole time in the midst of gay bursts of laughter and such repartee as occurred to them . He found his young hostess so entertaining that he did not get away until the morning was half gone . By the time he reached Seven Mile the sun was past the meridian , and the stage a lessening patch of dust in the distance . Before he was well out of the saddle , Phyllis Sanderson was standing in the doorway of the store , with a question in her eyes . " Well ? " he forced her to say at last . Leisurely he turned , as if just aware of her presence . " Oh , it 's you . Mornin ' , Phyl . " " What did you find out ? " " I met your friend . " " What friend ? " " Mr. Keller , the rustler and bank robber , " he drawled insolently , looking full in her face . " Tell me at once what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding a roan with four white stockings and a wound on its flank . " She caught at the jamb . " You did n't , Brill ! " " I ce'tainly did , " he jeered . " What -- what did you do ? " Her lips were white as her cheeks . " I have n't done , anything -- yet . You see , I was alone . The other boys had n't arrived then . " " And he was n't alone ? " " No ; he had three friends with him . I could n't make out whether any more of them were college chums of yours . " Without another word , she turned her back on him and went into the store . All night she had lain sleepless and longed for and dreaded the coming of the day . Over the wire from Noches had come at dawn fuller details of the robbery , from her brother Phil , who was spending two or three days in town . It appeared that none of the wounded men would die , though the president had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a fresh one was just starting from Noches . It was generally believed , however , that the bandits would be able to make good their escape with the loot . Her father was absent , making a round of his sheep camps , and would not be back for a week . Hence her hands were very full with the store and the ranch . She busied herself with the details of her work , nodded now and again to one of the riders as they drifted in , smiled and chatted as occasion demanded , but always with that weight upon her heart she could not shake off . Now , and then again , came to her through the window the voices of Public Opinion on the porch . She made out snatches of the talk , and knew the tide was running strongly against the nester . The sound of Healy 's low , masterful voice came insistently . Once , as she looked through the window , she saw a tilted flask at his lips . Suddenly she became aware , without knowing why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and drew her feet swiftly to the door . Conversation had ceased . All eyes were deflected to a pair of riders coming down the Bear Creek trail with that peculiar jog that is neither a run nor a walk . They seemed quite at ease with the world . Speech and laughter rang languid and carefree . But as they swung from the saddles their eyes swept the group before them with the vigilance of searchlights in time of war . Brill Healy leaned forward , his right hand resting lightly on his thigh . " So you 've come back , Mr. Keller , " he said . " As you see . " " But not on that roan of yours , I notice . " " You notice correctly , seh . " " Now I wonder why . " Healy spoke with a drawl , but his eyes glittered menacingly . " I expect you know why , Mr. Healy , " came the quiet retort . " Meaning ? " " That the roan was stolen from the pasture two nights ago . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cattleman laughed harshly , but behind his laughter lay rising anger . " So that 's the story you 're telling , eh ? Sounds most as convincing as that yarn about the pocketknife you picked up . " " I 'm not quite next to your point . Have I got to explain to you why I do or do n't ride a certain horse , seh ? " " It ai n't necessary . We all know why . You ai n't riding it because there is a bullet wound in the roan 's flank that might be some hard to explain . " " I do n't know what you mean . I have n't seen the horse for two days . It was stolen , as I say . Apparently you know a good deal about that roan . I 'd be right pleased to hear what you know , Mr. Healy . " " Glad to death to wise you , Mr. Keller . That roan was in Noches yesterday , and you were on its back . " The nester shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in abruptly : " What have you got up your sleeve , Brill ? Spit it out . " " Glad to oblige you , too , Jim . The First National at Noches was held up yesterday , about half-past three or four , by some masked men . Slim and Jim Budd were around and recognized that roan and its rider . " " You mean --  --  " " You 've guessed it , Jim . I mean that your friend , the rustler , is a bank robber , too . " " Yesterday , you say , at four o'clock ? " " About four , yes . " Yeager 's face cleared . " Then that lets him out . I was with him yesterday all day . " " Any one else with him ? " " No . We were alone . " " Where ? " " Out in the hills . " " Did n't happen to meet a soul all day maybe ? " " No ; what of it ? " Healy barked out again his hard laugh of incredulity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let him out . It 's going to let you in . " Yeager took a step toward him , fists clenched , and eyes flashing . " I 'll not stand for that , Brill . " Healy waved him aside . " I 've got no quarrel with you , Jim . I ai n't making any charges against you to-day . But when it comes to Mr. Keller , that 's different . " His gaze shifted to the nester and carried with it implacable hostility . " I back my play . He 's not only a rustler , he 's a bank robber , too . What 's more , he 'll never leave here alive , except with irons on his wrists ! " " Have you a warrant for my arrest , Mr. Healy ? " inquired Keller evenly . " Do n't need one . Furthermore , I 'd as lief take you in dead as alive . You cay n't hide behind a girl 's skirts this time , " continued Healy . " You 've got to stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a bad outfit . We know you for a rustler , and that 's enough . But it ai n't all . Yesterday you gave us surplusage when you shot up three men in Noches . Right now I serve notice that you 've reached the limit . " " You serve notice , do you ? " " You 're right , I do . " " But not legal notice , Mr. Healy . " At sight of his enemy standing there so easy and undisturbed , facing death so steadily and so alertly , Brill 's passion seethed up and overflowed . Fury filmed his eyes . He saw red . With a jerk , his revolver was out and smoking . A stop watch could scarce have registered the time before Keller 's weapon was answering . But that tenth part of a second made all the difference . For the first heavy bullet from Healy 's .44 had crashed into the shoulder of his foe . The shock of it unsteadied the nester 's aim . When the smoke cleared it showed the Bear Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other hanging limply at his side . At the first sound of exploding revolvers , Phyllis had grown rigid , but the fusillade had not died away before she was flying along the hall to the porch . Brill Healy 's voice , cold and cruel , came to her in even tones : " I reckon I 've done this job right , boys . If he had n't winged me , and if Jim had n't butted in , I 'd a-done it more thorough , though . " Yeager was bending over the man lying on the ground . He looked up now and spoke bitterly : " You 've murdered an innocent man . Ai n't that thorough enough for you ? " Then , catching sight of Cuffs on the porch of the house , Yeager issued orders sharply : " Get on my horse and ride like hell for Doc Brown ! Bob , you and Luke help me carry him into the house . What room , Phyl ? " " My room , Jim . Oh , Cuffs , hurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to make ready the bed for the wounded man . Healy picked up the revolver that had fallen from his hand , and slid it back into the holster . " That 's right , boys . Take him in and let Phyl patch up the coyote if she can . I reckon this time , she 'll have her hands plumb full . Beats all how a decent girl can take up with a ruffian and a scoundrel . " " That will be enough from you , seh , " Yeager told him sharply . Purdy nodded . " Jim 's right , Brill . This man has got what was coming to him . It ai n't proper to jump him right now , when he 's down and out . " " Awful tender-hearted you boys are . Come to that , I 've got a pill in me , too , but of course that do n't matter , " Healy retorted . " If he dies you 'll have another in you , seh , " Yeager told him quietly , meeting his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You take his feet . That 's right . " They carried the nester to the bedroom of Phyllis and laid him down gently on the bed . His eyes opened and he looked about him as if to ask where he was . He seemed to understand what had happened , for presently he smiled faintly at his friend and said : " Beat me to it , Jim . I 'm bust up proper this time . " " He shot without giving warning . " Keller moved his head weakly in dissent . " No , I knew just when he was going to draw , but I had to wait for him . " The big , husky plainsmen undressed him with the tenderness of women , and did their best with the help of Aunt Becky , to take care of his wounds temporarily . After these had been dressed Phyllis and the old colored woman took charge of the nursing and dismissed all the men but Yeager . It would be many hours before Doctor Brown arrived , and it took no critical eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supple strength and gay virility were out of him . Three of the bullets had torn through him . In her heavy heart the girl believed he was going to die . While Yeager was out of the room she knelt down by the bedside , unashamed , and asked for his life as she had never prayed for anything before . By this time his fever was high and he was wandering in his head . The wild look of delirium was in his eyes , and faint weak snatches of irrelevant speech on his lips . His moans stabbed her heart . There was nothing she could do for him but watch and wait and pray . But what little was to be done in the way of keeping his hot head cool with wet towels her own hands did jealously . Jim and Aunt Becky waited on her while she waited on the sick man . About midnight the doctor rode up . All day and most of the night before he had been in the saddle . Cuffs had found him across the divide , nearly forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitten by a rattlesnake . But he brought into the sick room with him that manner of cheerful confidence which radiates hope . You could never have guessed that he was very tired , nor , after the first few minutes , did he know it himself . He lost himself in his case , flinging himself into the breach to turn the tide of what had been a losing battle . CHAPTER XX YEAGER RIDES TO NOCHES Jim Yeager had not watched through the long day and night with Phyllis without discovering how deeply her feelings were engaged . His unobtrusive readiness and his constant hopefulness had been to her a tower of strength during the quiet , dreadful hours before the doctor came . Once , during the night , she had followed him into the dark hall when he went out to get some fresh cold water , and had broken down completely . " Is he -- is he going to die ? " she besought of him , bursting into tears for the first time . Jim patted her shoulder awkwardly . " Now , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull him through . Course he 's shot up a heap , but then a man like him can stand a lot of lead in his body . There are n't any of these wounds in a vital place . Chief trouble is he 's lost so much blood . That 's where his clean outdoor life comes in to help build him up . I 'll bet Doc Brown pulls him through . " " Are you just saying that , Jim , or do you really think so ? " " I 'm saying it , and I think it . There 's a whole lot in gaming a thing out . What we 've got to do is to think he 's going to make it . Once we give up , it will be all off . " " You are such a help , Jim , " she sighed , dabbing at her eyes with her little handkerchief . " And you 're the best man . " " That 's right . I 'll be the best man when we pull off that big wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him with a rush . " You 're the only friend both of us have , " she cried impulsively . With the coming of Doctor Brown , Jim resigned his post of comforter in chief , but he stayed at Seven Mile until the crisis was past and the patient on the mend . Next day Slim , Budd , and Phil Sanderson rode in from Noches . They were caked with the dust of their fifty-mile ride , but after they had washed and eaten , Yeager had a long talk with them . He learned , among other things , that Healy had telephoned Sheriff Gill that Keller was lying wounded at Seven Mile , and that the sheriff was expecting to follow them in a few hours . " Coming to arrest Brill for assault with intent to kill , I reckon , " Yeager suggested dryly . Phil turned on him petulantly . " What 's the use of you trying to get away with that kind of talk , Jim ? This fellow Keller was recognized as one of the robbers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil . He says he recognized the hawss , and thinks it was Keller in the saddle . Now , I do n't think anything about it . I know Keller was with me in the hills when this hold-up took place . " " You 're his friend , Jim , " the boy told him significantly . " You bet I am . But I ai n't a bank robber , if that 's what you mean , Phil . " His clear eyes chiselled into those of the boy and dominated him . " I did n't say you were , " Phil returned sulkily . " But I reckon we all recall that you lied for him once . Whyfor would it be a miracle if you did again ? " Jim might have explained , but did not , that it was not for Keller he had lied . He contented himself with saying that the roan with the white stockings had been stolen from the pasture before the holdup . He happened to know , because he was spending the night in Keller 's shack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drawling sarcasm : " You 've got a plumb perfect alibi figured out for him , Jim . I reckon you 've forgot that Brill saw him riding through the Pass with the rest of his outfit . " " Brill says so . I say he did n't , " returned Yeager calmly . Toward evening Gill arrived and formally put Keller under arrest . Practically , it amounted only to the precaution of leaving a deputy at the ranch as a watch , for one glance had told the sheriff that the wounded man would not be in condition to travel for some time . It was the following day that Yeager saddled and said good-by to Phyllis . " I 'm going to Noches to see if I cay n't find out something . It do n't look reasonable to me that those fellows could disappear , bag and baggage , into a hole and draw it in after them . " " What about Brill 's story that he saw them at the Pass ? " the girl asked . " He may have seen four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My notion is , Brill lied out of whole cloth , but of course I 'm not in a position to prove it . Point is , why did he lie at all ? " Phyllis blushed . " I think I know , Jim . " Yeager smiled . " Oh , I know that . But that ai n't , to my way of thinking , motive enough . I mean that a white man does n't try to hang another just because he -- well , because he cut him out of his girl . " " I never was his girl , " Phyllis protested . " I know that , but Brill could n't get it through his thick head till a stone wall fell on him and give him a hint . " " What other motive are you thinking of , Jim ? " He hesitated . " I 've just been kinder milling things around . Do you happen to know right when you met Brill the day of the robbery ? " " Yes . I looked at my watch to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-thirty . " " And the robbery was at three . The fellows did n't get out of town till close to three-thirty , I reckon , " he mused aloud . " What has that got to do with it ? You do n't mean that --  --  " She stopped with parted lips and eyes dilating . He shook his head . " I 've got no right to mean that , Phyllie . Even if I did have a kind of notion that way I 'd have to give it up . Brill 's got a steel-bound , copper-riveted alibi . He could n't have been at Noches at three o'clock and with you two hours later , fifty-five miles from there . No hawss alive could do it . " " But , Jim -- why , it 's absurd , anyway . We 've known Brill always . He could n't be that kind of a man . How could he ? " " I did n't say he could , " returned her friend noncommittally . " But when it comes to knowing him , what do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low-lived coyote without you knowing it . I might be all kinds of a devil . A good girl like you would n't know it if I set out to keep it still . " " I could tell by looking at you , " she answered promptly . " Yes , you could , " he derided good-naturedly . " How would you know it ? Men do n't squeal on each other . " " Do you mean that Brill isn't -- what we 've always thought him ? " " I 'm not talking about Brill , but about Jim Yeager , " he evaded . " He 'd hate to have you know everything that 's mean and off color he ever did . " " I believe you must have robbed the bank yourself , Jim , " she laughed . " Are you a rustler , too ? " He echoed her laugh as he swung to the saddle . " I 'm not giving myself away any more to-day . " Brill Healy rode up , his arm in a sling . Deep rings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked first at Yeager and then at the young woman , with an ugly sneer . " How 's your dear patient , Phyl ? " " He is better , Brill , " she answered quietly , with her eyes full on him . " That is , we hope he is better . The doctor is n't quite sure yet . " " Some of us do n't hope it as much as the rest of us , I reckon . " She said nothing , but he read in her look a contempt that stung like the lash of a whip . " He 'll be worse again before I 'm through with him , " the man cried , with a furious oath . Phyllis measured him with her disdainful eye , and dismissed him . She stepped forward and shook hands with Yeager . " Take care of yourself , Jim , and do n't spare any expense that is necessary , " she said . For a moment she watched her friend canter off , then turned on her heel , and passed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , for he had unsaddled and let his horse rest at Willow Springs during the heat of the broiling day . After he had washed and had eaten , Yeager drifted to the Log Cabin Saloon and gambling house . Here was gathered the varied and turbulent life of the border country . Dark-skinned Mexicans rubbed shoulders with range riders baked almost as brown by the relentless sun . Pima Indians and Chinamen and negroes crowded round the faro and dice tables . Games of monte and chuckaluck had their devotees , as had also roulette and poker . It was a picturesque scene of strong , untamed , self-reliant frontiersmen . Some of them were outlaws and criminals , and some were as simple and tender-hearted as children . But all had become accustomed to a life where it is possible at any moment to be confronted with sudden death . A man playing the wheel dropped a friendly nod at Jim . He waited till the wheel had stopped and saw the man behind it rake in his chips before he spoke . Then , as he scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed Yeager with a whoop . " Hi there , Malpais ! What 's doing in the hills these yere pleasant days ? " " A little o ' nothin ' , Sam . The way they 're telling it you been having all the fun down here . " Sam Wilcox gathered the chips pushed toward him by the croupier and cashed in . He was a heavy-set , bronzed man , with a bleached , straw-colored mustache . Taking his friend by the arm , he led him to one end of the bar that happened for the moment to be deserted . " Have something , Jim . Oh , I forgot . You 're ridin ' the water wagon and do n't irrigate . More'n I can say for some of you Malpais lads . Some of them was in here right woozy the other day . " " The boys will act the fool when they hit town . Who was it ? " " Slim and Budd and young Sanderson . " " Was Phil Sanderson drunk ? " Yeager asked , hardly surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but he was makin ' the fur fly at the wheel , there . Must have dropped two hundred dollars . " Jim 's brows knit in a puzzled frown . He was wondering how the boy had come by so much money at a time . " Who was he trailin ' with ? " " With a lad called Spiker , that fair-haired guy sitting in at the poker table . He 's another youngster that has been dropping money right plentiful . " " Who is he ? " " He 's what they call a showfer . He runs one o ' these automobiles ; takes parties out in it . " " Been here long ? Looks kind o ' like a tinhorn gambler . " " Not long . He 's thick with some of you Malpais gents . I 've seen him with Healy a few . " " Oh , with Healy . " Jim regarded the sportive youth more attentively , and presently dropped into a vacant seat beside him , buying twenty dollars worth of chips . Spiker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a brilliant game . Jim , playing very conservatively , and just about holding his own , listened to the angry bursts and the boastings of the man next him , and drew his own conclusions as to his character . After a couple of hours of play the Malpais man cashed in and went back to the hotel where he was putting up . He slept till late , ate breakfast leisurely , and after an hour of looking over the paper and gossiping with the hotel clerk about the holdup he called casually upon the deputy sheriff . Only one thing of importance he gleaned from him . This was that the roan with the white stockings had been picked up seven miles from Noches the morning after the holdup . This put a crimp in Healy 's story of having seen Keller in the Pass on the animal . Furthermore , it opened a new field for surmise . Brill Healy said that he had seen the horse with a wound in its flank . Now , how did he know it was wounded , since Slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed that if he had not seen the broncho -- and that he had seen it was a sheer physical impossibility -- he could know of the wound only because he was already in close touch with what had happened at Noches . But how could he be aware of what was happening fifty miles away ? That was the sticker Jim could not get around . His alibi was just as good as that of the horse . Both of them rested on the assumption that neither could cover the ground between two given points in a given time . There was one other possible explanation -- that Healy had been in telephonic communication with Noches before he met Phyllis . But this seemed to Jim very unlikely , indeed . By his own story he had been cutting trail all afternoon and had seen nobody until he met Phyllis . Yeager called on the cashier , Benson , later in the day , and had a talk with him and with the president , Johnson . Both of these were now back at their posts , though the latter was not attempting much work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had theories , but none of them had any new facts to advance . The young cattleman put up at the same hotel as Spiker and struck up a sort of intimacy with him . They sometimes loafed together during the day , and at night they were always to be seen side by side at the poker table . CHAPTER XXI BREAKING DOWN AN ALIBI Keller found convalescence under the superintendence of Miss Sanderson one of the great pleasures of his life . Her school was out for the summer and she was now at home all day . He had never before found time to be lazy , and what dreaming he had done had been in the stress of action . Now he might lie the livelong day and not too obviously watch her brave , frank youth as she moved before him or sat reading . For the first time in his life he was in love ! But as the nester grew better he perceived that she was withdrawing herself from him . He puzzled over the reason , not knowing that her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown out bitterly because his boyish concern for her good name could find no gentler way to express itself . " They 're saying you 're in love with the fellow -- and him headed straight for the pen , " he charged . " Who says it , Phil ? " she asked quietly , but with flaming cheeks . He smote his fist on the table . " It do n't matter who says it . You keep away from him . Let Aunt Becky nurse him . You have n't any call to wait on him , anyhow . If he 's got to be nursed by one of the family , I 'll do it . " He tried to keep his word , and as a result of it the wounded man had to endure his sulky presence occasionally . Keller was man of the world enough to be amused at his attitude , and yet was interested enough in the lad 's opinion of him to keep always an even mood of cheerful friendliness . There was a quantity of winsome camaraderie about him that won its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boy in him responded to the nester 's gameness , the praises of which he heard on all sides . " I see you have quite made up your mind I 'm a skunk , " the wounded man told him amiably . " You robbed the bank at Noches and shot up three men that had n't hurt you any , " the boy retorted defiantly . " Not unless Jim Yeager is a liar . " " Oh , Jim ! No use going into that . He 's your friend . I do n't know why , but he is . " " And you 're Brill Healy 's . That 's why you wo n't tell that he was carrying your sister 's knife the day I saw you and him first . " The boy flashed toward the bed startled eyes . Keller was looking at him very steadily . " Who says he had Phyl 's knife ? " " Had n't he ? " " What difference does that make , anyhow ? I hear you 're telling that you found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any proof , have you ? " challenged young Sanderson angrily . " No proof , " admitted the other . " Well , then . " Phil chewed on it for a moment before he broke out again : " I reckon you cay n't talk away the facts , Mr. Keller . We caught you in the act -- caught you good . By your own story , you 're the man we came on . What 's the use of you trying to lay it on me and Brill ? " " Am I trying to lay it on you ? " " Looks like . On Brill , anyhow . There 's nothing doing . Folks in this neck of the woods is for him and against you . Might as well sabe that right now , " the lad blurted . " I sabe that some of them are , " the other laughed , but not with quite his usual debonair gayety . For he did not at all like the way things looked . But though Phil had undertaken to do all the nursing that needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of an outdoors dweller to confine himself for long to the four walls of a room . Besides , he was often called away by the work of looking after the cattle of the ranch . Moreover , both he and his father were away a good deal arranging for the disposal of their sheep . At these times her patient hoped , and hoped in vain , that Phyllis would take her brother 's place . Came a day when Keller could stand it no longer . In Becky 's absence , he made shift to dress himself , bit by bit , lying on the bed in complete exhaustion after the effort of getting into each garment . He could scarce finish what he had undertaken , but at last he was clothed and ready for the journey . Leaning on a walking stick , he dragged himself into the passage and out to the porch , where Phyllis was sitting alone . She gave a startled cry at sight of him standing there , haggard and white , his clothes hanging on his gaunt frame much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " she cried , running to his aid . After she had got him into her chair , he smiled up at her and panted weakly . He was leaning back in almost complete exhaustion . " You would n't come to see me , so -- I came -- to see you , " he gasped out , at last . " But -- you should n't have ! You might have done yourself a great injury . It's -- it 's criminal of you . " " I wanted to see you , " he explained simply . " Why did n't you send for me ? " " There was n't anybody to send . Besides , you would n't have stayed . You never do , now . " She looked at him , then looked away . " You do n't need me now -- and I have my work to do . " " But I do need you , Phyllie . " It was the first time he had ever spoken the diminutive to her . He let out the word lingeringly , as if it were a caress . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She changed the subject abruptly . " None of the boys are here . How am I to get you back to your room ? " " I 'll roll a trail back there presently , ma'am . " She looked helplessly round the landscape , in hope of seeing some rider coming to the store . But nobody was in sight . " You had no business to come . It might have killed you . I thought you had better sense , " she reproached . " I wanted to see you , " he parroted again . Like most young women , she knew how to ignore a good deal . " You 'll have to lean on me . Do you think you can try it now ? " " If I go , will you stay with me and talk ? " he bargained . " I have my work to do , " she frowned . " Then I 'll stay here , thank you kindly . " He settled back into the chair and let her have his gay smile . Nevertheless , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll stay , " she conceded , moved by her anxiety . " Every day ? " " We 'll see . " " All right , " he laughed weakly . " If you do n't come , I 'll take a pasear and go look for you . " She helped him to his feet and they stood for a moment facing each other . " You must put your hand on my shoulder and lean hard on me , " she told him . But when she saw the utter weakness of him , her arm slipped round his waist and steadied him . " Now then . Not too fast , " she ordered gently . They went back very slowly , his weight leaning on her more at every step . When they reached his room , Keller sank down on the bed , utterly exhausted . Phyllis ran for a cordial and put it to his lips . It was some time before he could even speak . " Thank you . I ai n't right husky yet , " he admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she charged him . " Not ever ? " " Not till the doctor says you 're strong enough to move . " " I won't -- if you 'll come and see me every day , " he answered irrepressibly . So every afternoon she brought a book or her sewing , and sat by him , letting Phil storm about it as much as he liked . These were happy hours . Neither spoke of love , but the air was electrically full of it . They laughed together a good deal at remarks not intrinsically humorous , and again there were conversational gaps so highly charged that she would rush at them as a reckless hunter takes a fence . As he got better , he would be propped up in bed , and Aunt Becky would bring in tea for them both . If there had been any corner of his heart unwon it would have surrendered then . For to a bachelor the acme of bliss is to sit opposite a girl of whom he is very fond , and to see her buttering his bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intimacy of which he has dreamed . Keller had played a lone hand all his turbulent life , and this was like a glimpse of Heaven let down to earth for his especial benefit . It was on such an occasion that Jim Yeager dropped in on them upon his return from Noches . He let his eyes travel humorously over the room before he spoke . " Why for do n't I ever have the luck to be shot up ? " he drawled . " Oh , you Jim ! " Keller called a greeting from the bed . Phyllis came forward , and , with a heightened color , shook hands with him . " You 'll sit down with us and have some tea , Jim , " she told him . " Me ? I 'm no society Willie . Do n't know the game at all , Phyl . Besides , I 'm carrying half of Arizona on my clothes . It 's some dusty down in the Malpais . " Nevertheless he sat down , and , over the biscuits and jam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The finding of the stocking-footed roan near Noches so soon after the robbery disposed of Healy 's lie , though it did not prove that Keller had not been riding it at the time of the holdup . As for Healy , Yeager confessed he saw no way of implicating him . His alibi was just as good as that of any of them . But there was one person his story did involve , and that was Spiker , the tinhorn , tenderfoot sport of Noches . During the absence of this young man at the gaming table , Jim and his friend , Sam Weaver , had got into his room with a skeleton key and searched it thoroughly . They had found , in a suit case , a black mask , a pair of torn and shiny chaps , a gray shirt , a white , dusty sombrero , much the worse for wear , and over three hundred dollars in bills . " What does he pretend his business is ? " Keller asked , when Jim had finished . " Allows he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the theory , but I notice he turned down a mining man who wanted to get him to run him into the hills on Monday . Said he had n't time . The showfer biz is a bluff , looks like . " The nester made no answer . His eyes , narrowed to slits , were gazing out of the window absently . Presently he came from deep thought to ask Yeager to hand him the map he would find in his inside coat pocket . This he spread out on the bed in front of him . When at last he looked up he was smiling . " I reckon it 's no bluff , Jim . He 's a chauffeur , all right , but he only drives out select outfits . " " Meaning ? " The map lying in front of Keller was one of Noches County . The nester located , with his index finger , the town of that name , and traced the road from it to Seven Mile . Then his finger went back to Noches , and followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost paralleled the one to the ranch . The eyes of Phyllis were already shining with excitement . She divined what was coming . " Is this road still travelled , Jim ? " " It goes out to the old fort . Nobody has lived there for most thirty years . I reckon the road ai n't travelled much . " " Strikes through Del Oro Canon , does n't it , right after it leaves Noches ? " " Yep . " " I reckon , Jim , your friend , Spiker , drove a party out that way the afternoon of the holdup , " the nester drawled smilingly . " By the way , is your friend in the lockup ? " " He sure is . The deputy sheriff arrested him same night we went through his room . " " Good place for him . Well , it looks like we got Mr. Healy tagged at last . I do n't mean that we 've got the proof , but we can prove he might have been on the job . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right thick . " " I see it , " spoke up Phyllis quickly . Keller smiled at her . " You tell him . " " Do n't you see , Jim ? The motor car must have been waiting for them somewhere after they had robbed the bank , " she explained . " At the end of Del Oro Canon , likely , " suggested the nester . She nodded eagerly . " Yes , they would get into the canon before the pursuit was in sight . That is why they were not seen by Slim and the rest of the posse . " Yeager looked at her , and as he looked the certainty of it grew on him . His mind began to piece out the movements of the outlaws from the time they left Noches . " That 's right , Phyl . His car is what he calls a hummer . It can go like blazes -- forty miles an hour , he told me . And the old fort road is a dandy , too . " " They would leave the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she hazarded . " All but Brill . Being bridlewise , he rode right for Seven Mile to make dead sure of his alibi , whilst the others made their getaway with the loot . When he happened to meet you on the way , he would be plumb tickled , for that cinched things proper for him . You would be a witness nobody could get away from . " " And what about their hawsses ? Did they bring the bronchs in the car , too ? " drawled Keller , an amused flicker in his eyes . The others , who had been swimming into their deductions so confidently , were brought up abruptly . Phyllis glanced at Jim and looked foolish . " The bronchs could n't tag along behind at a forty per clip . That 's right , " admitted Yeager blankly . " I had n't thought about that . And they had to have their horses with them to get from Willow Creek to the Pass . That spoils everything , " the girl agreed . Then , seeing her lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had found a way round the difficulty . " How would this do , partners -- just for a guess : The car was waiting for them at the end of the Del Oro Canon . They dumped their loot into it , then unsaddled and threw all the saddles in , too . They gave the bronchs a good scare , and started them into the hills , knowing they would find their way back home all right in a couple of days . At Willow Creek they found hawsses waiting for them , and Mr. Spiker hit the back trail for Noches , with his car , and slid into town while everybody was busy about the robbery . " " Sure . That would be the way of it , " his friend nodded . " All we got to do now is to get Spiker to squeal . " " If he happens to be a quitter . " " He will -- under pressure . He 's that kind . " A knock came on the door , and Tom Benwell , the store clerk , answered her summons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyl . He came to see about getting-that stuff you was going to order for a dress for his little girl , " the storekeeper explained . Phyllis rose and followed the man back to the store . When she had gone , Jim stepped to the door and shut it . Returning , he sat down beside the bed . " Larry , I did n't tell all I know . That hat in Spiker 's room had the initials P.S. written on the band . What 's more , I knew the hat by a big coffee stain splashed on the crown . It happens I made that stain myself on the round-up once when we were wrastling and I knocked the coffeepot over . " Keller looked at his friend gravely . " It was Phil Sanderson 's hat ? " Yeager nodded assent . " He must have loaned his old hat to Spiker for the holdup . " " You did n't turn the hat over to the sheriff ? " " Not so as you could notice it . I shoved it in my jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This mixes things up a heap . If Phil is in this thing -- and it sure looks that way -- it ties our hands . I 'd like to have a talk with Spiker before we do anything . " " What 's the matter with having a talk with Phil ? Why not shove this thing right home to him ? " The nester shook his head . " Let 's wait a while . We do n't want to drive Healy away yet . If the kid 's in it he would go right to Healy with the whole story . " Yeager swore softly . " It 's all Brill 's fault . He 's been leading Phil into devilment for two years now . " " Yes . " " And all the time been playing himself for the leader of us fellows that are against the rustlers and that Bear Creek outfit , " continued Jim bitterly . " Why , we been talking of electing him sheriff . Durn his forsaken hide , he 's been riding round asking the boys to vote for him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can oppose him , of course . But we have no absolute proof against him yet . We must have proof that nobody can doubt . " " I reckon . And 'll likely have to wait till we 're gray . " " I do n't think so . My guess is that he 's right near the end of his rope . We 're going to make a clean-up soon as I get solid on my feet . " " And Phil ? What if we catch him in the gather , and find him wearing the bad-man brand ? " Keller 's eyes met those of his friend . " There never was a rodeo where some cattle did n't slip through unnoticed , Jim . " CHAPTER XXII SURRENDER The weeks slipped away and brought with them healing to the wounded man at Seven Mile . He moved from the bed where at first he had spent his days to a lounge in the living room , and there , from the bay window , he could look out at the varied life of the cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drag drive , their approach heralded by the bawl of thirsty cattle . Others cantered up and bought tobacco and canned goods . The stage arrived twice a week with its sack of mail , and always when it did Public Opinion gathered upon the porch of the store , as of yore . Phil Sanderson he saw often , Yeager sometimes , and once or twice he caught a glimpse of Healy 's saturnine face . A scarcity of beef and a sharp rise in prices brought the round-up earlier than usual . Every spare man was called upon to help comb the hills for the wild steers that ran the wooded water-sheds , as untamed as the deer and the lynx . Even the storekeeper , Benwell , was pressed into the service . ' Rastus and the nester were the only men about the place , the deputy sheriff having been recalled to Noches on the collapse of Healy 's story . The removal to a distance of the rest of her admirers did not have the effect of throwing Keller alone with Phyllis more often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her , and now he never saw her except in the presence of her other guest . Bess took him in at once , evidencing her approval of him by entering upon a spirited war of repartee with him . She had not been in the house twenty-four hours before she had unbosomed herself of a derisive confidence . " I do n't believe you 're a bank robber , at all ! I do n't believe you are even a rustler ! You 're a false alarm ! " Both Keller and Miss Sanderson smiled at the daring of the girl 's challenge . But the former defended himself with apparent heat . " What makes you think so ? Why should you undermine my reputation with such an assertion ? You ca n't talk that way about me without proving it , Miss Purdy . " " Well , I do n't . You do n't look it . " " I ca n't help that . You ask Mr. Healy . He 'll tell you I am . " " You 'll need a better witness than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were going to like me , " he lamented . " I like a lot of people who are n't ruffians , but of course I ca n't admire you so much as if you were a really truly bad man . " " But if I promise to be one ? " " Oh , anybody can promise , " she flung back , eyes bubbling with laughter . " Wait till I get on my feet again . " A youth galloped up to the house in a cloud of alkali dust . " There 's Cuffs , " announced Phyllis , smiling at Bess . That young woman blushed a little , supposed , aloud , she must go out to see him , and withdrew in seeming reluctance . " He wants Bess to go with him to the Frying Pan dance . He sent a note over from the round-up to ask her . She has n't had a chance yet to tell him that she would , " explained her friend . " How will he take her ? " asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . Why ? " " The surrey will hold four . " She made no pretense of not understanding . Her look met his in a betrayal of the pleasure his invitation gave her . Yet she shook her head . " No , thank you . " " But why -- if I may ask ? " " Ah ! But you may n't , " she smiled . He considered that . " You like to dance . " " Most girls do . " " Then it is because of me , " he soliloquized aloud . " Please , " she begged lightly . " My reputation , I suppose . " She began to roll up the embroidery upon which she was busy . But he got to the door before her . " No , you do n't . " " You are not going to make me tell you why I ca n't go with you , are you ? " " That , to start with . Then I 'm going to make you tell me some other things . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were wide open with surprise , for he had never before taken the masterful line with her . Deep down , she liked it ; but she had no intention of letting him know so . " There are times not to tell , and there are times to tell . This will be one of the last kind , Phyllis . " She tried mockery . " When you throw a big chest like that I suppose you always get what you want . " " You act right funny , girl . I never see you alone any more . We have n't had a good talk for more than a week . Now , why ? " She thought of telling him she had been too busy ; then , moved by an impulse of impatience , met his gaze fully , and told him part of the truth . " I should think you would understand that a girl has to be careful of what she does ! " " You mean about us being friends ? " " Oh , we can be friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you , " she finished . " I can see it , I reckon . You saved my life , and I expect some human cat got his claws out and said it was because you were fond of me . " Then you saved it again by your nursing . No two ways about that . Doc Brown says you and Jim did . I was so sick folks knew it had to be . But now I 'm getting well , you have to show them you 're not interested in me . Is n't that about it ? " " Yes . " " But you do n't have to show me , too , do you ? " " Am I not -- courteous ? " " I ai n't worrying any about your courtesy . But , look here , Phyllie . Have you forgotten what happened in the kitchen that night you helped me to escape ? " She flashed him one look of indignant reproach . " I should think you would be the last person in the world to remind me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it because I 've asked you a question since that ai n't been answered . That week 's been up ten days . " " I 'm not going to answer it now . " And with that she slipped past him and from the room . He ran a hand through his curls and voiced his perplexity . " Now , if a woman ai n't the strangest ever . Just as a fellow is ready to tell her things , she gets mad and hikes . " Nevertheless he smiled , not uncheerfully . What experience he had had with young women told him the signs were not hopeless for his success . He was not sure of her , not by a good deal . He had captured her imagination . But to win a girl 's fancy is not the same as to storm her heart . He often caught himself wondering just where he stood with her . For himself , he knew he was fathoms deep in love . She was in his thoughts when he fell asleep . He awoke in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calamity oppressing him . Something pungent tickled his nostrils . A faint crackling sounded in the air . Swiftly he slipped on such clothes as he needed and stepped into the passage . A heavy smoke was pouring up the back stairway . He knocked insistently upon the door where Phyllis and her guest were sleeping . " What is it ? " a voice demanded . " Get up and dress , Miss Sanderson ! The house is on fire ! You have plenty of time , I think . If there 's any hurry I 'll let you know after I 've looked . " He went down the front stairs and found that the fire was in the back part of the house . Already volumes of smoke with spitting tongues of flame were reaching toward the foot of the stairs . He ran up to the room where the girls were dressing , and called to them : " Are you ready ? " " Yes . " The door opened , to show him two very pale girls , each carrying a bundle of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disarray . Keller went to the clothes closet , emptied it with a sweep and lift of his arm , and returned , to lead the way downstairs . " Take a breath before you start . The smoke 's bad , but there is no real danger , " he told them as he plunged forward . At the foot of the stairs he stopped to see that they were following him closely , then flung open the outer door and let in a rush of cool , sweet air . In another moment they were outside , safe and unhurt . Phyllis drew a long breath before she said : " The house is gone ! " " If there is anything you want particularly from the living room I can get in through the window , " Keller told her . She shuddered . Flame jets were already shooting out here and there . " I would n't let you go back for the world . We did n't get out too soon . " " No , " he agreed . A sniveling voice behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yai n't seen him yet . " Larrabie swung round on ' Rastus like a flash . " What do you mean ? He 's at the round-up , of course . " The little fellow began to bawl : " No , sah . He done come home late last night . Aftah you-all had gone to bed . He 's in his room , tha 's where he is . " Phyllis caught at the arm of Keller to steady her . She was colorless to the lips . " Oh , God ! Oh , God ! " she cried faintly . The nester pushed her gently into the arms of her guest . " Take care of her , Bess . I 'll get Phil . " He ran round the house to the back . The bedroom occupied by young Sanderson was on the first floor . The ranger caught up a stick , smashed the window , and tore out the frame by main strength . Presently he was inside , groping through the dense smoke toward the bed . Flames leaped at him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , his clothes , caught fire before he had discovered that the bed had been used , but was now empty . The door into the hall was open , and through it were pouring billows of smoke . Evidently Phil must have tried to escape that way and been overpowered . The young man caught up a towel and wrapped it around his throat and mouth , then plunged forward into the caldron of the passage . The smoke choked him and the intense heat peeled his face and made the endurance of it an agony . He stumbled over something soft , and discovered with his hands that it was a body . Smothered and choked , half frantic with the heat , he struggled back into the bedroom with his burden . Somehow he reached the window , stumbled through it , and dragged the inanimate body after him . Then , with Phil in his arms , he reeled forward into the fresh air beyond . With a cry Phyllis broke from Bess and ran toward him . But before she had reached the rescuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , too , was unconscious when she knelt beside him and began with her hands to crush out the smoldering fire in his clothes . He opened his eyes and smiled faintly when he saw who it was . " How 's the boy ? " he asked . " He is breathing , " cried Bess joyfully , from where she was bending over Sanderson . " You go attend to him . I 'm all right now . " " Are you truly ? " " Truly . " He proved it by sitting up , and presently by rising and joining with her the group gathered around Phil . For Aunt Becky had now emerged from her cabin and taken charge of affairs . Phil was supported to the bunk house and put to bed by Keller and ' Rastus . It was already plain that he would be none the worse for his adventure after a night 's good sleep . Aunt Becky applied to his case the homely remedies she had used before , while the others stood around the bed and helped as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned at all . In this he had escaped better than Keller , whose hair and eyebrows and skin were all the worse for singeing . The nester noticed that Phyllis , in handing a bowl of water to Bess , used awkwardly her left hand . The right one , he observed , was held with the palm concealed against the folds of her skirt . Presently Phyllis , her anxiety as to Phil relieved , left Aunt Becky and Bess to care for him , while she went out to make arrangements for disposing of the party until morning . The nester followed her into the night and walked beside her toward the house of the foreman . The darkness was lit up luridly by the shooting flames of the burning house . " The store is n't going to catch fire . That 's one good thing , " Keller observed , by way of comfort . " Yes . " There was a catch in her voice , for all the little treasures of her girlhood , gathered from time to time , were going up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " " Well , it might be worse . " She thought of the narrow escape Phil had had , and nodded . " You 'll have to sleep in the bunk house . Take any of the beds you like . Bess and I will put up at the foreman 's , " she explained . As is the custom among bachelors who attend to their own domestic affairs , they found the bed just as the foreman had stepped out of it two weeks before . While Keller held the lantern , Phyllis made it up , and again he saw that she was using her right hand very carefully and flinching when it touched the blankets . Putting the lantern down on the table , he walked up to her . " I 'll make the bed . " She stepped back , with a little laugh . " All right . " He made it , then turned to her at once . " I want to see your hand . " She gave him the left one , even as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it , and kept it . " Now the other . " " What do you want with it ? " " Never mind . " He reached down and drew it from the folds of her skirt , where it had again fallen . Very gently he turned it so that the palm was up . Ugly blisters and a red seam showed where she had burned herself . He looked at her without speaking . " It 's nothing , " she told him , a little hysterically . For an instant her mind flashed back to the time when Buck Weaver had drawn the cactus spines out of that same hand . His voice was rough with feeling . " I can see it is n't . And you got it for me -- putting out the fire in my clothes . I reckon I cay n't thank you , you poor little tortured hand . " He lifted the fingers to his lips and kissed them . " Do n't , " she cried brokenly . " Has it got to be this way always , Phyllie -- you giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so slightly , and a spasm of pain shot across her face . He looked at the burned fingers again tenderly . " Does it hurt pretty bad , girl ? " " I wish it was ten times as bad ! " she broke out , with a sob . " You saved Phil 's life -- at the risk of your own . I wish I could tell you how I feel , what I think of you , how splendid you are . " In default of which ability , she began to cry softly . He wasted no more time . He did not ask her whether he might . With a gesture , his arm went around her and drew her to him . " Let me tell what I think of you , instead , girl o ' mine . I cay n't tell it , either , for that matter , but I reckon I can make out to show you , honey . " " I did n't mean -- that way , " she protested , between laughter and tears . " Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute . Than : " Do you really -- love me ? " she murmured . " What do you think ? " He laughed with the sheer unconquerable boyish delight in her . " I think you 're pretending right well , " she smiled . " If I am making believe . " " If you are . " Her arms slipped round his neck with a swift impulse of love . " But you 're not . Tell me you 're not , Larry . " He told her , in the wordless way lovers have at command , the way that is more convincing than speech . So Phyllis , from the troubled waters of doubt , came at last to safe harborage . CHAPTER XXIII AT THE RODEO There was an exodus from Seven Mile the second day after the fire . Keller went up Bear Creek , Phyllis accepted the invitation of Bess to stay with her at the Fiddleback , and her brother returned to the round-up . The riders were now combing the Lost Creek watershed . Phil knew the camp would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headwaters of the creek . Before he reached the valley the steady bawl of cattle told him that the outfit was camped there . He topped the ridge and looked down upon Cattleland at its busiest . Just below him was the remuda , the ponies grazing slowly toward the hills under the care of three half-grown boys . Beyond were the herded cattle . Here all was activity . Within the fence of riders surrounding the wild creatures the cutting out and the branding were being pushed rapidly forward . Occasionally some leggy steer , tail up and feet pounding , would make a dash to break the cordon . Instantly one of the riders would wheel in chase , head off the animal , and drive it back . Brill Healy , boss of the rodeo by election , was in charge . He was an expert handler of cattle , one of the best in the country . It was his nature to seek the limelight , though it must be said for him that he rose to his responsibilities . The owners knew that when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wound around them . " Hello , Brill ! " shouted the young man as he rode up . " Hello , son ! Too bad about the fire . I 'll want to hear about it later . Looking for a job ? " he flung hurriedly over his shoulder . For he had not even a minute to spare . " I reckon . " Phil did not wait to be assigned work , but joined the calf branders . Not until night had fallen and they were gathered round in a semicircle leaning against their saddles did Phil find time to tell the story of the fire . There was some haphazard comment when he had finished , after which Slim spoke . " So the nester hauled you out . Ce'tainly looks like he 's plumb game . You said he was afire when he got you into the open , did n't you , Phil ? " The boy nodded . " And all in . He fainted right away . " " With him still burning away like the doctor 's fire there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cook . Phil looked at him angrily . " I did n't say that . Some one put the fire out . " " Oh , some one ! Might a man ask who ? " Phil had not had any intention of telling , but he found himself letting Healy have it straight . " Phyllis . " " About what I thought ! " Healy said it significantly , and with a malice that overrode his discretion . " What do you mean ? " demanded the boy fiercely . " I ai n't said anything , have I ? " Healy came back smoothly . Yeager 's quiet voice broke the silence that followed , while Phil was trying to voice the resentment in him . " You mean what we 're all thinking , Brill , I reckon -- that she is the sort to forget herself when somebody needs her help . Ai n't that it ? " The eyes of the two met steadily in a clash of wills . Healy 's gave way for the time , not because he was mastered , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair-minded , men sitting around . " You 're mighty good at explaining me to the boys , Jim . I expect that is what I mean , " he answered sullenly . " Sure , " put in Purdy , with amiable intent . " But when it comes to Mr. Keller I can explain myself tol'able well . I do n't need any help there , Jim , not even if he is yore best friend . " " If you 've got anything to say against him , I 'll ask you to say it when I 'm not around , " broke in Phil . " You 'll recollect , please , that he 's my friend , too . " " That so ? Since , when , Phil ? " the rodeo boss retorted sarcastically . " Since he went into the fire after me and saved my life . Think I 'm a coyote to round on him ? I tell you he 's a white man clear through . In my opinion , he 's neither a rustler nor a bank robber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met that of his former friend and challenged him defiantly . Healy 's eyes narrowed . He gazed at the boy darkly , as if he meant to read him through and through . For years he had dominated Phil , had shaped him to his ends , had led him into wild , lawless courses after him . Now the anchors were dragging . He was losing control of him . He resolved to turn the screws on him , but not at this time and place . " I 've always been considered a full-grown man , Phil . What I think I aim to say out loud when the notion hits me . That being so , I go on record as having an opinion about Keller . You think he 's on the square , and you give him a whitewashed certificate as a bony-fidy Sunday-school scholar . " Different here . I think him a coyote and a crook , and so I say it right out in meeting . Any objections ? " The gaze of the boss shifted from Sanderson to Yeager , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you like , Brill , and we 'll stick to our opinions , " Yeager replied cheerfully . " And when I get good and ready I 'll act on mine , " Healy replied with an evil grin . " If you find it right convenient . I expect Keller ai n't exactly a wooden cigar Indian . Maybe he 'll have a say-so in what 's doing , " suggested Yeager . " About as much as he had last time , " sneered the round-up boss . With which he rose , stretched himself , and gave orders . " Time to turn in , boys . We 're combing Old Baldy to-morrow , remember . " " And Old Baldy 's sure a holy terror , " admitted Slim . " Come three more days and we 'd ought to be through . I 'm not going to grieve any when we are . This high life do n't suit me too durned well , " put in Benwell . " Yet when you come here first you was a right sick man , Tom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the outside of a hawss is good for the inside of a man , like the docs say ? " grinned Purdy . " Tom 's notion of real living is sassiety with a capital S , " explained Cuffs . " You watch him cut ice at the Frying Pan dance next week . He 'll be the real-thing lady-killer . All you lads going , I reckon . How about you , Jim ? " Yeager said he expected to be there . " With yore friend the rustler ? " asked Healy insolently over his shoulder . " I have n't got any friend that 's a rustler . " " I 'm speaking of Mr. Larrabie Keller . " There was a slurring inflection on the prefix . " He 'll be there , I should n't wonder . " " I 'd wonder a heap , " retorted Healy . " You 'll see he wo n't show his face there . " " That 's where you 're wrong , Brill . He told me he was going , " spoke up Phil triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that this country knows him for an out-and-out crook . He 'll stay in his hole . " " You going , Slim ? " asked Purdy amiably , to turn the conversation into a more pacific channel . " Sure , " answered that young giant , getting lazily to his feet . " Well , sons , the boss is right . Time to pound our ears . " They rolled themselves in their blankets , the starry sky roofing their bedroom . Within five minutes every man of them was asleep except the night herders -- and one other . Healy lay a little apart from the rest , partially screened by some boxes of provisions and a couple of sacks of flour . His jaw was clamped tight . He looked into the deep velvet sky without seeing . For a long time he did not move . Then , noiselessly , he sat up , glanced around carefully to make sure he was not observed , rose , and stole into the darkness , carrying with him his saddle and bridle . One of his ponies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leading the animal very carefully so as to avoid rustling the brush , he zigzagged from the camp until he had reached a safe distance . Here he swung himself on and rode into the blur of night , at first cautiously , but later with swift-pounding hoofs . He went toward the northwest in a bee line without hesitation or doubt . Only when the lie of the ground forced a detour did he vary his direction . So for hours he travelled until he reached a canon in which squatted a little log cabin . He let his voice out in the howl of a coyote before he dismounted . No answer came , save the echo from the cliff opposite . Again that mournful call sounded , and this time from the cabin found an answer . A man came sleepily to the door and peered out . " Hello ! That you , Brill ? " Healy swung off , trailed his rein , and followed the man into the cabin . " Do n't light up , Tom . No need . " For ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , remounted , and rode back to the cow camp . He reached it just as the first , faint streaks of gray tinged the eastern sky . Silently he unsaddled , hobbled his pony , and carried his saddle back to the place where he had been lying . Once more he lay down , glanced cautiously round to see all was quiet , and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the saddle . CHAPTER XXIV MISSING From all over the Malpais country , from the water-sheds where Bear and Elk and Cow creeks head , from the halfway house far out in the desert where the stage changes horses , men and women dribbled to the Frying Pan for the big dance after the round-up . Great were the preparations . Many cakes and pies and piles of sandwiches had been made ready . Also there was a wash boiler full of coffee and a galvanized tub brimming with lemonade . For the Frying Pan was doing itself proud . Phil and his sister drove over together . The boy had asked Bess to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distance was only twenty-five miles , a neighborly stroll in that country of wide spaces and desert stretches filled with absentees . When Phyllis came into the big room where the dancing was in progress , her dark eye swept the room without finding him for whom she looked . There were many there she knew , not more than two or three whom she had never met , but among them all she looked at none who was a magnet for her eyes . Keller had not yet arrived . Before she had taken her seat she had three engagements to dance . Jim Yeager had waylaid her ; so , too , had Slim and Curly . She waltzed first with Phil , and after he had done his duty he left her to the besiegings of half a score of riders for various ranches who came and went and came again . She joked with them , joined the merry banter that went on , laughed at them when they grew sentimental , always with a sprightly devotion to the matter in hand . Nevertheless , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him who had not yet appeared . Why was he late ? Could he have missed the way by any chance ? And later -- as the hours passed without bringing him -- could anything have happened to him ? More than once her troubled gaze fell upon Brill Healy with a brooding question in it . The man had received only the day before his party 's nomination for sheriff , and he was doing the gracious to all the women and children . He had many of the qualities that make for popularity , even though he was often overbearing , revengeful , and sullen . When he chose he could be hail fellow well met in a way Malpais found flattering to its vanity . Now he was apparently having the time of his life . Wherever he moved an eddy of laughter and gayety went with him . The eyes of men as well as women admiringly followed his dark , lithe , picturesque figure . Phyllis had declined to dance with him , giving as an excuse a full programme , and for an instant his face had blazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swaggered away with a malicious sneer . Her judgment told her it was folly to connect this man with the absence of her lover , but that look of malevolent triumph had none the less shaken her heart . What had he meant ? It seemed less a threat for the future than a gloating over some evil already done . When she could endure them no longer she carried her fears to Jim Yeager . They were dancing , but she made an excuse of fatigue to drop out . " First time I ever knew you to play out at a dance , Phyl , " he rallied her . " It is n't that . I want to say something to you , " she whispered . He had a guess what it was , for his own mind was not quite easy . " Do you think anything could have happened , Jim ? " she besought pitifully when for a moment they were alone in a corner . " What could have happened , Phyllie ? Do you reckon he fell off his hawss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but -- you do n't know how Brill looked at me . I 'm afraid . " " Oh , Brill ! " His voice held an edge of scorn , but none the less it concealed a real fear . He was making as much concession to it as to her when he added lightly : " Tell you what I 'll do , Phyl . I 'll saddle up and take a look back over the Bear Creek trail . Likely I 'll meet him , and we 'll come in together . " Her eyes met his , and he needed no other thanks . " You 'll lose the dance , " was her only comment . Jim followed the road until it branched off to join the Bear Creek trail . Here he deflected toward the mountains , taking the zigzag path that ran like a winding thread among the rocks as it mounted . Now for the first time there came to him the faint rhythmic sound of a galloping horse 's hoofs . He did not stop , and as he picked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of it . " Mr. Hurry-up-like-hell kept the road , I reckon , " Jim ruminated aloud , and even as he spoke he caught again the echo of an iron shoe striking a rock . He stopped and listened . Some one was climbing the trail behind him . " Mebbe he 's a friend , and then mebbe he is n't . We 'll let him have the whole road to himself , eh , Keno ? " Yeager guided his pony to the left , and took up a position behind some huge bowlders from whence he could see without being seen . The pursuer toiled into sight , a slim , wiry youth on a buckskin . He came forward out of the shadows into the fretted moonlight . Yeager gave a glad whoop of recognition . " Hi-yi , Phil ! " " You 're there , are you ? Did I scare you off the trail , Jim ? " " That 's whatever , boy . What are you doing here ? " " Sis sent me . She got worried again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I reckon there 's nothing serious the matter . Still , it ai n't like Larry to say he would come and then not show up . " " Brill is back there bragging about it . " Phil nodded his head toward the lights of the Frying Pan glimmering far below . " Says he knew the waddy would n't show his head . You do n't reckon , Jim , he 's turned a trick on Keller , do you ? " " That 's what we have got to find out , Phil . " " Looks funny he 'd be so durned sure when we all know how game Keller is , " the boy reflected aloud . " I do n't expect you 're armed , Phil ? " Jim put the statement as a question . " Nope . Are you ? " " No , I ai n't . Did n't think of it when I started . Oh , well , we 'll make out . Like enough there will be no need of guns . " A gray light was sifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up toward the peaks of the divide . Jim , leading the way , drew rein and pointed to a cactus bush beside the trail . Among its spines lay a gray felt hat . From it his eye wandered to the very evident signs of a struggle that had taken place . Moss and cactus had been trampled down by boot heels . To the cholla hung here and there scraps of cloth . A blood splash stared at them from an outcropping slope of rock . Jim swung from the saddle and rescued the hat from the spines . Inside the sweat band were the initials L.K. Silently he handed the hat to Phil . " It 's his hat , " the boy cried . " It 's his hat , " Jim agreed . " They must have laid for him here . He put up a good scrap . Notice how that cholla is cut to ribbons . Point is , what did they do to him ? " They searched the ground thoroughly , and discovered no body hidden in the brush . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeager decided aloud at last . " Brill could n't have been in this . He was at the Frying Pan before I was . " " I reckon he ordered it done . If that 's correct they will be holding Larry till Brill gets there to give further orders . " Phil entered an objection . " That does n't look to me like Brill 's way . He 's not scared of any man that lives . When he squares accounts with Keller he 'll be on the job himself . " " That 's so , too , " admitted Yeager . " Still , I figure this is Healy 's work . Maybe he gave out there was to be no killing . He was at the ranch himself , big as coffee , so as to be sure of his alibi . " " What does he care about an alibi ? When he gets ready to go gunnin ' after Keller he wo n't care if the whole Malpais sees him . There 's something in this I do n't sabe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing down muy pronto . No use both of us going ahead without arms , Phil . My notion is this : You burn a shuck back to the Frying Pan and round up some of our friends on the q.t . Do n't let Brill get a notion of what 's in the air . Better make straight for Gregory 's Pass . I 'm going to follow this trail we 've cut and see what 's doing . Once I find out I 'll double back to the Pass and meet you . Bring along an extra gun for me . " " I do n't reckon I will , Jim . What 's the matter with me going on instead of you ? I can follow this trail good as you can . I announce right here that I 'm not going back . I 've got first call on this job . Keller went into the fire after me . I 'm going to follow this trail to hell if I have to . " Yeager tried persuasion , argument , appeal . The lad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go buttin ' in where I 'm not wanted any more than you would , Jim . I 'll play this hand out with a cool head , but I 'm going to play it my ownself . " " All right . It 's your say-so . I 'll admit you 've got a claim . But you want to remember one thing -- if anything happens to you I cay n't square it with Phyl . Go slow , boy ! " Without more words they parted , Jim to ride swiftly back for help , and young Sanderson to push on up the trail with his eyes glued to it . Ever since he could swing himself to a saddle he had been a vaquero in the cow country . He was therefore an expert at reading the signs left by travellers . What would have been invisible to a tenderfoot offered evidence to him as plain as the print on a primer . Mile after mile he covered with a minute scrutiny that never wavered . CHAPTER XXV LARRY TELLS A BEAR STORY Keller rode blithely down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crotch of the mountains behind which it was slipping . The western sky was a Turner sublimated to the nth degree , a thing magnificent and indescribable . The young man rode with his crisp curls bared to the light , grateful breeze that came like healing from the great peaks . From the joyous , unquenchable youth in him bubbled snatches of song and friendly smiles scattered broadcast over a world that pleased him mightily . He was going to see his girl , going down to the Frying Pan to take her in his arms and whirl her into the land of romance to the rhythm of the waltz . He wanted to shout it out to the chipmunks and the quails . Ever and again he broke out with a line or two of a melody he had heard once from a phonograph . No matter if he did not get the words exactly . He was sure of the sentiment . So the hills flung back his lusty : " I love a lassie , A bonnie Hieland lassie , She 's as pure as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bolt out of a June sky . His pony stumbled , went down heavily with its weight on his leg . From the darkness men surged upon him . Rough hands dragged at him . The butt of a weapon crashed down on his hat and stunned him . He became dimly aware that his leg was free from the horse , that he was struggling blindly to rise against the force that clamped him down . He knew that he reached his feet , that he was lashing out furiously with both hands , that even as he grappled with one assailant a gleam of steel flashed across the moonlight and shot through him with a zigzag pain that blotted out the world . As his mind swam back to consciousness through troubled waters a far-away voice came out of the fog that surrounded him . " He 's coming to , looks like . I reckon you ai n't bust his head , after all , Brad . " Vague , grinning gargoyles mocked him from the haze . Slowly these took form . Features stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached in space , but belonged definitely to human beings . " It ai n't our fault if you 're stove up some , pardner . You 're too durned anxious to whip yore weight in wildcats , " one of the men grinned . " Right you are , Tom . He shore hits like a kicking mule , " chimed in a third , nursing a cheek that had been cut open to the bone . A fourth spoke up , a leather-faced vaquero with hard eyes of jade . " No hard feelings , friend . All in the way of business . " With which he gave a final tug at the knot that tied the hands of his prisoner . " I 've got Mr. Healy to thank for this , I expect , " commented the nester quietly . " We 've got no rope on yore expectations , Mr. Keller ; but this outfit does n't run any information bureau , " answered the heavy-set , sullen fellow who had been called Brad . There were four of them , all masked ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not two . The first speaker had been Tom Dixon ; the last one was Brad Irwin , a rider belonging to the Twin Star outfit . They helped the bound man to his horse and held a low-voiced consultation . Three of his captors turned their horses toward the south , while Irwin took charge of Keller . With his rifle resting across the horn of his saddle , the man followed his charge up the trail , winding among the summits that stood as sentinels around Gregory 's Pass . Through the defile they went , descending into the little-known mountain parks beyond . This region was the heart of the watershed where Little Goose Creek heads . The peaks rose gaunt above them . Occasionally they glimpsed wide vistas of tangled , wooded canons and hills innumerable as sea billows . Into this maze they plunged ever deeper and deeper . Daylight came , and found them still travelling . The prisoner did not need to be told that this inaccessible country was the lurking place of the rustlers who had preyed so long upon the Malpais district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure behind him with the gang of outlaws who rode in and out of these silent places on their nefarious night errands while honest folks kept their beds . The sun was well up to its meridian before they came through a thick clump of quaking aspens to the mouth of a gulch opening from the end of a little mountain park . On one of the slopes of the gulch a cabin squatted , half hidden by the great boulders and the matting of pine boughs in front . Here Brad swung stiffly from the saddle . " We 'll ' light hyer , " he announced . " Time , too , " returned Keller easily . " If anybody asks you , tell them I usually eat breakfast some before ten o'clock . " " You 'll do yore eating from now on when I give the word , " his guard answered surlily . He was a big , dark man with a grouch , one who took his duties sourly . Not by any stretch of imagination could he be considered a brilliant conversationalist . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the rest his opinions had to be cork-screwed out of him in surly monosyllables . There was a good deal of the cave man about him . The heavy , slouching shoulders , the glare of savagery , the long , hairy arms , all had their primordial suggestion . Given a club and a stone ax , he might have been set back thousands of years with no injustice to his mentality . The man soon had a fire blazing in the stove , and from it came a breakfast of bacon , black coffee , and biscuits . He freed the hands of the nester and sat opposite him at the table , a revolver by the side of his plate for use in an emergency . Keller smiled . " This is one of those fashionable dinners where they have extra hardware beside the plates , " he suggested . " Get gay , and I 'll blow the top of yore head off ! " the cow-puncher swore with gusto . " Thanks . Under the circumstances , I reckon I 'll not get gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen , seh . Plenty of time . I 'm going to need the top of my head to testify against you . " Irwin swore violently . " For two cents I 'd pump you full of holes right now , " he glared . Keller laughed , meeting him eye to eye pleasantly . " Those are n't the orders , friend . I 'm to be held here till the boss shows up or gives the signal . " The big jaw of his captor fell from astonishment . " Who told you that ? " The prisoner helped himself to more bacon and laughed again . He had made a guess , but he knew now that he had hit the bull's-eye with his shot in the dark . " Some things do n't need telling . I do n't have to be told , for instance , that if things get too hot for Brill Healy he will slide out and leave you to settle the bill with the law . " Irwin 's eyes glared angrily at his smiling ones . The unabashed impudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescience of this youth disturbed him because he could not understand them . Moreover , it happened that his suspicious mind had lingered on the chance of a betrayal at the hands of his chief . For which very reason he broke into angry denial . " That 's a lie ! Brill ai n't that sort . He 'd stand pat to a finish . " Then , tardily , came the instinct for caution . " And there 's nothing to tell , anyways , " he finished sulkily . " Sure . What 's a little rustling and a little bank robbing among friends ? " Keller wanted to know cheerfully . For just an instant he thought he had gone too far . The big ruffian opposite choked over his biscuit , the while rage purpled his face . He caught up the revolver , and his fingers itched at the trigger . His prisoner , leaning back in the chair , held him with quiet , unwavering eyes . " Steady ! Steady ! " he drawled . " That will be about enough from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You padlock that mouth of yours , mister . " Keller took his advice temporarily , but it was not in him to long repress the spirit of adventure that bubbled in him . The temptation to bait this bear drew him irresistibly . He could not let him alone , the more that he sensed the danger to himself of the prods he sent home through the thick skin . Lying carelessly on the bed with his head on his arm , or perhaps sitting astride a chair with his hands crossed on the back support , he would smile with childlike innocence and sent his barbs in gayly . And Irwin , murder in his dull brain , would glare at him like a maniac . " Now would be a good time to blow off the top of my cocoanut , " the nester suggested more than once to the infuriated cave man . " I 'm allowing , you know , to send you to Yuma as soon as I get out of this . Nothing like grabbing your opportunity by the forelock . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his guard demanded huskily . Keller waved his hand with airy persiflage . " No exact information obtainable , my friend . Likely to-day . Maybe not till to-morrow . The one dead-sure point is that I 'll make my getaway at the right time . " " There 's one more dead-sure point -- that I 'm going to blow holes in you at the right time , " retorted the other . " Like to bet on which of us is a true prophet ? " Brad relapsed into black , sulky silence . The hours followed each other , and still nobody came to relieve the guard . Keller could not understand the reason for this , any more than he could fathom an adequate one for his abduction . There was of course something behind it -- something more potent than mere malice . If the intention had been merely to kill him , the thing could have been done without all this trouble . But though he searched his brain for an explanation , he could not find one that satisfied . The answer came to him later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse pounded up the draw to the cabin . Irwin went to the door , his eye still on his prisoner , except for a swift glance at the newcomer . " How 's yore five-thousand-dollar beauty , Brad ? " inquired a voice that the nester recognized . " Finer than silk , boss . " The rider swung from the saddle , trailed his rein , and came with jingling spurs into the cabin . " Good evening , Mr. Keller , " he said with derisive respect . The nester , lying sideways on the bed with his head on his hand , nodded a greeting . " I did n't know you and Mr. Irwin had doubled up and were bunkies , " continued the jubilant voice . " When did you-all patch up the partnership ? " " About eight o'clock last night , Mr. Healy , " returned the prisoner , eying him coolly . " And of course I knew it would be a surprise to you when you learned it . " " Expecting to stay long with him ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll outstay my welcome . " Healy laughed , with mockery and not amusement . " Brad 's such a pressing host there 's no telling when he 'll let you go . " He was as malevolent as ever , but it was plain to be seen that he was riding high on a wave of triumph . Affairs were plainly going to his liking . " The way I heard it you were expected down at the Frying Pan last night . Changed yore mind about going , I reckon , " he went on insolently . " I reckon . " " Had business that detained you , maybe . " " You 're a good guesser . " " Folks were right anxious down there , according to the say-so that reached me . " Keller 's cool eye measured him in silence , at which his enemy laughed contemptuously and turned on his heel . Healy drew his confederate to one side of the room and held a whispered talk with him . Apparently he did not greatly care whether his foe caught the drift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that scraps of sentences reached the man lounging on the bed . "  - -  close to two hundred head -- by the Mimbres Pass -- the boys are ce'tainly pushing the drive -- out of danger by midnight -- wait for the signal before you turn him loose --  --  " " So-long , Mr. Keller . I cay n't spare the time to stay longer with you , " their owner jeered . " Just a moment , Mr. Healy . I want to know why you are keeping me here . " The man grinned . " Am I keeping you here , seh ? Looks to me like it was Brad that 's a-keeping you . Make a break for a getaway , and I 'll not do a thing to you . Course I cay n't promise what Brad wo n't do . He 's such a plumb anxious host . " " You 're his brains . What you tell him to do he does . I hold you responsible for this ! " " You do n't say ! " " And right now I 'll add , for all the devilment that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about reached the end of your rope , though . " " I 'll bet dollars to doughnuts you reach the end of one inside of forty-eight hours , Mr. Rustler , " flashed back Healy . And with an evil , significant grin he was gone . They heard the sound of retreating hoofs die in the distance . But his visit had told the prisoner two things . A hurried wholesale drive of rustled cattle was being made across the line into Sonora , and it was being done in such a way as to fasten the suspicion of it upon the nester who had not appeared at the dance and had not been seen since that time . The irony of the thing was superb in its audacity . Healy and his friends would get the profit from the stolen cattle , and they would visit the punishment for the crime upon him . Evidence would be cooked up of course , and the retribution would be so swift that his friends would not be able to save him . This time his enemy would take no chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing was diabolic in the simplicity of its cleverness . Keller watched his jailer now like a hawk . He was ready to take the first chance that offered , no matter how slight a one it seemed . But the man was vigilant and wary . He never let his hand wander a foot from the handle of the weapon he carried . Silently Irwin cooked a second meal . They sat down to it opposite each other , Keller facing the open window . While his jailer plied the knife , his revolver again lay on the oilcloth within reach . " While I 'm your guest and eating at your expense , I want to be properly grateful , " the nester told his vis-a-vis . " Some folks might kick because the me-an ' - you was n't more varied , but I ai n't that kind . You 're doing your best , and nobody could do more . " " The which ? " asked Irwin puzzled . " The me-an ' - you . It 's French for just plain grub . For breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a variety . This time it is biscuits and coffee and bacon . To-morrow I reckon --  --  " Keller stopped halfway in his sentence , but took up his drawling comment again instantly . Only an added sparkle in his eyes betrayed the change that had suddenly wiped out his indolence and left him tense and alert . For while he had been speaking a head had slowly raised itself above the window casement and two eyes had looked in and met his . They belonged to Phil Sanderson . Never had the brain of the prisoner been more alert . While his garrulous tongue ran aimlessly on , he considered ways and means . The boy held up empty hands to show him that he was unarmed . The nester did not by the flicker of an eyelash betray the presence of a third party to the man at table with him . Nevertheless his chatter became from that moment addressed to two listeners . To one it meant nothing in particular . To the other it was pregnant with meaning . " No , seh . Some might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixings , but what I say is to make out the best we can with what we 've got , " the slow , drawling voice continued . " Some folks cay n't get along unless things are up to the Delmonico standard . That 's plumb foolishness . Reminds me of a friend of mine that happened on a grizzly once while he was cutting trail . " Not expecting to meet Mr. Bear , he did n't have any gun along . Mr. Bear was surely on the wah-path that day . He made a bee line for my friend to get better acquainted . Nothing like presence of mind . That cow-puncher got his rope coiled in three shakes of a maverick 's tail , his pinto bucking for fair to make his getaway . The rope drapped over Mr. Bear 's head just as the puncher and the hawss separated company . " Things were doing right sudden then . My friend grabbed the end of that rope and twisted it round and round a young live oak . Then he remembered an appointment and lit out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronto that grizzly came up awful sudden . The more he jerked the nearer he was to being choked . You better believe Mr. Puncher was hitting that trail right willing in the meanwhile . " " You talk too much with yore mouth , " growled Irwin . " It 's a difference of opinion that makes horse races . I was just aiming to show you that if my friend had n't happened to have a rope along he would have been in a bad fix . But , you notice , he used his brains , and a rope did just as well as a gun . " The eyes just above the window casing disappeared . Brad attended to the business in hand , which was that of getting away with bacon and biscuits while he kept an eye on the man opposite . His prisoner also did justice to his supper , to his flow of conversation , and to the window behind the unconscious jailer . In that open window were presently framed again the head and shoulders of young Sanderson . Irwin pushed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture in the frame shot instantly down . The guard , his coffee cup , and his revolver went to the stove and returned . Phil reappeared at the window , his rope coiled for action . It slid gracefully forward , dropped over the head of Brad , and was instantly jerked tight . Keller vaulted across the table , and flung himself upon the struggling man . Brad 's arms were entangled in the rope , but one leg shot out and hurled back the nester . But before he could free himself from the taut loop his prisoner was upon him again and had borne him to the ground . Of the two , Irwin was far the more powerful , Keller the more agile and supple . He knew every trick of the wrestling game , whereas the other was clumsy and muscle-bound . By main strength the older man got to his feet again . Over went the table as they surged against it . A chair , stamped into kindling , was hurled aside by the force of their impact . The stove rocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it . The ranger , twisting as they fell , landed on top and his fingers instantly found the throat of his foe . Simultaneously Phil came to his assistance . Even then , taken at an advantage , with two much younger men against him , the big jailer fought to the finish like a bear . Not till he was completely exhausted and they nearly so did he give up and lie quiet . All three of them panted heavily , the allies lying across his chest and legs . The nester managed to draw the loop taut about Irwin 's neck and insert his knuckles so that he could use them as a tourniquet if necessary . " Gather up the other end of the rope , loop it , and tie his feet together , " the nester ordered , getting his sentence out in fragmentary jerks . Phil did so , deftly and expertly , after which , in spite of renewed struggles , they tied the hands of their prisoner behind his back . " Looks like a cyclone had hit the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larrabie laughed . " He 's the most willing mixer I ever saw . " " What are you going to do with him ? " " We 'll leave him tied right where he is . When we get down into the settlement we 'll notify his friends , though I reckon they 'll find him without any help from us . " In order to make sure they went over the knots again , tightening them here and there . The revolver and the rifle of the bound man they appropriated . The nester 's horse was in a little corral back of the house . He saddled , and shortly the two were on the back trail . Phil knew the country as a golfer knows his links . To him Keller put the question in his mind : " How far is the Mimbres Pass from here , and in what direction ? " The younger man looked at him in surprise . " A dozen miles , I reckon . See that cleft over there ? That 's the Mimbres . " His friend drew rein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's come to a show-down ! Are you for Brill Healy or are you for me ? " " I 'm through with Brill . " " Dead sure of that ? " " Dead sure . Why ? " " Because you 've got to make your choice to-night whether you 're going to stand with honest men or thieves . Healy 's gang is rustling a bunch of cows gathered at the round-up . They 're heading for Mimbres Pass . I 'm going to stop them if I can . " " I 'm with you , Larry . " " Good ! I was sure of you , Phil . " The boy flushed , but his eyes did not waver . " I want to tell you something . That day we most caught you over the dead cow of the C.O. outfit Brill was carrying Phyl 's knife . I had lent it to him the night before . " Keller nodded . " I had figured it out that way . " " But that ai n't all . Once when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before that time -- I happened on Brill driving a calf still bleeding from the brand he had put on it . " I did n't think anything of that , but I noticed he was anxious to have me turn and join him . But I kept on the way I was going , and just by a miracle my pony almost stumbled over a dead cow lying in the brush . That set me thinking . That night I rode over to Healy 's and asked an explanation . " He had one ready . Some one else must have killed the cow . He found the calf wandering about alone , and branded it . Somehow his story did n't quite satisfy me , but I was n't ready then to think him a coyote . I liked him -- always had . And it flattered me that he had picked me out to be his best friend . So I said nothing , and figured it out that he was on the square . Of course I knew he was reckless and wild , but I did n't like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused him of not being game . " " Hardly , " smiled Keller . " He 'll stand the acid that way . " " The thing that stuck in my craw was his lying about seeing you on the night of the bank robbery . He said you were riding the roan with white stockings . Later we found out that could n't be true . Then I knew Jim was telling the truth about you being with him in the hills at the time . It kind of sifted to me by degrees that you were a white man and he was a skunk . " " And then ? " " Then we had it out one day . He had his reason for wanting to stand well with me . I reckon you know what it is . " " I know his reason . No man could have a better . I reckon I 've a right to think so , Phil , because she has promised to marry me . " The boy shook hands with him impulsively . " I 'm right glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make girls any better than Phyl . " " That 's not news to me . I have known it since the first time I saw her . " Sanderson returned to the order of the day . " Well , Brill and I had had one or two tiffs , mostly about you and Phyl . He saw I was changed toward him , and he wanted to know why . I let him have it straight , and since then we have n't been friends . " " I 'm glad of that . It makes plain sailing for me . He 's got to be run down and caged , Phil . Healy is at the head of all this rustling that has been troubling the Malpais country . His gang stuck up the Diamond Nugget stage , killed Sheriff Fowler , and robbed the Noches Bank . " " How could he have robbed the bank when he was seen fifty miles from there not two hours afterward ? " Keller briefly explained his theory then pushed on at once to his plans . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back and rustle help . I 'll try to keep them from getting through the Pass until you close in on them behind . " " That do n't look good to me . How do I know how long it will be before I can gather the boys together or find Jim and his outfit ? You might be massacred before I got back . " " A man has to take his fighting chance . " " Then let me take mine . We 'll hold the pass together . I 'll bet we can . Do n't you reckon ? " " What use would you be without a rifle ? No , Phil , you 'll have to bring up the reinforcements . That 's the best tactics . " Sanderson protested eagerly , but in the end was overborne . They turned their backs upon each other , one headed for the Mimbres and the other for the trail that ran down to the Malpais country . CHAPTER XXVI THE MAN-HUNT When Jim Yeager separated from Phil after their discovery of Keller 's hat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pony toward the Frying Pan . Daylight had already broken before he came in sight of it , but sounds of revelry still issued boisterously from the house . As he drew near there came to him the squeal of sawing riddles , the high-pitched voice of the dance caller in sing-song drawl , the shuffling of feet keeping time to the rhythm of the music . For though a new day was at hand , the quadrilles continued with unflagging vigor , one succeeding another as soon as the floor was cleared . The cow country takes its amusements seriously . A dance is infrequent enough to be an event . Men and women do not ride or drive from thirty to fifty miles without expecting to drink the last drop of pleasure there may be in the occasion . As Jim swung from the saddle , a slim figure in white glided from the shadow of the wild cucumber vines that rioted over one end of the porch . " Well , Jim ? " The man came to the point with characteristic directness . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where they ambushed him . " " Is he --  --  " Her voice died at the word , but her meaning was clear . " I do n't think it . Looks like they were aiming to take him prisoner without hurting him . They might easily have shot him down , but the ground shows there was a struggle . " " And you came back without rescuing him ? " she reproached . " Phil and I were unarmed . I came back to get guns and help . " " And Phil ? " " He 's following the trail . I wanted him to let me while he came back . But he would n't hear to it . Said he had to square his debt to Larry . " " Good for Phil ! " his sister cried , eyes like stars . " Is Brill still here ? " he asked . " No . He rode away about an hour ago . He was very bitter at me because I would n't dance with him . Said I 'd curse myself for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his power , Jim . " " Looks like , " he nodded , and added grimly : " If you do any regretting there will be others that will , too . " She caught the lapels of his coat and looked into his face with extraordinary intensity . " I 'm going back with you , Jim . You 'll let me , wo n't you ? I 've waited -- and waited . You ca n't think what an awful night it has been . I ca n't stand it any longer ! I 'll go mad ! Oh , Jim , you 'll take me , I know ! " Her hands slipped down to his and clung to them with passionate entreaty . " Why , honey , I cay n't . This is likely to be war before we finish . It ai n't any place for girls . " " I 'll stay back , Jim . I 'll do whatever you say , if you 'll only let me go . " He shook his head resolutely . " Cay n't be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't do . " Nor could all her beseechings move him . Though his heart was very tender toward her he was granite to her pleadings . At last he put her aside gently and stepped into the house . Going at once to the fiddlers , he stopped the music and stood on the little rostrum where they were seated . Surprised faces turned toward him . " What 's up , Jim ? " demanded Slim , his arm still about the waist of Bess Purdy . " A man was waylaid while coming to this dance and taken prisoner by his enemies . They mean to do him a mischief . I want volunteers to rescue him . " " Who is it ? " several voices cried at once . " The man I mean is Larrabie Keller . " A pronounced silence followed before Slim drawled an answer : " Cay n't speak for the other boys , but I reckon I have n't lost any Kellers , Jim . " " Why not ? What have you got against him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't say he 's a rustler and a bank robber , but then we do n't say he ai n't . " " I say he is n't ! Boys , it has come to a show-down . Keller is a member of the Rangers , sent here by Bucky O'Connor to run down the rustlers . " Questions poured upon him . " How do you know ? " " How long have you known ? " " Who told you ? " " Why did n't he tell us so himself , then ? " Jim waited till they were quiet . " I 've seen letters from the governor to him . He did n't come here declaring his intentions because he knew there would be nothing doing if the rustlers knew he was in the neighborhood . He has about done his work now , and it 's up to us to save him before they bump him off . Who will ride with me to rescue him ? " There was no hesitation now . Every man pushed forward to have a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll want rifles , boys . Looks to me like hell might be a-popping before mo'ning grows very ancient . We 'll set out from Turkey Creek Crossroads two hours from now . Any man not on hand then will get left behind . " And remember -- this is a man hunt ! No talking , boys . We do n't want the news that we 're coming spread all over the hills before we arrive . " As Jim descended from the rostrum , his roving gaze fell on Phyl Sanderson standing in the doorway . Her fears had stolen the color even from her lips , but the girl 's beauty had never struck him more poignantly . Misery stared at him out of her fine eyes , yet the unconscious courage of her graceful poise -- erect , with head thrown back so that he could even see the pulse beat in the brown throat -- suggested anything but supine surrender to her terror . Before he could reach her she had slipped into the night , and he could not find her . Men dribbled in to the Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan running to a common centre . Jim waited , watch open , and when it said that seven o'clock had come he snapped it shut and gave the word to set out . It was a grim , business-like posse , composed of good men and true who had been sifted in the impartial sieve of life on the turbid frontier . Moreover , they were well led . A certain hard metallic quality showed in the voice and eye of Jim Yeager that boded no good for the man who faced him in combat to-day . He rode with his gaze straight to the front , toward that cleft in the hills where lay Gregory 's Pass . The others fell in behind , a silent , hard-bitten outfit as ever took the trail for that most dangerous of all big game -- the hidden outlaw . The little bunch of riders had not gone far before Purdy , who was riding in the rear , called to Yeager . " Somebody coming hell-to-split after us , Jim . " It turned out to be Buck Weaver , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A girl had called him up out of his sleep , and he had pounded the road hard to get in at the finish . Jim explained the situation in a few words and offered to yield command to the owner of the Twin Star ranch . But Buck declined . " You 're the boss of this rodeo , Yeager . I 'm riding in the ranks to-day . " " How did you hear we were rounding-up to-day ? " Jim asked . " Some one called me up , " Buck answered briefly , but he did not think it necessary to say that it was Phyllis . Behind them , unnoticed by any , sometimes hidden from sight by the rise and fall of the rough ground , sometimes silhouetted against the sky line , rode a slim , supple figure on a white-faced cow pony . Once , when the fresh morning wind swept down a gulch at an oblique angle , it lifted for an instant from the stirrup leather what might have been a gray flag . But the flag was only a skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion of a girl who knew that the men she loved best on earth were in danger . CHAPTER XXVII THE ROUND-UP The Mimbres Pass narrows toward the southern exit where Point o ' Rocks juts into the canon and commands it like a sentinel . Toward this column of piled boulders slowly moved a cloud of white dust , at the base of which crept a band of hard-driven cattle . Swollen tongues were out , heads stretched forward in a bellow for water taken up by one as another dropped it . The day was still hot , though the sun had slipped down over the range , and the drove had been worked forward remorselessly . Every inch that could be sweated out of them had been gained . For those that pushed them along were in desperate hurry . Now and again a rider would twist round in his saddle to sweep back a haggard glance . Dust enshrouded them , lay heavy on every exposed inch ; but through it seams of anxiety crevassed their leathern faces . Iron men they were , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch . But behind the jaded , stony eyes lay a haunting fear , the never-ending dread of a pursuit that might burst upon them at any moment . Driven to the wall , they would have faced the enemy like tigers , with a fierce , exultant hate . It was the never-ending possibility of disaster that lay heavily upon them . Just as they entered the pass , a man came spurring up the steep trail behind them . The drag drivers shouted a warning to those in front and waited alertly with weapons ready . The man trying to overtake them waved a sombrero as a flag of truce . " Keep an eye on him , Tom . If he makes a move that do n't look good to you , plug him ! " ordered the keen-eyed man beside one of the drag drivers . " I 'm bridle wise , boss . " But though he spoke with bravado Dixon shook like an aspen in a breeze . The man he had called boss looked every inch a leader . He rode with the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle born . Just now he was looking back with impassive , reddened eyes at the approaching figure . " Hold on , Tom ! Do n't shoot ! It 's Brad , " he decided . " And I wonder what in Mexico he is doing here . " The leader of the outlaws was soon to learn . Irwin told the story of the strategy that had changed him from jailer to prisoner and of the way he had later freed himself from the rope that bound him . Healy unloaded his sentiments with an emphasis that did the subject justice . Nevertheless he could not see that their plans were seriously affected . " It 's a leetle premature , but his getaway does n't cut any ice . What we want to do is to nail him , clamp the evidence home , and put him out of business before his friends can say Jack Robinson . The story now is that he was caught driving a little bunch of cows to met the big bunch his pals were rustling , and that we left him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other waddies . Understand , boys ? " They did , and admired the more the versatility of a leader who could make plans on the spur of the moment to meet any emergency . " We 'll push right on , boys . Once we get through the pass it will trouble anybody to find us . Before mo'ning you 'll be across the line . " " And you , Brill ? " " I 'm going back to settle accounts for good and all with Mr. Keller , " answered Healy grimly between set teeth . " I 've got a notion about him . I believe he 's a spy . " Just before Point o ' Rocks a defile runs into the Mimbres Pass at right angles . The leaders of the cattle , pushed forward by the pressure from behind , stopped for a moment , and stood bawling at the junction . A rider spurred forward to keep them from attempting the gulch . Suddenly he dragged his pony to its haunches , so quickly did he stop it . For a clear voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You ca n't go this way ! The Pass is closed ! " The rider looked up in amazement , and beheld a man standing on the ledge above with a rifle resting easily across his forearm . " By Heaven , it 's Keller ! " the rustler muttered . He wheeled as on a half dollar , pushed his way back along the edge of the wall past the cattle , and shouted to his chief : " We 're trapped , Brill ! " None of the outlaws needed that notification . Five pair of eyes had lifted to the ledge upon which Keller stood . The shock of the surprise paralyzed them for an instant . For it occurred to none of the five that this man would be standing there so quietly unless he were backed by a posse sufficient to overpower them . He had not the manner of a man taking a desperate chance . The situation was as dramatic as life and death , but the voice that had come down to them had been as matter-of-fact as if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the breakfast table . The temper of the outlaws ' metal showed instantly . Dixon dropped his rifle , threw up his hands , and ran bleating to the cover of some large rocks , imploring the imagined posse not to shoot . Others found silently what shelter they could . Healy alone took reckless counsel of his hate . Flinging his rifle to his shoulder , he blazed away at the figure on the ledge -- once , twice , three times . When the smoke cleared the ranger was no longer to be seen . He was lying flat on his rock like a lizard , where he had dropped just as his enemy whipped up his weapon to fire . Cold as chilled steel , in spite of the fire of passion that blazed within him , Healy slid to the ground on the far side of his horse and , without exposing himself , slowly worked to the loose boulders bordering the edge of the canon bed . The bawling of the cattle and the faint whimpering of Dixon alone disturbed the silence . Healy and his confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile the leader of the outlaws was thinking out the situation . " I believe there 's only two of them , Bart , " he confided in a low voice to the big fellow lying near . " Keller must have heard us when we talked it over at the shack . I reckon he and Phil hit the trail for here immediate . They had n't time to go back and rustle help and still get here before us . " We 'll make Mr. Keller table his cards . I 'm going to try to rush the cattle through . We 'll see at once what 's doing . If they are too many for us to do that we 'll break for the gulch and fight our way out -- that is , if we find we 're hemmed in behind , too . " He called to the rest of the bandits and gave crisp instructions . At sound of his sharp whistle four men leaped into sight , each making for his horse . Dixon alone did not answer to the call . He lay white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to rise and face the bullets that would rain down upon him . Keller , watching alertly from above , guessed what they would be at . His rifle cracked twice , and two of the horses staggered , one of them collapsing slowly . He had to show himself , and for three heartbeats stood exposed to the fire of four rifles . One bullet fanned his cheek , a second plunged through his coat sleeve , a third struck the rock at his feet . While the echoes were still crashing , he was flat on his rock again , peering over the edge to see their next move . " He 's alone , " cried Healy jubilantly . " Must have sent the kid back for help . Bart , get Dixon 's gun , steal up the ravine , and take him in the rear . I 'd go myself , but I ca n't leave the boys now . " Slowly the cattle felt the impetus from behind , and began to move forward . The voice above shouted a second warning . Healy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ledge . Rifles cracked . This time the cattle detective was firing at men and not at horses , and they in turn were pumping at him fast as they could work the levers . One man went down , torn through and through by a rifle slug in his vitals . Healy 's horse twitched and staggered , but the rider was unhurt . The officer on the ledge , a perfect target , was the heart of a very hail of lead , but when he sank again to cover he was by some miracle still unhurt . " They 'll try a flank attack next time , " Keller told himself . Up to date the honors were easily his . He had put three horses out of commission and disabled one of the outlaws so badly that he would prove negligible in the attack . Peering down , he could see Healy , with superb contempt for the marksman above , slowly and carefully carry his wounded comrade to shelter . The other men were already driven back to cover . The cattle , excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Healy laid the wounded man down , knelt beside him , and gave him water from his flask . The man was plainly hard hit , though he was not bleeding much . " Where is it , Duke ? Can I do anything for you , old fellow ? " The dying man shook his head and whispered hoarsely : " I 've got mine , Brill . Shot to pieces . I 'm dying right now . Get out while you can . Do n't mind me . " His chief swore softly . " We 'll get him right , Duke . Brad 's after him now . Buck up , old pard . You 'll worry through yet . " " Not this time , Brill . I 've played rustler once too often . " Keller , far up on the precipice , became aware of approaching riders long before the outlaws below could see them . He counted eight -- nine -- ten men , still black dots in a cloud of dust . This he knew must be Phil 's posse . If he could hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats in a trap . Once or twice he glanced behind him as a precaution against some one of the enemy climbing Point o ' Rocks from the defile , but he gave this little consideration . He had not seen Brad when he disappeared into the mesquite , and he supposed all of the rustlers were still in the Pass five hundred feet below him . What he had expected was that they would force their way up the defile for a quarter of a mile and strike the easy trail that ran from the rear to the top of the Point . He wondered that this had not occurred to Healy . In point of fact it had , but the outlaw leader knew that as they picked their way among the broken boulders of the gulch bottom the enemy would have them in the open for more than a hundred yards of slow going . He had chosen the alternative of sending Brad quietly up the rough face of the cliff . The other plan would do as a last resource if this failed . Healy believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keller had been killed they would toss his body down into the Pass , and while his companions continued the drive to Mexico , Healy would return to get help for Duke and spread the story he wanted to get out . The main features of that tale would be that he and Duke had cut their trail by accident , suspected rustling , and followed as far as the Mimbres Pass , where Keller had shot Duke and been in turn shot by Healy . It was a neat plan , and one that would have been fairly sure of success but for one unforeseen contingency -- the approach of Yeager 's posse a half hour too soon . Healy heard them coming , knew he was trapped , and attempted to force an escape through the narrows in front of Point o ' Rocks . The milling cattle had jammed the gateway . Keller , shooting down one or two of them , blocked the exit still more . Healy and his confederates could not get through , and turned to try the defile just as the first of the posse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the van , a hundred yards in front of Yeager , dashing over the uneven ground in a reckless haste that Jim 's slower horse could not match . Loose shale was flying from his pony 's hoofs as it pounded forward . The outlaws just beat him to the mouth of the intersecting gulch . Dragging his broncho to a slithering halt , he fired twice at the retreating men . He had taken no time to aim , and his bullets went wild . Brill laughed in mockery , covered him deliberately with his rifle , and just as deliberately raised the barrel and fired into the air . The distance was scarce a hundred yards . Phil could not doubt that his former friend had purposely spared his life . The boy 's rifle dropped from his shoulder . " Brill would n't shoot at me ! I could n't kill him ! " he shouted to Weaver , as the latter rode up . Buck nodded . " Let me have him ! " And he plunged into the gorge after the men that had disappeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they plowed forward across the boulder bed , but the difficulty of shooting from far above at moving figures almost directly below saved the rustlers . They reached a thick growth of aspens and disappeared . Healy parted company with his ally at the place where the trail to the summit of Point o ' Rocks led up . " Break south when you get out of the gulch , Sam . In half an hour it will be night , and you 'll be safe . So-long . " " Where you going , Brill ? " " I 'm going to settle accounts with that dashed spy ! " answered Healy , with an epithet . " Inside of half an hour either Keller or I will be down and out ! " The outlaw took the stiff incline leisurely , for he knew Keller could come down only this way , and he had no mind to let himself get so breathed as to disturb the sureness of his aim . The aspen grove ran like a forked tongue up the ridge for a couple of hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider just disappearing over the shoulder of the hill in front of him . For an instant he had an amazed impression that the figure was that of a woman , but he dismissed this as absurd . He went the more cautiously , for he now knew that there would be two for him to deal with on the Point instead of one -- unless Brad reached the scene in time to assist him . The sound of a shot drifted down to him , followed presently by a far , faint cry of terror . What had happened was this : Keller , turning away from preliminary to descending . He was surprised to see a horse and rider halfway between him and the aspen tongue . To him , too , there came a swift impression that it was a woman , and almost at once something in the poise of the gallant figure told him what woman . His heart leaped to meet her . He waved a hand , and broke into a run . But only for two strides . For there had come to him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again he heard the light rumble of shale , and before that had died away a sinister click . Alert in every fiber , his gaze swept the bluff -- and stopped when it met a pair of beady eyes peering at him over the edge of the precipice . The two pair of eyes fastened for what seemed like an eternity , but could have been no longer than four ticks of a clock . Neither of the men spoke . The outlaw fired first -- wildly , for the arm which held the rifle was cramped for space . Keller 's revolver flashed an answer which tore through Irwin 's teeth and went out beneath his ear . With a furious oath the man dropped his weapon and flung himself upward and forward , landing in a heap almost at the feet of the detective . " Do n't move ! " ordered the latter . Brad writhed forward awkwardly , knew the shock of another heavy bullet in his shoulder , and catching his foe by the legs dragged him from his feet . Keller 's revolver was jerked over the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close with the burly ruffian . Both of them were unarmed save for the weapons nature had given them . The detailed purpose of the struggle defined itself at once . Irwin meant by main strength to fling the detective into the gulf that descended sheer for five hundred feet . The other fought desperately to save himself by dragging his infuriated antagonist back from the edge . They grappled in silence , save for the heavy panting that evidenced the tension of their efforts . Each tried to bear the other to the ground , to establish a grip against which his foe would be helpless . Now they were on their knees , now on their sides . Over and over they rolled , first one and then the other on top , shifting so fast that neither could clinch any temporary advantage . Illustration : THEY GRAPPLED IN SILENCE SAVE FOR THE HEAVY PANTING THAT EVIDENCED THE TENSION OF THEIR EFFORTS . Page 340 Yet Keller , with a flying glance at the cliff , knew that he was being forced nearer the gulf by sheer strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn , was not fighting to win , but to kill . He cared not whether he himself also went to death . He was obsessed by the old primeval lust to crush the life out of this lusty antagonist , and his whole gigantic force was concentrated to that end . He scarce knew that he was wounded , and he cared not at all . Backward and forward though the battle went , on the whole it moved jerkily toward the chasm . The end came with a suddenness of which Larrabie had but an instant 's warning in the swift flare of joy that lit the madman 's face . His foot , searching for a brace as he was borne back , found only empty space . Plunged downward , the nester clung viselike to the man above , dragged him after , and by the very fury of Irwin 's assault flung him far out into the gulf head-first . It was Phyl Sanderson 's cry of horror that Healy heard . She had put her horse up the steep at a headlong gallop , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that witnessed two men hurled over the precipice into space . She slipped from the saddle , and sank dizzily to the ground , not daring to look over the cliff at what she would see far below . Waves of anguish shot through her and shook her very being . A man bent over her , and gave a startled cry . " My heaven , it 's Phyl ! " he cried . " Yes . " She spoke in a flat , lifeless voice he could not have recognized as hers . " Where is he ? What 's become of him ? " Healy demanded . She told him with a gesture , then flung herself on the turf , and broke down helplessly . The outlaw went to the edge and looked over . The gulf of air told no story except the obvious one . No wingless living creature could make that descent without forfeiture of life . He stepped back to the girl and touched her on the shoulder . " Come . " She looked up , shuddering , and asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With you ? It was you that drove him to his death , and I loved him ! " " Never mind that now . Come . " " I hate you ! I should kill you when I got a chance ! Why should I go with you ? " she asked evenly . He did not know why . He had no definite plan . All he knew was that his old world lay in ruins at his feet , that he must fly through the night like a hunted wolf , and that the girl he loved was beside him , forever free from the rival who lay crushed and lifeless at the foot of the cliff . He could not give her up now . He would not . The old savage instinct of ownership rose strong in him . She was his . He had won her by the fortune of war . He would keep her against all comers so long as he had life to fight . Night was falling softly over the hills . They would go forth into it together to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feet and brought up her horse . She looked at him in a silence that stripped him of his dreams . " Come ! " he said again , between clenched teeth . " Not with you . I do n't know you . Leave me alone . You killed him ! You 're a murderer ! " He stretched hands toward her , but she shrank from him , still in the dull stupor of horror that was on her spirit . " Go away ! Do n't touch me ! You and your miscreants killed him ! " And with that she flung herself down again , and buried her face from the sight of him . He waited doggedly , helpless against her grief and her hatred of him , but none the less determined to take her with him . Across the border he would not be a hunted man with a price on his head . They could be married by a padre in Sonora , and perhaps some day he would make her love him and forget this man that had come between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master and would tie her life inextricably to his . He stooped and caught her shoulder . She had fainted . A footfall set rolling a pebble . He looked up quickly , and almost of its own volition , as it seemed , the rifle leaped to both of his hands . A man stood looking at him across the plateau of the summit . He , too , held a rifle ready for instant action . " So it 's you ! " Healy cried with an oath . " Have you killed him ? " The outlaw lied , with swift , unblazing passion : " Yes , Buck Weaver , and tossed his body to the buzzards . Your turn now ! " " Then who is that with you there ? " " The woman you love , the woman that turned you and him down for me , " taunted his rival . " After I 've killed you we 're going off to be married . " " Only a coyote would stand behind a woman 's skirts and lie . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healy asked nothing better than an even break . He might have killed with impunity from where he stood . Yet pantherlike , he swiftly padded six paces to the left , never lifting his eyes from his antagonist . Buck waited , motionless . " Are you ready ? " The outlaw 's weapon flashed to the level and cracked . Almost simultaneously the other answered . Weaver felt a bullet fan his cheek , but he knew that his own had crashed home . The shock of it swung Healy half round . The man hung in silhouette against the sky line , then the body plunged to the turf at full length . Buck moved forward cautiously , fearing a trick , his eyes fastened on the other . But as he drew nearer he knew it was no ruse . The body lay supine and inert , as lifeless as the clay upon which it rested . Once sure of this Buck turned immediately to Phyllis . A faint crackling of bushes stopped him . He waited , his eyes fixed on the edge of the precipice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him the slipping of displaced rubble . He was all eyes and ears , tense and alert in every pulse . From out of the gulf a hand appeared and groped for a hold . Weaver stepped noiselessly to the edge and looked down . A torn and bleeding face looked up into his . " Good heavens , Keller ! " Buck was on his knees instantly . He caught the ranger 's hand with both of his and dragged him up . The rescued man sank breathless on the ground and told his story in gasped fragments . "  - -  caught on a ledge -- hung to some bushes growing there -- climbed up -- lay still when Healy looked over -- a near thing -- makes me sick still ! " " It was a millionth chance that saved you -- if it was a chance . " " Where 's Healy ? " Weaver pointed to the body . " We fought it out . The luck was with me . " A faint , glad , terrified little cry startled them both . Phyllis was staring with dilated eyes at the man restored to her from the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretched hands . " My little girl . " " Oh , Larry ! I do n't understand . I thought --  --  " He nodded . " I reckon God was good to us , sweetheart . " Her arms crept up and round his neck . " Oh , boy -- boy -- boy . I thought you were -- I thought you were --  --  " She broke down , but he understood . " Well , I 'm not , " he laughed happily . Catching sight of Buck 's grim , set face , Larrabie explained what scarce needed an explanation . " You 'll have to excuse us , I reckon . It 's my day for congratulations . " Phyllis freed herself and walked across to her other lover . " My friend , I know the answer now , " she told him . " I see you do . " " Don't -- please do n't be hurt , " she begged . " I have to care for him . " The hard , leathery face softened . " I lose , girl . But who told you I was a bad loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick to register . " " Not the best man , " Keller corrected , shaking hands with his rival . Phyllis summed it up in woman fashion : " My man , whether he is the best or not . It 's just that a girl goes where her heart goes . " Weaver nodded . " Good enough . Well , I 'll be going . I expect you 'll not miss me . " He turned and went down the hill alone . At the foot of it he met Jim Yeager . " What about Brill ? " the younger man asked quickly . " He 'll never rustle another cow , " Buck answered gravely . " I killed him on the top of Point o ' Rocks after an even break . " " Duke has cashed in . Game to the last . Would n't say a word to implicate his pals . But Tom has confessed everything . The boys slipped a noose over his head , and he came through right away . " Says he and Duke and Irwin helped Healy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviltry . It was just like Keller figured . The automobile was waiting for the bunch with the showfer , and took them out the old Fort Lincoln Road . Dixon knows where the gold is hidden , and is going to show the boys . " " That clears up everything , then . I judge we 've made a pretty thorough gather . " Jim looked up and indistinctly saw the lovers coming slowly down through the grove . Dusk had fallen and soon the cloak of night would be over the mountains . " Who is that ? " Buck did not look round . " I reckon it 's Keller and his sweetheart . She followed us here . " " I told her not to come . " " I expect she takes her telling from Mr. Keller . " He changed the subject abruptly . " We 'll go on down to the boys and see what 's doing . They 'll be some glad , I should n't wonder , at making a gather that cleans out the worst bunch of cutthroats and rustlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I reckon , " answered Yeager briefly . THE END
