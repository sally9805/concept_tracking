txt The State Bar Association has done well to uphold its Special Committee on the Commitment and Discharge of the Criminal Insane , for the committee 's report rebukes in words that will cut deep those who have sought , and are still seeking , to free the insane murderer Thaw . These persons are many , and they are gravely responsible . " Medical experts whose opinions can be bought for cash " ; " Judges of the Supreme Court of this State " whose heads may not always control their hearts ; " a confused jury , " and " the murderer 's family , " who secured his acquittal on the ground of his insanity , and now , by their power of wealth , attempt to have him set at large on the , ground of his sanity  --  these persons are conspiring , some willingly , some reluctantly , against the good of society . of themselves , and of the criminal himself . It is a continuing scandal . It must be stopped in this and in future cases .. But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report of the committee , that " the normal man does not commit a crime . " He must be in some degree abnormal , insane , or he would not have done the thing forbidden . Is he therefore innocent ? That he is innocent is coming more and more to be the popular opinion , as expressed-in the verdicts of petit juries . It is an erroneous opinion . Every committer of a crime is in come degree responsible for his act , and , in most cases , he is completely responsible .

Therefore this continuous performance of habeas corpus proceedings , which , by its corrupting influence , . would result ultimately in his freedom and " a repetition of his homicidal tendencies , " must cease . One issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury : Did the accused do the forbidden deed ? " Let it find him guilty or not guilty of this , without consideration of his sanity . That is a matter for the decision of medical experts , and not for the " opinions " of biased experts employed to sway the- mind of the jury . The Penal Code should be amended so that the court , " upon its own-inquiry , " may learn whether the mental deficiency of the accused is such that the - Vila might not to proceed - If nor , then hisa tub qwq upon a certificate , accompanied by rea ; sons alleged for his sanity , and sworn to by two qualified medical examiners in lunacy . - Such an amended procedure would safeguard more nearly , the interests of the accused , of his family , and of the public , and , at the same time , remove the temptations that in the Thaw case have proved too strong for members of the bar and of  --  the medical profession : -          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
