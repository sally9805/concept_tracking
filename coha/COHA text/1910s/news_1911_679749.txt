Led. by Unitarian headquarters in Bcston , efforts are being made to induce Unitarians ' of Boston , New York , Washington , and Chicago to sell existing properties and create Unitarian houses that shall be centres not only for ' religious work , but also for social service , and for missionary headquarters for . districts about them . President Taft nas urged a Unitarian cathedral for Washington , and an appeal is ' now made for funds with which ? to erect in Washington a Unitarian headquarters after the . Boston plan . The proposal to . New York was that the Church of the Messiah and All Souls ' Church be sold and a Unitarian headquarters created . The proceeds in sight were *2,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale , and that its Trustees were open to suggestions as to where to go and what to do . The answer " of  --  the Messiah is , however , a negative one . The new Messiah Church house will occupy the site fronting on Park Avenue , in teh rear of the church itself . There is now a chapel on it , but this is to be torn down . A four-story building will take its place , to contain assembly room , gymnasium. classrooms , bowling alley , and other equipments of a first-class club . Speaking yesterday of the Boston proposition and of the Messiah 's plans , the Rev. Mr. Holmes said : - " The Trustees of the Church of the Messiah have decided once for all to keep the church  --  where it is and to snake it serve in greater measure than heretofore the needs of its neighborhood . The church is becoming more democratic , and I hope we may be able soon to abolish pew rents . One of our Trustees is the architect of the new church house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in it religious work on modern lines . " RABBI WISE ATTACKS CASTE . Thinks the Democratic Spirit in America is Being Broken Down . " If Benjamin Franklin were living today he could not be Third Assistant Secretary of any European embassy , much less an American Ambassador , " said Rabbi Stephen S. Wise at the morning service in the Free Synagogue at Carnegie Hall yesterday , when he preached on " Class and Caste in Our American Democracy . " That the democratic spirit of the country is menaced gravely by a rising spirit of caste , made manifest daily in many directions , was the belief of the speaker , who enumerated many recent items of news in support of his declaration . He said also that he was fearful of trade schools and the growing cry for efficiency , and would like to know who is back of them , and whether the promoters expect to accomplish more than merely to make the workers more perfect machines He deplored the growth of the Sons of the American Revolution and kindred organizations , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scantest sympathy for the ideals of those who made their membership possible and possessing even less regard for the welfare of present-day revolutionists . " Fellow-Jews , " he said , " not only are we sons and daughters of 100 revolutions , but we are brothers and sisters of the Russian revolution  --  infinitely more lustilled than the American revolution . ' In speaking of an " American moneyed caste , " the clergyman said : ' It is a present matter of discussion whether a distinguished captain of industry descended from an English King . I can easily believe he did  --  Richard III . might be an ancestor . " You recall also , no doubt , the case of a glorified stable boy , who , in supplying the needed information ni one of his marriages , gave his occupation as ' gentleman . ' He seems to think rich loafers are necessarily gentlemen . " The speaker declared that all high school fraternities and sororities should be forbidden by the authorities , and expressed regret that college societies can not be reached by similar means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
