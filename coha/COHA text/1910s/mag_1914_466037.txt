NEW YORK would have been a more interesting city if it had climbed over the island of Man-hattan instead of grad-ing and squaring it all into such a checker-board pattern . You see that in Central Park , where the original rocks have been left about as they were , and the roads follow more or less the lines of least resistance . There are hills in the Park , and the roads run around them ; dales and gullies that the roads and paths run through ; ponds that they skirt or cross on bridges . So it was originally with the rest of the island . It was all rocky , irregular , tumultuous , disordered . But surveyors laid it out ; not with judgment and regard for nature , as cows would have done , but in the bard fashion usual to surveyors who squint through those glasses that top their tripods , and contrive straight streets on their maps , and practise to obtain right-angled lots . And so one thing that makes Central Park so great a medicine is the soothing contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there out of the monotony of streets that run east and west and avenues that stretch interminably north and south into one considerable tract where a straight line is a great rarity . The Mall has straight lines and is level . Some of the meadows are level enough to play tennis on , but flats that are really flat , and straight lines and right angles , are happily rare in Central Park . If our Park were fully appreciated it would be like the street-cars ? the seats all taken and folks waiting for some one to come out so they could crowd in . As it is , it gathers in a wonderful number of people . Its most remarkable feature is the human life that so abounds in it . It is two miles and a half long and about ha l fa mile wide , and in the daylight hours its population varies onlyfrom thick to dense . It is dense on Saturdays in May , when the school children have May parties there , and on fair Sunday afternoons , and on most fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the mornings it is not so full , but abounds in babies and small children and their nurses or mothers , and in riders on the bridle-path , and carriages and motor-cars and fortunate beings who are out of a job and have leisure to sit on a bench and smoke a pipe and take the air . I never counted the people in the Park at any one time , but that was because there were always too many to count . I never got up in the night to inspect the Park , but I presume there are people there at night . In Paris at about eleven o'clock a man with a drum goes about the Tuileries Gardens and beats a warning to all the people to go home , and when they have gone the Gardens are locked up . But the Park is never emptied and closed like that . It is lighted at night as the streets are , but not so much but that people who are at the time of life to be interested in moonlight can observe it there to good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight must be very charming , walks where one gets it filtered through the treetops , seats a little retired , where one can see it reflected in the water . The walk around the reservoir ? think what it must be when the temperature is about right and the wind just enough , and the moon neither too young nor too mature and the Company suitable ! Of course moonlight on the Hudson seen from the Riverside has delectable points , but if She lives on the East Side that is just that much farther off , and less retired ? almost , indeed , like being at the theater ? and the river and the passing boats and all may he just a little too distracting . I have never myself walked around the Park reservoir by moonlight , for I came to live in New York at rather an advanced age , but I am sure that exercise is not neglected , nor the observation of the moon efFects on the lake , or on the yacht-pond , nor the straggle of the moonlight through the branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roll of the meadows in that soft light . I am sure , because in New York you must go into some park to get much good of moonlight and because whenever there is much of anybody in the Park a notable proportion of them are lovers . Whenever I go there I see lovers in profusion . I never have been very early in the morning , when the Kneipp-cure enthusiasts go to walk barefoot in the dewy grass , and another lot of health-seekers go to drink mineral waters , but I guess the lovers are there then . The babies would VOL . CXXVIIT ? No. 765. - 44 hardly be out at that hour , but the lovers might . Nothing daunts them . The last time I passed the pavilion was in the morning , and there were three pairs of lovers in it , each looking out at a different prospect . That was in mid-November , late in the season . I came across the Park from Seventy-seventh Street in the late afternoon a few days later , and they abounded . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down with my back to the Needle of Cleopatra to watch it through the bare branches of trees which interlace very beautifully there . A handsome urchin of six or seven years , in white clothes , sped back and forth on roller-skates and was so obviously a parlor-bred child that T began to wonder who was looking after him . There was nobody near but a dark-haired girl walking up and down with a young European who was talking with great earnestness and more docution with the hands than is common to us Yankees . I wondered what he was saying . Whatever it was , she responded in kind , and seemed so much occupied that I could not connect her with the urchin until suddenly on his skates he bore down on her and seized hold of her dress with the confidence of a proprietor . It is gratifying when a nurse-maid is able to illuminate her labors like that with timely beams of courtship . The Park abounds in nurse-maids and their charges , as it does in carriage people , invalids , people of leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Park ( not all of them very edifying ) to Shakespeare , Daniel Webster , Burns , Scott , Fitz-Greene Halleck , and other deserving people , but there is no monument to the nurse-maid , by far more deserving than any of them of such recognition . There should be such a monument done by the best hand in the business and placed either where the effigy of Shakespeare now looks down on the lively children who play tag year after year around its base , or else over by the Menagerie , within sight of the cormorants and sacred animals . Perhaps when the Arsenal at the Sixty-fourth Street entrance is remove its The Nurse-maid will find a place on ts site , with tulip-beds all about her . And there should be space on its pedestal for hundreds of names of honest women who have been faithful to other people 's children , including one who was faithful to some I knew , and who wearily declared that she " had seen those animals until she knew every hair on their backs . " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and neglect their charges or are not kind to them , and I have myself seen the sun shining too strong in babies ' eyes ; but on the whole they give the observer reassurance about human life . For it must be tiring to stand by , or even sit by , while children play ? and they do it by the hour ? and for other They children . They are paid ? Yes , they are paid , but it is incredible that money could buy nurse-maids if it were not eked out with that golden affection with which little children pay their own debts . The nurse-maids encourage one about life , and so , of course , do the lovers . And there might be a pair of lovers in marble or bronze in i the Park , but I am not for it . It is not necessary . The lovers will always be there ; for they have a habit of infesting parks and have had since ages before Horace heard their lenes susurri in the Campus Martius . And they will immortalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't put up statues of people for doing what was pleasant , but for doing what was hard . But justly and with reason we may rejoice in the lovers , and that they can do it , and that , in the teeth of all the agitation about who shall vote , and who shall make the laws , and who shall make the fire , and who shall support the family , and who shall rule it , and eugenic marriage , and the double standard , and all the disputable questions and all the unspeakable ones , still out of the vast treasury of nature there should he furnished this tireless procession of lovers who find that in life which they wish may continue , and walk in the - Park and plot to keep it up . There are buildings in the Park ? some that are necessary to its maintenance , like farm buildings on a farm : stables for horses and sheds for carts and wheelbarrows , tool-houses , shelter for the sheep that graze on the meadows , yards where shrubs are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposi-tories , and those there are well placed , where they are not too visible . For in respect to that , and in all the particulars of landscape architecture , the Park was very well laid out , and is a work on which no considerable improvements have ever been de-manded . Land is so scarce and so dear in the central part of Manhattan Is-land that there is a regular recurrence of effort to plant in the Park something which does not be-long there and for which there is no space to spare . Our metropolitan fam-ily grows so fast and changes so much from decade to dec-ade that there is not much permanence t of tradition in it , and again and again the Park 's defend-ers have to be ral-lied against vandal intruders with a conviction that one more art-gallery or museum or concert-hall or something else , in the Park , would be a great boon to the people and would still leave room enough for grass and trees and roads . For the last thirty or forty years it has been possible to defeat all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of territory that the Park had to make was to the M etropolitan Museum of Art . The Museum , however , serves two great purposes : it is splendid as a museum ( except that the old red-brick part of it makes rather a harsh assault on the landscape and the eye ) and it is very effective as a horrible example of the consequences of starting any kind of building , not necessary to a park , in the Park inclosure . As a museum , the Museum is a palace of delights ; by far the greatest treasure-house in all the country ; but as a Park property , it is a formidable intruder , vast , heavy , addicted ro excessive growth , and reproachful to the greeneries it pushes into . Of course it will stay where it is , and it must be admitted that it supplements in its way the work of recreation to which the Park is dedicated , but let us hope that when once its square has been inclosed and it is a completed structure , the collections it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , most of them go back to the sixties or thereabouts and are ugly little buildings , but of no consequence , because in due time they will all be replaced by better ones . One would like to see even now how the sort of taste and skill that made the new Park Avenue and the Forty-second Street station , or the buildings of the Bronx Zoo , w. ould express itself in a new Casino and a new Tavern and Menagerie and all the rest ; and one could wish that even now there was a tea-house in the Park that was as simple and attractive as some that are in the Bois de Boulogne . But Father Knickerbocker has been extravagant , and these matters can wait ; and meanwhile the present Casino and the present Tavern at McGowan 's Pass are amusing reminders of how bad our taste was in the trotting-horse and road-house days of the heroic sixties , and how much less accomplished we still are than the French in the purveying of picturesque refreshment . The admirable skill of Vaux that contrived our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it invisibly , and did the other feats that left it beautiful , so led i a drive around it as to extend it to the length of seven miles . In older days , when horses still hauled or carried us , that was about as far as carriage people had time to go of an afternoon . Now that the motor-car is the prevailing vehicle , the Park seems smaller , for the automobiles , however restrained , maintain a higher speed than horses did , and keep it tip much more steadily . Of course the motor-cars crowd the roads in the afternoon ; of course they make the crossings more hazardous than they used to be ; of course they diffuse some odors of gasolene , though that is better than it was , and they have been almost broken of the obnoxious habit of smoking . If motor-cars were not underfoot or coming toward us everywhere and every minute , they would doubtless be the ruin of the Park , which admits them all , hired or proprietary . But since they have become so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised not to find one in hed with him , the adventurous and resourceful spirit of man seems to have adjusted itself to them , and in the roads of the Park , as on all other roads , they are now accepted as something that has naturally happened and belongs in every scene . They have quickened the moving picture of the drive for the people who walk , or who sit and look on , and to many of whom that moving picture is the liveliest and greatest attraction the Park offers . They have changed the Park , as they have changed the rest of life , but the Park survives as life does , and there is no strong sentiment now in favor of their exclusion . No kind of a motor , not even a motor-cycle , has been devised that can make a successful claim to rights on the Park 's bridle-path , and there the horses still have things their own way . On good days there are many riders , some for pleasure , some for advertisement , some for adventure , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many for health . One sees all the kinds of riding and all the kinds of horses . They are much observed , and add very much to the Park spectacle , but observation of them has never become such a feature of life in New York as inspection of the riders in Rotten Row seems to be of life in the season in London . One goes into the Museum and looks at Hobbemas and Ruysdaels and Corots and Constables and Claude Lorraines , and Innesses , and whatever else in that line it has , and asks himself what he sees and how much , and gradually acquires from contemplation and comparison some notion of the merits of the landscape-painters . Out-of-doors all over the Park , wherever one goes , there is the chance for the same sort of training of the vision and taste ; for the development of perception and appreciation , and the cultivation of a consciousness of beauty . That is , in a way , a medicine for the spirit , and in nothing is the Park more valuable to us city-dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the streets , we see lots of people , and automobiles and horses and all manner of buildings that are worth looking at , and in the picture-shops pictures of great interest , and in the shop-windows gems and beautiful fabrics and various treasures of art , but the only place on Manhattan Island where we can study rural landscapes is in Central Park . If we learn to see what is there , we learn much , and wherever we go in the country where there are trees and grass and water and sky we shall see more of them and more in them because of what we have learned to see in our own strip of mid-island scenery , saved for us out of a great sea of houses , and bordered by its fringe of cliffs of masonry . It could be wished that the frequenters of the Park dealt somewhat more gently i with it , that the necessary restrictions about going on the grass were better respected , that the shrubs and trees were not broken nor the Bowers pilfered ; but as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could wish were different . The family that uses our Park is very large , and not all its members have been well brought up . The tenement district which stretches all the way up the island on the east side and well up to the neighborhood of the Park on the west , abounds in recent accessions from Europe to our family ; a changing population which is imperfectly affected by any standard of deportment . So the Park is within easy reach of thousands of people who do not know how it should be treated . It is fortunate for them that they can get to it , for they need it , but it is not so fortunate for the Park . To see a troop i of ravaging school-boys cross it in the late afternoon makes one fairly tremble for its future . But , after all , it is a part of the great school of New York , a school under constant pressure of throngs of people new come to a land of promise and needing to be taught the rudiments of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
