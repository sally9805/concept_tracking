txt In peace talk , as in everything else , the German mind and the un-German mind never meet . However , in the matter of peace talk , unlike other things , It is at least easy to see why they never meet , to see the line on which the German mind is running . The German mind Is preoccupied with the idea that if the war does not end in a German conquest of so much of the world as it wants , it must end in a three-card monte game in a dark room , because those are the two ways in which European wars for a hundred years have ended . As all wars since the fall of NAPOLEON have ended in either one of these ways or the other , the German mind accepts it as an axiom that this war is going to end in that way . ' Since it is becoming manifest that the war is not likely to end in the first of these ways , Germany is resigning herself to the Idea that it may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she may be willing to accept that disagreeable alternative , she appears to expect a rejoicing and grateful cheer from her adversaries , and to be offended that she does not get it . The course with nearly all the wars of the past hundred years has been uniform . When they have been fought to a point where either the people of the warring Powers or semis other Powers became peevish and discontented , a halt has been called . The belligerents , and not infrequently some of the bystander Powers as well , have then assembled themselves around a table for a game of skill  --  not in the least a game of chance ? in which everything was permissible , including dealing from the sleeve or the bottom of the pack . The most adroit sleightof-hand operator rose from the table with most of the stakes ; the least adroit , who was generally Russia , , escaned with his life . The losing players , feeling aggrieved at having ' been overreached , then made preparations as speedily as might be for a new war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These games were called " peace conferences , " and a manipulator of the shell game at a county fair would have been ashamed . of their unsportsmanlike character .. Germany did not expect that the qwq fashion . She expected it to terminate In the Franco-Prussian way ; her idea was to end it like BISMARCK , not like NAPOLEON III . But things have not gee as they did in 1870 , and so , making the best of it , she proposes what , according to all the precedents of a hundred years , must be the only alternative  --  the truck-and-dicker meeting , in which she feels pretty confident her players will be the most adroit . This and nothing else is what Chancellor MICHAELIS means when he says : We must , by means of understanding and in a spirit- of give-and-take , guarantee conditions of the existence of the German Empire upon the Continent and overseas . And it is precisely that idea at which LLOYD GEORGE strikes in his refusal to hear a word from Germany until she has pronounced the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies mean , is that although those are the two ways in one of which all ' the wars of the nineteenth and early twentieth century have ended , this war is not going to end in either of them . This war is not a war between Kings , who , having fought to a good bargaining position , can sit down at a table and swap their subjects , and other Kings ' subjects , too , and rise to plan for the next war . This is a war between the principle which made such iniquitous bargaining possible and another principle , a new principle , the principle that the war is the people 's affair , and that it must end not in bargaining but in justice , not in truck and dicker but in verdict and sentence . Though wars have not ended hn that way on the European Continent , they have ended in that way on the American Continent ; and this time , if never before , a'war on the European Continent is going to end in that way .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
