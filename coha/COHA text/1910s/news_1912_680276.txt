txt Possibly the Board of Object to Education In Huntington , Athletic West Va. , is unduly Language . troubled about small things  --  and about small things , too , which are not necessarily bad and only seem so to those morbidly sensitive . For that dignified and important board , it appears , instead of devoting its large minds to solution of the large problems which the public schools of every town present , has undertaken the task of editing out of the " yells " with- which the boys encourage their athletic teams everything considered slangy and vulgar by the official critics . The result is that the amended ululations have been scornfully rejected by the youth of Huntington , and , rather than use them , they declare that they will give up athletic sports altogether . Just what the condemned cries were has not , perhaps fortunately , been revealed , but certain is it that slang is an important part of every language and that in every language all the best words are vulgar , so the Huntingtonian purists need better justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys than the accuracy of these appellations . It may be , of course , that when the board uses the word " vulgar " it means something quite different . A vast number of people make that mistake , but It is one which educational magnates should have been careful enough to avoid , and in not exercising that care they were guilty of the one real sin which slang sometimes illustrates  --  that of diverting words from their original and proper signifloarece , and doing it without the excuse that no words to express the intended meaning are in existence . If the purpose of the board was to suppress indecency or profanity , it should have said so , and if there had been anything of either to suppress , nobody , young or old , could have complained , however vigorous the action taken . In language there is room for diversity of taste , and expressions are not reprehensible simply because they are not appropriate for all occasions . Elegance of diction has its place , but so has diction in which elegance gives way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its brightest ornaments to the inventive powers of those whose locutions were caned slang , and were slang , - until after they had vindicated by . usage their right to a more respectful treatment by the lexicographers and others . Denial is made in beStraightening half of the New Ro Out a chelle Water Company . of a recent statement Grievance In this column to the effect that it had announced as a. reduction of rates what was really an increase , and , in reply to the assertion that much of the water supplied to consumers is Undrinkable because of an evil odor , there is presented an authoritative certificate of analysis from the Lederle laboratories which shows that the New Rochelle water contains no pathogenic bacteria and therefore could not transmit disease . A copy of the notice which revealed the change in rates confirms the denial . The word " reduction " is not used . The statement made is that - " the yearly minimum rate for water will be $9 instead ' of *12 , for Which 4,000 cubic feet will be al " IeWeef'als minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge ; for all Water above the minimuru was increased , without mentioning the fact increaid , . it is not unnatural that the , r local papers announced the change as a reduction . They had n't stopped to figure up what - the effect of the rate revision would be on the semi-annual bills of the average . consumer , who uses much more than the allowed minimum . As . for- the Lederle analysis , while that ia'fioubtlesEi reassuring for those who are unable to , buy bottled spring water , it explicitly admits that the only charge made ' against the quality of the New Rochelle water was true . The chemist says on this point : " Odor ( heated to , 100 degrees Fahrenheit ) ? fishy . " He might have said with equal truth , had he thought-of it , that the water is just about as " fishy " ' when it runs unheated out of the taps . But there ! the New Rochelle Water Company ' is n't the worst corporation of its-.class , by any means . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good . deal of pains not to do So ; also , In the Summer of 1811 , when many another Westchester town was put on the shortest of short water rations , and some of them went without altogether , New Rochelle had , if not a plentiful supply , at least enough to get along with In safety and comfort . Just the same , every town ought to own its own water works , and not to do so is an evidence of gross municipal stupidity and of almost criminal lack . of foresight . Connecticut 's Public It Did n't Utilities Commission is See somewhat fiercely attacked by The Hartford the Point . Courant because of its recent order to the New Haven Railroad in regard to cross-overa . The order is that whenever a train approaches a cross-over of short curvature , it shall come to a dead stop before proceeding to the other track , and towermen are forbidden to change fhe switches for trains the engineers of which disobey this rule . It is to this second provision that The Courant objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made for the reason that there is something ahead , presumably another train , into which the first would run if it did not make the change , and , as there must be something the matter with an engineer who breaks rules ** a way that perils his own life - even more than those of his passengers , The Courant thinks that the order is likely to cause as many accidents of one kind as it prevents of another . There is something in this criticism , but , not much . For one thing , cross-overs are often made for other reasons than because there is a train in the next block . For another , an engineer who , while making up time , might be willing to take the risk of changing from track to track at high speed , would be much more reluctant to rush into some inevitable kind of trouble . Of course the Utilities Commission issued its order , not for the purpose of delaying travel by a lot of useless stops , but in the expectation that the inconvenience of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That effect the order has already had , and The Courant , Instead of scolding the Commissioners for what it thinks or says is their incompetency as railway managers , might better have praised their shrewdness
