YOUR last letter from across the Atlantic , my dear Father , can not but stir in any reflecting mind a world of thought ; and in one like myself ? a student now of things American for more than half a century ? reflections have not been wanting . I envy you indeed . My own acquaintance with sights and scenes among which you have spent years is that of the passing tourist . But you , for a long spell , have been watching at its chief centres how that multitudinous life ebbs and flows . Day after day you come into close touch with all sorts and conditions of men . You have journeyed over the land from Boston to Seattle and San Francisco . You call America ' Tomorrow , ' and this old grandmotherly Europe of ours ' Yesterday . ' With a smile you observe that in the grammar of Humanity the past tense broods over London , Berlin , and even the Third French Republic ; while the future lightens and sparkles out West , away beyond Chicago , far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doormat whereon immigrants wipe their feet as they go by the custom-house . Yet I have an advantage , you tell me , denied to those who are caught in such mighty currents ? I enjoy the privilege of distance , which is perspective . Literature and history teach me what America has been . Can I help you to forecast what America will be ? Have we grounds , you inquire , to hope that this great new people may contribute to the future ( which will surely be theirs ) any saving element whereby life shall grow richer and civilization more desirable ? That is your question . I turn it my own way , and I ask , ' What is the Religion of America ? ' In the true answer to that query lies the secret of to-morrow . How does the mind of the people judge concerning God , conscience , and immortality ? Is it still , in any sense , Christian ? It is impossible , you say , and I must agree , for those who have not lived on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is detached , as a whole , from the Eastern World to which Europe belongs . The divergence increases with some vast multiple of the distance . A fresh order of society is forming on a scale never hitherto known , with a hundred millions for its present figure , in a democracy where opinion , at least , is free . You survey this illimitable chaos of beliefs , no-beliefs , parties , professions , sects , syndicates , trusts , platforms , and it is like a glimpse of the countless glowing lines in the solar spectrum , too dazzling for the eyes of man . Who would not feel overcome at the vision ? Is there any way to master its dimensions ? Has it a law of development within it ? Or one so enormous in range , so deep and high , that our mental instruments can not detect its drift or anticipate its motions ? Well , i answer , we are only minor prophets , for whom the age to come will have many a surprise . But one thing seems clear ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which even now public opinion in the United States condemns and rejects as outworn . Reversion to the social ideas prevailing in Europe is simply not conceivable with Americans . You , my dear Father , dwelling in the midst of this onward-looking race , know well that there is not a power on earth which can persuade them to look back . Europe lives by custom and tradition , America by prophecy and adventure . This is what the New World means by progress . It has jettisoned most of the objects for which men fought three centuries ago . What has it kept ? Freedom and hope . From your side of the Ocean we appear to be the ancients , literary and picturesque , as the Greeks and Romans appear to us . Now , as I see the American idea ? let me term it so ? it stands for the average man , the common school , equal opportunities , and the fine old English proverb , ' Turn about is fair play . " Ehe common school , I say again , not the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar divine election and reprobation that Jonathan Edwards reckoned to be a doctrine ' exceedingly pleasant , bright , and sweet . ' Calvin , transplanted to New England , flourished for a time like the aloe , then withered and died . Of all the Puritan convictions , which one is now alive in the great multitude of their descendants ? Not the conviction of sin , or any strong beliefs concerning the world to come as it was imaged by the Pilgrim Fathers ; quite another view has taken hold upon them , if they do not fling the whole subject aside ; but , in any case , the reaction is complete and trenchant . Liberty for a man to make of himself what he can and will , everywhere , under all dispensations , is the shape that Nonconformity puts on . That is the American version of Burke 's celebrated phrase , ' The dissidence of Dissent , and the protestantism of the Protestant religion . ' Moreover , independence from the first carried with it a principle which may be summed up as ' free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth . Sects multiplied as they had begun ; doctrines broadened or changed into the clean contrary . The stern disciple of Calvin had a Universalist grandson . From Edwards to Emerson we follow an undoubted pedigree , but how entire is the transformation ! ' Cast behind you , ' exclaims the sage of Concord , addressing youthful ministers , ' all conformity , and acquaint men at first hand with Deity . ' He spoke to ' a decaying church and a wasting unbelief . ' He said , ' The Puritans in England and America found in the Christ of the Catholic Church , and in the dogmas inherited from Rome , scope for their austere piety and their longings for civil freedom . But their creed is passing away , and none arises in its room . ' His conclusion or his premise , ? for we may take it either way , ? was that ' miracles , prophecy , poetry , the ideal life , the holy life , exist as ancient history merely ; they are not in the belief nor in the aspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge , Massachusetts , on Sunday evening , July 15 , 1838 . It records a fact beyond question : the Sabbath rule of Puritanism over men 's minds had come to its last hour . Churches might cling to it , story-tellers perceive a sombre kind of romance in it ; but the shafts of light from Emerson 's Essays were not more eloquent than Hawthorne 's Twice-told Tales in proclaiming that Jonathan Edwards could never be the prophet of modern America . The Pilgrim Fathers and their Commonwealth sank into an episode now rounded off , not opening into the wide-ranging national procession , or guiding it any more . But the dissenter , the theorist , the aspirant , ' required no prompting from Concord to embark on seas of adventure ; they were already afloat , ? often , it must be admitted , in crazy vessels . Reform , now as always after the sixteenth century in Protestant lands , implied the breaking up of larger societies into innumerable small ones , the coming out ' from Babylon to march towards a distant New Jerusalem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thousands , a forlorn hope . But in that crisis or judgment of all things , it was still the average man whom its leaders kept in view . Those leaders might be fanatics or impostors , or a mixture of both ; among them we shall scarcely discern the tokens of intellectual greatness , and no name shines with a lustre comparable to the glory of some latter-day seers in Europe . Dreamers wild enough we watch as they struggle in convulsive nightmares ; but they dream no poetic dreams . From a stranger , Swedenborg , they have won the ideas , and on his pattern they have shaped the mythology , which they offer as a substitute or supplement to the Hebrew-English Bible . Mark , I say , that name . Swedenborg is the predestined destroyer of Puritanism , who discloses to men wearied of its terrible dogmas a new heaven and a new earth , prosaic , solid , near at hand , to be reached by experiment or by deliberately sought ecstasy . He is the father of Mormons , Spiritualists , Second Adventists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestor , several times removed , of Mrs. Eddy and her Christian Science . Swedenborg occupies in the develop- ment of these modern religions a place corresponding to that of Bacon as regards the Inductive Method . He is at once popular and scientific in appearance ; he makes a boast of his experimental triumphs which others who are competent will not allow ; and he does , in truth , help to ruin older false interpretations of the universe , though failing to establish any of his own . Nevertheless , one principle ? and that essentially Baconian ? this ghost-seer , as Kant named him , did so blazon forth as to make it a central illumination by which Americans , the leaders and the led , were sure that they could not go astray . To Swedenborg are applicable the curiously exact words of Hawthorne touching this entire movement : ' If he profess to tread a step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world , yet he carries with him the laws of our actual life , and extends them over his preternatural conquests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin veil easily swept aside , between this world and the next . When an American authoress depicted The Gates Ajar , by which angels came to earth and souls went to Paradise , it seemed no more trouble to make that little journey than to enter a neighbor 's garden . America lay on both sides of the veil , ? again let me quote Hawthorne , ? ' a country where there is no shadow , no antiquity , no mystery , no picturesque and gloomy wrong , nor anything but a commonplace prosperity , in broad and simple daylight . ' You recognize the picture , my dear friend , do you not ? How unlike our crime-laden , storm-tossed Europe ! My charming American friends often tell me that I am a pessimist , and wonder that I should be . I wonder at them . But every new company of religious pilgrims starting from East to West in the United States goes out not merely // to discover but to found Utopia . The sect is always a business concern , the prophet a promotor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smart money-changing . Observe , I do not say that the temple is nothing else . Reform , thrown into articles and loudly proclaimed , determines what these believers shall eat , drink , avoid , acquire , and give up . They may be Socialists with Fourier , Shakers with Anne Lee 's disciples , Mormons in the grasp of Brigham Young , dwellers at Oneida Creek with Noyes , enthusiasts that follow T. L. Harris from Mountain Cove to Santa Rosa ; but their intent is ever to set up a Commonwealth on the idea of Perfection . New England has inoculated its descendants with a fever for migration in quest of this Eldorado , where heaven and earth shall be one . They are prospecting for the Garden of Eden . Before they reach its angel-guarded gates Swedenborg intercepts them once more . He whispers to each new Adam and Eve the secret long ago consigned to Platonic Dialogues which only scholars read , of ' heavenly counterparts , ' or marriages made in heaven . I am not speaking figuratively ; you may track the amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the life and writings of Harris or Laurence Oliphant , in the Pantagamy of Noyes ; and , as I am persuaded , it lies below the facility and multiplication of American divorce , a sub-conscious but powerful instinct , vulgarized into the ' elective affinities ' which we laugh at and loathe . ' The more intelligent , ' said Emerson , ' are growing uneasy on the subject of marriage ; they wish to see the character also represented in that co enant . ' Yes , and Salt Lake City , Oneida , and Reno , have replied to the gentle ' Oversoul ' with a vengeance , by new-forming or getting rid of the ' cove nant ' as a step toward improving the ' character . ' Utah gloried in its polygamy ; the ' sealing ' of hapless young maidens to dead Joseph Smith might scandalize Gentiles , but it went on for a generation . T. L. Harris , whom his disciple and victim , Laurence Oliphant , depicted under the features of Masollam , a dull profligate , taught in appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall say what this new ordering of the most sacred of human relations involved ? The Mormon creed was plain and simple . ' God 's service , ' they said , ' is the enjoyment of life . ' Americans , we know well , did not as a people follow after Brigham Young , or Harris , or Noyes , any more than they shut themselves up at Mount Lebanon with the Shakers , or trooped out with Ripley to Brook Farm . But is it doing vast numbers of them an injustice to believe that they , too , consider enjoyment the first and greatest of the Commandments ? The old religion preached self-sacrifice ; what could a new one oppose to it but self-indulgence ? Respect for law is an English principle , and it was carried over to Massachusetts with English law-books . Yet the sects which have sprung up in America , display anarchic tendencies not to be mistaken . The average man wants to feel himself free ; the average woman has opportunities of living her own life denied to most of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the club or the hotel brings them together . Add now some reform to propagate , some universal liberty or prohibition to be spread ' from Maine to Oregon , ' as the saying runs , ? a crusade against slavery , or whiskey , or in favor of a vegetarian diet , or to get ready for the Millennium , ? your club turns into the semblance of a church , your hotel becomes a pulpit , and your dining-room the meeting-place of souls . But the most remarkable instances of free association in the United States , from a native religious point of view , I take to be Mormonism , Spiritualism , and Christian Science . These are genuine products of the American soil and climate . At once original , daring , commonplace , and attractive to fugitives from the established religions , they may offer to us elements , or even inchoate and rudimentary forms , of the idea which we are seeking . Repulsive forms , if you will , impostures disguised as superstitions , trading on ignorance and credulity ; symptoms in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spirituality , yet imbued throughout with a cold and dead materialism . ' I grant all that and more ; but , as Aristotle shrewdly observes , a man may get light on his ruling passions and motives even from his bad dreams ; and here we can study dreams that , as they move and stir the dreamers , ' confront peace , security , and all settled laws , to unsettle them . ' Where shall we look for the future ? Not in faint shadows of the once all-venturing Puritans ; therefore outside , among explorers , or on their track . The American idea lives elsewhere than in Baptists , Methodists , or any of the earlier Calvin-descended Churches ; for it quitted them long ago . I hear it in a word of Emerson 's , ' America is the home of man . ' It babbles a kind of foolish fairy tale when the Mormon declares that his Continent was peopled from the lost Ten Tribes ; and that America is the true land of Israel . It plays a game of blind man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with mediums , trances , frantic beatings at the door of the tomb . It goes about staggering amid delusions , calling on those who have passed over ' to answer its questions . It dances ghostly ' Pentecostal ' dances after the fashion of Red Indians , falling back upon customs that are only to be found on this side of the world among the dervishes of Islam , who scream themselves into ecstasy by repeating the name of Allah . In regard to marriage , as we have seen , it substitutes for monogamy the most varied forms ; sets up as a model the wigwam or the harem ; and tolerates something not unlike Free Love by its criminal readiness in granting divorce . This American spirit has made trial of Socialism under many schemes , all ending in failure ; but still it struggles to reconcile the laws of production and distribution with even-handed justice , although its vision is confused by the immense respect which it has always felt for success , whether clean or unclean . It makes laws in the interest of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet again , it breaks laws by appealing to the Higher , or the Unwritten Law ; and it is so entangled in casuistries that because of a comma misplaced it will allow a murderer to go free . It is soft even to sentimentalism , but permits Judge Lynch to work his will in ways that are not to be described . Its ' Bird of Freedom ' is a jest and an inspiration to Lowell , who treats it as a comic symbol , yet would have died rather than give up a feather from that eagle 's wing . It is emphatically the ' spirit of the crowd , ' liable to sudden enthusiasms , unreasoning panics , to run mad about a celebrity one week and to forget him the week after . It feels hot under the slight . est breath of criticism , but can be humored like a child with a little judicious management . It is lofty , forgiving , good-natured , alert , curious , and does not suspect irony . Its age is youth ; its ambition is to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial passed into a more perilous phase when the Civil War ended by establishing democracy . And we , though strangers , look on at the vast theatre , the high stage , and the throng of actors engaged in working out this drama , with hope and fellow-feeling . For it is our play , too , since the future of mankind hangs upon it . Have I been drawing a chimera , the monster of my own imagination ? I think not ; the lines upon which I have gone may be studied in a library of books , and are visible wherever we turn amid American scenes . You have felt it as well as I , my dear friend . But you will surely be struck with a sense of the contradictions that my sketch brings out . If they can not be resolved , the ' New Thought ' of which we hear so much will defeat itself . To take a crucial instance : Reform has been the chief motive in those never-ending secessions whereby the elder Christian communities were broken into fragments . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever anything was , and it declares evil to be non-existent , therefore not in need of reform . By one stroke it makes an end of the reformer and his task . Yet , in this dilemma , the true American feels a secret , an irresistible longing to agree With both sides . He would have had slavery abolished by men like Garrison , and pain decreed to be a mere phantom by women like Mrs. Eddy . He can not give up any doctrine that seems to favor universal happiness . Logic does not trouble him , for , as I said , he goes by sentiment . His theories are nothing but his feelings , thrown into abstract terms by way of a platform whence he can address the world . At this point Shakerism puts in a claim to our attention . It is not a growing sect ; but its principles , more than forty years ago , were declared by Hepworth Dixon to be ' found in the creed of every new American Church . ' Let us inquire what these principles are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an American Church and a new dispensation , the Old Law having had its day . That intercourse between heaven and earth is restored , and that God is the only King and Governor . That the sin of Adam is atoned , man made free from all errors except his personal misdeeds , and salvation assured to the whole race . That earth is heaven now soiled and stained , but to be restored by love and labor to its primeval condition . ' With Swedenborg , the ' uniquely gifted , uniquely dangerous ' precursor of Millenarian sects , the brethren hold that the general Resurrection is already passed , the Second Advent ' here ; and they conclude that the regenerate should not marry or give in marriage , that women may be priests , that every one must labor with hands for the goods which all are to enjoy . They see the heavens open and angels ascending and descending on Jacob 's ladder . Anne Lee , the female Swedenborg , was English , not American . But the ecstatic revivals to which Shakerism owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderesses ; the community of goods , and Family of Love , are deeply rooted in old and extreme aberrations from a more sober ? shall we call it a less unworldly ? ? form of the Puritan faith . ' No soldiers , no police , no judges ' ; but also no houses of temptation to vice ; no gambling , because no speculation ; but order , temperance , frugality , worship ' ; these are features of a Utopia dear to the American heart in its Sabbath moments , when it muses on the dreams of its youth . They express a more severe judgment on the popular religion , which builds and adorns fashionable churches with gifts from Wall Street millionaires , than earthquake or tornado would be . Mount Lebanon is a sign lifted up , pointing to the consummation of the age , ' and to the need of monasticism , even in New York State . A sect , however , as the name declares , cuts itself away from the people at large , and whether Mormon or Shaker , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was room about the year 1848 ? a period marked ' stormy ' on both sides of the Atlantic ? for some great religious manifestation which , while it appealed to the general desire of novelty , should be free from articles , set ministries , church-buildings , and even the inspired Bible . A new heaven and a new earth were in request . But could not some way be found , like printing or stock-jobbing , accessible to every one who chose , by which religion might become at once private and universal , as literature was , or business , or politics ? Two considerations must be kept in view . The Puritans had revolted from Catholic tradition because they would not allow any priest , as they said , to stand between man and his Maker . By similar reasoning they had put down the invocation of Saints and Angels , in order to leave a clear space before the Great White Throne for suppliants who would draw nigh to it . The consequences we all know . Heaven receded to an immeasurable distance ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse with departed saints was no more . Religion was thus violently broken into parts which lay utterly separate ? the Here and the Hereafter ? while death forbade every attempt by prayer to bridge over the gulf between dearest friends , however they might yearn for one another . The solemn old services of Dirge and Requiem had been swept away ; and nothing had taken their place . It is true , indeed , that while Heaven was shut , Satan 's invisible world ' opened its ponderous jaws and sent forth its denizens to meet ancient crones in the forests at midnight , if the records of Salem and other witch-haunted towns in New England may be trusted . The Communion of Saints was a lost article of the creed . But the communion of devils was , on Cotton Mather 's showing , a judicially ascertained fact . Witches , executed by the hundred , may be looked on , in short , as pioneers of Spiritualism , and its earliest martyrs in the New World . They were destined to have their revenge . If instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the change ! Yet in essentials the new science and the old superstition are at one . I call Spiritualism a science , for it professed to yield its results by experiments which could be repeated , tested , and compared on the accepted laws of evidence ; to attain ' a world of spirit that took shape and form and practical intelligibility , in ordinary rooms and under very nearly ordinary circumstances . ' It said , ' Seeing is believing , handling is proof . ' It did not require you to take the medium on trust . It had no priesthood , no dogmas ; for its central statement , that the living could have intercourse with the dead , was not a truth to be received on the word of another , but a challenge which whoso would might verify . Moreover , though some have questioned if the name of religion can rightly be attached to Spiritualism , it does without doubt bring its adepts back from doctrines of the lecture-room or abstract theory to that primitive condition of thought in which religion finds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' next world , ' call it how you will . And Spiritualism undertakes to solve the problem by the scientific method , exactly as the chemist answers our inquiry , ? for instance , ' Does radium exist ? ' ? by putting a sample of the thing sought into our hands . Neither the chemist nor the medium is a priest , any more than the class or the inquirer can be termed disciples . Experiment , in both cases , remains the ground of affirmation . Now , then , we have arrived at an idea which , as it rose and overspread the civilized world , was seen to be peculiarly American . Inspired by Mesmer and ' animal magnetism , ' starting with vulgar phenomena of raps and table-turning , noised abroad by Universalist preachers and Andrew Jackson Davis , the Poughkeepsie seer , with ' sensit ives ' and clairvoyants to furnish daily evidence of its marvels , Spiritualism ran its wildfire course , outstripping elely other propaganda by the numbers who took up its practices . Any one could begin anywhere . ' Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of earnest men and women ever presented a more unlovely picture of the Hereafter . Yet in spite , or perhaps because , of the concreteness of its ideals , and the parochial limitations of its chief prophets , the new ideas had sufficient motive-power to overrun the American continent . ' They did not reveal a spiritual life as conceived by any previous form of Christianity ; angels and demons were alike absent from the trance communications of the medium ; and concerning the Supreme there was absolute silence . Neither heaven nor hell came into the scenery of a universe as matter of fact as Broadway or State Street at high noon . All the sensitive beheld was ' a practicable and imminent millennium , freed from the fear of death , and continuing , on the gray level , through indefinite generations . ' Taking the witnesses at their own value , without heeding the professional charlatan or the liar detected in the very act of imposture , we feel dumbfounded when Franklin , Washington , and Bacon deliver by the lips of entranced subjects the silliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as science lights upon every day is added to our knowledge . We can not be astonished that hardheaded rationalizers like Professor Miinsterberg flatly declare , ' The facts as they are claimed do not exist , and never will exist . ' Yet I would remind the eminent professor that science ? physical merely , and not metaphysical ? should be cautious in prophesying a universal negative . Science is quite incapable of determining a priori , that departed spirits are and ever will be unable to ' enter into communication with living men by mediums and by incarnation . ' How can the ' scientist ' possibly know ? Let him lay his hand on his lips when it is a question of what must or must not be , outside the law of contradiction . You and I , my dear friend , are agreed as Catholics in holding Spiritualism to be exceedingly dangerous , where it happens not to be false or delusive . But you will readily grant that so virulent a disease , attaching itself to American religion , is symptomatic of much . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritan theology betokened that its life was decaying at the roots . Its magic ring was broken . All its dogmas were melting into the anaemic optimism ' of an afterworld in which no difference appeared between good and evil . For the ' spirits ' never hinted at a Day of Judgment ; neither did they confirm Swedenborg 's vision of many penal abodes , or ' hells , ' to be finally transformed into heavens . Characteristic of the later religious developments in America , from Shakerism to Christian Science , is this denial of sin , which Theodore Parker had done worse than deny , defining it in a scandalous epigram as a ' falling upwards . ' But do not these phenomena bear testimony to the law of reaction as equal and opposite ? ' The witch supplants the minister ; Apollyon is chained , in Hawthorne 's deeply biting parable , to the modern fast train on the Celestial Railroad ; all men are saved , instead of most being foredoomed to perdition ; and Satan is abolished by universal suffrage . Is there nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws down the question as a defiance . But from every quarter these new theologians ' reply with a great shout , ' No , there is nothing . ' Sin and pain and death are hallucinations , scattered by the advent of a science which rests on the senses and reaches beyond them . Yet , even if a malignant disease , the movement known as Spiritualism announced a religious revolution , ? the new birth of ideas long extinct among Reformed Christians . Again , whether it was salvation by electricity , ' as in earlier stages , or by telepathy , ' as in our day , it insisted on carrying science over the border into a living and not a dead cosmos , greatly to the indignation of comfortable settlers on this side of the tomb . Life has always been a puzzle and an offense to the system of Materialism ; but life beyond the grave , in any account of it , would totally derange the snug proportions of which unbelieving physical science had been so proud . It remains true , nevertheless , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundered , so to speak , into a vast realm of obscure yet undeniable phenomena , where psychic research has laid bare operations and processes altogether strange to official biology . Man was recognized as living at once in two worlds ? the world of matter analyzed by chemistry and the world of spirit transcending matter , shaping it to ends which neither chemist nor physicist could grasp . The story of our kind was not , therefore , a by-product of atoms at play among themselves , but a chapter in the Book of Life which is wide as the universe . Atoms and ether do not by combination produce that real thing named by us the soul . On the contrary , it is the spirit ? Mind and Will , existing from before all ages ? that employs atoms and ether as its instruments , the vehicles of its message to other spirits , by laws which it has framed itself . Spiritualism was a rebellion against death , as physical science conceived of it . The rebels have won . Personality , miracles , foreknowledge , action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science ' has been compelled to admit all these things and more also ; ? a life outside earthly conditions has been revealed , justifying religion , which would it give up believing in it during the heyday of agnostic incredulity . Spiritualism , then , has stumbled upon facts by crude experiments . But it has not dealt , as a popular religion , with problems of space and time , of knowing and being , of evil and good , of will and law . ' It makes no attempt to be a theology . It is , like the American genius that gave it birth , something practical , without literary culture , or a sense of art , or metaphysical subtlety , or any very deep elements of worship . The fact to which it bears witness , we may say in the language of William James , is this , that the conscious person is continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences come ' ; but also , we must add , experiences the reverse of saving . These dark regions of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science it has invented a system that positively denies them . The wheel has come full circle from its old Puritan standpoint . Universal optimism finds a prophet and a poet of genuMe fervor in Walt Whitman , who proclaimed that the religion of Americans is America , that the common life is the best life , that ' there is no imperfection in the present , and can be none in the future . ' To him , ' Men and women , life and death , and all things , are divinely good . ' The religion of Americans is America . ' For the millions who never darken the door of a church there seems to be no other . Movements of reform , so widespread as to embrace the Continent , proceed on a determination not to rest until the evils that they combat are banished from the United States , which ought to . be the world 's Holy Land . The so-called New Thought is American by origin , deliberately suppresses reference to evil , and instead of the Lord 's Prayer says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Such ' concrete therapeutics ' are natural to a young and self-confident people , whose principle has been pithily summed up by R. W. Trine : ' One need remain in hell no longer than one chooses . ' Mindcure is American ; Mrs. Eddy could have flourished nowhere else than among a people who adore financial success and suffer from chronic indigestion . All these varieties of religious experience may be resolved into Pantheism ; but they derive their language and not a little of their power from Emerson , who was a New Englander to the core . American ideals furnish to all such evangelists an object and an inspiration . They have none of them been transplanted from the Old World or the Christian Gospels . Let me bind these divers threads together . Americans once believed ' with shuddering in man 's total depravity , from which only the small number of the elect were redeemed . They now believe that man is by nature good , by destiny perfect , and quite capable of saving himself . But in a sort of ' ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane life toward which they ought ceaselessly to be tending . The Commonwealth is their goal , business their way to heaven , progress their duty , free competition their method . Mystery , obedience , self-denial are repugnant to them . But they admire self-discipline when it rejects what is beneath man 's dignity , or , in deference to a fine idea , practices temperance . They are a breed of heroes rather than ascetics ; Western not Eastern ; not contemplatives , nor cloistered , nor exactly humble in their thoughts before God or man . If there is to be election , they are the elect : in any case leaders of a New Israel to the Land of Promise . For , as Whitman sings , ' Never was average man , his soul , more energetic , more like a God ' ? meaning the average American of these States . Whitman is very bold . However , when the true democracy dawns , it will acknowledge the ' essential sacredness of every one , ' or , as was said of old , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be not an average but a comradeship . In very rude or even brutal forms of association this divine germ may be perceived under heaps of dross . When Emerson cultivates it , the name is friendship and the atmosphere love . Nothing more severe has been charged upon Puritanism than that it made a religion of hatred . Those who left its precincts to become Unitarians or Universalists founded their new beliefs on kindness , which they judged to be the Highest Law . Herein they were eminently American and democratic . I am saying no word in support of the doctrines at which they arrived as religious teachers . But this Law of Kindness it certainly was that gave its death-blow to the Puritan theology . In like manner the American insists on freedom , and his marching song of the Republic declares , not less truly than passionately , that it is worth dying for . But this freedom can be no other than the individual 's choice to live a moral , an heroic life . He has broken out of the cast-iron system that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is progressive because he is free . He will build up , as I said , and not be thrust onwards blindly into the New Jerusalem . Civilization becomes an enterprise , and the future an object , to this adventurer , simply for the reason that he can create them as he will . The Divine Power is his Friend , not his Fate ; and his belief in human nature as something of intrinsic value , to be made perfect hereafter , is the free acceptance of a Divine Idea which it is man 's duty to realize . Thus civilization and Religion are but different facets of the same glory . With pure metaphysical speculation the American does not concern himself . He is more English than the Englishman by his inability to feel an interest in problems which the Greek or the German philosopher spent his life in brooding over . At length a name has been found for this deliberate suppression of metaphysics ; and the late William James taught us to call it Pragmatism . On such a showing , Religion must produce the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , ? of a cosmic order beyond the reach of physical science , but experienced , and not merely inferred . Faith and prayer , mind-cure and the phenomena of spiritualism , the subliminal self , ' ? what is the explanation of our interest in all this but that we can not live by physics or metaphysics alone ? that the spirit demands its own world , peopled by conscious beings with whom it may hold communion ? At certain points the invisible realm of spirits touches ours , pouring into it the energy from which proceed revelations , miracles of healing , inspirations to follow the dictates of holiness laid down in the Gospels by Jesus . Life rather than thought , action far more than theory , is the word for Americans . And whereas the Pilgrim Fathers divided heaven from earth by a gulf which death alone could pass , their descendants are learning in ways most unexpected that we attain to life everlasting by the Cornmunion of Saints . The earthly and the heavenly Commonwealths make up together the American ideal . So it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not without good-will , the strange story of religious development which has reversed the principles of Puritan theocracy and rejected its leading doctrines . Often , indeed , it has gone to the other extreme . To be moonstruck with optimism ' I can not reckon sound philosophy . But , if there is a world beyond the reaches of earthbound sense , its action , miraculous and illuminating , was surely not confined to Israel or the period of the New Testament . Religion is present fact as well as past history . The Communion of Saints either did not exist at any time , or it exists now . All that was ever in the Church must be with us under living forms at this moment , not in the shape of abstract ideas , but of objects , institutions , personalities , accessible to our prayers and answering them by the gift of powers not to be gained otherwise . The supernatural order , in short , is a universe and we are in it , not isolated or left to ourselves as lonely souls astray in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome the world ; they reveal here and now in every man who will look within , a vital force , a consciousness , on which time , space , and material conditions have only a limited influence . And here is our freedom ; for ' where is the spirit , there is liberty . ' Our name for the Communion of Saints , as I need not remind you , my dear Father , is the Catholic Church . We have always held that in its three stages , militant , suffering , triumphant , it is united by prayer of invocation and intercession , by graces asked and given , by the Holy Sacrifice . We never would allow , even in fallen man , total depravity of will or intellect . We have in our Religious Orders that scheme of a perfect life which Mount Lebanon has attempted , and which the Socialist can not achieve . Dreams outside Catholicism become realities within it . And when the uninstructed crowd makes objection to it , from the distance of Puritan prejudice , scientific conceit , or spiritualist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The great Church smiles calmly upon its critics , and for all response says , " Look at me ! " and if you still murmur for the loss of your shadowy perspective , there comes no reply save " Look at me ! " in endless repetition , as the one thing to be said . And after looking many times , with long intervals between , you discover that the cathedral has gradually extended itself over the whole compass of your idea ; it covers all the site of your visionary temple , and has room for its cloudy pinnacles beneath the dome . ' Such , my dear Father , is the homage of New England to the old religion , as its pilgrim and finest representative in literature stands before St. Peter 's shrine . Is it not a prophecy of things to be ?
