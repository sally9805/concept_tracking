txt In the course of a countrywide campaign against the bucket shops , which has resulted in the closing of approximately 240 brokerage offices lacking Stock Exchange connections in the last six months , the Federal authorities showed their hands last week . Proceedings brought by them resulted in the closing of no more offices , but were designed principally to stamp out the evil , so that , as in the past , managers or principals in bucket shops , closed or failed , might no turn up again in another place and under a different name in the same illegal business . According to New York Stock Eichange authorities and officers of the Chicago Board of Trade , who gathered most of the clues which were traced out by the Federal authorities , there is not on record a solitary case of a bucketshop operator serving time for his offense . Convictions have run into the hundreds , but in all cases fines or suspended prisoPi sentences have been imposed . The fines have ranged from $10 to $10,000 , which is the maximum penalty yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company of Jersey City five years ago . The outward evidences of the activities of the Federal authorities were disclosed in Pittsburgh , where fourteen indictments were returned last week for , conspiracy and.loemisiistOsf the Malls l against . men who had been engaged in the brokerage:business in Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , and Michigan . The evidence in the cases was presented by ' Chief Post Office Inspector George V. Craighead , who for the last two months has been collaborating on the cases with A. Bruce Bielaski , Chief of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice . Most of the men indicted were engaged in brokerage offices which were raided on March 10 by the Pennsylvania constabulary under the direction of Deputy Attorney General Davis of Pennsylvania . The raid closed up the Pittsburgh Consolidated Stock and Produce Exchange , which was the so-called clearing house of most of the brokerage concerns , and four chains of brokerage houses with branches in Pennsylvania and adjoining States . Of the fourteen indicted Henry J. Spuhler , Frank Spuhler , William G. Heck , Albert Walters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ralph J. Bowler , Harry Ritchert , and Lee Patterson were connected with the Union Securities Company , which had headquarters in Pittsburgh and fifteen branch offices in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio . This Union Securities Company was the successor of Heck &; Co. , which failed April 30 , 1915 , leaving cus ? tomers of thirty-eight branch offices in Pennsylvania , Maryland , and West Virginia to whistle for their money . Isaac N. Harkless , Percy C. Harkless. and C. Vernon Shoup , three of the other indicted men , did business as I. N. and P. C. Harkless with headquarters in Pittsburgh . Isaac N. Harkless was a4 member of the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York , but his brother , Percy C. Harkless , at the same time was a member of the Consolidated Stock and Produce Exchange of Pittsburgh . When the Consolidated Exchange officers heard of the connection they suspended Isaac N. Harkless . That was on Jan. 24 last . The others indicted were Abraham J. Cummings and Herbert L. Reynolds , doing business as A. J. Cummings &; Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio and Michigan . The indictments were presented before United States Distriet Judge Thomson by Assistant United States Attorney Neill W. . Most of the evidence on which they were based was gotten as a result of the March raid by the Pennsylvania constabulary . The Pennsylvania authorties and officers of the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade found much of the evidence in documentary form . They got more from some of the thirtyfive men arrested in that raid . Thirty of these men pleaded guilty and were let off with fines of $100 apiece and a jail sentence suspended during good behavior . Several of them , according to the Steele Exchange authorities ; turned State 's evidence . The whole batch of testimony ' was then laid before Chief Bielaski by Deputy Attorney General Davis of Pennsylvania and officers of the Stock Exchange and Board of Trade . Previously Mr. Bielaski had been unable to act , for all of the brokerage concerns had carefully refrained from opening offices in the District of Columbia and rendering themselves liable to prosecution under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mails to defraud Mr. Bielaski saw a clear way of proceeding and moved forward directly . The action ' of the Department of Justice differs from that in the successful prosecutions of bucket shops five years ago . Then the Cella Commission Company , the biggest bucket-shop chain ever conducted , E. S. Boggs &; Co. of New York and Price &; Co. of Baltimore , had offices in the District of Columbia . The managers of these offices were arrested for violation of the Federal law , and their principals and associates outside the ' District were charged with conspiracy to violate that law . In the present proceedings the Federal authorities rely on charges of using the mails to defraud and conspiracy to do so . According to the New York Stock Exchange authorities , there are now in operation only two bucket shops east of the Mississippi  --  one in Pennsylvania and the other in West Virginia . The West Virginia concern is conducting a lawful business , for that State sanctions the . business on payment of a 81,000 license . But , like ti e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the West Virginia brokerage concern can not do business in branch offices outside the State without running the risk of violating Federal statutes against misuse of the mails . STOCKS CLOSE STRONG . Issues That Were Weakest on Friday Higher Than Previous Level .

It appeared as though the covering of short contracts supplied much of the strength to quotations , but , irrespective of this fact , - the Street watched the course of business in a cheerful frame of mind . The imbression was general in commission houses that the danger of a diplomatic break had , at least , been transferred some distance into the future , while there was a chance that relations between the two countries would become altogether amicable .
