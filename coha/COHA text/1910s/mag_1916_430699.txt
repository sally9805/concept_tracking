 |p622  I. POLITICS AND STRATEGY DESPITE interesting incidents in the West , despite the French victory at Verdun , one of the most brilliant local achievements of the war , the campaigns in the Near East continued in November to hold the attention of military observers of the world . Indeed , the value of the Rumanian campaign was enhanced by developments of the political order , which served to demonstrate the great value that the Germans now attached to this operation . 1y readers are familiar with the analyses I have made in other articles of the Verdun campaign . The German operation at Verdun was a military undertaking , with very clear military aims . It sought first to pierce the French lines , then to pound through , and finally to obtain a circumscribed local advantage , the possession of the ruins of Verdun . But beyond all else , Verdun was an effort to crush the spirit of the French people and demonstrate to them and to the world that Germany could not be beaten . Now the Rumanian campaign has similar purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated the value of Rumanian operations in the eyes of the Central Powers , when he said that Rumania would soon be crushed , and the enemies of the Central Powers , seeing in the defeat of Rumania the proof that their own hopes and purposes could not be realized , would at last listen to peace propositions . BethmannHolhveg opened the way for such proposals by the frank assertion that he had never officially considered the annexation of Belgium . In a word , Germany , and Austria as well , see in the Rumanian campaign the way to win peace , to win a peace which shall be satisfactory to them without being too onerous for their enemies . They are fighting in Rumania to convince their enemies that the Central Powers can not be conquered . They have sought to make the Rumanian campaign a supreme moral demonstration of their invincibility . They have riven to the 622 campaign the moral value they sought to attach to the Verdun campaign , when they expected to take Verdun . And they could not wholly subtract that moral value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German conclusions in the matter of the Rumanian operation , it is necessary to accept some of their premises if we are to understand what they are aiming at and why the Rumanian operation has become so important in their eyes . To do this the easiest illustration at hand is found in the Verdun effort of last spring . ' When German high command planned the present campaign against Rumania it reasoned something like this : We have lost the initiative in the East , the West and in the South , along the Italian front . Verdun has demonstrated the folly of any new offensive in the West . Our Austrian allies have barely been put on their feet and they are not in condition to make a new and colossal effort against Russia . The failure of the offensive in the Trentino abolishes all hope in this direction , given our present resources . Our defeats and losses on all fronts have led our own people and neutral nations to take a pessimistic view of our condition . The entrance of Rumania has convinced the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the situation , German high command proposed this solution . The eyes of the world are upon Rumania ; they expect to see the invasion of Hungary and the collapse of our ally . If we can strike down Rumania , as we have struck down Belgium and Serbia , if we can get to Bucharest as we have reached Brussels and Belgrade , if we can demonstrate that the Allies are unable to save their latest ally , then our own people and the world will no longer believe that we are going to lose the war , that our condition is desperate . On the contrary , we shall restore our position in their eyes , and our opponents , already tiring of the war ? that is , the people , not their leaders ? will be ready to listen to reason .  |p623  And the fact is , so the German high command reasoned , we can hope with those resources at our hand to crush Rumania . We have reserves , not enough for another Verdun or a new drive toward Moscow , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to insure a quick and sweeping success , such as our political necessities demand , over the Rumanians , who do not number much more than 300,000 , who have no heavy artillery to speak of , who are still green troops , who have made the greatest blunder of the war by going into Transylvania instead of attacking Bulgaria before we could help our Balkan ally . On the military side this campaign against Rumania will abolish a new peril ; it will , if it succeeds , shorten our line enormously ; it will put us in possession of the great stores of grain Rumania possesses , of the oil wells , which will furnish us with the petroleum we lack ; but on the political side we shall win even more , we shall probably win peace . II . HOW IT HAS WORKED OUT Last month I indicated the extent of the German success in the earlier phase of the campaign against Rumania . All that the German high command had expected had , up to that time , come to pass . Rumania had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole war for the Allies had been spoiled and the first weeks of the third year of the struggle witnessed a change in the opinion of neutrals all over the world . Expectation of German defeat within a brief time gave place to new admiration for German efficiency and fresh confidence in German military power . In August there was a well-defined belief all over the world , outside of Germany and Austria , that the Allies were winning . In November this conviction had disappeared , there was pessimism in Allied capitals , and there was frank skepticism in quarters where Allied expectations had von recent credence . Out of great Allied opportunities Germany had drawn a military advantage for herself that can hardly be exaggerated . Yet , looking at the military situation , as it stands in the last week of November , it is plain that Germany has not yet achieved the great success which is necessary to crown her operations , having regard for her own viewpoint . She has continued to advance into Rumania by the valley of the Alt and by the railroad which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campolung , an important Rumanian railroad town at the edge of the plain . But she is no longer making rapid advances and the thing that happened at Verdun is happening in the new field ? she is being called upon to make high payment for relatively small gains . In a word , Rumania has repaired her earlier mistakes . Her troops are now fighting well ; Berlin concedes this . They have been reinforced by Russian armies , whose strength has begun to tell . As it stands now it is still likely that Germany will ultimately get to Bucharest , but it is less likely than it was a month ago . And there is no longer any chance that she will get there by a swift and comparatively cheap thrust . She is keeping on , as she kept on at Verdun , because of the value that , by her own action , has attached to the campaign in the eyes of the world , but the highest conceivable profit has now escaped her . If you look at any map of Rumania you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallachian Plain , halfway between the Danube and the Transylvanian Alps , a single railroad which connects Bucharest with Orsova and crosses a large number of railroads which go north from the Danube to or across the Transylvanian frontier . This railroad is the key of the whole Rumanian campaign . If the Germans , coming south of the mountains , can get to this railroad , at Pitesci , for example , where it is nearest to Transylvania , they will cut off all of the Rumanian troops west of the point they reach , unless these troops are recalled in time . If they are recalled , then half of Wallachia will have to be abandoned to the invader . What the Belgrade-Constantinople railroad is in the problem to the south , this Orsova-Bucharest railroad is in the northern problem . But the Germans are stilt a long way from Pitesci ; they will not be there a month hence unless they accelerate their speed ; they are beginning to show signs of a lack of men ; the bad weather seems to have interfered with their munitioning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer to their bases . Still ; it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the German drive on this front has not yet been stopped and the Germans are confident , the Allies fearful , that a great Rumanian disaster impends . On the other hand , the campaign in the Moldavian half of Rumania , the fraction of the country between Russia and Transylvania , has reached a state of deadlock , while Russian reinforcements have actually turned the tide and short dashes into Transylvania have been made . No progress of any importance has been made by the Germans on this front , and there are signs that the Russian pressure here has seriously interfered with the operations of Falkenhayn to the south and west . A month ago it looked as if the Germans would be able to get through on the east front as well as the south . Now this seems no longer likely , and their advance is rigidly limited to the northern front between the railroads which enter Rumania , one south of Kronstadt , the other south of Petroseny , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between these two passes are several others , notably the Red Tower Gorge , also used by the Germans , but the front between these two railroads is the main operative front of Falkenhayn , measured by November operations . As I correct these proofs , on November 21 , the dispatches report very great German progress south of the Vulcan Pass and toward Crajova , which is the point where the railroad coming south out of the Vulcan Pass cuts the Bucharest-Orsova line ? the backbone of Rumania . Such an advance carries a very grave threat to all the Rumanian troops west of the railroad , they may be cut off and captured , if their line of retreat and communications is thus cut . Here is the possibility of a real disaster . III . IN THE DOBRUDJA Meantime , if Falkenhayn has managed to keep on , at a reduced pace , to be sure , Mackensen has not only ceased advancing , but has retreated a considerable distance and has been several times reported heavily defeated and in flight toward the Bucharest-Constanza railroad . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem seemed to be the problem of Rumania caught between the closing jaws of a German trap , with Falkenhayn in the north and Mackensen in the south acting as the jaws . What has happened to Mackensen remains hidden in a fog of official reticence . We know that he has retreated toward the railroad , that he has evacuated much territory north of the railroad and has given over the effort to pursue and destroy the Rumanian and Russian armies he defeated in October . We know that a new Russian commander , Sahkaroff , who contributed much to the great Russian victories of last spring and summer , is operating against him , but more precise details fail us . One circumstance , however , claims attention . There have been several reports of Rumanian thrusts across the Danube in the rear of Mackensen . If the Rumanians and the Russians could get troops across the river in Mackensen 's rear his position would be desperate , because he is already enclosed on three sides by the Danube and the Black Sea . A Russian army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exactly like a cork in a bottle and Mackensen would be inside the bottle . No one expects such a turn , but it is clear that the threat of it might explain his reported retirement . Another explanation , even more plausible , is that he has been compelled to lend troops to the Bulgars , fighting to save Monastir , and that the Allied offensive from Salonica , which I shall discuss in a moment , has already helped Rumania by drawing off the pressure from the south . If this be true , we shall see Mackensen standing on the defensive , hereafter , holding the gap between  |p626  the Danube and the sea , which is the natural route for any Russian invasion of Bulgaria . Conceivably Mackensen 's part in the German plan has been fulfilled . It may be that he was used solely to make a demonstration drawing off Rumanian troops from the Transylvania front until Germany could get Falkenhayn into the field . If so his success is beyond praise , and he has , in addition , achieved a local advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus crippling Rumania by depriving her of one of the very few roads of communication with her Russian ally . In addition , Mackensen has saved Bulgaria not alone from invasion but from the threat of invasion from the north and restored to the Bulgars ? for the time being , at least , ? the territory taken from them by Rumania in the Second Balkan War . The moral and political effect of this service is tremendous . ' As it stands we can not know whether Mackensen 's task is performed or whether we shall see him soon endeavoring to repeat his famous passage of the Danube a year ago and drive north to join hands with Falkenhayn . We must recognize the possibility of this . But we must also recognize the possibility that a Rumanian thrust across the river in his rear will compel him to retire southward . Either is possible , but neither is very likely , considering the difficulties . In November a French commander , General Berthelot , and Russian armies and generals , succeeded in bracing up the Rumanian defense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moldavia , where the invaders have retired , without quite succeeding in stopping the , main thrust of Falkenhayn . Because of this failure Rumania remains in very real peril , but the chances of salvation have increased , both because of local conditions and outside aid , and because of the Monastir campaign of Sarrail 's Salonica army far off to the south . I do not believe that we have seen the crest of the German effort in Rumania . I think we shall see very desperate fighting in this field in December . Given the political value that the campaign has for the Germans and Austrians , given their faith that a shining success will win the peace they desire , I am satisfied that they will make new efforts and new sacrifices . It is the political element that now gives this campaign its real importance . The Allies have lost their big chance , Germany has saved Bulgaria and Hungary on these fronts , but it remains to be seen whether she can now crush Rumania . Personally , I do not think the biggest possiblevictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Allies are concerned , just as I did not believe German success at Verdun could alter French determination . But what is important now is the fact that Germany believes it will and therefore means to achieve it . IV . MONASTIR The French have an expression to describe a military operation made on one front with the purpose of relieving pressure on another . They call it a coup de ventouse , which is , literally translated , the application of a leech . This best describes the new activity in the Balkans , the drive at Monastir . Actually the chief purpose of this drive is to relieve the pressure upon Rumania by recalling Bulgar troops from the Dobrudja to defend the Macedonian conquests of Czar Ferdinand . We may safely say that before all else the thing in the mind of Allied High Command is to exercise such pressure upon the southern front of the Bulgarians that they will not only have to give over their invasion of Rumania , but will also be compelled to appeal to their German and Austrian allies for reinforcements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies or from the reserves marked for him . In a word , just as the Germans are endeavoring to destroy Rumania , the Allies are now concentrating their attention upon Bulgaria . Monastir , which was the chief objective of Sarrail 's advance , has for ' the Bulgars a sentimental value , outside of the military value which it possesses for all the Central Powers equally . It dominates the portion of Macedonia which saw the rise of Bulgar power in the Balkans nine centuries ago . It was assigned to Bulgaria by the Treaty of San Stefano , returned to the Turk at the Congress of Berlin , again assigned to Bulgaria by the treaty with Serbia which preceded the First Balkan War , and lost in the Second Balkan War , which Bulgaria precipitated because Serbia refused to surrender Monastir according to agreement . The present , therefore , is the second war Bulgaria has fought for Macedonia , for Monastir , because she joined the Central Powers a year ago to reconquer what she had lost in the war with Greece and Serbia . To lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of the Vardar , is to lose the chief prize of the war for which Bulgaria has been fighting . With the  |p628  loss goes a heavy casualty list , for the main burden of resisting the Serb , French , Russian , Italian and British forces in Macedonia is carried by the Bulgars . And even if they lose all of Macedonia with Monastir , they will have to endure more casualties , for the Allies will still push on . No one will venture to forecast that the fall of Monastir , even if it brings military disaster as well ( these lines are written when only the fact of the fall of Monastir is known ) , will persuade Bulgaria to make a separate peace . The thing is just possible , given the fact that the Bulgar entered the war with little enthusiasm and recognizing that there does exist a pro-Russian party in Bulgaria . The military value of Monastir is easily explained . Monastir is situated in a plain bounded on its eastern and western sides by mountain walls , that on the west rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . West of the mountain wall are Presba and Ochrida Lakes , beyond which is the Albanian wilderness . Hence it was next to impossible to turn the western flank of the Bulgars , and they were holding a sort of Thermopylae . Between the two mountain walls they have stretched trench lines which rested upon the mountains as a gate rests upon its two sets of posts ; until the Allies could get through the gate they could not move north . Now , instead of attempting to break through the gate ? that is , through the trench lines ? Sarrail sent the Serbs up the eastern mountain wall and they have been systematically clearing the Bulgars out of these hills until they have got north as far as Monastir , but above it in the mountains . The French , escalading the western walls , did the same thing , but when Monastir fell they were still five miles south of Monastir . It was the Serbian success that compelled the Bulgars to evacuate all their lines of trenches , because of the flanking fire from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bulgars must now retreat north over the Ba'buna Pass , probably making their first stand at Prilep , on the heights between the Monastir Plain and the Vardar Valley . Such a retreat , given existing weather conditions , may cost them all their heavy artillery and might end in disaster . But its immediate effect would be to expose the flank of the other Bulgar army , which is defending the valley of the Vardar , up which goes the Salonica-Belgrade railroad , which is the main avenue of advance for Sarrail . A very considerable retirement from Doiran might then take place and might even extend to the evacuation of all the Vardar valley from the Greek frontier to Uskub . All these latter considerations are speculations . But a real success , such a success as the Serbs alone achieved just four years ago on this same field where they routed the Turkish army of Djavid Pasha and drove it into the Albanian wilderness , might easily change the whole face of conditions in the Balkans . And what is of greatest interest now , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . It is always well to remember that the main Allied objective . in the whole Balkan War is the railroad binding the Central Powers to Constantinople . If this can be cut the war will instantly change in character , for Germany will lose the one solid conquest of the war , the single chance to bring from the war a place in the sun , and will be thrown back upon Central European conditions . The fall of Constantinople , once this line were cut , would be inevitable , however long delayed . It is for this railroad that Sarrail is reaching . He is a very great distance from it even now when Monastir has fallen , and the Bulgars are retiring upon Uskub . But aside from the main purpose there is the incidental necessity to aid Rumania , and this is what the present Monastir operation was designed to do . V. POLAND " RESTORED " Next to the Rumanian and Balkan campaigns , the most interesting event of the month was the proclamation of a " restored " Poland at Lublin and Warsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This step closed a whole year of hesitation and dubitation . It was taken at a time when there could be no mistaking its purpose . It was a deliberate attempt to repeat Napoleon 's success in enlisting Poles , by his creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw at Tilsit , and it was marked by similar limitations . Napoleon 's Poland included all the territory of Russian Poland as it existed in 1914 , together with the present German province of Posen . But when he freed Poland he was at peace with Austria and had no wish to invite a new war by endeavoring to take Galicia from Austria . He also refrained from taking from Prussia the portion of Poland which , before the First Partition , separated East Prussia from the rest of the Hohenzollern state . These failures led to  |p629  a final failure , for , although he did get Polish recruits , in limited numbers , he did not enlist the Polish people , as he might have done had he been more generous . The present Austro-German project is much more restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor those of Galicia are included in this new Polish state ; only Russia 's Polish provinces are affected by the new decision . But at the same moment Galicia , which contains 5,000,000 Poles , has been promised autonomy , whatever that may mean . As for the Poles of Posen , they have been promised nothing and can expect nothing . The first conclusion to be drawn from the latest move is that the Germans have abandoned all hope of a separate peace with Russia . To create a new state out of Russian territory and Russian subjects can only be accepted as proof that Germany no longer expects to be able to bargain with Russia , as she has long hoped . If only to regain lost provinces , Russia must now continue . The second conclusion is no less patent . In " restoring " a portion of Poland , Austria and Germany have run the same risk that Austria ran when she consented at the Congress of Vienna to the creation of a relatively strong Sardinia , namely , it promised future effort in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is more certain , even if the Central Powers win the war and are able to make the Polish autonomy permanent , than that the Poles in their own provinces will seek union with the Poles of the autonomous Poland . All modern history supports the belief that once a fraction of a people is free , all parts will seek freedom and union . The case of Serbia , still fresh in mind , is an admirable example . For Austria this means the danger of losing some 5,000,000 subjects . But this would not be too serious , because these 5,000,000 Poles live in a well-defined district in which there are no other races . Austria could afford to sacrifice her Poles and gain a strong buffer state on the east in return . It is different with Germany ; her Poles are inextricably entangled with Teutons , and if old Poland were restored , she would face mutilation , and 2,000,000 Germans east of the Vistula would be cut off from all contact with the main block of German peoples by a Polish wall thrust north toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Austrian and Russian Poles would be a state of at least 17,000,000 people . It would hardly endure being cut off from the sea and thus made tributary to Germany . All the considerations of self-interest and sentiment would lead it to aspire to retake old Polish lands , some of them still populated by Poles , and gain a window on the sea . And with such an ambition Russia , once she had lost her Polish provinces , would necessarily sympathize . Thus would be born a Polish question like to the old Serb question , but this time pressing fatally upon Germany , not Austria . We are bound to conclude that in undertaking even the limited and partial restoration of Poland now promised , Germany was driven by necessities , for no one can mistake the risks . Poland divided between three great powers , all united in a common policy of repressing the Poles , was one thing . A Poland partially free and longing to achieve complete freedom and unity , a Poland secretly or openly championed by Russia ? this would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to promise , even if the Central Powers win . But if they lose ? if they are heavily defeated ? will Russia fail to follow their example and liberate their fractions of Poland ? She has already promised an autonomous Poland ; will she not include within it old Polish cities like Cracow and Dantzig , Posen and Thorn ? Will she not insist that this autonomous Poland have a frontage on the Baltic , control of the lower Vistula ? Will she not view with equanimity the passing of  |p630  the 2,000,000 Teutons in East and West Prussia under a Slav rule ? Nor is there any better reason why 4,000,000 Poles should be subject to German rule than that 2,000,000 Germans should be subjects of a Slav state . The Polish incident is one of the most interesting of the whole war . It opens-'dew horizons and raises new problems . It may prove the greatest blunder of Germany during this war ; it certainly gives promise of new vitality to Polish patriotism and new basis for Polish hopes . In any event , Germany has raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest and challenge . Germany is now raising a Polish army , but it is too soon to estimate her success or failure . What is plain is that she has risked much ; even Austria has taken a considerable gamble , in the hope of getting recruits . Is it too much to conclude that this points to a growing apprehension on the subject of man-power , an apprehension plainly disclosed in the shameful violation of the rights of humanity and the rules of international law in recent Belgian depor-tations ? The psychologist might , too , find material for profound investigation in the mentality which invites neutral applause for a proposal to liberate the Poles and at the same moment excites neutral indignation by deporting the unhappy Belgians . VI . BRITISH PROGRESS November saw a long pause in the operations at the Somme , followed by a sudden British advance ? the most business-like of all British advances ? the capture of some 6000 prisoners and the winning of a local success at a relatively low cost in casualties . The manner in which Beaucourt , BeaumontHamel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance than the captures themselves . Here was a plain indication of a fact long doubted but becoming unmistakable , that the new British armies were learning the game of modern war . To-day Britain has 1,500,000 troops in France . In the last four months she has lost close- to 600,000 in the fighting which has been going forward . She has actually taken over the operative task in the West , although French attacks continue at points . Conceivably she will presently take over still more of the French front ? to-day she holds rather less than one-quarter of the west front ? some French writers urge this and some British commentators have forecast it . Actually Germany has now to deal with a fresh foe , just beginning to bring his trained troops in great masses into action . At the beginning of the Somme battle the British failed rather badly . They failed as our troops failed in all the early battles of the Civil War , and for the same reasons . They did not fail in courage or devotion ; the men were as brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained . As a result the British attack was promptly held up , while the French made sweeping progress . The British losses were terrific where the French losses were light , and many British troops were killed by British guns , so difficult is the work of coordinating man with gun in modern attack . But from July to November the improvement has been steady and rapid . The new British armies are not as good as the German or the French ; the new officers are not the equals of the French and German officers who have given their lives to the study of the business of war . But there is no longer the hopeless inferiority of the early months of the war . Guns the British have , as good as the French or the German , and munitions in adequate amounts . Gunners they are getting , now that the French have lent their artillery officers to train the British . Next year , in the minds of most British military critics , the British army will be ready . It will be equal to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German army , through losses . Britain is now drawing on the best of its selected manhood , the men who volunteered at the early calls ; the Germans are drawing upon the older and younger classes . It is difficult to praise too highly the achievement of the British in creating a vast national army out of next to nothing in two short years . The Germans did not believe they would even dare to impose compulsory service , and British policy here in this case was a shock to all Germans , a shock which they confessed to my friend Mr. Swope , of the World , who has recently returned from Berlin and supplied this country with admirable pictures of present German conditions , seen sympathetically . But the British army was not ready this year . It had to get its training in the field , and the training covered the period when a general offensive could hope to be successful . That time has passed now , and while we are likely to see thrusts , whenever the weather  |p631  VII . VERDUN ? THEY DID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after the first German attack , three French divisions , commanded by General Magin , left their trenches , swarmed up the famous slopes of Fort Douat , lmont , took the fort , took the village of Fleury , the woods of Caillette , of Laufee , of Fumin , took the Haudraumont quarries , the farm and work of Thiaumont , took the Damloup battery , and stretched a net around the Fort of Vaux , their attack pausing at the edge of Vaux village and about Vaux Pond . In a few hours there were retaken all the important places , all the component parts in the defensive system of the fortified camp of Verdun , save only the Fort of Vaux , and that was evacuated by the Germans a few days later . When the French attack had ended and Vaux had been evacuated , the French remained in possession of every fort and every prepared line which had been erected before the war and which belonged to the old Verdun defense system . They had retaken in less than six hours the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in daily fighting and cost the  |p632  Germans not less than half a million casualties . In making the assault the French took 6000 prisoners and lost rather less than 5000 in killed and wounded . A more brilliant bit of scientific military operation it would be impossible to imagine . The Germans in Douaumont were surprised and the French captured many guns and a whole magazine of shells , grenades , and ammunition , together with vast stores of provisions and a water supply . Even the electric-light plant was soon in service , far down in the labyrinths of the ancient defense . Such was the end of the German attack upon Verdun . To-day the French once more hold all the hills about Verdun , and of their losses in the defense they have retaken every yard that was of military value . The Germans took Douaumont on February 25 ; they were still advancing on June 25 , and they had then covered rather less than two miles . This two miles the French covered in less than six hours . When the French counterattacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the French were fighting with their back to the wall ; their hold upon the hills on the east bank of the Meuse was measured by inches . Now , if the Germans desire Verdun they will have to begin all over again . Verdun was saved , primarily , by the courage of its own defenders ; but the offensive at the Somme long ago compelled the Germans to draw off men and guns to meet the new menace . When enough men and guns had gone to satisfy the French , they attacked , to get more elbow room , as General Petain expressed it . As long as the Germans held on to Vaux and Douaumont , there was a chance of a renewed offensive . The new French success has now made the earlier Verdun victory absolute . On the military side this feat was chiefly important as it displayed the wonderful efficiency of the French army . On the sentimental side it has a value that can not be exaggerated . Verdun will rank with the Marne in French history , and together these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war and history . It is unlikely that the victory will have any consequences . Nothing is less likely than a drive toward Metz . Conceivably there will be a new effort to remove the St. Mihiel salient , but even this is unlikely . Verdun does not offer a good base for an offensive ; it is hardly likely to invite new efforts on the part of the Crown Prince . One of the odd things about this war is the fashion in which we have grown accustomed to events which will remain the marvel of the generations which come hereafter . Anyone who was in France during the attack upon Verdun will agree that for the French , Verdun has become a vital circumstance in the history of the race . Long before the end of the attack Verdun had lost its military value ; it had lost its moral value for the Germans , so far as the rest of the world was concerned , long before the end came ; but the fall of Verdun , although it proved to be without consequences , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately had they willed that it should hold . For myself , after I had been to Verdun and seen the soldiers who were defending it , heard their confident assertion , " They shall not pass , " I could not believe that there could be any other end to the battle than that which has now come . And I am satisfied that the same spirit will repulse any proposition of peace that does not include the redemption of Alsace-Lorraine.
