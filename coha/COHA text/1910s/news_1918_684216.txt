txt If Germany wants peace , let her do away . with her irresponsible , braggart Ifalser and speak by a Government of her own people to the Governments of the allied peoples . It is not from Prince . Maxnarraws , answerable only to imperial authority , but from a Minister responsible to the German people that Germany 's plea for peace must come . He does not even describe himself , In his Reichstag speech , as such a Minister . Compliance with the terms the Allies are agreed in insisting upon as indispensable to a lasting peace demands of Germany an enforced or voluntary change of heart and purpose . There can be no change so ' long as the Hohenzollern , combining the political and military ideals of GgNGnis Khan with the moral principles of ATTILA , holds in thrall seventy million subjects , alwaYs ready at his command to butcher their neighbors and seize upon their possessions . More evils than Pandora 's box contained have been let loose upon the world by Prussia , militarism , lust of conquest , brutal disregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and barbarous savageries in war , but imperialism is the root of them all . The world will know no safety while it continues to exist . By that test the new peace overtures of Germany and Austria must be examined . Is it a peace of righteousness they suggest , a peace of assured permanence ? Or is it a peace that would leave imperial Germany unrepentant , harboring her old plans for evil , free to seize the next favoring occasion for an assault upon the nations of the world ? That is a peace the nations arrayed against her will never consider ? The arms they took up to make the world safe they will never lay down until the Prussian scourge is utterly exterminated . From their graves upon the battlefields of France the millions who have shed their life blood in the strife would cry out against an inconclusive peace , and the voices of posterity , doomed to ceaseless struggles and sacrifices in defense of their liberty , would bitterly reproach them should they consent to any ending of the war that does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The . German Chancellor has addressed a note to President ? WiLsoN . He declares that in his address to Congress on Jan. 8 of this year and in his later utterances , particularly his speech in this city on Sept. 27 , Mr. WILSON has proposed a program for a general peace which Germany and her allies can accept as " a basis for negotiations. ? ' That is the old Potsdam cant ,  - -  -  ? ? we are waging a war of defense , " we have always believed in a peace , " of justice , we are ready to negotiate " for such a peace on the principles , " laid down by President laTrosos . " , All that is a barren futility . President NiTrosos and the chiefs of the allied na- ' lions will enter into no " negotiations " for peace in the sense in which that ensnaring word is used by Prince I1IAXIMILLA.N . Their terms have been made known . They have been stated , as Mr. WILSoN said in his reply- to the Austrian overture , " with entire candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will entertain no proposals for a " conference upon a matter concern " ing which it has made its position " and purpose so clear . " What is that purpose ? In words that have been heard around the world Woonnow WILSON declared it in his address to Congress on April 2 , 1917 , when he asked for a declaration that we were at war with Germany : " The world must be made safe for democ " racy . " How can democracy be safe while that . monstrous anachronism of Irresponsible autocracy by " divine right " endures in Germany ? That Prussian autocracy " could never be our friend , " in its nature it is at war with liberal ideas the world over , it is a menace , and civilization , now fighting against it , can not enjoy peace an . assured safety Until it is destroyed . Did the German Chancellor inwardly note this passage from Mr. WILSON 'S speech on Sept. 27 , when , speaking of the Central Powers , he said : They have convinced us that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe no covenants , accept no principle but force and their own interest . We can not - " come to terms " with them . They have made It impossible . The German people must by ' this time be fully aware that we can not accept the , word of , those who forced the war on us . Terms by negotiation are " impossible , " the Central Powers have made them impossible by their faithlessness . " They are without honor and do not intend justice . " In. any transactions with them there must be a bond with sureties . As the very least guarantee of their good faith it would be demanded of them that they evacuate all occupied territory , restore to France and Italy the provinces they took from them , set Russia and Rumania free from German control by tearing up the treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest  --  in short , that they execute a general release of spoil they have acquired during the war and of all engagements that have made other States partners in their infamy . This is surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the condition the Allies impose , the penance by which alone the Central Powers can make themselves fit for conference . It must come to that . The victorious armies of FocH are hurrying on the consummation . Bulgaria has fallen out , Austria totters , and LUDENDORFF 'S shaken forces are every clay retreating further toward the German frontier . It is now nearly four years since THE TIMES put certain questions to the German people : " Will the Ger " mans blindly insist on having their " Waterloo , their Sedan  --  their St. " Helena . too ? A million Germans " have been sacrificed , a million Ger " man homes are desolate . Must oth " er millions die and yet other millions " mourn before the people of Germany " take in the court of reason and " human liberty their appeal from the " imperial and military caste that " rushes them to their ruin ? " Since that day many more millions have died , and Germany is a land of anguish . It is time to ask again if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the peoples of other nations in the pact of peace and civilization . In no other way can they qualify for that great fellowship . The door will never be opened by false-hearted proposals for negotiation such as the Chancellor now makes , belied in this very moment of their making by the arrogant words of the Kaiser , who in his proclamation to the army and the navy yesterday announced that he had , in accord with his allies , " re " solved once more to offer peace to " the enemy , but I will only extend " my hand for an honorable peace . " ? That is sufficient proof either that Wrousoar does not know What is going on or that the proposal of Prince MAXimiLIAN is not made in good faith . President WILSON does know what is going on . No man on earth is better informed , none better understands the German purposes . He can be trusted to make an answer to these overtures which will leave no doubt as to the determination of Germany 's foes to pursue their victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced upon her , and with it security against any further disturbances of the peace from that quarter . The American people stand as one man behind the President in the resolve that the end of this war shall destroy the satanic Potsdam power and the Eohenzollern and Hapsburg dynasties . In the court of peace the imperial criminals will stand in the prisoner 's dock awaiting a sentence that will disqualify them for any place in a League of Nations .
