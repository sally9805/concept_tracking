txt The National Tidende 's Budapest correspondent sends an interview with Count Julius Andrassy , former Hungarian . Premier , who has just returned from a series of conferences . in Berlin . Count Andassy is quoted as saying that the subject of the conferences was peace and peace conditions . " Unfortunately , " Count ' Andrassy added , " the people in Berlin do not seem to understand that no real result can be expected in the present war . The only result possible is no result . " Only a surprise attack . such as the one in Belgium , can be completely successful under modern conditions of warfare . I expect only one good outcome from this war , namely , that It will make war impossible in the future . " AMSTERDAM , Monday , April 19 . ? The Cologne correspondent of The Tijd , discussing peace conditions , says : " There is no serious thought in competent circles in Germany of retaining Belgium . Within a few weeks some-surprising statements on this matter may be expected . " The leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war will have been reached as soon as Germany 's national existence is guaranteed and her colonies secured " The letter of Dr. Bernhard Dernburg , ex-Colonial Secretary of Germany , in which he proposed as a basis of peace satisfactory to Germany the " neutralization of the seas , " in times of war as well as peace , by a concert of the powers , aroused great interest yesterday as pointing to a possible willingness of Germany at this time to discuss terms upon which the conflict in Europe might be brought to a termination . In this letter , read at a pro-German mass meeting in Portland , Me. , Saturday night and given wide circulation through the press , Pr . Dernburg advanced ideas which in the main amounted to these proposals : 1 . The freedom or neutralization of the high seas in time of war . 2 . An open door policy regarding colonies under which German trade with the colonies of other empires , notably the British , would not be hampered by the preferential tariffs now accorded the mother country . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoothing of the German paths of commerce through Belgium without British interference , Germany 's retention of Belgium as a natural foreland and commercial doorway to the western seas . 4 . The safety , which would seem to mean now the return , to Germany of German colonies , into which Germany could pour her increasing population . 5 . A free hand for German activity along lines already tapped in Asia Minor and Africa . In his argument Dr. Dernburg asserted that the advantages accruing to Germany from permanently retaining the land which it had taken in Europe could be disregarded if all the other German demands , cspecialty a guaranteed free sea , were fully complied with in making peace and " the natural commercial relations of Belgium and Germany were considered iii a just and workable form . " ! In connection with the neutral free sea which he proposed , Dr. Dernburg made , a. point of including the " narrows , " and in elaborating upon his letter last night he said he meant to include in the term " narrows " all waterways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that/ in case of the United States being engaged in war . the warships of the enemy of this country would not have a right to pass through the Panama Canal , and he added significantly that the warships of no other nation would enjoy that right . Added significance attached to Dr. Dernburg 's letter from the fact that Peace ' discussions have simultaneously appeared from various sources in Europe as if indicating a possible desire on the Part of Germany to put out feelers for peace . Sees Hand of Ton Bigelow . Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , who was suggested as the next Republican Presidential candidate at a Lotos Club dinner in his honor Saturday night , read the Dernburg letter with interest , making several remarks regarding his impressions of It a 's he read . One of these remarks was : " , Dernburg did n't write this letter ' , himself ; . he could n't . It came from a far stronger hand than Dernburg 's . " Dr. Butler said later that he could n't think of any man who could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Itajy , who is pre- ! ? sumably now in Rome . " This thing is extremely subtle . " said Dr. Butter . " It sounds like von Billow . He is supposed to be one of their thinkers at the present time , and is ' ' probably one of the few who. could . liaye ; dona7a , nything.like. this . " . published in its original form . Von Billow , he said , wrote fluently in both English and French . After finishing the article , Dr. Butler said : " I have stopped reading the things Dr. Dernburg says , as a general rule . It is apparent , though , that this has a great deal more weight than a personal opinion of Dr. Dernburg , and I would n't attempt to enter into a discussion or the subject without first making a thorough study of the document . The proposal about a neutral sca involves a complete upsetting of ail of the present doctrine of international law . Many phases of international law , in fact , enter into the document , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities on that subject . " One point , however , which Dr. Dernburg skims over , is the sanction of the plan for neutral seas The seas ions have been considered neutral beyond the three-mile limit . He does n't sa : , anything about who is going to enforce absolute neutrality on all waters . " Another important question which a cursory reading of the dochment suggests is that of the effect which such a plan as this would have on the Panama Canal and other waters ' if similar character . If all of the ? narrows ' on the globe are to be make ? neutral waters what are we to do about Panama ? Shall it be opened to all ships at all times ? " Should Except the Canals . James M. Beck , one of the foremost authorities on international law , said that he had not yet had time to give a careful reading to the Dernburg letter , but that in reading it over hurriedly the references to neutral seas and neutral narrows had attracted his attention . " The whole document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but , without making a careful study of it , I would not care to discuss it in detaiL Regarding the neutral narrows , if Dr. Dernburg meant them to include such waters as the Panama and other canals , I think that it would be only reasonable for him to draw a distinction between the open seas which God Almighty made and a canal such as the Panama Canal which our good dollars made . and I think that neutrals responsible for the construction of such waters certainly should have a say in the matter of what rights they are to have in them . " Frederic R. Coudert , who , is also considered exceptionally well versed in matters of international law , said that he had found the document most interesting , especially as regarded its bearing on established International law . But the principal features of the document I were in no way new , Mr. Coudert said . " The same sort of proposition was advanced by Napoleon , in 1807 , when he complained of British supremacy on the sea , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Napoleon 's standpoint , for the English Navy was interfering rather seriously with his plans . Neutrals , too , would have been glad at the time to adopt a scheme which would enable them to ship more goods . " In our own civil war , too , neutrals would have been delighted at an un- I limited opportunity to supply the South i with arms and food , and undoubtedly the Confederates would have been extremely well pleased . Also , the war might still be going on . Such a plan would in all cases prevent a great i nation from using its most effective 1 weapon to starve out another nation . Would Mean Naval Disarmament . " Neutral sees would , of course , mean naval disarmament . except for certain coast defenses . Inland nations always j have attempted to neutralize this great war power of other nations . If such a policy had been adopted a little over a 1 I hundred years ago , ' for the sake of humanity , ' as I am told Dr. Dernburg puts it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been for England 's naval power at that time Napoleon . with the greatest armies then on the Continent , could have made France the dominating influence in Europe . It was the English fleet that saved Germany . " Such disarmament on the sea as is proposed would have no good effect in the general matter of disarmament . It would only make necessary land armament far more extensive than is now necessary and would prove a great boon to militarism . Ultimately , in the natural order of things , the dominating Power on the Continent of Europe would be the power with the greatest army . If it had not been for Britain 's navy in the present war , assuming that prepared . Germany could defeat the unprepared Allies on land , Germany would soon be that dominating influence in Europe . Summed up , it Is a case of whose ox is gored . " Concerning Dr. Dernburg comments on the open door trade policy for colonies . It would appear that the Germans now have lit.11 to . complain of on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater extent than any ? other country .. The Germans have constantly boasted that they could ship their goods direct to England and undersell the English . " There are many interesting points in the letter . It contains many points which would be interesting when compared with arguments that have been advanced by interested persons in past conflicts . " Mr. Coudert said that he intended to preserve the article and study its relationship to similar documents that previous wars had produced . He had been at a loss for an adequate topic for a talk he is to make Thursday evening before the Philadelphia Bar Association , he said , and he thanked Dr. Dernburg for supplying him with a topic for the occasion . " My Letter , " Dernberg Says . Dr. Dernburg , who , in sending the " neutral sea " letter to Portland to be read in his absence , explained that he was unable personally to attend the mass meeting because of the illness of Mrs. Dernburg , was seen in his apartment at the Ritz-Carlton last night . He laughed heartily when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he personally was the author of the letter , or if it had emanated from some official source , Dr. Dernburg said : " I found myself unable  --  to attend the meeting in Maine . Two of the men who had gotten up the mass meeting in Portland called on me before the meeting and when I told them I could not attend urged me to do something to keep from disappointing the audience , for they had advertised the meeting extensively . And so I sat down at my typewriter there , " indicating a typewriter in a corner , " and wrote the letter myself . " While the letter was not , in a strict sense , official in any manner whatsoever , it expressed what were my sentiments regarding the basis on which lasting peace could be procured and expressed what I was confident were the sentiments of the leaders in Germany on this subject . I know the views of these men through long personal association with them , through the exchange of ideas on such subjects , and through holding for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of peace set forth in my letter was not meant to be a basis of peace which would be of advantage to either side in the present war or to any individual nation . It was meant to represent a basis which would be of the greatest benefit to all nations , to the world at large . France would benefit as much as Germany from such a basis of peace . All nations would be benefited by it . " Regarding the part about neutral , seas and narrows , I did mean to include 1 all canals as well as the seas . ' Your rights in the Panama Canal in the event you were at with another nation ? The other nation would not have a right to pass warships through the canal ? neither would anybody else . The plan was meant to be one by which the seas would be disarmed . " The English would be most benefited by a neutral sea policy ? in spite of their dreadnoughts . Where are those dreadnoughts now ? Where will they be soon ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Museum . Their usefulness will have passed . It is the submarine that has brought about this change . Already the British dreadnoughts are packed away in oil and cotton in safe harbors . Instead of twenty-nine submarines , Germany soon will have a hundred . " Some great change in the international view of the proprietorship of the seas must be brought about as a consequence to the advent of the submarine and the passing of the dreadnought . Many submarines can be built for the price of one dreadnought , but they are essentially coast fighting ships , and must find a place in the future only as coast defenses , while the open seas must belong to everybody . " A plan of this nature would open the door of sea commerce to the world . " Seeks Trade of Colonies . In his letter , Dr. Dernburg said that a free sea would be useless unless combined with freedom of cable and mail communication with all countries , and that , to an even greater extent , the open sea would demand an open commercial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , " that while every nation must have the right , for commercial and fiscal purposes , to impose whatever duties it thinks fit , those duties must be equal for all exports and imports for whatever destination and from whatever source . " " England has her great colonies in Africa , Australia , and North America , " he said last night , in elaborating this I subject , " and Germany has no colony in which white men can thrive . While other countries were exporting men , Germany exported goods , until walls were built up to keep her goods away from places where her competition was distasteful . These walls should be torn down for the benefit of all nations alike . Then every manufacturer 's goods , no matter what nation he belonged to , would have to stand on its merits . ' " The consequence of this open world trade would be increased contact and understanding among the peoples of the world , and would result in a friendlier spirit among the different nations . It would serve more than any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which all strove for honest supremacy . " Asked if he did not think the peace terms he had outlined would work great benefit to Germany in particular , Dernburg said they . would work giect benefit to everybody , and ' that he be. ? .. aved- a , basis of , pcace along , similar ' Linda would be ' necessary ' if -Ileacs.ivierill to last for any considerable time after the conclusion of the present war . " I do not say that these are the things that caused the present war . " he said . " but while we are at it these are things which should be cleared up and settled finally by the present war to prevent a recurrence of conditions that make war necessary . "
