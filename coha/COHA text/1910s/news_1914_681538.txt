txt We should go on just as If there were no war , " said Secretary Daniels to the House Naval Committee this morning , when asked if It would not be wise to authorize four instead of two dreadnoughts this session . " We are not building against anybody , " he said a little later when asked to compare our programme with those of the powers of Europe and that of Japan . Mr. Daniels said that the United States was as far along with submarines as were Germany and England , and that submarine construction was still experimental . He pointed out that Thomas A. Edison was developing an electric battery for submarine cruising , and said the department had sent a man to Switzerland to study the Diesel engine . The Secretary took the ground trot it would be folly to stop building chips of the first line because we were to propose a limit to armaments . Utter prostration of the countries now at war in Europe was predicted , and that was given as one reason why there should be no apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building programme , embracing two capital ships each year , with auxiliaries imperatively needed , rather than stopping all construction or going to the other extreme , that of trying to keep up with the doubled or trebled programmes or England and Germany , was advised . " I stand , " said Mr. Daniels , " for the regular normal rate of construction . If the revenues of the country were sufficient to provide it , I should favor authorizing four new battleships this year . But as the revenues are not sufficient , I say two battleships is the minimum for this year to insure the development of a strong navy . If the revenues were abundant I would rather have forty-eight battleships by 1919 , but I would not feel that that was important if we go forward with our regular programme . " This came after the committee had examined the Secretary regarding the differences between his views and those of the General Board . The board 's recommendations are for four battleships a year , with a view to forty-eight battleships by 1919 . Secretary Daniels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along until Congress appropriated for only one , and then the board changed to a fourbattleship programme . There are now forty battleships built , building , and authorized , Favors More Submarines . The Secretary made clear his belief that there should be an increase in the number of submarines , but he did not go so far as Rear Admiral Badger in asking for fifty more . He said there were 193 vessels in commission in March , 1913 , when he became Secretary , and there were now 222. which , he thought , was twenty-nine more than necessary . The enlisted personnel , he said , was now full , and he did not ask for any increase of men , as he regarded the present strength sufficient to man all the ships that could be kept in commission . The Secretary then took up the question of a trained naval reserve and said he would ask that an item he had recommended , amounting to $130,000 , to provide for a medical reserve be cancelled and the amount be allowed for him to begin organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Secretary . " between 3,000 and 4,000 men drop out of the navy . These men would form a splendid reserve . When we sent the fleet to Vera Cruz my office was deluged with letters and telegrams from men of this class , men who had been in the service and who desired to return . I think there were fully 25,000 such men , Admiral Dewey estimated the available number of trained men who might be placed in a reserve at 38,000 . We keep their names and addresses and we could very easily , as they passed out of the service , ask each man if he wished to be enrolled in the reserve . The cost of organizing such a reserve would be small , comparatively . At the next session of Congress I shall ask for authority to proceed with the organization of such a reserve . All retired officers are now being registered with that purpose in mind . " We have enough men now in the navy . " continued the Secretary . " Fully 90 per cent . of the enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think we ought to have all the men that would be required to man all the vessels we have , but simply all the available fighting ships . We shall need men soon for the new dreadnoughts which will be finishea within the next two years . We have added 4,600 men to the enlisted personnel during the last Year , of whom 1,400 were an authorized increase to offset men who are held as prisoners . The strength of the navy is now , therefore , up to 50,500 men . " Possible Disarmament . Representative Butler of Pennsylvania brought up the subject of disarmament . Secretary Daniels said that no one nation could expect to accomplish such a reform , and that until it was accomplished the United States could not cease , to maintain the strength of its navy . " Do n't you think , " asked Mr. Butler , " that at the end of the present war disarmament will come ? Do n't you think it ought to ? " " It is to be hoped , " replied the Secretary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be disposed to consider placing a limit on armament . " " Would n't we be in a better position to propose disarmament , " asked Mr. Butler , - if we were to stop building battleships ? " " I think it would be unwise , " replied Mr. Daniels , " to act differently In any particular now than we acted before the war . It would be a great mistake now to say that because we thought , that by building large navies the powers had not averted war we should stop building . I think we would be in far I better condition to propose disarmament , if we kept on . " An adequate navy is what we need , " continued Mr. Daniels . " It should not be bigger than England 's or Germany 's or that of any Country in particular . I think the war in Europe is going to exhaust the resources of the countries engaged in it , so that we shall have little likelihood of trouble . You are not going to get an adequate national defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency . The people will not tolerate a large standing army or a navy that in its cost impoverishes the country , as do some of those of the European powers . We are not going into competition with the military nations . If Canada or any of our neighbors had great navies and armies we would have to adopt a military policy , and we might need a large standing army and a great navy . We should not alter our building policy until we know the conditions after the war . There may be much to learn in regard to the character of successful ships . " Representative Roberts disclosed that it was his purpose to urge the building of auxiliaries rather than ships of the battle line . Secretary Daniels turned him over to Capt . Wintedhalter , his aid for material , who told him that since the organization of the submarines in flotilla commands the question of submarine tactics had been under experiment . that there was really but one vessel built and equipped expressly for a tender for submarines and that had only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the experimental stage of the use of submarines , . vessels that had been found unnecessary in other branches of the service had been converted into tenders or mother ships for the submarines . These were the Ozark , Tallahassee , Alert , Tonopah , Monadnock . Severn and Potomac . Two of these were at Panama . one at Cavite. two in Hawaii and the rest on the Atlantic coast . Illustrating the experimental stage of the submarine Capt . Winterhalter said : " We began with a boat of 150 tons . Congress soon authorized 600 tons and now we are to let a contract for 1.200 tons . What is true in this country is also true in Germany and England . " Secretary Daniels explained that he had recommended an oil collier this year because the navy was more and more using oil in the new ships . ? Next year , he said , he would ask for another hospital ship and two more oil ships , There was no need of another supply ship or of transports , there being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of auxiliaries , " said the Secretary , " can be met in a time of emergency better than any other need in ships . We can buy vessels for transports always . " Submarines . " said the Secretary , " have given us more trouble than anything else in the navy . Submarines are fickle  --  getting out of order any time ? and we have yet to find a successful type of battery and engine . The lead casings around the batteries are liable to be eaten out by the sulphuric acid in the batteries . Then the steel surrounding the lead is eaten through and the salt water from the submerging tanks gets in and chlorine gas is generated , which is very dangerous to the crew . " We tried to buy a submarine in Germany , in order to ascertain the proper type of battery and engine . We also tried in France . They have nothing in either country that we have not already here . Probably we lead in constructing submarines . " Mr. Edison went with me to the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful battery . It Is this trouble that has delayed construction by the two firms in this country and we have decided that we must take up the building of the submarine at a Government yard in order to solve the problem . We have decided to build one at the Portsmouth Yard . We shall have to pay Mr. Lake , the submarine inventor , $7.0,000 royalty on his patents and we will get a certain amount of superintendakee on his part . We have sent an expert to Switzerland to take up with the inventor the Diesel engine , burning oil rather than gasoline for internal combustion . If we can solve these problems we ought to authorize up to fifty more submarines . Mr. Edison proposes to use an alkaline solution in the cells of his battery and thus eliminate the danger to the lead casings and the steel partitions . " Chairman Padget read a letter from Mr. Lake . the inventor , saying the latest submarines " functioned perfectly . " " I think there is no vessel in our navy that functions less perfectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans would not dare fight the British fleet because of their numerical inferiority and that both countries would come out of the war with navies very much increased and tremendously greater than ours , therefore we should build big . " No , " observed Mr. Daniels , " after the war the countries engaged will be so exhausted ' that the people will demand a cessation of war expenditure . There will be such a revulsion against war that we shall have an international conference on armament , and we shall probably get an agreement that the various powers shall maintain only such navies as are required to execute national policies . " Mr. Hobson appealed for one large battle cruiser in the programme this I year , but the- Secretary could not see the wisdom of it . Mr. Padget remarked that " battle cruisers cost $20,000. noo and public opinion would be against it now . " " But England and Germany are ordering more and more armored cruisers . " persisted Mr. Hobson , as the committee adjourned for the day . Secretary Daniels will continue at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
