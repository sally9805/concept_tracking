txt We hold this truth to be self-evident : that if in joining the League of Nations the " United States would surrender " vital points of sovereignty " ; if in joining the League we should abandon the Monroe Doctrine ; if the war powers of Congress and the control of Congress over out armament would be surrendered to the League ; if control of imrnigratior , would pass from the United State ) Government to the League ; ? then , the question of acesUting or rejecting the League of Nations plan is the most Compelling , " and momentous of all the questions now awaiting the decision of the American people . That being true , and it IC quite beyond controversy , then the deliverance of the Nation from all these perils must be the thought and purpose uppermost in the minds of the people . In any by-election to Congress , for instance , no trumpery issues . of local politics , no merely personal preference for one candidate over the other , would determine the choice to be made . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senator LODGE , for instance , that this danger to our sovereignty , to our very existence as an Independent nation , really impends , then they would cast their votes , so far as they were able , to elect an opponent of the League . If the choice were between candidates of the two leading parties , they would naturally elect a Republican , for the Republican leaders have set themselves in opposition to the League . Wherever the electorate has been convinced by the speeches against the League , we Hhould suppose the majority for the Republican candidate would be imposing . It therefore follows , either that Senator KNox 's speech has not convinced the people of his own State . or that the voters of the Twenty-second Congressional District in Pennsylvania are indifferent to the fate of the Nation , to its sovereignty , to the Monroe Doctrine , to the threatened impairment of the constitutional powers of Congress . For in the election held in that district on Wednesday JOHN H. Witsole , Democrat , was chosen to fill the vacancy caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. E. BOBBIN s . In the November election Mr. Rossiss bad a majority of 7,231 over his Democratic opponent ; Mr. WILSON , Democrat , was elected on Wednesday by a majority of 473 . Only once since the Republican Party was organized has it failed to carry this district ; that was in 1912 , when the party was divided by the Progressive movement . Here is a change of some 7,700 votes in a Republican Congressional district in the leading Republican State . Mr. WILSON was elected on a platform approving the League of Nations , urging the voters to uphold the President . We leave it for opponents of the League to admit or deny that the election of Mr. Wiesoet is evidence in support of the President 's declaration that the American people approve the League of Nations plan . We content ourselves with the affirmation that the result of the election . - in the Twenty-second Pennsylvania District proves at least that the speeches of the Republican Senators against the League and their " round robin " have failed to carry conviction to the hearts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
