txt The city officials will soon have to deal with a problem presented by an amendment to the workmen 's compensation law inserted by the Legislature at the last moment extending its provisions to include State and municipal employes . This amendment , if effective . will not only make the city liable for injuries to its employes , but will make it necessary for it to take out insurance against this liability the same as any other employer . This raises the question whether the city shall insure in the State fund , in a liability company , in a mutual association , or shall carry its own insurance . These four means are open to I other employers , but to carry their own insurance they must first obtain , the authorization of the Workmen 's Compensation Commission . The next question will be how many and which of the 100,000 city employes are to be covered . Under an interpretation attributed to the commission , an employer who has any employes falling within the occupations classified as nazardous will be liable for injuries to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , it would be liable for injuries to tile Mayo- the Controller , or any other officia ' City Chamberlain Henry Eruere , in his capacity of Vice Chairman of the ' Pension Commission appointed by May1 or Gaynor , obtained yesterday from Prof. Thomas I. Parkinson of Columbia University , an authority on workmen 's compensation laws , an informal discussion of the provisions of-the law as affecting city employes . The pension system of the city has been for some time under examination by this commissioni , and as it is intended to provide'for city employes injured or killed in the city serl.:ice , especially policemen and . fin ? - men , the relation between the subjects is intimate . The amendment to the Workmen 's Compensation law also provides that in the case of the State and city employes l'ensions shall be deducted from death benefits under the act . It is likely that the Pension Commission will be one of the agencies on which the City Governmen will rely for assistance in working out the Problem presented by the new law , which goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved in this city will , of course , nave their counterparts in the other cities of the State and in the State Government . Prof. Parkinson , in his letter to Mr. Bruere , said that he would not attempt at this time to go into a comprehensive statement of the specific provisions of the act . hut would only indicate the serious general questions involved in applying it to the city as an employer . " The subject , " he sate , " is a complex one and it has been made more complex by the attempt to apply to the city service an act originally intended only for commercial employments by the insertion of a few words in the definition of the word ' employer ' What the attitude of the city officials should be and what action you should take under the act depends not only upon a careful Interpretation of the act as applied to the city service , but also an appreciation of your general attitude toward the subject of providing compensation for city employes injured in the course of their employment or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their employment . " The act as originally passed did not apply to the State or its cities because the definition of ' employer ' in the act expressly omitted the State and cities : and , moreover , the definition of ' employment ' expressly limited the act to those employments ' in a trade . business , or occupation carried on by the employer for pecuniary gain . ' Even if the definition of employer had not expressly excluded cities , this definition of ' employment ' would have done so . At least I do not now have in mind any function or activity of the City of New York which can be said to be carried on by the city ' for pecuniary gain . ' " While ? it was unquestionably the purpose of the bill to so amend the original compensation act as to bring the city and its employes under the act , there is , unfortunately , grave doubt of the legal effect of the amendments . The Legislature amended the term ' employer ' so that it Includes the State and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of ' employment . ' It would seem , therefore . that while the city is now within the term ' employer . ' as used In the act , it is responsible for compensation under the act only where it can be shown to be g carryin on an employment for pecuniary gain . ' " No employments are affected by the act unless they are included in the groups described in it , and the only ones that seem to me to include the functions or the activities of the City of New York are the construction , operation , repair . Zec. , or railways ( subways ) and noesibly telegraph nr telephone lines ; the operation , repair , &c.,; of vessels : paving . sewer , and subway construction and similar work ; operation of stationary engines and boilers ; - operation on the street of cars , trucks , other vehicles . &c.; " Assuming that the act applies to the city at all . It may be held that it applies only to the employes engaged in those activities which fall within the groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's activities fall within those groups , therefore all the employes of the city are within the act . I do not believe this interpretation can be sustained . " Another amendment made at the last moment changes the penalty for failure on the part of an employer to comply with the law from $1 a day for every employee td ' an amount equal to the pro rata premium that would have been payable to the State fund for the period of non-compliance
