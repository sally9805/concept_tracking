txt Among bankers , considerable satisfaction was expressed regarding the terms of the new Government loan . On all sides , Secretary Glass was commended for his dncisions in the various particulars of the offering . The announcement , in fact , appears to have created the same , favorable impression as marked the announcements of previous Liberty Loans , when , after much speculation as to what the terms and conditions  --  would be , Mr. surprised the banking community with his unique and resourceful decisions . The most surprising feature of the announcement was the amount of the loan , $4.500,000,000 . Bankers expected two classes of bonds , and they felt assured that the taxable issue would lie in the neighborhood of 43 , .1% . But they were not prepared to have the loan confined to $4,500,000,000 . This is where Secretary Glass has exercised his master-stroke in preparing a favorable reception for his loan. - it may have been that he felt that so large a sum as the Fourth Loan could scarcely be expected at this time . But , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of an overwhelming inundation , necessitating an enormous strain upon the banks . The banks and the loan committees know wed they can float $4,500,000,0004on this occasion . Another interesting feature . is the inter-convertibility of the two issues  --  the 434% taxable only as to Federal super-taxes and the 334% free from all taxes . The effect of this inter-convertibility will be to keep the prices of the two issues on the market at a parity , for if one falls too low it will be profitable to buy and convert into the issue commanding the higher price . In other words , the opportunity for arbitrage between the issues will tend to keep the prices of the two issues at the same level . It is pointed out that this inter-convertibility has also this recommendation to the rich investor , namely , that he can subscribe originally for the 43 ' 4% note , and subsequently convert it into a 3 3 ' 4% tax-free obligation By this expedient , his real purpose , avoiding taxes , will not be disclosed . If this practice is resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue original subscription over the of time , the conversions may notes outstanding . Charles E. Mitchell , president of the National City Co. , believes the Victory Liberty Loan , as announced by , Mr. Glass , should prove a pronounced success . " I think that Mr. Glass has made excellent decisions , both in regard to the amount and the rates . The rates on the two issues are such that they should prove particularly attractive to all classes of investors . It is difficult to ray which of the two issues will produce the greater subscriptions , but I think both will be big . " It is a good thing that the , Secretary hhs confined the loan to the relatively small amount of $4.500,000,000 . Ho says that this will be the last popular loan but he admits that he may have to resort to other borrowings to meet current requirements , presumably certificates of indebtedness placed among the banks . This can not he objected to . The banks do not mind the revolving certificates which contribute to their funds the desired liquidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years it will give him an opportunity perhaps of refunding the issue into a lower-rated obligation . " " Secretary Glass used eminently sound judgment in ' fixing the terms of the Victory Loan , " says a member of a prominent banking firm . " The terms can not he characterized as being other than attractive , and the loan should he successfully floated , provided , however , the public does not become over-confident . Aside from the interest sates and the short maturity , the most attractive features of the iorthcoming issue are the absolute limitation of subscriptions to a figure which is lower than had been expected and the fact that the public will not be appealed to again . " Still , the amount th t Secretary calls for is large , and while there can he hardly any doubt about the final outcome , it will require considerable effort to accomplish the flotation , particularly as every endeavor should he made to place the notes in the hands of the lesser subscribers , and relieve corporations from the necessity of subscribing for any large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous issues , while their earnings arc not running as high as they did Itefore the cessation of hostilities . ' D. E. Pomeroy , vice-president of the Bankers Trust Co .. in commenting on the Victory Liberty Loan , said : " The terms of the Victory Loan will unquestionably commend themselves to the public and will grow in favor as they are understood by everyone who has a dollar or can e a dollar for investment . " Secretary Glass has evidently been liberal to the investor and at the Caine time safeguarded the proper interests of the Government . " From a patriotic standpoint  --  our armies have taken their objective and held them  --  largely to the cRilian Yank falls the mopping-up process , of keeping the Government Treasury in funds to meet its debts promptly and keep its credit clean , and they will not be found wanting . It 's not in the blood " Charles M.

" Thomas Cochran of . I. P. Morgan &; Co .. in commenting on the terms of the Victory Liberty Loan , said : " The interest rate to be borne by the Victory-Liberty Loan is so fair , and the taxation features so liberal , I firmly believe the issue will go well . The limit as to the amount offered and the interest , rate , will have little effect , I believe , on prices of outstanding Liberty bonds . " F. D. Bartow , vice-president of the First National Bank , in commenting on the terms of the Victory Liberty Loan said : " There is little question but what the Victory Loan will he a success owing to the limited offering , the attractive rate and the short maturity . The terms of the Victory issue have already reflected strength in prices for outstanding Liberty bonds . "
