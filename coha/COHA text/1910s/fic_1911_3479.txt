But say , I ai n't one of them kids that gets callouses on the hands doin ' it . When I 'm handed the fresh air on payday , I do n't choke to death over it . I goes out and rustles for another job . And I takes my pick , too . Why not ? It 's just as easy . This time I gets a bug that the new Octopus Buildin ' might have been put up special for me . Anyway , it looked good from the outside , and I blows in through the plate glass merry go round . The arcade was all to the butterscotch , everything handy , from an A. D. T. stand to Turkish baths in the basement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter guy . " Think of buying the buildin ' , sonny ? " says he . " There 'd be room for you on the sidewalk if I did , " says I. " But say , if you can tear your eyes off the candy counter queen long enough , tell me who 's got a sign out this mornin ' . " " They 're going to elect a second vice-president of the Interurban to-day . Would that suit you ? " says he , twistin ' up his lip whisker and lookin ' cute . " Maybe , " says I ; " but I 'd take a portfolio as head office boy if I knew where to butt in . " " Then chase up to 2146 , " says he . " You 'll find ' em waitin ' for you with a net . Here 's your car . Up ! " and before I knows it I has done the skyrocket act up to floor twenty-one . Well say , you would n't have thought so many kids read the want ads. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor was full of ' em , all sizes , all kinds . It looked like recess time at a boys ' orphan asylum , and with me against the field I stood to be a sure loser . I had n't no more'n climbed out before they starts to throw the josh my way . " Hey , Reddy , get in line ! The foot for yours , Peachblow ! " they yells at me . And then I comes back . " Ah , flag it ! " says I. " Do I look like I belonged in your class ? Brush by , you three-dollar pikers , and give a salaried man a show ! " With that I makes a quick rush at 2146 and gets through the door before they has time to make a howl . The letterin ' on the ground glass was what got me . It said as how this was the home office of the Glory Be Mining Company , and there was a string of high-toned names as long as your arm . But the minute I sizes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lookin ' for about a thousand feet of floor space ; but all I could see was a couple of six by nines , includin ' a clothes closet and a corner washbowl . There was a grand aggregation of two as an office force . One was a young lady key pounder , with enough hair piled on top of her head to stuff a mattress . The other was a long faced young feller with an ostrich neck and a voice that sounded like a squeaky door . " Go outside ! " says he , wavin ' his hands and puttin ' on a weary look . " Mr. Pepper ca n't see any of you until he has finished with the mail . Now run along . " " I ca n't , " says I ; " my feet wo n't let me . Is that the Pepper box in there ? " The door was open a foot or two ; so I steps up to take a peek at the main squeeze . And say , the minute I sees him I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried up whiskered freaks , nor he wa' n't any human hog , with no neck and three chins . He was the kind of a gent you see comin ' out of them swell cafes , and he looked like a winner , Mr. Belmont Pepper did . His breakfast seemed to be settin ' as well as his coat collar , and you could tell with one eye that he would n't come snoopin ' around early in the day , nor hang around the shop after five . Pepper has his heels up on the rolltop , burnin ' a real Havana . That 's the kind of a boss I likes . I lays out to connect , too . " Say , " says I to the long faced duck , " you hold your breath a minute and I 'll be back ! " Then I steps outside , yanks the " Boy Wanted " sign off the nail , and says to the crowd good and brisk , just as though I come direct from headquarters : " It 's all over , kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group picture taken you 'd better hit the elevator . " Wow ! There was call for another sudden move just then . I was lookin ' for that , though , and by the time the first two of ' em struck the door I was on the other side with the key turned . Riot ? Well say , you 'd thought I 'd pinched the only job in New York ! They kicked on the door and yelled through the transom and got themselves all worked up . The lady key pounder grabs hold of both sides of her table and almost swallows her tuttifrutti , the ostrich necked chap turns pea green , and Mr. Pepper swings his door open and sings out , real cheerful : " Mr. Sweetwater , ca n't you get yourself mobbed without being so noisy about it ? What 's up , anyway ? " But Sweetwater was n't a lightnin ' calculator . He stands there with his mouth open , gawpin ' at me , and tryin ' to figure out what 's broke loose ; so I pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a bunch of also rans out there , Mr. Pepper , " says I , " that do n't know when to fade . They 're just grouchy because I 've swiped the job . " I was lookin ' for him to sit up at that ; but he do n't . " What makes you think that you 've got it ! " says he . " ' Cause I 'm in and they 're out , " says I. " Anyway , they 're a lot of dopes , and a man like you wants a live one around . That 's me . Where do I begin ? " And I chucks the sign into a waste basket and hangs my cap on a hook . Now , that ai n't any system you can follow reg'lar . I do n't often do it that way , ' cause I ai n't any fonder of bein ' thrown through a door than the next one . But this was a long shot and I was willin ' to run the risk . That fat headed starter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so I was just achin ' to squeeze the lemon in his eye by makin ' good . For awhile , though , I could n't tell whether I was up in a balloon or let in on the ground floor . Mr. Pepper was givin ' me the search warrant look-over , and I see he 's one of these gents that you ca n't jar easy . I had n't rushed him off his feet by my through the center play . There was still plenty of chance of my gettin ' the low tackle . " If I might ask , " says he , smooth as a silk lid , " what is your name ? " " Ah , w'at 's the use ? " says I , duckin ' my head . " Look at that hair ! You might 's well begin callin ' me Torchy ; you 'd come to it . " He did n't grin nor nothin ' ; but only I see his eyes wrinkle a little at the corners . " Very well , Torchy , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nah , I ai n't , " says I. " But if you 're stuck on such things I can get ' em . There 's a feller down on Ann-st. that 'll write beauts for a quarter a throw . " " So ? " says he . " Then we 'll pass that point . Why did you leave your last place ? " " By request , " says I. " The stiff gives me the fire . He said I was too fresh . " " He was mistaken , I suppose , " says Mr. Pepper . " You 're not fresh , are you ? " " Well say , I ai n't no last year 's limed egg , " says I. " If you 're lookin ' for somethin ' that 's been in the brine all winter , you 'd better put the hook in again . " He rubs his chin at that . " Do you like hard work ? " says he . " Think I 'd be chasin ' up an office boy snap , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so to let that soak in , knockin ' his cigar ashes off on the rug in that careless way a man that ai n't married does , and then he springs another . " I presume that if you were left alone in the office occasionally , " says he , " you could learn to run the business ? " " Nix , not ! " says I. " When I plays myself for a confidential manager I wants to pull down more than four per . Givin ' book agents the quick back up and runnin ' errands is my strong points . For tips on the market and such as that I charges overtime . " Course , I 'd figured it was all off by then , seein ' as how I had n't rung the bell at any crack . That 's why I was so free with the hot air . Mr. Pepper , he squints at me good and hard , and then pushes the call button . " Mr. Sweetwater , " says he , " this young man 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in running the affairs of the Glory Be Mining Company . Put him on the payroll at five a week , and then induce that mass meeting in the corridor to adjourn . " " Say , " says I , " does that mean I 'm picked ? " " You 're the chosen one , " says he . " Gee ! " says I. " You had me guessin ' , though ! But you ai n't drawn any blank . I 'll shinny on your side , Mr. Pepper , as long 's you 'll let me -- and that 's no gust of wind , either . " And say , inside of three days I 'd got the minin ' business down to a science . Course it was a cinch . All I has to do is fold bunches of circulars , stick stamps on the envelopes , and lug ' em up to the general P. O. once a day . That , and chasin ' out after a dollar 's worth of cigars now and then for Mr. Pepper , and keepin ' Sweetie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweetie was cut out for the undertakin ' business , by rights . He took things hard , he did . Every tick of the clock was a solemn moment for him , and me gettin ' a stamp on crooked was a case that called for a heart to heart talk . He used to show me the books he was keepin ' , and the writin ' was as reg'lar as if it 'd been done on a job press . " You 're a wonder , you are , Sweetie , " says I ; " but some day your hand is going to joggle , and there 'll be a blot on them pages , and then you 'll die of heart disease . " Miss Allen , the typewriter fairy , was a good deal of a frost . She was one of the kind that would blow her lunch money on havin ' her hair done like some actress , and worry through the week on an apple and two pieces of fudge at noon . I never had much use for her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly human at all . She 'd sit and pat that hair of hers by the hour , feelin ' to see if all the diff'rent waves and bunches was still there . It was a work of art , all right ; but it did n't leave her time to think of much else . I used to get her wild by askin ' how the six other sisters was comin ' on these days . We did n't have any great rush of customers in the office . About twice a day some one would stray in ; but gen'rally they was lookin ' for other parties , and we did n't take in money enough over the counter to pay the towel bill . It had me worried some , until I tumbles that the Glory Be was a mail order snap . All them circulars we sent out told about the mine . And say , after I 'd read one of ' em I did n't see how it was we did n't have a crowd throwin ' money at us . It was good readin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel lib'ry . I 'd never been right next to a gold mine before , and it got me bug eyed just thinkin ' about it . Why , this mine of ours was one that the Injuns had kept hid for years and years , killin ' off every white man that stuck his nose into the same county . But after awhile a feller by the name of Dakota Dan turned Injun , got himself adopted by the tribe , and monkeyed around until he found the mine . It near blinded him the first squint he got of them big chunks of gold . The Injuns caught him at it and finished the business with hot irons . Then they roasted him over a fire some and turned him loose to enjoy himself . He was tougher'n a motorman , though . He did n't die for years after that ; but he never said nothin ' about the gold mine until he was nearly all in . Then he told his oldest boy the tale and gave him a map of the place , makin ' him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck to it , too . He grew up and kept a grocery store , and it wa' n't until after he 'd died of lockjaw from runnin ' a rusty nail in his hand and the widow had sold out the store to a Swede that the map showed up . The Swede swapped the map to a soap drummer for half a dozen cakes of scented shaving sticks , and the drummer goes explorin ' . He had a soap drummer 's luck . He did n't find any Injuns left . Most of ' em had died off and the rest had joined Wild West shows . The gold mine was there , though , with chunks of solid gold lyin ' around as big as peach baskets . Mr. Drummer looks until his eyes ache , and then he hikes himself back East to get up a comp'ny to work the mine . He 'd just made plans to build a solid gold mansion on Fifth-ave. and hire John D. Rockefeller for a butler , when he strays into one of these Gospel missions and gets religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees how selfish it would be to keep all that gold for himself . " But how 'll I divvy it ? " says he . " And who with ? " Then he decides that he 'll divide with ministers , because they 'll use it best . So he gets up this Glory Be Mining Company , and hires Mr. Pepper to sell the stock at twenty-five cents a share to all the preachers in the country . Blamed if it wa' n't straight goods ! I looked on the letters we sent out , and every last one of ' em was to ministers . Talk about your easy money ! This was like pickin ' it off the bushes . Mr. Pepper shows ' em how they can put in fifty or a hundred dollars and in three or four years be pullin ' out their thousands in dividends . You 'd thought they 'd came a runnin ' at a chance like that , would n't you ? There we was givin ' ' em a private hunch on a proposition that was all velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands us a comeback . It was enough to make a man turn the hose on his grandmother . Course , a few of ' em did loosen up and send on real money . I used to stand around and pipe off the boss while he shucked the mail , and I could tell whether it was fat or lean by the time it took him to eat lunch . The days when I was sent out to cash five or six money orders , and soak away a bunch of checks , he 'd call a cab at twelve-thirty and would n't come back until near four ; but when there wa' n't much doin ' he 'd send out for a tray and put in the afternoon dictatin ' names and addresses to Miss Allen . Then there come a slack spell that lasted for a couple of weeks , and we did n't get hardly any mail at all , except from some crank out in Illinois that had splurged on a whole ten dollars ' worth of shares , and wrote in about every other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin comin ' his way . I heard Miss Allen talkin ' it over with Sweetie . It was along about then that this duck from the post-office buildin ' showed up . He comes gumshoein ' around one noon hour , while I was all by my lonesome , and he asks a whole lot of questions that I 'd forgot the answer to . I was tellin ' the boss about him that night around closin ' up time . " I sized him up for one of them cheap skates from the Marshal 's office , " says I. " I did n't know what his game was and I wa' n't goin ' to give up all I knew to him ; so I tells him to call around to-morrow and you 'll load him up with all the information his nut can hold . Was that right ? " Mr. Pepper seems to be mighty int'rested for awhile ; but then he grins , pats me on the shoulder , and says : " That was just right , Torchy , exactly right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour later , after Miss Allen has stuck her gum on the paperweight and skipped , and Sweetwater has slid out too , and just as I was gettin ' ready to call it a day , Mr. Pepper calls me in on the rug . " Torchy , " says he , " during the brief period that we have been associated in business I have found your services very valuable and your society very cheering . In other words , Torchy , you 're all right . " " There 's a pair of us , then , " says I. " You 're as good as they make them , Mr. Pepper . " " Thanks , Torchy , " says he , " thanks . " Then he looks out of the window for a minute before he asks how I 'd like a two-weeks ' vacation with pay . " Well , " says I , " seein ' as how Coney 's froze up , and Palm Beach do n't agree with my health , I 'd just as soon put them two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he ; " but the fact is , Torchy , I 've had a sudden call to go West . " " Out to the Glory Be mine ? " says I. " You 've guessed it , " says he . " And I am taking this opportunity for releasing Sweetwater and Miss Allen . " " They ai n't much use , anyway , " says I. " But you would n't shut up the shop for fair , would you ? Do n't you want some one on hand to answer fool questions , or steer cranks off like that post-office guy that 's comin ' to-morrow ? Unless you think I 'd hook the rolltop or pinch the letterpress , you 'd better leave me sittin ' on the lid . " Well , sir , he seemed to take to that notion , and the next thing I knows I 'm tellin him about my scheme of wantin ' to save up enough dough to pay for a little bunch of them Glory Be stocks . " It 's a shame to waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cinch when it 's passed out to ' em , " says I , " and I 've been thinkin ' that if I hung to the business long enough maybe I 'd have a show to buy in . " Say , you could n't guess what Mr. Pepper up and does then . He opens the safe , counts out a hundred shares of Glory Be common , and fills out the transfer to me right on the spot . " Now , Torchy , " says he , " it will cost you five weeks ' salary to pay for these ; but if I raise you a dollar a week and take it out a little at a time you 'll never miss it . Anyway , you 're a shareholder from now on . " Did you ever get rich all of a sudden , like that ! You feel it first up and down the small of your back , and then it goes to your knees . I could n't say a blamed word that was sensible . I do n't know just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after Mr. Pepper 'd finished up and gone , leavin ' me with two-weeks ' pay in my pocket , and a big envelope full of them Glory Be shares , all printed in gold and purple ink , with a picture of Dakota Dan in the middle . I could n't eat a bite of supper that night , and I puts in the evenin ' readin ' over them pamphlets we 'd been sendin ' out until I knew every word of it by heart . I 'll bet I got up and hid them stocks in a dozen diff'rent places before mornin ' , and an hour before bankin ' time I was sittin ' on the steps of the Treasury Trust concern , waitin ' to hire one of them steel pigeon-holes down in the vaults . After I 'd got the envelope stowed away and tied the key around my neck with a string , I goes back to the office . Sweetie and Miss Allen was there , with their hammers goin ' . They 'd found their blue tickets and their week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been planning to make a change for the last two weeks , " says Miss Allen . " I was looking for something like this . " " Me too , " says Sweetie . " It 's rough on Torchy , though . " " Say , do n't you waste any sympathy on me , " says I , " and do n't let off any more knocks at Mr. Pepper . I wo n't stand for it ! " With that they snickers and does a slow exit . That leaves me runnin ' the gold minin ' business single handed ; but me bein ' one of the firm , as you might say , it was all right . I 'd always had a notion that I 'd be a plute some day ; but honest , I wa' n't expectin ' it so sudden . I was just tryin ' to get used to it , when the door opens and in drifts that guy from the Marshal 's office . " Where 's Mr. Belmont Pepper ? " says he . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him he was headed west . " " Skipped out ! " says the gent , doin ' the foiled villyun stunt with his face . " Skipped nothin ' , " says I. " Mr. Pepper 's gone out to look after the mine . " " Oh , he 's gone to the mine , has he ? " says the duck . " See here , kid , I 'm a United States Deputy Marshal . Do n't you try to tell me any fairy stories , or you 'll pull down trouble . We want your Mr. Pepper , and we want him bad ! He 's a crook . " Well say , it was a hot argument we had . He tries to tell me that this minin ' business is all a bunko game , and that there 's a paper out for the boss . Then he camps down in the private office and says he 'll wait until Mr. Pepper shows up . He makes a stab at it , too , and a nice long wait he has . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to beat it into his head that the Glory Be mine was a real gilt edged proposition . I 'd have been there yet , only they comes and lugs off all the desks and things and makes me give up the keys . Say , it was a tough deal , all right . It was some jay that stirred up all the muss , howlin ' for his coin that he thought he 'd lost . But look at the hole I 'm in , after bein ' so brash to Mr. Pepper about stayin ' on the lid , and him lettin ' me write my own valuation ticket ! How do I square it with him when he comes back and finds I 've stood around and seen him closed out ? Old Velvet Foot , the deputy , says if the boss comes back at all he 'll be wearin ' a diff'rent face and flaggin ' under another name . But I know better . He 's as square as a pavin ' block . If he wa' n't , why was he distributin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keepin ' it in the fam'ly ? " Ah , brush your belfry ! " says I. " Your mind needs chloride of lime on it . " But say , shareholder or not , I 've got to plug the market for somethin ' that 'll pass with the landlady . I 've been livin ' on crullers and coffee for two days now , and that starter guy says if I do n't quit hangin ' around the arcade he 'll have me pinched . I 've wrote out a note to leave for Mr. Pepper , and I guess it 's up to me to frisk another job . You do n't know where they want a near-plute as temp'rary office boy , do you ? CHAPTER II A JOLT FOR PIDDIE It 's a case of " comin ' up , up " with me . Sure as ever ! Ai n't I got stock in a gold mine ? And now I 'm in with the Corrugated Trust . Why , say , two moves more and I 'll be first vice-president . There 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then me . I 'm behind the brass rail , next to the spring water . When you have the front to push through the plate glass , you see me first . If I likes your looks , and your card reads right , maybe I gives you a peek at Mr. Piddie . Anyone that gets past Piddie 's a bird . He 's the Inside Brother , Keeper of the Seal , Watch on the Rhine , and a lot more . He draws down salary for bein ' confidential secretary to the G. M. ; but Con . Sec. do n't half cover it . He keeps the run of everything , from what the last quarterly dividend was down to how many tubs of pins is used by the office force every month . I 'd never made good with Piddie in a month of Yom Kippurs if it had n't been for Old Heavyweight , the main squeeze . Piddie had ten of us lined up for the elimination test , and was puttin ' us through the catechism and the civil service , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see our V. P. ? Say , he uses up cloth enough in his vest to make me a whole suit . He 's a ripe old sport , with a complexion like an Easter egg , and a pair o ' blinks that 'd look a hole through a chilled steel vault . He runs us over without losin ' step , sticks out a finger as he goes by , and says over his shoulder , " Piddie , take that one ! " Me , I was in range . Piddie made a bluff at goin ' on with the third degree business ; but the other entries begins to edge for the door . I was the one best bet ; so what was the use ? See what it is to have a thirty-two candle power thatch ? He could n't have missed me , less'n he 'd been color blind . There 's worse things can happen to you than red hair , all right . Piddie was sore on me from the start , though . He 'd made up his mind to tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored top and a girly voice . Them 's the kind that forgets to bring back change and always has stamps to sell . Oh , I sized up Piddie for a two by four right at the get away ; but I 've been keepin ' him jollied along just for the fun of it . " J. Hemmingway Piddie " is the way he has it printed . Think of wastin ' all them letters , when just plain Piddie is as good as seein ' a strip of pingpong pictures of him ! He 's mostly up and down , Piddie is , like he 'd been pulled out of a bundle of laths , and he 's got one of these inquisitive noses that 's sharp enough to file bills on . Refined conversation is Piddie 's strong hold . It bubbles out of him like steam out of the oatmeal kettle . Sounds that way , too . You know these mush eaters , with their , " Ah , I 'm su-ah , quite su-ah , doncher know " ? He 's got that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could talk it in his sleep . I 've heard ' em before ; but I never looked to hold a sit . under one . It 's a privilege , though , bein ' so close to Piddie . If I do n't forget all the things he tells me , and follows ' em , I 'll be made over new in a month more . He begins with my name . Torchy do n't fit right with him . It might do for some places he did n't mention , but not for the home offices of the Corrugated Trust . " Maybe you 'd like Reginald better ! " says I. " But -- er -- aw -- is that your baptismal name , my boy ? " says he . " Nix , " says I. " I 'm no Baptist . And , anyway , I could n't give up my real name , cause I 'm travelin ' incog. , and me noble relatives would be shocked if they knew I was really workin ' . You can call me Torchy , or Reginald , whichever you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real nice maybe I 'll come . " Every time I throws a jolt like that into J. Hemmingway , he looks kind of stunned and goes off to chew it over . But he gets even all right . Sometimes he 'll take a whole forenoon to dig up somethin ' he thinks is goin ' to give me the double cross . Most of his spare time , though , he puts in tellin ' me about how I 'm to behave when Mr. Robert comes back . For the first few days I had an idea Mr. Robert was the pulley that carried the big belt , and that when he stopped there was a general shut down . I got nervous watchin ' for him . Then I rounds up the fact that he 's Bob Ellins , who cuts more ice in the society columns than he does in the Wall Street notes . Piddie has him down for a little tin god , all right , and that wa' n't such a fool move of Piddie 's , either . Some day Hickory Ellins will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Mr. Robert will get acquainted with an eight o'clock breakfast . See where Piddie comes in ? He 's takin ' out insurance on his job . He needs it bad enough . If I ever get to think as much of a job as Piddie does of his , I 'll have some one nail me to the office chair . Rule No. 1 on my card was never to let anyone through the brass gate unless they belonged inside or had a special permit . Piddie wants to know if I 've ever had any experience with that kind of work . " Say , where do you think I 've been ! " says I. " Why , I did that trick for six months , shuntin ' dopes away from the Sunday editor 's door , and there was times when nothin ' but a club would keep some of ' em out . Back to the bridge , Piddie ! When I 'm on the gate it 's just as good as though you 'd set the time lock . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , when one mornin ' about ten-thirty the door comes open with a bang , and in steps a husky young gent , swingin ' one of these dinky , leather-covered canes , and lookin ' like money from the mint . He did n't make any play to draw a card , same 's they generally does ; but steers straight for the brass gate , full tilt . I never says a word ; but just as he reaches over to spring the catch and break in , I shoves my foot out and blocks it at the bottom , bringin ' him up all standin ' . " Say , this ai n't no ferryhouse , " says I. " Hello ! " says he . " A new one , eh ? " " I ai n't any Fourth-ave. antique , " says I ; " but I 'm over seven . Was you wantin ' to see anyone special ? " He seems to think that 's a joke . " Why , " says he , " I am Mr. Ellins . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " That reaches his funnybone , too . " You 're perfectly right , young man , " says he ; " but I happen to be his son . Now are you satisfied ? " " Nope , " says I. " That bluff do n't go either . If you was Mr. Robert I 'd have been struck by lightnin ' long ' fore this . You 've got one more guess . " Just then I hears a gurgle , like some one 's bein ' choked with a chicken bone , and I squints around behind . There was Piddie , lookin ' like the buildin ' was fallin ' down and tryin ' to uncork some remarks . " Ah , Piddie ! " says the gent . " Perhaps you will introduce me to your new sentry and give me the password . " Well , Piddie did . He almost got on his hands and knees doin ' it . And say , blamed if the duck wa' n't Mr. Robert , after all ! " Gee ! " says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't soothe Piddie , though . He used up the best part of an hour tryin ' to tell me what an awful thing I 'd gone and done . " This ends you , young man ! " he says . " You 're as good as discharged this very moment . " " Is that all ? " says I. " Why , by the way you 've been takin ' on I figured on nothin ' less than sudden death . But if it 's only bein ' fired , do n't you worry . I 've had that happen to me so often that I get uneasy without it . If I should wear a stripe for every time the can 's been tied to me , my sleeves would look like a couple of barber 's poles . Cheer up , Piddie ! Maybe they 'll let you pick out somethin ' that suits you better next time . " He could n't get over it , though . Along about lunch time he comes out to me , as solemn as though he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Robert will attend to my case now . " Piddie , " says I , givin ' him the partin ' grip , " you 've been a true friend of mine . When you hear me hit the asphalt , send out for a chocolate ice cream soda and drown your sorrow . " Then I turns down a page in " Old Sleuth 's Revenge " and goes to the slaughter . Mr. Robert has just talked about three cylinders full of answers to the letters that 's piled up while he 's been gone , and as the girl goes out with the records he whirls around in the mahogany easy-chair and takes a good long look at me . " If it comes as hard as all that , " says I , " I 'll write out my resignation . " " Mr. Piddie 's been talking to you , I suppose ? " says he . " He 's done everything but say mass over me , " says I. " Piddie is a good deal of an --  --  " then he pulls up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't him found me , " says I ; " it was a case of me findin ' him ; but if it had n't been for your old man 's buttin ' in , that 's all the good it would have done me . " " Ah ! " says he . " That explains the mystery . By the way , son , what do they call you ? " " Guess , " says I , and runs me fingers through it . " Just Torchy , and it suits me as well as Percival or Montgomery . " " Torchy is certainly descriptive , " says he . " How long have you been doing office work ? " " Ever since I could lift a waste basket , " says I. " Are you ambitious ? " says he . " Sure ! " says I. " I 'm waitin ' for some bank president to adopt me . " " You came in here expecting to be discharged , I presume ? " says he . " What , me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to ask me over to the Caffy Martang for lunch . " For a minute or so after that he looks me straight in the eye , and I gives him the same . And say , for the kind , he ai n't so worse . Course , I would n't swap him for Mr. Belmont Pepper , who 's the only boss I ever had that I calls the real thing ; but Mr. Robert would get a ratin ' anywhere . " Torchy , " says he after a bit , " I 'm inclined to think that you 'll do . Have a chair . " " Do n't I get the blue ticket , then ? " says I. " No , " says he , " not until you do something worse than obey orders . Besides you 're the cheekiest youth that has ever graced the offices of the Corrugated Trust , and once in awhile we have use for just such a quality . For instance , I am tempted to send you on a very important errand of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Time out ! " says I. Well say , I did n't know what was comin ' , he took so long makin ' up his mind . But Mr. Robert ai n't one of the kind to go off half cocked . He 's got somethin ' on his shoulders besides tailor 's paddin ' , and when he sets the wheels to movin ' you can gamble that he 's gettin ' somewhere . After awhile he slaps his knee and says : " No , there is n't another person around the place who would know how to go about it . Torchy , I 'm going to try you out ! " It was n't anything like I 'd ever been up against before . He hands me an express receipt and says he wants me to go over to Jersey City and get what that calls for without landin ' in jail . " You 'll see a bundle done up in burlap somewhere around the express office , " says he , " a big bundle . It looks like a side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer , one that I shot four days ago up north . Torchy , did you know that it was illegal to shoot deer during certain months of the year ? " " You can be pinched for shootin ' craps any time , " says I. " Really ? " says he . Then he goes on with his tale , givin ' me all the partic'lars , so I would n't make any batty moves . And say , they can think up some queer stunts , hangin ' around the club of an afternoon and lookin ' out at Fifth-ave. through the small end of a glass . This was one of them real clubby dreams . It started by Mr. Robert countin ' himself in on a debate that he did n't know the beginning of . " When they asked me if I could do it , I said , ' Of course I can , ' " says he , " and then I asked what it was . " The bunch had been gassin ' about an old gun hangin ' over the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about Daniel Boone 's havin ' , in the Nickel Libr'ies , the kind you load with a stove poker . Flintlocks -- that 's it ! They was wonderin ' if there was anyone left that could take a relic like that out in the woods and hit anything besides the atmosphere . And the first thing Mr. Robert knows he has been joshed into bettin ' a hatful of yellowbacks that he can take old Injun killer out and bring back enough deer meat to feed the crowd -- and him knowin ' no more about that sort of act than a one-legged man does about skatin ' ! They gives him two weeks to do it in . That wa' n't the worst of it , though , accordin ' to him . They passes the word around until everyone that knows him is on the broad grin . The joke is handed across billiard tables between shots , and is circulated around the boxes at the opera . It 's the best ever ; for Mr. Robert has never hunted anything livelier than a Welsh rabbit , after the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . He never makes a brag ; but he boxes up that old shootin ' iron and drops out of sight . ' Way up in the woods somewhere he digs up an old b'gosh artist that was brought up with one of them guns in his hand , and he takes a private course . After he 's used up a keg of powder shootin ' at tin cans they start out to find where the deers roost . They find ' em , too . Mr. Robert is so rattled that he misses the one he aims at ; but he bores a tunnel through another in the next lot . Course , he thinks he 's got a cinch then . He hustles to the nearest flag station and spends eight dollars sendin ' telegrams to the bunch , invitin ' ' em to a venison feed at the club . Then he has his game sewed up neat in meal bags and expressed to John Doe , Jersey City . See how cute he was ? He 'd heard about the game laws by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . But he had n't counted on that gang tippin ' off the Jersey game wardens , nor on their trailin ' the baggage and express bundles with huntin ' dogs . " The dogs had smelled it out just as I came in to claim it , " says he ; " so all I could do was to keep my mouth closed , standing around and looking foolish until I got tired and came away . And that , Torchy , is the situation up to the present moment . My venison is under guard over in Jersey City , and if it is n't delivered at the club by six o'clock to-night I shall not only lose my bet , but have my life made miserable from cheap jokes for months to come . It occurred to me that if your wits were as bright as the hair that covers them , you might be able to help me out . What do you think ? " " Chee ! " says I , scratchin ' me bonfire , " I guess I 'm down the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes , and lied the boss out of a family row ; but I never tried my hand at kidnappin ' enough meat for a dinner party . How about buyin ' off the game sleuth ? " " He has been bought by the other side , " says Mr. Robert . " He would n't dare to sell them out . " Well , I thunk some more thinks just as punky as that , and then we settles it that I 'm to hike over and take a squint , anyway . I gets him to give me a line on what kind of a looker the warden was , and he throws me a couple of tens for campaign expenses . I was just stowin ' away the green stuff as I goes through the outside office , and Piddie 's eyebrows go up . " They 're goin ' to let me finish out the week , " says I. " Ai n't they the gentle things ? " Then I skips out for the 23d-st. boat , leavin ' Piddie with his mouth open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way or other , I 'm goin ' to talk that game cop into a dope dream and rescue the roast . But , say , I did n't need to look twice at that snoozer to see that no line of hot air I had in stock would soften him up . He had an undershot jaw , a pair of eyes that saw both sides of the street at once , and a head like a choppin ' block . He was sittin ' right alongside of that burlap bundle , waitin ' to spring his tin badge on some one . " Do they send such things as that through without cratin ' ? " says I to a guy behind the chicken wire , jerkin ' me thumb at Mr. Sleuth . " What 's the label on him ? " " That 's Mr. Hinkey Tolliver , special officer , " says he . " Better look out or he 'll break a hand grenade on that still alarm of yours . " " Ah , back to the blotter ! " says I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Mrs. Leslie Carter disguise ? " We swapped a few more like that , while I sizes up Hinkey , tryin ' to map out a way to brace him . But it was a losin ' proposition . He has one of them eyes nailed to what I wanted to take away and the other trained on the door , and you could tell by the way he held his jaw that nothin ' short of an earthquake would jar him loose . It was too much for me . If it had n't been that Mr. Robert had put it up to me so flat , I 'd have quit then . But I could n't lay down with just a look ; so I takes a turn around into the passenger waitin ' room , battin ' my head for a new line . I guess it was kind of second sight that steers me over into the corner where there is an A. D. T. branch . I wa' n't lookin ' for anyone I knew , seein ' it 's been so long since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sittin ' on the call bench , but Hunch Leary ! And , say , between the time I 'd give him the nod to come out , and his askin ' how it was I 'd shook the red stripe , I 'd framed up the whole scheme . First I goes over to the girl under the blue bell and rings up Mr. Robert . " Hello , " says I , " this is Torchy . " " Good ! " says he . " Have you got it ? " " Got nothin ' ! " says I. " You must think I 'm a writ of habeas corpus . I want to know who was the gent that most likely tipped off your warden friend . " When I 'd got that I asks the time of the next uptown boat , and makes a deal with one of them ferry hawks to back his chariot up near the express office door and be ready to make a swift move for the gangplank . Then me and Hunchy fakes up this little billy ducks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest ' phone and call up the gent that Mr. Robert had put me wise to . It was worse'n playin ' a three-ball combination for the side pocket , and I holds my breath while Hunch pokes his book at him and waits to see if there 's any answer . Tolliver , he reads it over two or three times , first with one eye and then the other . One minute I thought he was goin ' , and the next he settles back like he 'd made up his mind to balk . He squints at the burlap package , and then at the message , and all of a sudden he makes a break for the ' phone . He had n't begun movin ' before I was up to the window with my receipt , callin ' for ' em to get a hustle on , as Mr. Doe had run out of veal and had to have it in a hurry . Ever try to poke up one of them box jugglers ? They took their time about it -- and me lookin ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an O. K. on it after awhile , and for a quarter I hired a wagon helper to drag the bundle out and chuck it into the hansom . Then I climbs in and we made the boat just as the bell rang . She was pullin ' out of the slip when Tolliver rushes out about as calm as a bulldog chasin ' a tramp . " Say , " says the driver , climbin ' down to take a look at the baggage , " who you got sewed in the sack ! " " Get on your perch ! " says I. " Ai n't you makin ' extra money on this ? And when you fetch up at the club , do it like you was used to stoppin ' at such places . " It was a great ride that me and the deer meat had across town and up Fifth-ave . I 'd stopped once to put Mr. Robert next ; so he was waitin ' for me out in front of the club , wearin ' a grin that was better'n a breakfast food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Piddie when Mr. Robert shows up next mornin ' and pats me on the back like I was one of his old Hasty Puddin ' chums . " Piddie , " says I , " look what it is to be born handsome and lucky , all in one throw ! " CHAPTER III MEETING UP WITH THE GREAT SKID Next time you nabs me writin ' a form sheet on any unknown , you can hang out the waste paper sign and send me to the scows . Look at the mess I makes of this here Mallory business ! Why , first off I has him billed for a Percy boy that had strayed into the general office from the drygoods district . He had a filin ' job in the bond room , and when he drew his envelope on Saturdays it must have set the Corrugated Trust back for as much as twelve D. Course , I did n't pay no attention to him , until one noon I finds him in the next chair at the dairy lunch . He 's got his mug of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef splits , with plenty of mustard , and he 's just squarin ' off for a foodfest , when I squats down with two hunks of pie and all the cheese I could get at one grab . " Hello , Algy ! " says I. " Where 's the charlotte russe and the cup of tea ? " " Beg pardon , " says he ; " were you speaking to me ? " " Sure , " says I. " You did n't think I was makin ' that crack at the armchair , did you ? Maybe we ai n't been introduced ; but we 're on the same payroll . " " Oh , yes , " says he , " I remember now . You 're the -- the --  --  " " Go on , say it , " says I. " I do n't mind if it is red , and I lets anybody call me Torchy that wants to , even Willies . " " Well , now , that 's nice of you , " says he , sidetrackin ' a bite to look me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that open face movement that made me suspicious maybe he wa' n't one of the Algernon kind , after all . But he had most of the points , from the puff tie to the way he spoke . It wa' n't the hot potato dialect Piddie uses ; but it leaned that way . If he 'd been a real Willie boy , though , he 'd gone up in the air , and maybe I 'd got slapped on the wrist . His springin ' that grin was a hunch for me to hold the decision . " How long you been keepin ' Corrugated stocks from goin ' below par ? " says I. That stuns him for a minute , and then a light breaks . He throws another grin . " Oh , about a year , " he says . " Chee ! " says I. " And they ai n't put you on the board of directors yet ? " " I 've managed to keep off so far , " says he . " Get a lift every quarter , though , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same salary I began with , if that 's what you mean , " says he , tacklin ' another sandwich that had got past the meat inspectors . " Yours must be fatter'n most of the Saturday prize packages they hand out in the general office , or you would n't have kept satisfied so long , " says I. He thinks that over for awhile , like it was a new proposition , and then he says , quiet and easy , " I 'm not at all sure , you see , that I am satisfied . " " Why not chuck it then and make another grab ? " says I. " It 's good luck sometimes to shake the bag . " He swings his shoulders up at that ,  - -  and say , he 's got a good pair , all right !  - -  but he do n't say a word . " Ai n't married the job , have you ? " says I. " Or have you lost your nerve ? " " Perhaps it 's a lack of nerve , as you suggest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to himself than anything else . " Do n't think you could connect with another , eh ? " says I. He shakes his head . " I 'm not exactly proud of the fact , " says he ; " but I do n't mind telling you in confidence that it required the combined efforts of my entire family and all my friends to get me into this job . " " Honest ? " says I. " Chee ! They picked a pippin for you , did n't they ? " " It 's a star , " says he . " So 's a swift kick from the bottom of a well , " says I. With that I shakes off the pie crumbs and takes a chase up around the Flatiron , to watch the kids collectin ' cigar coupons and take a look at the folks from the goshfry-mighty belt shiverin ' in the rubberneck buggies . Say , I never feel quite so much to home in this burg as when I watch them jays from the one-night stands payin ' their coin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I gets back on the gate I tries to figure out this Mallory gent ; but I ca n't place him . He 's no Willie , and he 's no dope , I can see that . With his age and general get-up , though , he ought to be pullin ' out fifty or so a week . What 's he been at all this time ? I was just curious enough to stroll over and take a look at him . He has his coat off , pluggin ' away on the job and doin ' the kind of work that I could learn to play with any time I had a day off . Not that I 'm lookin ' for it . Bein ' head office boy suits me down to the ground . That 's bein ' somethin ' , even if they do pay you off with a five and a one . But if you 're a live one you 'll get tipped as much more . And you do n't have cold chills up the spine every time the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck like Mallory ca n't get in any such game ; so he 's got to dig away at the filin ' case and wear his last summer 's suit until Christmas . Diggin ' and keepin ' quiet seemed to be his only play . Just as though he 'd ever win any medals by the way he stacked papers away in little pasteboard boxes ! He wins somethin ' else , though . One day the general manager rushes into Mallory 's corner after somethin ' he wanted in a hurry , and by the time he 'd found it he 'd pied things from one end of the coop to the other . Mallory was just tryin ' to straighten out the mess , when along comes Piddie , with that pointed nose of his in front . Piddie do n't ask any questions ; he throws a fit . Why , he had Mallory on the carpet for forty minutes by the clock , givin ' him the grand roast , and the only time Mallory opens up to tell him how it was he shuts him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallory ! I am here to get results , not excuses . Is that quite clear ? " " Yes , sir , " says Mallory . Say , but he did it well ! He looks that peanut headed snipe straight in the eye all the time after that and takes what 's comin ' to him without turnin ' a hair . It was " Yes , Mr. Piddie , " and " No , Mr. Piddie " ; but nothin ' else . And the cooler and politer he was , the wilder Piddie got . When I hears him tell Mallory that another such break will cost him his job , I was achin ' to throw the letterpress at him and break him in two . I could n't hardly wait for Mallory to shut the door before I let loose . " Say , Piddie , " says I , " if you do n't think you 'll sleep easy to-night unless you give some one the bounce , why not fire me ? Go on , now ; I 'll make out a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around like a pup with a sore ear . " Piddie turns white and gives me the glassy eye -- that 's all . I could n't tease a fire out of him with a box of matches . But that did n't make up for the way he 'd roughed Mallory . I was still sore over it at closin ' time ; so I lays for Mallory and asks him why he did n't risk the job and take a crack at Piddie 's jaw . He just laughs . " Oh , " says he , " I could n't pay him that compliment . " Was that a joke , yes ? Blamed if I could tell . Anyway , it wa' n't sense . And there 's where I had the front to put it straight up to Mallory about his bein ' stranded in a place where he had to take such pin jabbin ' as that . " Say , " says I , " is it hard luck , or a late start , or what ? " " I fancy a late start would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " says I. " That 's it , " says he . " Aw , fudge ! " says I. " Honest , I did n't take you for one of them rah-rah boys . Well , if it 's that ails you , you 're up against it . I do n't wonder you had to be jammed into a job with a flyin ' wedge . Chee ! " I was sorry for him , though . Maybe it was somethin ' he could n't duck . Some of ' em I 've known of could n't . Oh , I 've seen bunches of ' em , just turned out . Did n't we have more'n a dozen unloaded on us when me and Mr. Marshall was gettin ' out the Sunday edition ? And we did n't do a thing to ' em , either ! But it 's a tough deal , after puttin ' in all that time dodgin ' the fool killer at some one else 's expense , to be chucked into the grub game with nothin ' but a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallory was that sort . Nice young feller , too . Never slung any of his Greek at me , nor flashed his college pins . Seemed to kind of like chinnin ' to me at lunch ; so I let him . You know how you 'll get to gassin ' and tellin ' each other the story of your life . I lets out about Belmont Pepper and the minin ' stocks he gave me , and Mallory drops hints about mother and sister , that was livin ' off in Washington or somewhere with a brother that was in better luck . Mallory , he was doin ' the hall bedroom act , livin ' on that twelve per and keepin ' out of sight of everyone he 'd ever known until he 'd made good . Guess he found it kind of a lonesome deal . Once when I was extra flush I offers to blow him to a fam'ly circle seat at " The Bandit Queen " ; but he says he thinks he 'd better not go . " Plannin ' to have a spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he . " Well , how do you put in your off time , anyway ? " says I. And say , whatcher think ? His programme is to light up the gas stove reg'lar after dinner and fill his head full of truck out of the trade monthlies and Wall Street columns , postin ' himself on Corrugated business . " Gettin ' ready to give the old man a few private tips ? " says I. " Not until he asks for them , " says he . " Then you 've got lots of time , " says I. " But it 's a punk way of enjoyin ' yourself . " Maybe it was thinkin ' about what a dead slow time he was havin ' that gives me the cue to stir up that lovely mess , or perhaps it was because the thing was sprung on me so unexpected . It come one day when I was busy drawin ' pictures of Piddie on the blotter . I hears a giggle , and squints up to see a pair that looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a husky youth in a frock coat , with a face like a full moon and a voice that did n't call for any megaphone . The other was a her , and she was a bundle of tuttifrutti , the kind you see floatin ' by in sixty horsepowers , all veils and furs and eyes . " Hello , sonny , " says he , swingin ' up to the brass gate , wearin ' a four-inch grin . " Where 's the Great Skid ? " " Give it up , " says I. " Have you tried the Zoo ? " " He-haw ! " says he , with the stops all out and a forced draft on . " That 's a good one , that is ! But we have n't much time and we 're looking for Skid . Where do you keep him ? " " Say , " says I , " we 've got a lot of freaks on tap ; but we 're just out of Skids . Anything else do ? " Then she comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dicky ! " says she . " It is n't likely they call him that here . Tell the young man it 's Bert Mallory we wish to see . " " You 're right , Sis , right as usual , " says Dick . " It 's Mallory we 're looking for . " " Oh ! " says I. " Mister Mallory ? " " There now , Dicky ! " says she , pokin ' him with her elbow and touchin ' off another giggle . " Did n't I tell you ? " " He-haw ! " says Dicky . " Mister Mallory , of course . " But I did n't feel he-hawy a bit ; for it was up to me to tow Mallory 's swell college chum and his sister in where the boy was jugglin ' the file cases . And them lookin ' for him to be sittin ' in a swing chair with his name painted big on the door ! That was when I dug up my fool thought . " Cards ! " says I. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the general manager . " " Oh ! " gurgles Sis . " Does n't that sound business like , though ? I suppose Skid -- er -- Mr . Mallory is quite a busy man , is n't he ? " " Busy , " says I. " Say , you do n't think he has all of us around here to play marbles , do you , miss ? " Sis , she gets mighty int'rested at that . " He 's a very important man now , is n't he ? " says she . " Chee , yes ! " says I. " He 's I-double-it around here . " " Is n't that fine ? " says Sis . " But I hope he can see us . " " Oh , I 'll fix that all right , " says I. With that I slides through two doors and into Mr. Robert 's room . He 's still out to lunch , of course , it bein ' only about two o'clock ; so I unlocks the corridor door that he do n't use and skips across into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mallory , " you 're wanted in the boss 's office . No , not the old man 's ; Mr. Robert 's . Skin into your coat and come along . " Never fazes him a bit . He just hunches his shoulders , knocks the dust off his hands , and trots after . When I gets him in there I tells him to wait a minute , and then I goes out through the right way and lugs in Dicky and sister . Was it a surprise party ? Well , say ! Dicky lets out a roar , makes a plunge for him , hammers him on the back , works the pump handle , and talks a blue streak . " Well , Skiddy , old man , here we are ! " says he . " Thought you 'd given us the shake for good , eh ? But we heard you 'd gone in with the Corrugated ,  - -  saw Blicky in Venice and he told us ,  - -  so when we came ashore we wired father to hold the car over one train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me come unless she could too . Here , Sis , it 's your turn . Blaze ahead now and give the boy what you said you would . I 'll turn my back . " I did n't , though . Was there any hangin ' off about Sis ? Not so you 'd notice it . She just steps up and makes a grab for Mallory and --  -- Aw , say ! One like that must be good for chapped lips . If I 'm ever handed one of them kind I wo n't wash it off for a month . It tickles Dicky most to death . " He-haw ! " says he , so 's the window panes rattle . " She said she 'd do it . And she did , did n't she , eh , Skid ? " Mallory could n't prove an alibi . He was the worst rattled man I ever see , and as for blushin '  - -  he got up a color like the lady heroine in a biff-bang drama . He acted as though he did n't know whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good to be true . Once or twice he tried to unloosen some remarks ; but Sis and Dicky was both talkin ' to once and he never got a show . They was tellin ' him how glad they was to see him again , and what a great man he was , and how Sis was comin ' back to town next month for the rest of the season , and all that -- when right in the middle of it the door opens and in comes Mr. Robert . Say , I felt like a noon extra in a bunch of six o'clock editions . I 'd balled things up lovely , I had ! Why , the only times a general office hand ever gets a chance to stand on the Persian rug in the boss 's office is just before he gets the run or is boosted into a five-figure salary . And here I has a twelve-dollar man usin ' it like a public reception hall ! It was what was goin ' to happen to Mallory that gave me the shivers . " Torchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " S-s-sh ! " says I. " It 's Old Home Day , and the lady is handin ' out choc'late creams . Wait up ; maybe it 'll be your turn next . " " But , see here , I do n't understand , " says he . " Who are these persons , and why --  --  " " Ah , say ! " says I. " Ai n't you got any sportin ' blood ? Besides , I do n't know the answer myself . " I could of kept that up just about one more round before I 'd fell through a crack ; but just as Mr. Robert was framin ' up another conundrum Dicky turns around and spots him . " Why , hello , Bob ! " yells Dicky , as gentle as if he was hailin ' someone across Broadway . " By Jove , though , I forgot all about you being in the Corrugated too ! But of course you are . Sis and I just ran in a minute to look up Skid . Good old Skid ! Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look over by the window at Mallory , who was n't seein ' a thing but Sis and was n't hearin ' anything but what she was sayin '  - -  and she was sayin ' a lot . " Is -- is that Skid ? " says Mr. Robert . " Oh , come along now , Bob , " says Dicky , pokin ' him in the vest playful . " You do n't mean to say you do n't know Skid Mallory , the Great Skid , best quarterback we ever turned out , the one that went through Harvard for forty-five yards , and that with a broken ankle ? Do n't know Skid ? Why , say ! " " I take it all back , " says Mr. Robert . " Of course I know him ; but not so well as you do , Dicky . I was n't one of the coaches , you know , and I have n't kept the run of the team for the last year or two . But I 'm glad to see the Great Skid . How the deuce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He-haw ! " says Dicky . " That 's rich , that is ? Shows how much you know of Corrugated affairs , Bob . Why , man alive , Skid 's one of the chaps that 's runnin ' your old gent 's trust . This is his office you 're in now . " " Really ! " says Mr. Robert . He takes another look at Mallory , who 's deaf and dumb and blind to everything but Sis , and then he turns for a good hard look at me . I grins kind of foolish and nods . Then I jumps behind Dicky and begins to wigwag over his shoulder for Mr. Robert to keep it up . I did n't know whether he would or not . I wa' n't sure but what he 'd think I 'd turned batty , by the motions I was goin ' through ; but he 's a sport , Mr. Robert is . He did n't know what was on the card ; but he takes a chance . So Dicky waltzes him over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallory acquainted , and jollies ' em both , and all three of ' em talk football to Mallory , who blushes worse than ever and do n't know which way to turn . They keep that up until Dicky pulls out his watch , grabs Sis by the arm , and hollers that they 've got to make a break for the Washington Limited . Sis is shakin ' good-by with both of ' em at once , when she thinks of somethin ' funny . " Oh , Mr. Robert ! " says she . " I want to know which of you is who here , do n't you know . Is it you that works for Skid , or Skid that works for you ? " " Chee ! " thinks I. " That upsets the soup kettle . " Mr. Robert looks at Mallory , and Mallory looks at him . There was no breakin ' away ; for she has hold of a hand apiece . Both of ' em makes a start ; but Mr. Robert gets the floor . " Why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Corrugated , only one of us works a little harder than the other . " " Ah ! " says Sis , givin ' Mallory a smile that was worth payin ' money to see . " I thought so . " The next minute they makes a dash for an elevator goin ' down , and that part of it was over . We 'd worked the bluff all the way through , and Sis has lugged off the idea that Mallory was at the top of the bunch . But there was Mr. Robert , waitin ' to talk Dutch to us . Mallory he starts in to say that he 's sorry for seemin ' so cheeky ; but that 's about all he can say . " Ah , cheese it ! " says I , buttin ' in . " What do you know about it ? It was me put up the game , and if Mr. Robert had loafed another half an hour at the club like he usually does , there would n't have been any mix up . Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to leave it like that ; but Mr. Robert was holdin ' the door open for him , so he could n't do anything else . When we had it all to ourselves , the boss ranges me up in front of him for the court of inquiry session . " Well ? " says he , real solemn . I takes all that in and gives him the wink . " Say , " says I , " did n't I have my nerve with me , though ? " He kind of blinks at that ; but it do n't fetch him . " Who 's Dicky , your whisperin ' friend ? " says I. " Nobody much , " says he . " His father 's a Senator . " " Well , say , now , " says I , " you did n't want me to chase a Senator 's son and a real swell girl like Sis off into a place like the general office reception room , did you ! And would n't it have been a nice break if I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a twelve-dollar job ? " " Was that why you had the impudence to appropriate my office ? " says he . " That was part of it , " says I. And that gives me an openin' ' to tell him the whole tale about Mallory , from the hall bedroom act to the way he 'd been postin ' himself . " You think he 's a valuable man , do you ? " says Mr. Robert . " Valuable ! " says I. " Why , he 's all the goods . What if he did learn to talk Greek once ? He 's forgettin ' it , ai n't he ? And look at the way he stands up to trouble ! Do n't that show there 's good stuff in him ? " " Well , " says he , " what would you suggest ? " " Ah , say ! " says I. " Could n't you give a guess ? Why , if I was you I 'd fix it so that when Sis comes back to town she would n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a show to get his name painted on a door somewhere . " " Torchy , " says he , punchin ' the button for his secretary , " I should n't wonder if we did . " CHAPTER IV FROSTING THE PROFESS Chee ! but I 'm gettin ' to be useful ! Course , I do n't figure out no awful slump in Corrugated stocks if I should get pettish some day and tell ' em they 'd got to find a new office boy . That ai n't the kind of shredded thought I 'm feedin ' on . I fit into a lot of places besides the chair behind the brass gate . Why , I have to put on a sub . three or four times a week , while I 'm spreadin ' myself out all over the lot . It all come of their makin ' me special messenger to the boss ; for since old Mr. Ellins has been laid up with toothache in his knee joints they 've been chasin ' me up to the Fift ' - ave. ranch , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such truck . And that 's how I came to get so thick with Marjorie . I was waitin ' in the front hall , pipin ' off the gorgerifousness , when some one pushes in through the draperies L. U. E. and I 'm discovered . And , say , she was a magnum , all right ! You know the sort of pippins they pick out to hang up by a string in the fruit store window ? Well , that was her style . Big ? She 'd fit close in a Morris chair ! And she did n't look more'n eighteen or nineteen , either . For all her width , she was built on good lines , and if she 'd been divided up right there 'd been enough for a pair of as good lookers as you 'd want to see . " O-o-o-o ! " says she as she comes in . " See who 's here ! " I never says a word , but just twists my toes around the chair legs and looks into my hat . Not that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' so much to home there as I do in some places , and I did n't want to make any break . But she would n't let it go at that . " O-o-o-o ! " says she again , and as I squints up at her I sees the reg-lar cut-up looks just bubblin ' out . " G'wan ! " says I. " I ai n't no curiosity . " " Oh , it is Torchy then , is n't it ? " says she . " You do n't think this is a wig I 'm wearin ' , do you ? " says I. That 's what I got to expect with hair like mine . The minute my description 's given out everybody 's on . She giggles and says that Brother Robert 's been telling her about me . " I 'm Marjorie , you know , " says she . " Well , " says I , lookin ' her over careful , " you 'll do . " I meant it . Mr. Robert 's only fair sized ; but old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him when I said that Marjorie was up to specifications . She seems to think I 've handed out a lump of butterscotch , though , and we gets real chatty . I do n't know what kind of fairy yarns Mr. Robert 's been tearin ' off at home about me ; but from the start she treats me like I was one of the fam'ly . And Marjorie was just as nice as she was heavy . She did n't try to carry any dog ; but just blazes ahead and spiels out the talk . I get next to the fact that she 's just home from one of them swell boardin ' schools , where they pump French and music into young lady plutesses at a dollar a minute , and throw in lessons on how to say " Home , Francois ! " to the chaffeur . This was some kind of a vacation Marjorie was havin ' , and she was doin ' her best to make every hour count . Knowin ' all that helped me to keep from bein ' so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days after , on a Wednesday , and we 'd got real well acquainted , when Marjorie spots me as I was headin ' back for the office after leavin ' some things for the boss . " Torchy , " says she , " where 's Robert ? What was he doing when you left ? " " Give it up , " says I. " And , anyway , I ai n't supposed to know . " " I 'll bet you do , though , " says she . " Could n't you guess ? " " If I did , " says I , " I 'd guess that he 'd just made a run of ten or twelve and was pushin ' up the buttons on the string . " " I do n't know what that means , " says she . " Well , " says I , " it means that maybe he 's playin ' billiards at the club . " " Oh , darn ! " says she , real wicked . It turns out that Brother Robert has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the date has got clean by him . She wants to go the worst way , too . Mother was n't handy , Aunty May had the icebag on her head , and there was n't anyone else within reach . Accordin ' to the rules , there 'd got to be some one . " Torchy , " says she , " I do n't see why you could n't take me , as well as anyone else . " " Thanks , " says I , " but I do n't want to earn my release that way . I 've got ' em trained down to the office so they 'll stand for a lot ; but me ringin ' in a matinee durin ' business hours would sure break the spell . " " Oh , pshaw ! " says she . " I can fix that part of it , " and off she goes , up to see puppah . If she 'd come back and said the old man was havin ' a fit on the floor , I would n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pull accordin ' to her weight ; for inside of four minutes she comes skippin ' down the front stairs , makin ' the gas globes rattle and jigglin ' the pictures on the wall . " It 's all right , " says she . " Father says you 're to telephone Mr. Piddie that you wo n't be back , and then you 're to see that I get to the theater and home again without being kidnapped . I 'll be ready in ten minutes . " It was a shame , though , that I missed seein ' Piddie when he got the word . All I could hear was a gasp , like he 'd been butted just above the belt , and then he hung up the receiver . I expect I 'll send him to the nerve repair shop some day . But you should have seen me and Marjorie sittin ' on the broadcloth cushions and bein ' carted down to the theater . I swelled up all I could ; but at that I wa' n't much more'n a dot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chesty and can hear my feet make a noise when I walk ; but this wa' n't one of ' em . And when it came to paradin ' down the middle row after the usher , with Marjorie puffin ' behind , I felt like one of them dinky little river tugs towin ' a floatin ' grain elevator . I was lookin ' for the house to let loose a " Ha-ha ! " It did n't , though . They expect most anything to drift into them afternoon shows . " Say , Miss Ellins , " says I , after she 'd squeezed herself into her place , pinned her feather lid up in front of her , and opened the choc'late creams , " I 've been in such a dream I did n't look at the outside boards or get a programme . What 's doin '  - -  variety or a tumpy-tump show ? " " Why , " says she , " this is Shakespeare 's ' Romeo and Juliet . ' " " Z-z-z-zing ! " says I. " Stung again ! Who unloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ? She 'd picked this show out all by herself , put up real money for it -- and that with two Injun drammers runnin ' right on Broadway ! Said she 'd seen the same thing half a dozen times before , too . Aw , say ! I could n't get next to any such batty move as that . And when I thought how this was my first plunge into a two-dollar chair , it made me sore . " Wake me up when it 's all over , " says I , and settles back for a real rest . There 's where I hung out the wrong number . That wa' n't any dope drammer at all . Course , Shakespeare do n't know how to ring in burnin ' flat houses , or mill explosions , or any real thrillers like that ; but there 's somethin ' doin ' in his pieces . There was in this one , anyway . It was quite some time before I got any glimmer of what it was all about ; but before the first act was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think of her ? " says Marjorie . " The one with the Maxine Elliott eyes and the gushy voice ? " says I. " Oh , I do n't call her such a much ; but if Romeo wants her as bad as he says he does , I hope it wo n't be a case of ' My pa wo n't let me . ' But , say , what for did they kill off the only real live one they had , that Mr. Cuteo ? Say , he was all to the good , and it was a shame to have him punctured so quick ! " The parts I liked , though , wa' n't the ones that Marjorie got herself worked up over . It was the balcony scene she 'd come for . When they got to that she grips the seat in front and glues her eyes on them two that was swappin ' the long , lingerin ' breakaway tackles , and every once in awhile she heaves up a sigh like cuttin ' out an airbrake . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swallowed knockout drops , Marjorie gives me a sidelight on what 's been runnin ' through her head . " I could do that , " says she . " I just know I could ! " " Do what ? " says I. " Why , Juliet 's part . I 've been studying it for months , ever since our class gave it at school . They would n't give me a part then ; but just you wait ! I 'll show them ! " " You 're joshin ' , " says I. Honest , I did n't think she meant it . She did n't say any more about it , and all the way home she was as quiet as a bale of hay . That was the last I see of Marjorie for near a week . Then , one afternoon as I was goin ' through Tinpan Alley on an errand , I sees the Ellins carriage pull up , and out she comes . Now , say , I knew in a minute that wa' n't any place for Marjorie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old five-story brownstones , where they sell wigs in the basement , costumes on the first floor , have a theatrical agency on the second , and give voice culture and such stuff above . Among the other signs was one that read , " School of Dramatic Art , Room 9 , Fifth Floor . " " Chee ! " says I. " You do n't suppose Marjorie 's got it that bad , do you ? " First off I thinks I 'll chase along and forget I 'd seen anything at all . Then I thinks of what Mr. Robert would say if he knew , and I stops . Sure , I had n't been called to play any Buttinsky part ; but somehow I did n't feel right about stayin ' out , so the first thing I knows I 'm trailin ' up the stairs . There wa' n't any need to do the sleuth act after Marjorie got started . Anyone on the floor could have heard it ; for she was spoutin ' the Juliet lines like a carriage caller , and whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaked . It was enough to drag a laugh out of a hearse driver . And guess what the guy was tellin ' her ! " Great ! " says he . " You 're almost as good as Mary Anderson was at her best , and as for Marlowe , she ca n't touch you . Excellent , that last speech ! What fire , what expression , what talent ! Why , young woman , all you need is a Broadway production to sweep ' em off their feet ! I 'll arrange it for you . It means money , of course ; but after the first cost -- fame , nothing but fame ! " Now , how was that for a hot-air blast ? Would n't that make a short ice crop if you let it loose up the Hudson ? But it wa' n't what he said , so much as how he was sayin ' it , that got me int'rested . There 's some voices you do n't have to hear but once to remember a lifetime , an this was one of that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what does the coonsongs for the punky records they put into the music boxes at the penny arcades . That was as near as I could map it for a minute or so while I was tryin ' to throw up the picture of the man behind the voice . And , then it hits me -- Professor Booth McCallum ! Oh , skincho , what a front ! Why , when I was on the Sunday editor 's door the professor used to show up reg'lar with some new scheme for winnin ' space . Talk about your self-acting press agents ! He had the bunch shoved to the curb . All he had to bank on was a ten-minute turn at a 14th-st. continuous house , fillin ' in between the trained pig and the strong lady ; but he wanted as much type set about himself as if he 'd been Dave Warfield . When he could n't get next to anybody else , he used to give me the earache tellin ' of the times when he played stock in one of Daly 's road comp'nies , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then he 'd leave his stuff with me and I 'd promise to sneak it into the dramatic notes the first time I found the forms unlocked . And to think of a hamfatter like McCallum , who 's come back from Buffalo on a brake beam so often that he always sleeps with one arm crooked around the bedpost , havin ' the nerve to call himself a school of dramatic art ! Course , I did n't think Marjorie was so easy as to fall for a fake like that . She must be stringin ' him . But the minute I see her come out I knew she 'd swallowed the hook . I 'd dropped back into the far end of the hall , where it was dark ; but as she walks under the skylight I sees the pleased look on her face , like she was havin ' a view of her lithographs on all the gold frames in the subway . I waits until McCallum shuts himself in to throw bouquets at his picture in the glass , and then I slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbin ' into the carriage . " Is this the lady that 's entered for the heavyweight Juliet championship ? " says I , tryin ' to break the news to her gentle . It shook her up a good deal , just the same . Her face gets the color of an auction flag , and she jounces down on the seat in a way that makes the springs flat out like bed slats . " Why , Torchy ! " says she . " Where did you come from , and what do you mean ? " " Oh , I 've taken out a butt-in license , " says I. " I 'm on , Miss Ellins . I wa' n't invited to the rehearsal ; but I was there . " " Listening outside ? " says she . " Uh-huh , " says I. " Oh , Torchy ! " says she . " Did you hear how lovely the professor talked of the way I did it ? " " About your havin ' Julia Marlowe sewed in a sack ? Sure thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says she . " I would n't want the job , " says I. " I can draw a diagram of the riot there 'll be when mommer and popper get the bulletin . " " I do n't care , " says Marjorie . " They never want me to do anything . It 's always , ' Oh , Marjorie , you 're too big . ' In summer I ca n't go bathing because they say I 'm a sight in a bathing suit , and in winter they wo n't let me skate because they 're afraid I 'll break through . The boys wo n't dance with me , and the girls shut me out of basketball . But Professor McCallum has been perfectly dear . He said right away that I was n't a bit too stout to be an actress . I 'm not , either ! Why , I weigh less than two hundred , with my jacket off ; honest , I do ! He liked my voice , too . And this was only my third lesson . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to do it ! " Well , say , that was a proposition to give you a headache . I could n't go runnin ' to Mr. Robert or the boss with any tales about Miss Marjorie . That ai n't what I 'm on the payroll for . But I could n't let McCallum play a friend of mine for a good thing ; so I just opens up on him . " Why , " says I , " he 's a never was . Maybe he used to carry a spear , or play double-up parts on the haymow circuit ; but that 's about all . He 's a common , everyday , free lunch frisker , Mac is . I used to know all about him when I was in the newspaper business ; so this is a straight steer . He 's just tollin ' you along because he 's had a dream that if he gets you real stuck on yourself you 'll come across with two or three thousand for expenses and will be too tender-hearted to squeal afterwards . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to queer it is to send him ten and say the folks object . " That 's about the way I put it , drawin ' it as strong as I knew how . Does Marjorie see the point and heave up any thanks about my bein ' her true friend ? Not her ! She calls me impid'nt and says she 's got a good mind to box my ears right there . So it was up to me to calm her down . " All right , Miss Marjorie , " says I. " If I 've said anything I ca n't prove , I 'll take it back ; but if you 'll follow me upstairs again for a minute , and wait outside in the hall , I 'll have a little talk with the professor that 'll settle it one way or the other . " No , she would n't do it , and she did n't want me ever to speak to her again . I was too fresh , I was ! " Then I guess I 'll have to send Mr. Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I , makin ' a play to move off . It was a bluff ; but it fetched her . She was willin ' to do ' most anything if I would n't tell Brother Robert ; so back we goes up to the acting school on the top floor . I left her leanin ' up against the wall , right near the open transom , and makes a break for McCallum . He was right there , too . He 's one of these short-legged , ham-faced gents that 's almost as tall when he 's sittin ' down as when he 's standin ' up . A neck that takes a No. 18 turn-down collar goes with that . He has his hands in his pockets , an Egyptian joss-stick in his mouth , and he 's straddlin ' up and down , as satisfied with himself as if he 'd just cashed a ticket on the right horse . " Hello , profess ! " says I. " I spots your name on the sign ; so I takes the foot elevator up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite right , son , " says he , " quite right . " He did n't need any whizz plane then to beat the Curtiss record . He was soarin ' , soarin , ' and too busy with it to take much notice of me . " You ai n't been round to the office lately , " says I , lettin ' on I was still with the paper . " No , son , " says he ; " but you can inform your dramatic man down there that if he wants an important piece of news he 'd better come and see me , " and with that he taps his chest like he was stunnin ' the gallery . " Thought you looked like happy days , professor , " says I. " What 's it like ? You ai n't been takin ' on any swell pupils , have you ? " " Have n't I , though ? " says he , stickin ' his thumbs in his vest pockets and comin ' up on his toes as if he was goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , Mac , " says I confidential , " that was n't her I saw drivin ' off in the private buggy as I come in , was it -- the wide one ? " " That was her , " says he , " the new Juliet . " " Juliet ! " says I. " Aw , you 're kiddin ' ! Honest , professor , do Juliets come as heavy as that ? " Then he winks . I could see he was just bustin ' to let it out to some one , and here was his chance . " Son , " says he , " when young ladies have the price to pay for such luxuries as the cultivation of a dramatic talent that does n't exist , size does n't count . I 've coached a Hamlet with lop ears and a pug nose , a Lady of Lyons that had a face you could chop wood with , and I guess I 'm not going to draw the line at a Juliet whose father is president of a trust , even if she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall crack at that , and I suspected Marjorie 'd got a shock . " Can she act any ? " says I. " Act ! " says he . " It 's enough to make the angels weep to see her try . Imagine , my boy , a one hundred and thirty-pound Romeo trying to hug his way around a two hundred and fifty-pound Juliet ! Why , we 'd have to prop up the balcony with a structural iron pillar and --  --  " It was too bad to have the flow stopped , for he was enjoyin ' himself ; but just then the door was jerked open and in rushes Marjorie , her eyes blazin ' , her face white , and so mad she could n't speak . As she looms up in the door , lookin ' bigger'n ever , she was diggin ' somethin ' out of her handbag , somethin ' shiny . It wa' n't anything but a silver purse ; but the professor must have thought it was somethin ' else , for he gives only one look . Then he throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't shoot ! " and makes a dive under a desk in the corner . The hole under that desk wa' n't built for divin ' through ; so McCallum wedges himself in there like a cork in a bottle , wavin ' his legs in the air , and callin ' for help . " There ! " says Marjorie , throwin ' some bills on the floor . " That 's for what I owe you , you horrid old fraud ! Baby elephant , am I ? Oh , you wretch ! " With that she goes out and bangs the door behind her . It was all me and the cornet artist next door could do to separate McCallum from the desk , and even when we worked him loose he did n't want to come out . When we 'd got him into a chair , and he 'd felt himself all over careful , he says to me : " Torchy , how -- how many times did she shoot ? " And when I gets back to the office Mr. Robert wants to know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' all the way to Washington after them stamps . " Chee ! " says I , " but you 're gettin ' restless ! Maybe you think I oughter travel by pneumatic tube ? Huh ! " CHAPTER V WHERE MILDRED GOT NEXT There 's nothin ' wins out surer in this town of New York than puttin ' up a good front . If you 've got the fur coat and the goggles on your cap , you can walk or ride on a transfer , and folks 'll take it as a cinch that your bubble 's back in the garage bein ' fitted with a new set of hundred-dollar tires . Why , just the smell of benzine on a suit you 've had out to the cleaners will give ' em the dream , if you throw your chest out right . Look at the way Mildred has us goin ' . Maybe you do n't know about Mildred . Say , I 'll bet if you met up with her on Fift ' - ave. you 'd hold your breath till she got by and wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But she floats into the Corrugated Trust offices more or less reg'lar every day , just the same , and does her little stunt on the typewriter at so much per . Honest , when I sees her sailin ' in mornin 's , with all her swell drygoods on , I 'm just as liable as not to half break my neck openin' ' the door for her . That 's what I did the first time I saw her , when I was new on the gate . " This way , lady , " says I , and when she pikes right by and heads for the cloakroom I almost has a fit . Maybe there 's some hot ones down around Broad-st. that drives to business in cabs and pounds the keys durin ' office hours ; but for a genuine , mercerized near silk we stand ready to back Mildred against the field . She 'd have an expert guessin ' , Mildred would . " Miss Morgan " is the way she figures on the payroll ; but that never sounded rich enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I begun to get a line on Mildred . One day the old man calls me in and hands me a letter that 's been put on his desk for him to sign . He was plum color , Old Hickory was , so mad he could have chewed a file . " Boy , " says he , " take this into the main office , find out who M. M. is , and bring her in here . Anybody that can spell in that fashion I want to take a good look at . " Think of the shock I gets when Piddie tells me them letters stand for Mildred Morgan . " Lady , " says I , " I hates to say it , but the boss is waitin ' to hand out a call-down to you . Do n't you go to gettin ' scared stiff , though ; for the first cussword he lets go of I 'll chuck a chair at him . " The smile I gets for that would have been worth half a dozen jobs . I was lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper lip , like they usually does ; but she ai n't that kind -- not on your nameplate ! She just peels off the sleeve protectors , sets her side combs in firm , gives her face a dab or so with the rabbit 's foot , and starts along after me , with that new antelope walk of hers , as easy and pleased as if she 'd been asked to come to the front and pour tea . And she 's got the costume the part calls for , mind you ! They 're the only clothes of the kind I ever see wore into this buildin ' . I could n't say what they was made of ; but I know they 're the button-up-the-back style , and that they stick to her as if they 'd been put on by a paper-hanger . I guess you 'd call Mildred a 1911 model . Anyway , she seems to bulge in the right places ; though how anyone so long-waisted as that can get themselves into such a rig without callin ' for help is somethin ' I passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , feelin ' as mean as a welsher . The old man has settled back in his chair , a cigar pointin ' out of one corner of his mouth , and a letter in one fist . While I 'm gone he 's run across another , worse than the first , by the marks he 's made on it , and he 's got to the point where a thermometer slipped down the back of his neck would go off like a cap pistol . " See here ! " says he , growlin ' it out grouchy , without lookin ' up . " I 'd like to have you run your eye over that , and then tell me where in thunder you learned to spell such s-u-t-c-h ! " " Why , " says she , " I always spell it that way ; do n't you ? " " Do n't I ! " roars the old man . " Do you take me for a --  --  " Then he looks up . Well , say , you talk about your fadin ' sunsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss lost his crushed raspb'rry face tint and bleached out salmon pink . " Why -- why -- er -- are you sure this is some of your work , young woman ? " " Oh yes , indeed , " says she , kind of gurgly and aristocratic and as sweet as pie , " that 's mine . But you 've made so many horrid marks on it that I shall have to do it all over again . " " Yes , " says he , " I 'm afraid that 's so . But we have a way here , you know , of spelling explicit with a C instead of an S. " " Ruhlly ? " says she . " How odd ! " " It 's one of our fads , too , " goes on the old man , " not to spell Corrugated g-a-i-t-e-d . We 've simplified it by leaving out the I. Of course , we do n't expect you to learn all these things at once ; but pick ' em up as fast as you can . That -- that 's all . Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says she , " Mildred Morgan . " " Ah , " says the boss , " very much obliged , Mil -- er -- Miss Morgan , " and before I could get to the door he has hopped up and opened it for her . Then he turns around and sees me standin ' there grinnin ' . " Torchy , " says he , " are there any more like that around the shop ? " " None that I ever saw , " says I. " Thank Heaven ! " says he . " Send in one of the other kind . " " Want a real ripe one ? " says I. He does . And say , we got plenty of them . I picks out one with washed-out eyes , front teeth that sticks out , and no shape to speak of . She could make the typewriter do a double shuffle , though , and there could n't anybody around the place sling out words faster'n she could take ' em down on her pad , or any she could n't spell right the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go over Mildred 's work with an ink eraser before it comes to him . If Mildred knew about it , she never let on . Nothin ' much bothered her . She 'd come sailin ' in any old time durin ' the forenoon , lookin ' as han'some as a florist 's window and actin ' as if she never heard of such a thing as a time clock . Piddie tackles her only once . " Miss Morgan , " says he , " business begins here at nine o'clock promptly . " " How absurd ! " says Mildred , and Piddie do n't get over the shock for an hour . About the second week all hands took a vote that Mildred wa' n't much of a success as a typewriter artist and that she ought to be fired . The old man put it up to Mr. Robert , and Mr. Robert shoves it back at him . Then they both loaded it onto Piddie and cleared out . When they come back they asks him if he 's done it . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly . " Come to make him own up , he 'd gone at the job so easy and had been so polite about it that Miss Morgan has time to head him off with a strike for more pay , and before he can back out he 's promised to see what can be done . " Could n't you talk to her , Mr. Ellins ? " says he . " Great Scott , no ! " says the boss . " Tell her she 's raised , and let it go at that . " For awhile , though , Mildred cost the firm a lot more money than her salary , if you reckon up as worth anything the time a lot of two-by-four ink-slingers spent makin ' goo-goo eyes at her . It was a losin ' game all around . Mildred did n't seem to be pinin ' for any such honors , and after they got well acquainted with the fact that she would n't stand for lunch invites , or bids to the theater , and did n't want to be walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that foolishness . It leaves ' em dizzy , though . There 's pinheads on our gen'ral office staff who believes they never missed breakin ' a heart before , and they ca n't figure out just what 's the matter with the combination . There was others , too , that could n't place Mildred , until some one hints that maybe she 's a sure enough swell whose folks had gone broke , and that she 's picked out a typewriter job as a sort of trapdoor that would let her down out of sight and keep the meal ticket renewed . After that Mildred is as much of a myst'ry as why folks live in Brooklyn . We was all wise to the main proposition , though , and it was funny to hear ' em all sayin ' that they 'd known it right along . Kind of set us up some , too , havin ' a real ex-ice cutter like her right on the floor with us . All the other key pounders , that had been givin ' her the stary eye at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't anything they would n't do for her , and they takes turns holdin ' her jacket , so 's to get a peek at the trademark on the inside of the collar . But Piddie is the most pleased of any . He thinks he 's right to home among carriage folks , and every time she comes near he bows and scrapes and begins to shoot off the " Aw , I 'm suah 's " and the " Don'tcher know 's , " until you 'd think he was talkin ' through a mouthful of hot breakfast food . " Chee ! " says I to him . " You act like you thought this was a five o'clock tea . " " I trust , " says he , " I know a lady when I see one , and that I know how to treat her too . " " That 's so , " says I. " Too bad you wa' n't on the stage , Piddie , in one of them ' Me lu 'd , the carriage waits ' parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she sends me for supplies I says to him , " Mr. Piddie , " says I , " the Lady Mildred presents her compliments and says she wants a new paste brush . " Gets him wild , that does ; so I sticks to it . The others hears it and picks it up too , and she wa' n't called anything but Lady Mildred from that on . First thing I knew I 'd said it to her face ; but she never so much as looks surprised . You 'd thought she 'd been called Lady Mildred all her life . " Who knows ? " says Piddie . " Perhaps she has . " Honest , we was makin ' up all kinds of pipe dreams about her , and believin ' ' em as we went along . There was no findin ' out from her what was so and what she wa' n't . She never gets real chummy with anyone ; but keeps us jollied along about so much . It was dead easy . All she had to do was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . Was n't anyone around the place needed so much waitin ' on as her ; but no one ever minds . Gen'rally there was two or three on the jump for her , and others willin ' to be . Course , that do n't include Mr. Robert . He seems to think Lady Mildred was some kind of a joke ; but , then , I expect he sees so many stunners like her every night , knockin ' around at dinner parties and such , that he gets tired lookin ' at ' em . I 'd been carryin ' it against him , though , and maybe that 's what put it into my nut to get so gay with Louie . Louie 's the gent in the leather leggin 's and north-pole outfit that comes around after Mr. Robert every night with the machine . Say , it 's a reg'lar rollin ' bay window , that car of Mr. Robert 's ! I would n't mind havin ' one of that kind taggin ' around after me . But if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wears his nose too high in the air and is too friendly with himself to suit me . There 's a lot of them honk-honk boys just like him ; but he 's the only one I ever has a chance to get real confidential with . It 's like this : Mr. Robert says to me , " Torchy , if I 'm not back by five o'clock , you may tell Louie when he comes that he need n't wait . " " Sure thing , " says I. Then , when Mr. Robert do n't show up at closin ' time , I chases down to the curb and sings out , " Hey , Frenchy , you tip huntin ' ex-waiter ! It 's back to the garage for yours ! And say ! After you 've run your old coal cart into the shed you can go let yourself out as a sign for a fur store . Ah , that 's right . Nothin ' doin ' here . Skidoo ! " Always makes me feel better after I 've handed Louie one like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a crowd around . When I has time to chew it over I can think up some beauts . But this night I was goin ' to tell you about I did n't have any warnin ' at all . Mr. Robert was right in the middle of a heart-to-heart talk with a Pittsburg man , when five o'clock comes and the word is sent up that Louie has came . " Tell him to come back in about half an hour , " says Mr. Robert to me . " Repeat at five-thirt ' , " says I , sliding out for the elevator . It was an elegant afternoon ,  - -  for pneumonia ,  - -  slush and rain and ice-box zephyrs gallopin ' up and down the street . Louie did n't look as though he was enjoyin ' it any too much , for all his furs . I was just turnin ' up my collar for a dash across the sidewalk and back , when out comes Lady Mildred in a raincoat that was a dream and carryin ' a silver-handled umbrella such as you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my funny thought . " Carriage for you , miss , " says I , grabbin ' the rain tent and hoistin ' it . " Right this way , miss . " Say , she 's a dead game sport , Mildred is . Never stopped to ask any fool questions ; but prances right out to the car , just as though she 'd expected it to be there . " Take the lady home , and be back after Mr. Robert in half an hour , Louie , " says I , jerkin ' open the door and handin ' her in . It was about then that I almost had heart failure . Stowed away in the further corner , as comf'table as if he was at the club , was Benny . I forget what the rest of his name is ; Mr. Robert never calls him anything but Benny . They 're chums from way back ,  - -  travel in the same push , live on the same block , and has the same ideas about killin ' time . But that 's as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much like Mr. Robert as a cream puff looks like a ham sandwich . All Benny ever does is put on more fat and grow more cushions on the back of his neck . He 's about five foot three , both ways , one of these rolypoly boys , with dimples all over him , pink and white cheeks , and baby-blue eyes . Oh , he 's cute , Benny is ; but the bashfullest forty-four fat that ever carried a cane , a reg'lar Mr. Shy Ann kind of a duck . He has a lisp when he talks too , and that makes him seem cuter'n ever . About twice a week he drifts up to the brass gate and says to me , " Thay , thonny , whereth Bob ? " Makes my mouth pucker up like I 'd been suckin ' a lemon , just to hear him . And if he sees one of the girls lookin ' sideways at him he 'll dodge behind a post . There he was , though , and there was Mildred pilin ' in alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backin ' out , and it was too late for me to hedge ; so I ups and does the honors . " Mr. Benny , " says I , " Miss Morgan . " " Oh , I -- I thay , " splutters Benny , makin ' a move to bolt , " perhapth I 'd better --  --  " " Forget it ! " says I , slammin ' the door . " Ding , ding , Louie ! Get a move on ! If you do n't fetch back here by five-thirt ' you lose your job . See ? " Frenchy did n't need any urgin ' , though , and he has the wheels goin ' round in no time at all . I watched the car for a couple of blocks and did n't see anything of Benny jumpin ' out of the window ; so I reckons that he 's too scared to make the break . I had a picture of him , squeezin ' himself up against the side of the tonneau , lookin ' at his thumbs , and turnin ' all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe it 'll do him good , " thinks I. It was funny while it lasted ; but when I thinks of what Mr. Robert 'll say when the tale is doped out to him . I has a chill . First off I thought I 'd go up and write out my resignation ; but then I remembers how long it is since I 've had the sport of bein ' fired , and I makes up my mind to see the thing through . I was lookin ' to be called up on the carpet first thing next mornin ' , but it do n't come . Mr. Robert never says a word all day long , nor the next , and by that time the thing was gettin ' on my nerves . Then Benny bobs up , as usual . I has my eye peeled from the minute he opens the door . He do n't look warlike or anything ; but you never can tell about these fat men , so when he hits the gate I dodges behind the water cooler . " Wha -- w'ath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G'wan ! " says I. " Ith n't Bob in ? " says he . " Go on in and tell Mr. Robert , if you want to , " says I ; " but do n't look for any openin' ' to sit on me . No pancake act for mine ! " He just grins at that ; but goes on into the office without makin ' a single pass at me . Course , I was sure the riot act was due inside of an hour . But never a word . Nor Mildred do n't have anything to say , either . It was like waitin ' for a blast that do n't go off . Things went on that way for a couple of weeks , and I was forgettin ' about it , when Piddie tells me one mornin ' that Mildred 's up and quit and nobody knows why . About an hour after that Mr. Robert sends for me . " Torchy , " says he , " I 'm tracing out a mystery , and as you seem to know about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to help me out . " " Ah , say , " says I , " w'at 's the use stringin ' out the agony ? Benny 's squealed , ai n't he ? " " No , " says Mr. Robert . " That 's the point . Benny has n't . All I 've been able to get out of him is that a short time ago he met a very charming young woman -- in my car . " " That 's right , " says I. " It was me put her in . " " Ah ! " says Mr. Robert . " Now we 're getting somewhere . " " Oh , you 've hit the trail , " says I. " Well , " says he , " who was she ? " " Why , " says I , " the Lady Mildred . " " Whe-e-e-ew ! " says Mr. Robert , through his front teeth . " Not the one that spells such with a T ? " " Ah , chee ! " says I. " What 's the odds how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell in the back row ? I did n't know your fat friend was in the car , anyway , and I thinks Frenchy might as well be cartin ' her home in the rain as blockin ' traffic on some side street . So I just loads her in and gives Louie the word . She never knew but what you had sense enough to do it yourself . Course , it was a fresh play for me to make ; but I 'll stand for it , and if Benny 's feelin 's was hurt , or yours was , you got an elegant show to take it out on me . Come on ! Get out the can and the string ! " But you ca n't hustle Mr. Robert along that way . When he gets his programme laid out there ai n't any use to try any broad jumps . He wants to know all about Mildred , who she is , where she comes from , and what 's her class . " You can take it from me , " says I , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the top bunch too , I guess ; anyone can see that . But so long as she 's jumped the job , where 's the sense in lookin ' up her pedigree now ? " " Well , " says Mr. Robert , " I am still more or less interested . You see , she and Benny are to be married next month . " " Honest ? " says I. " I have it from Benny himself , " says he . " Did Benny tell you how he worked up the nerve to make such a swift job of it ? " says I. He had n't . Near as I could make out , Benny had n't told much of anything . " Well , " says I , " he 's picked a winner , ai n't he ? " " That , " says Mr. Robert , " is something I mean to find out . " And say , if you ever see that jaw of Mr. Robert 's , you 'll know he did . And she wa' n't an Astor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Morgan , that had come on with her mother from Kansas City , or Omaha , or somewhere out there ; put in six or eight months in a swell dressmaker 's shop ; learned how to make herself the kind of clothes that look like ready money ; shuffled off her corn-belt accent ; and then broke into the typewritin ' game while she waited for somethin ' better to turn up . " And Benny was it , wa' n't he ? " says I to Mr. Robert . " With your help , Torchy , " says he , " it appears that he was . " " Well , " says I , " he needed the push , all right , did n't he ! " Fired ? Me ? Ah , quit your kiddin ' ! Why , they 're tickled to death now , all of ' em . They 're beginnin ' to find out that Mildred 's quite a girl , even if she ai n't got a lot of fat-wad folks back of her . And say , w'atcher think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad grin , lugs me out to his tailor 's to have me taped for a whole outfit of glad rags , and says I 've got to be one of the ushers at the weddin ' . Would n't that sting you ? CHAPTER VI SHUNTING BROTHER BILL Do n't talk to me about weddin 's ! Sure , I 've been mixed up in one . Maybe there was orange blossoms and so on ; but all that 's handed me is a bunch of lemon buds . Not that I 'm carryin ' any grouch . I might have known better'n to butt into any such doin 's . Long as I stick to bein ' head office boy , I knows who 's what , and what 's which , and anyone that thinks they can give me the double cross is welcome to a try ; but when it comes to sittin ' in at a wilt-thou fest I 'm a reg'lar Cousin Zeke from the red-mitten belt . Maybe I would n't have done so bad , though , if it had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bulletin right here , she ai n't my aunt ! She 's Benny 's . I was tellin ' you how I loaded Mildred , our lady typewriter that was , into Mr. Robert 's car alongside of Bashful Benny , and what came of it , wa' n't I ! And how Benny 's so grateful that he says I 've got to be one of the ushers ? Well , it was all goin ' lovely , and the gen'ral office force has chipped in and bought ' em a swell weddin ' present , and Benny 's tailor has built me a pair of striped pants and a John Drew coat , and Mr. Mallory 's been coachin ' me how to act when I chase the folks into their seats , and Piddie 's been loadin ' me up with polite conversation to fire off whenever I gets a show , and everything 's as gay around the shop as though the directors had voted an extra dividend -- when I 'm stacked up against Aunt Laura and it begins to cloud in the west . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after you got to know her you could n't blame him for wantin ' to start in on a new deal . She 's one of them narrow-eyed old girls that can look through a keyhole without turnin ' her head , and can dig up more suspicions in a minute than most folks would in a month . I 'll bet if the angel Gabriel should show up and send in his card she 'd make him prove who he was by playin ' the horn . It was a cinch she did n't mistake me for no angel , when Mr. Robert sends me up there to do an errand for Benny . I wa' n't callin ' for no aunts , anyway , but just leavin ' a note for Wilson -- that 's Benny 's man -- when this sharp-nosed old party comes rubberin ' into the front hall . " Marie , " says she to the girl , " what boy is this ? Where did he come from ? Who does he want to see ? Do n't you dare leave him alone for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs . " Ah , say , " says I , " do I look like a hallrack artist ? " " That 'll do , young man ! " says she . " You may not be as bad as you look ; but I have my doubts . " " Same to you , ma'am , and many of ' em , " says I. " Mercy ! " says she . " What impertinence ! " " Please , ma'am , " says the girl , " Mr. Ellins sent him up , and I --  --  " " Oh ! " says the old one . Then she gives me another look . " Boy , " says she , " what 's your name ! " " Torehy , " says I. " Ai n't it a snug fit ? " " Oh ! " says she again , and with the soft pedal on . " You 're Torchy , are you ? " " There ai n't any gettin ' away from a name like that , " says I. " Why , " says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what a bright young man you are ! " " Specially on top , " says I , throwin ' a wink at Marie . " Ye-es , " says Aunt Laura , " I always did think that copper-red shade of hair was real pretty . Come right in , Torchy , while Marie gets you some cake and a cup of tea . " " I ai n't turnin ' the shoulder to any cake , " says I ; " but you can cut out the tea . " Well , say , inside of three minutes from the start I 'm planted comf'table in one of the libr'y chairs , eatin ' frosted cake with both hands , while Marie 's off hustlin ' up lemonade and fancy crackers . Course , it was somethin ' of a shock , such a quick shift as that . I ai n't got a glimmer as to what Aunt Laura 's end of the game was ; but so long as the home-made pastry holds out I was as good as nailed to the spot . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , almost as much as though she was feedin ' ground glass to her best enemy . You 've seen that kind , that you can stand well enough until they begin to grin at you . Aunt Laura 's bluff at smilin ' was enough to make a cat get its back up , and you could tell she did n't really mean it , as well as if she 'd said , " Now I 'm goin ' to give you an imitation of somebody that 's pleased . " And all the time she was dealin ' out a line of talk that was as smooth as wet asphalt . Most of it was hot air that she said Benny 'd been givin ' to her about me , and how sweet Mildred thought I was . That should have been my cue ; but I was too busy with the cake . " Miss Morgan is such a dear girl , is n't she ? " says Aunt Laura . " Uh-huh , " says I , pokin ' in some frostin ' that had lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , are n't you ? " says she . " Um-m-m-m , " says I. " Let 's see , " goes on Aunt Laura , " what is it she did at the office ! " " Chickety-click , ding-g-g ! " says I , makin ' motions with my fingers . " Oh , typewriting ! " says she . " But I suppose she was very skillful at it ? " " Oh , she was a bird ! " says I. See what was happenin ' ? I was bein ' pumped . It was more'n that too . Everything I knew about Mildred , and a lot I guessed at , was emptied out of me like she was usin ' one of these vacuum cleaners on my head . When I gets to telling about the place out West where Mildred lived before she and her maw hit New York , Aunt Laura jumps up . " Oh , I know some people who lived there once , " says she . " I wonder if any of them knew Miss Morgan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives a call . Did they know any Miss Morgans out there ? Yes , Mildred Morgan . Really ! A brother too ? How interesting ! Who was he , and what was he doing last ? What ! In the State penitentiary ! That was enough for Aunt Laura . She hangs up the receiver and says to me : " Boy , when you get back to the office tell Mr. Robert I want to see him . Come , you 'd better be going now . " It was a case of " Here 's your hat -- what 's your hurry ! " " Say , " says I , " do n't you go to swallowin ' any tale about the Lady Mildred havin ' a brother that 's a crook . There 's lots of Morgans besides her and J. P. " But all Aunt Laura does is hold the door open for me ; so I beats it , feelin ' about as chipper as though I 'd been turnin ' State 's evidence . The more I thinks of it , the cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr. Foxy Cute , and had let an old lemon squeezer like Aunt Laura wring me dry ! Just what she 's got up her sleeve about the penitentiary business , I did n't know ; but I wa' n't long in findin ' out . Next day there was all kinds of a row . Aunt Laura has looked up the invitation list for the weddin ' , and , sure enough , among the also rans was a Mr. William Morgan , with a State penitentiary address . With that , and what she 'd heard over the ' phone , Aunt Laura makes out a strong case . Was she goin ' to stand by and see her only nephew marry into a family of jailbirds ? Not if she could help it ! So she calls in Mr. Robert and puts the layout before him . It looks like a bad mess , with Mildred on the toboggan ; for Mr. Robert has said he 'd see what could be done . He do n't promise anything ; but Benny 's always been such a willin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of wantin ' to get married . He did n't know Benny , though . These short , fat , dimpled boys are just the ones to fool you , and when it came to tellin ' Benny about Brother Bill , that was doin ' time , Benny works his lips at high speed sayin ' that he do n't believe it . " Anyway , " says Benny , " it ith n't Bill I 'm marrying . I do n't give a cuth for him . I 'd juth ath thoon marry Mildred if her whole doothed family wath in jail . " " That settles it , Benny , " says Mr. Robert . " If that 's the way you feel . I 'll stand by you . " Maybe Aunt Laura wa' n't wild , though , when she finds she ca n't block the game . I was handlin ' the office switchboard the afternoon she calls Mr. Robert up to give him the rake-over , and the old girl warms up the wires until she near has the lightnin ' arresters out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore on Benny 's bein ' married because she sees the finish of her steady job as boss of the house on the avenue . She ca n't queer Mr. Robert though . " Benny seems to have a clear idea as to just whom he wants to marry , " says he , " and that 's enough for me . If Miss Morgan has a brother in the penitentiary , and Benny does n't mind , I 'm sure I do n't . I 've known lots of fellows who wished their brothers-in-law were in the same place . Anyway , he 'll not trouble us by showing up at the wedding , even if she did send him an invitation . " That 's the kind of a sport Mr. Robert is . He 's dead game , and when you 've got him for a friend you 'll know who to send for if you should ever get run in . So we goes along gettin ' ready for the weddin ' same 's if nothin 's happened . It 's billed for a church hitch ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they do n't expect any crowd . Look when they has it too -- right at lunch time ! " Chee ! " says I to Mr. Robert , who 's running the thing , " you must be playin ' for a frost . Now if you 'd hire one of them Third-ave. halls and band , you might give ' em somethin ' of a send-off ; but it 'll be hard to tell this racket from one of these noonday prayin ' bees they has down in the wholesale crock'ry district . " Mr. Robert says that Benny bein ' so bashful , and Mildred not knowin ' many folks on East , they wanted to make it as quiet as they could . " It 'll have a pantomime show beat to death on quiet , " says I. " Put me on the door , will you , so 's I can keep awake joshin ' the sidewalk cop ? " Mr. Robert says he thinks that 'll be a good place for me , as they ai n't goin ' to let anyone in without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But say , I 'm so rattled when I get inside of that suit they sent around for me to wear that I do n't know whether I 'm goin ' up or comin ' down . Honest , that coat made me feel like I was wearin ' a dress . I did n't mind the striped pants ,  - -  they was all to the good ,  - -  but them skirts flappin ' around my knees was the limit . Think I had the face to spring that outfit on the folks at the boardin ' house ? Never in a year ! Why , some of them Lizzie girls rangin ' the block would have guyed me out of the borough . I just folds the thing inside out over my arm , like it was some one 's overcoat I was takin ' around to have a button shifted , and when I gets to the church I slides up into the gallery and makes a quick change . Mr. Robert looks me over and says no one would guess it was me . " I 'm hopin ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriages begun comin ' and I gets busy callin ' for the seat checks , I forgets how I looks and stops huntin ' for some place to stow my hands . It was a cinch job . There was only a few lady butt-ins that had strayed over from the shoppin ' district and smelled out a free show . " We 're intimate friends of the bride , " says a pair of ' em ; " but we 've forgotten our tickets . " " That 's good , but musty . Butt out , please , " says I. Chee ! but I ai n't used up so much politeness since I can remember ! It was wearin ' them clothes did it , I guess . Well , I was gettin ' to feel real gay , for most everyone that was due was inside , and I had n't made any breaks to speak of , and it was near time for the Lady Mildred to be floatin ' in , when I pipes off a tall , husky-lookin ' gent , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gawpin ' up at the sign on the church . " Tourist from Punk Hollow lookin ' for the Flatiron Buildin ' , " says I to myself ; but the next minute he comes meanderin ' up the steps , fishin ' a card out of his pocket . You can bet I plants myself in the door and calls for credentials ! But , say , he had the goods . There was the ticket , all right , with the name wrote on it , and it did n't need but one squint at the pasteboard for me to break into a cold sweat . It wa' n't anybody else but Mr. William Morgan ! " Say , " says I , as hoarse as a huckster , " are you Brother Bill ? " " Why , " says he , kind of surprised , but not half so stunned as I thought he 'd be ,  --  " why , I suppose I am . " You would n't have guessed it . Not that he did n't look the brother part ; for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height , and he had snappy black eyes and black hair like hers . The points that goes with a striped suit and the lock step was missin ' , though . But how you goin ' to tell , in these times when our toniest fatwads is sittin ' around the mahogany votin ' to raise the price of chewin ' gum to-day , and gettin ' a free haircut to-morrow ? There wa' n't any time for me to stand there guessin ' whether he 'd been pardoned , or had slid down the rain pipe . Somethin ' had to be done , and done quick . " Dodge in here and wait a minute , " says I. " There 's some word been left for you . " With that I sneaks down the side aisle and into the little cloakroom , where Mr. Robert was keepin ' Benny 's mind off'n what was comin ' to him by makin ' him count the geranium leaves in the carpet . " Mr. Robert , " says I , luggin ' him off to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Bill 's come ! " " What Bill ? " says he . " The one from the rock pile , Brother Bill , " says I. " That 's lovely ! " says he . " It 's all of that , " says I. " I hope he 's not wearing his uniform still , " says Mr. Robert . " Not on the outside , " says I. " He looks like he 'd pinched a minister 's Monday suit somewhere . But it ai n't the way he looks that 's worryin ' me ; it 's what he 's liable to do any minute to put the show on the blink . " " That 's so , Torchy , " says he . " Ca n't we get him out of the way somehow ? " " It 's a tough proposition , " says I ; " but if you 'll put on a sub for me at the door , and give me leave to make any play that I happens to think of , I 'll tackle it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make it worth a hundred to you to keep him away from here until it 's all over . " " I 'm on the job , " says I. As I skips back I grabs my hat out from under a rear seat and makes straight for Brother Bill . " Come on , " says I. " She 's waitin ' for you now . We 've got just half an hour to do it in . " Bill , he looks sort of jarred and reluctant ; but I has him by the arm and is chasin ' him down the steps before he can ask any dippy questions . First off I thought of runnin ' him up the avenue until he 's clean winded ; but I see by the way he strikes out that it would take more lungs than I 've got to do that . There was a lot of weddin ' cabs and such waitin ' round the corner , though ; so I steers him into the first one that has the apron up , jumps in after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings out : " Beat it ! This ai n't any dream carnival you 're hired for ! " " What number ? " says the bone thumper . For about two shakes I was up against it , and then the only place I could think of was Benny 's house ; so I give him that , and off we goes . " But I say , young man , " says Brother Bill , " I came on to go to the wedding . " " Sure , " says I ; " that 'll be all right too . Did n't I tell you there was some word left for you ? " " Yes , " says he , " I believe you did . Also you said something about her waiting --  --  " " Right again , " says I. " She 'll be tickled to death to see you too . " " Yes ; but the wedding ? " says he . " That 'll be there when we get back -- maybe , " says I. " You came on kind of unexpected , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think I could get away at first ; but I managed it . " " How 'd you get out ? " says I. " Was it a clean quit , or a little vacation ? " " Why -- er -- why , " says he ,  --  " yes , it was a -- er -- little vacation , as you say . " " Chee ! " thinks I. " The nerve of him ! Wonder if he sawed the bars , or sneaked out in a packin ' case ? " But , say , I could n't put it to him straight . When I gets these bashful fits on I ai n't any use . " How long you been in ? " says I. " In ? " says he . " Oh , I see ! About five years . " " Honest ? " says I. Then I had another modest spell that wo n't let me ask him whether he 'd been put away for givin ' rebates , or grabbin ' for graft . I knew it must have been somethin ' respectable like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong arms or till friskers . I was just wishin ' I knew how to work the force pump like Aunt Laura , when we pulls up at the horse block , and it was up to me to think of some new move . " She 's here , is she ? " says Mr. William . " You bet ! " says I , wondering who he thought I meant . And then I gets that funny feelin ' I gen'rally has when I takes the high jump . " Come on , " says I. " We 'll give her a surprise . " It wa' n't anything else . I knew she 'd be to home , ' cause I 'd heard she was too grouchy to go to the weddin ' or have anything to do with it ; so when Marie let us in I throws a tall bluff and says for her to tell Aunt Laura I 've brought some one she wants to see very partic'lar . " Why , " says Mr. Morgan , " there 's been some mistake , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should she wish to see me ? " " Sh-h-h-h ! " says I. " Maybe she 'll feed you frosted cake . It 's one of her tricks . " She did n't , though . She looked about as smilin ' as a dill pickle when she showed up , and she opened the ball by askin ' what I meant , bringin ' strangers there . " Well , " says I , " you 've been askin ' a lot about him lately ; so I thought I 'd lug him around . This is Brother Bill . " " What ! " says she , squealin ' it out like I 'd said the house was afire . " Not the brother of that -- that Morgan girl ? " " Ask him , " says I. " You 're a star at that . " Then I takes a peek at Bill . And say , I was almost sorry I 'd done it . For a party that 'd just broke jail , he could stand the least I ever saw . He looks as mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat in the smokin ' car by mistake . I 'd have helped him out then if I could have thought how . It was too late , though , and Aunt Laura was no quitter . " How long is it , " says she , jerkin ' her head back and throwin ' a look out of her narrow eyes that must have gone clear through him , " since you got out of the State penitentiary ? " " Why -- why -- er -- er --  --  " begins Brother Bill . Then he has the biggest stroke of luck that ever came his way ; for Marie pushes in with the silver plate and a card on it . " Thank goodness ! " says Aunt Laura , lookin ' at the card . " The very person I need ! Ask Dr. Wackhorn to step in here . " I thought he must be a germ chaser ; but it was just a minister , a solid , prosperous lookin ' old gent , with white billboards and a meat safe on him like a ten-dollar Teddy bear . He looks at Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear William ! " sings out the Doc , rushin ' over with the glad hand out . In two minutes it 's all over . Dr. Wackhorn has introduced Bill as his ex-assistant , who 's gone West and got himself a job as chaplain in a State prison , and Aunt Laura loses her breath tryin ' to apologize to both of ' em at once . Think of that ! We 'd been playin ' him for all kinds of a crook , and here he was a sure enough minister ! Well , I gets him back to the church just in time for the last curtain , so he can see what a stunner Mildred was in her canopy-top outfit . He 's all right , Brother Bill is . Never gives me any call-down for shuntin ' him off the way I did and makin ' him miss most of the show . As I says to him afterward : " Bill , " says I , " that was one on me . But we did throw the hook into Aunt Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIDDIE Say , I thought I knew Piddie . If anybody 'd asked me to pick a party for the Honest John act from among the crowd we got around the Corrugated Trust here , I 'd made J. Hemmingway Piddie my one best bet . He 's been with the concern ever since Old Hickory Ellins flim-flammed his partners out of their share of the business and took out a New Jersey chartered permit that allowed him to practice grand larceny . If Piddie had n't been a pinhead , he 'd had his name on the board of directors years ago . But there ai n't no use tryin ' to make parlor comp'ny out of kitchen help ; so Piddie 's just trailed along , bein ' as useful as he knew how , and workin ' up from ten a week to one fifty a month , just as satisfied as if he was gettin ' his per cent . of the profits . What he does around the shop would n't turn anyone gray-headed ; but he makes the most of it . He swells up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert would about signin ' a million-dollar contract , and the way he keeps watch of the towels and soap and spring water you 'd think our stock was fallin ' below par , ' stead of payin ' nine per cent , on common . Gen'rally Piddie do n't handle anything but petty cash ; but once in awhile , when no one else is handy , they chuck something big his way , and he never lets up until everyone knows all about it . You can tell how chesty he feels , just by his strut . Well , there 'd been a big rush on , and they was usin ' Piddie more or less frequent , so I was gettin ' used to his makin ' a noise like a balloon , when one mornin ' he come turkeyin ' out to the brass gate and says to me : " Torchy , call up 0079 Broad and get the opening on Blitzen . " " Sure , " says I. " And if it touches seven-eighths do n't you want to unload a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , " says he , puffin ' out his face , " you will get them ! " " Oh , slush ! " says I. " Do n't play so rough , Piddie . " I was onto him , all right . I 've seen these hot-air plungers before . They follow up a stock for weeks , and buy and sell in six figures , and reckon up how they 've hit the market for great chunks -- but it 's all under their lids . You ca n't spend pipe dreams , if you win ; and if you lose , it do n't shrink the size of your really truly roll . It 's almost as satisfyin ' as walkin by the back door of a bakery when you 're hungry . That kind of game is about Piddie 's size , too . All it calls for is plenty of imagination , and he 's got that by the bale . I was kind of glad to see him enjoyin ' himself so innocent , and now and then I 'd help along the excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of Blitzen ? " I 'd say , and Piddie would prick up his ears like a fox-terrier sightin ' a rat . " Who told you ? " Piddie 'd ask . " Why , " I 'd say , " I got it straight from a delicatessen man that lives on the same block with a man that runs a hot dog cart in John-st . Do n't want anything closer'n that , do you ! " Then Piddie 'd look kind of foolish , and go off and call down some one good and hard , just to relieve his feelin 's . First thing I knew , though , Piddie was havin ' star-chamber sessions with a seedy-lookin ' piker that wore an actor 's overcoat and a brunette collar that looked like it had been wished onto his neck about last Thanksgivin ' . They 'd get together in a corner of the reception room and whisper away for half an hour on a stretch . If it had n't been Piddie , I 'd put it down for a hard-luck tale with a swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a second look at Piddie would ever waste their time tryin ' a touch on him . So I guessed the gent was a bucketshop tout who was tryin ' to interest Piddie in some kind of a deal . Still , I could n't get any picture of Piddie takin ' a chance with real money . It wa' n't until I seen him walkin ' around stary-eyed one day , and gettin ' nervous by the minute , that I could believe he 's really been rung in . He was goin ' through all the motions , though , of a man that 's shoved everything , win or lose , on the red , and it was a circus to keep tabs on him . He makes a bluff at bein ' awful busy with the billbook ; but he could n't stay at the desk more'n three minutes at a spell . Inside of an hour I counted four times that he washed his hands and six drinks of water that he had . " You 'll be damp enough to need wringin ' out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep what up ? " says he . Honest , he was so rattled he did n't know whether he was usin ' the roller towel or runnin ' over the ticker tape . Half an hour before lunchtime he skips out and leaves word with me that maybe he 'll be back late . " All right , " says I. " If the boss calls for you I 'll tell him he 'll have to shut down the shop until you blow in again . " Maybe you 've seen symptoms like that in a hired man . It gen'rally means that there 's somethin ' doin ' in ponies or margins , and that next payday is goin ' to seem a long ways off . If I 'd been asked to give a guess , I should have put it as about two hundred bucks that Piddie had thrown into the market . Anyway , it wa' n't enough to knock the props out of call-money quotations ; so I was lettin ' Piddie do all the worryin ' . He did n't show back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . She was a nice little lady , one of the smooth-haired , big-eyed kind , as soft talkin ' and as gentle actin ' as the heroine in " No Weddin ' Cake for Her'n , " just before she gets to the weepy scenes . You could see by the punky mill'nery and the last season 's drygoods that she 'd just drifted in from Mortgagehurst , New Jersey . The little snoozer she has by the hand was a cute one , though . When he gets a glimpse of my sunset top piece he sings out : " O-o-o-o , mama ! Burny , burn ! " " Why , Hemmingway ! " says she . " I am surprised . Naughty , naughty ! " " Do n't worry , lady , " says I. " The kid 's got it dead right -- it 's one of them kind . " Then I wets my finger and shows him how it 'll go " S-z-z ! " when I touch it off . That gets a laugh out of little Hemmingway , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piddie , of course , and she 's a brick . Say , how is it these two-by-fours can pull out such good ones so often ? Why , if she 'd been got up accordin ' to this year 's models , and could have thrown the front she ought to , she 'd have been fit for a first-tier box at the grand op'ra . " Chee ! " thinks I. " Did she pick Piddie in the dark ? " She 'd come in to drag him out shoppin ' and hypnotize him into loosenin ' up . It was a case of gettin ' things for little Hemmingway . " Me , I go have new s'oes , an ' new coat wif pockets too , " says he . Say , they wins me , kids like that do . There 's some I ai n't got any use for , the kind brought up in hotels and boardin ' houses that learn to play to the gallery before they can feed themselves , and others I could name ; but clean , grinnin ' youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're good to have around . And , little Hemmy was a star . I got so int'rested showin ' him things in the office that I clean forgot about Piddie and what he was up to . " He will be back soon , wo n't he ? " says Mrs. Piddie . Now if you give me time I can slick up an answer so it 'll sound like the truth and mean something else ; but as an offhand liar I 'm a frost . Somehow I always has to swaller somethin ' before I can push out a cold dope . Course , I knew he 'd got to be back before long ; but I see right off that this wa' n't any day for a fam'ly reunion . Piddle wa' n't goin ' to be any too sociable by dinner time that night , ' less'n he 'd hit up the bucketshop , which the chances was against . So it was my turn to make a foxy play . " He 's due here before long , that 's a fact , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , there 's a big deal on , and Mr. Piddie 's gone downtown , and --  --  " " Oh ! " says Mrs. Piddle , her eyes shinin ' . " Then he has some important business engagement ? " You could n't help seein ' how she had it framed up ,  - -  the whole Corrugated Trust and half of Wall Street holdin ' its breath while hubby , J. Hemmingway Piddie , Esq. , worked his giant intellect for the good of the country . " That 's it , " says I. " I could n't say pos'tive that he 'd be as late as four o'clock ; but --  --  " " Oh ! then we 'll not wait , " says she , " Come , Hemmingway , we must go home . " " Do n't I det my new s'oes ? " says Hemmy . There was a proposition for you ! The kid was runnin ' true to form and stickin ' to the main line . No side issues for him ! Pop might be a big man , and all that ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new-shoes prospect . Things was beginnin ' to look squally , and Mrs. Piddie 's mouth corners was saggin ' some , when I has a thought . " Hold on , " says I. " Maybe he 's left a note or something for you . " See what it is to have a little wad stowed away in the southwest corner of your jeans ? I slips through into the main office , gets one of the typewriter girls to address an envelope to Mrs. Piddie , jams a sawbuck into it , and comes out smilin ' . " Maybe this 'll do as well as Pop himself , " says I. " Feels like it had long green in it , " and the last I heard of little Hemmy he was tellin ' the elevator man about the " new s'oes " that was comin ' to him . " It 's a fool way to lend out coin , " thinks I ; " but what 's the diff ? That kid 's got his hopes set on bein ' shod to-day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look it , though , when he drifts in about one-thirty . If he 'd had a load on his mind earlier in the day , he 'd got somethin ' more now . Just sittin ' at the desk doin ' nothin made the dew come out on his noble brow like it was the middle of August . He was too much of a wreck to stand any joshin ' ; so I let him alone , not even tellin ' him about the fam'ly visit . The first thing I knows he comes over to me , his jaw set firmer'n I ever see it shut before , and a kind of shifty look in his eyes . He hands me a letter and a package . " Torchy , " says he , " take these down to that address just as soon as you can . You 've got to go quick . Understand ? " " Fourth speed , advanced spark , that 's me ! " says I , grabbin ' my hat and coat . " Free track for the Piddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up against the letterpress as I makes a rush for the door . When I gets into the subway I sizes up the stuff I 'm carryin ' . Well say , it ai n't often I gets real curious ; but this was one of them times . I started in by rollin ' a pencil under the envelope flap while the gum was moist . Not that I 'd made up my mind to rubber ; but just so 's I could if I took the notion . And , sure enough , I got the notion , or it got me . Chee ! I near slid off the rattan seat when I reads that note . Guess I must have sat there , starin ' bug-eyed and lookin ' batty , from 14th to Wall . Do you know what that mush-head of a Piddie was at ? He was givin ' an order to bolster up Blitzen by buyin ' up to a hundred thousand shares , and in the package was a bunch of gilt-edged securities to cover the margins . Now would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piddie , a narrow-gauge , dime-pinchin ' ink-slinger , doin ' the bull act like he was a sooty plute from Pittsburg ! That 's what comes of swallowin ' the get-rich-fast bug . Well , when I gets out at the Street I did n't have any programme planned . First I strolls down to the number on the letter and takes a look at the buildin ' . That was enough . There was some good names on the hall directory ; but most of ' em was little , two-room , fly-by-night firms , with a party ' phone for a private wire and a mail-order list bought off 'm patent medicine concerns . The people Piddie was doin ' business with was that kind . Next I takes a walk around into Broad-st. , where the mounted cops keep the big-wind bunch roped in so 's they ca n't break loose and pinch the doorknobs off the Subtreasury . The ear-muff brigade was lettin ' themselves out in fine style , tradin ' in Ground Hog bonds , Hoboken gas , Moonshine preferred , and a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was under cover and biddin ' on Standard Oil firsts . While I was lookin ' ' em over , wonderin ' what to do next , I spots Abey Winowski on the fringe of the push . And say , it wa' n't so long ago that Abey was wearin ' sky-blue pants and a Postal shield , trottin ' out with messages from District Ten . But here he is , with a checked ulster and a five-dollar hat , writin ' figures on a pad . " Hello , Motzie ! " says I. " How long since they lets the likes of you inside the ropes ? " " Hello , Torchy ! " says he . " Got any orders ? " " I 'm lined with ' em , " says I. " What 's good ? " " Blitzen , " says he . " It 's on the seesaw ; but 'll fetch fifty . " " Ai n't it a wildcat ? " says I. " Just from the menagerie , " says he . " Goin ' to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brokers has to say first , " says I. With that I goes around to a little joint I knows of , where they has a board for unlisted stocks , and I sets back and watches the curves Blitzen was makin ' . First she 'd jump four or five points , and then she 'd settle back heavy . The Curb was playin ' tag with it ; that was all , so far as I could see . Nice lot of Hungry Jakes to feed with int'rest-bearin ' securities ! About fifteen minutes before the market closed I quit and moseyed along uptown , just killin ' time and tryin ' to figure out what ought to be done . Course , I did n't have any idea of playin ' private detective and showin ' Piddie up to Mr. Robert ,  - -  that 's out of my line ,  - -  but I did n't like the scheme of just chuckin ' the bonds back at him and let him get away with any bluff about my interferin ' with something I did n't understand at all . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deal , what was to hinder his tryin ' the same trick again next time he got the chance ? That would n't been a fair shake for the firm . Say , I worked my thinker overtime that trip ; but I could n't dig up a thing that was worth savin ' from the scrap basket , and when I strolled into the office just about closin ' time I wa' n't any nearer to knowin ' what to do than when I started . Most everyone had left when I pushes through the gate and takes a peek into Piddie 's office . He was there . And , say , for a speakin ' likeness of a dropped egg that 's hit the floor instead of the toast , he was it ! He 's slumped all over the desk , with his head in his hands , and his hair all mussed up , and his shoulders lopped . I always suspicioned he was built out with pneumatic pads , and blew himself up in the mornin ' before he buttoned on the four-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess he had a rubber backbone . It was a case of fush with Piddie . He was all in . What I could see of his face had about as much color to it as a sheet of blottin ' paper . Layin ' on the floor was a map of the whole disaster . It was a Wall Street extra , with a scarehead story of how Blitzen had kept ' em guessin ' all day and then , in the last quarter of an hour of tradin ' , had gone bumpin ' the bumps from twenty-eight down to almost nothin ' at all . I did n't stop to read the whole thing ; but I read enough to find out that Blitzen had gone soarin ' on a false alarm , and that when the facts was give out right the balloon had took fire . And there was Piddie , still fallin ' ! " Hello , " says I. " You look like a boned ham that 's in need of the acid bath and sawdust stuffin ' . What 's queered you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together when he first hears me ; but after he finds who it is he goes to pieces again and flops back in the chair groanin ' . " Is it new mown hay of the lungs , or too many griddle cakes on the stomach ? " says I. But he only gasps and groans some more . Maybe I should of felt sorry for him ; but , knowin ' the sort of sprung kneed near crook he was , I did n't . He was scared mostly , and he was doin ' all the sympathizin ' for himself that was needed . All of a sudden he braces up and looks at his watch . " Perhaps you did n't get there in time ? " says he . " With the letter and package ? " says I. " Watcher take me for ? Think I got mucilage on my shoes ? I was there on time , all right . " " Oh , mercy ! " says he . " Torchy , I 'm a ruined man . " " You look it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was much account anyway ; so there 's no great harm done . " Then he begins to blubber , and leak brine , and take on like a woman with a sick headache . " It was n't my fault , " says he . " I was led into it . Torchy , tell them I was led into it ! You 'll believe that , wo n't you ? " " Cert , " says I. " I 'll make affidavit I seen ' em snap the ring in your nose . But what 's it all about ? " " Oh , it 's something awful that 's happened to me , " he wails . " It 's too terrible to talk about . You 'll know to-morrow . I sha' n't be alive then , Torchy . " " Ai n't swallowed a buttonhook , have you ? " says I. Next he begins throwin ' a fit about what 's goin ' to become of the missus and the kid . Say , I 've been in at two or three acts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a stage they play that card , the wife and kid . Your real tough citizen do n't , nor your real gent ,  - -  they shuts their mouths and takes what 's comin ' to ' em ,  - -  but Mr. Weakback has a sudden rush of mem'ry about the folks at home , and squeals like a pup with his tail shut in the door . " Ah , say , " says I , " cut it out ! You ought to move up to Harlem and learn to pound the pipes . You 're a healthy plunger , you are , sneakin ' bonds out of the safe to stack up against a crooked game , and then playin ' the baby act when you lose out ! Come now , ai n't that the awful thing that 's happened to you ? " He could n't have opened up freer if he 'd been put through the third degree . I gets the story of his life then , with a handkerchief accomp'niment ,  - -  all about the house he 's tryin ' to buy through the buildin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splurge on ' cause the neighbors have got ' em , and how he was tipped off to this sure thing in Blitzen by a party that had always been a friend of his but could n't get hold of the stuff to turn the trick himself . He put in all the fine points , even to the way he came to have a chance at the safe . " If I could only put them back ! " says he , sighin ' . " What then ? " says I. " Next time I s'pose you 'd swipe the whole series , would n't you ? " If you could have heard him tell how good he 'd be you 'd think practicin ' a little crooked work now and then was the only sure way to learn how to keep straight . " Piddie , " says I , " I do n't want to hurt your feelin 's , but you act to me like a weak sister . If I was to do what the case calls for , this thing ought to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Please do n't ! " says he , scrabblin ' down on his hands and knees . " Nix on that ! " says I. " This is no carpet-layin ' bee . I 'm no squealer , anyway ; besides , I had a little interview with Mrs. Piddie and the kid this noon , and after seein ' them I ca n't rub it in like you deserve . What I 've seen and heard I 'm goin ' to forget . Now sit up straight while I break the news to you gentle . I went down there to-day , just as you told me . " " Yes , I know , " he groans , squirmin ' . " But I did n't like the looks of the joint ; so I did n't dump the bonds . There they are . Now see they get back where you found ' em ! " Talk about your hallelujah praise meetin 's ! Piddie was havin ' one , all by himself -- when the inside door opens and Mr. Roberts steps out of his office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he . Chee ! what a stunner ! Mr. Robert had been in there all the time , writin ' private letters , and had took in the whole business . Did he give Piddie the fire on the spot ? Nah ! Mr. Robert carries around a frigid portico ; but he 's got a warm spot inside . He says he 's mighty sorry to hear how near Piddie 'd come to goin ' wrong ; but he 's glad it turned out the way it did , and if Piddie 'll say how much they rung him in for on Blitzen he 'll be happy to make good right there . And how much do you guess ? A pair of double X 's ! He 'd worried himself near sick , worked himself up desp'rate , and had finished by doin ' something that stood to get him put away for ten or fifteen years -- all for forty bucks ! " Piddie , " says I , " for a tinhorn , you 're a wonder ! But , say , when you get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them new shoes of his before he gets the toes all stubbed out . " CHAPTER VIII A WHIRL WITH KAZEDKY Chee ! W'atcher think ? I ai n't read an " Old Sleut ' " for more'n a week , and there 's two murder myst'ries runnin ' in the sportin ' extras that I 'm way behind on . You would n't guess it in a month , but I 'm takin ' a fall out of the knowledge game . Mr. Mallory says I 'm part in the sixt ' grade and part in the eight ' . " I believe it , " says I ; " my nut feels that way . " Honest , I 'm stowin ' away so much that I never knew before that I 'm thinkin ' of wearin ' a leather strap around my head , same 's these strong boys wears ' em on their wrists . " Ah ! w'at 's the use ? " says I. " Nobody 's ever goin ' to ask me what 's four per cent of thoity thousand plunks , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for less'n six , anyway . And I do n't see where this De Soto comes in . Sounds like he might have played first base for the Beanies ; but he 's been dead too long for that . What odds does it make if I do n't know the capital of Nevada ? I ai n't lookin ' for no divorce , am I ? " But there 's no shakin ' Mallory off . He 's dug up a lot of kid school books for me , and I got ' em stowed away in the desk here , like this was P. S. 46 , ' stead of the front office of the Corrugated Trust . And when I ai n't takin ' cards into the main squeezes , or answerin ' fool questions over the ' phone , or chasin ' out on errands for Piddie , I 'm swallowin ' chunks of information about the times when G. Wash . was buildin ' forts in Harlem and makin ' good for a continuous in front of the Subtreasury . Course , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week , could I win another head office boy job by spielin ' off a mess of guff about a lot of dead ones ? Nit , never ! But Mallory 's got the bug that it 'll all come in handy to me sometime , and I 'm doin ' it just to keep him satisfied . We get together most every night in his room , and I has to cough up what I 've got next to durin ' the day . And say , when I 've been soldierin ' , and try to run in a stiff bluff instead of the real goods , he looks as disappointed as if I 'd done something real low down . So gen'rally I hits up the books when there 's nothin ' else doin ' . Mr. Robert 's on . He comes in one mornin ' and pipes off the ' rithmetic . " What 's this , Torchy ? " says he . " Studying ? " " Yep , " says I. " When I went through Columbia College there wa' n't anybody there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postprandial whirl at this number dope , and it 's fierce . " " Whose idea ? " says he . " Mr. Mallory 's , " says I. " But I 've laid it out flat to him that I draws the line at Greek . I 'd never want to talk like them 23d-st. flower peddlers , not in a thousand years ! " Did n't tell you , did I , about Mallory 's doin ' the skyrocket act ? After Mr. Robert gets next to the fact that Mallory 's a two seasons ' old football hero from his old college he yanks him out of that twelve-dollar-a-week filin ' job and makes him a salaried gent , inside of two days . " Which is something I owe chiefly to you , Torchy , " says Mallory . " Honk , honk ! " says I. " Them 's the kind of ideas that will get you run in for reckless thinkin ' . You was winnin ' all that when you did that sprint for goal your friend Dicky was tellin ' about the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on your toes and make one or two touchdowns for old Corrugated . " " I know , " says he ; " but I 'm afraid that in this game I 'm outclassed . " Honest , he was scared stiff ; but he did n't let anyone but me see it . Even a little thing like goin ' down to Wall Street and lookin ' up some securities gets him rattled . He had n't been gone more'n an ' hour ' fore he calls me up on the ' phone and says some broker 's clerk has asked him if our concern do n't want to bid on P. O. privileges at seven-eighths . " What are P. O. privileges ? " says Mallory . " Oh , tush ! " says I. " And you let ' em hand you such a burry one ? P. O. privileges is the right to lick stamps at the gen'ral post-office , and it 's a gag them curb shysters has wore to a frazzle . You go back and tell that fresh paper-chewer we 're only buyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what comes of foolin ' around at college . Mallory comes back lookin ' like some one had sold him a billboard seat to a free window show . But that was nothin ' to the down-and-out slump I found him in next night , when I goes around for my writin ' lesson and so on . " Is it the spino comeandgetus , " says I , " or has Miss Tuttifrutti sent back your Christmas card ? " " It 's worse than either , " says he , with his chin on the top button of his vest . " I guess I 'm what you would call a false alarm , Torchy . I 've been tried out and have n't made good . " " G'wan ! " says I. " Everyone gets a lemon now and then . Some tries to swaller it whole , and chokes to death ; others mixes ' em up with eggs and things , and knocks out a pie , with meringue on top . Draw us a map of how you fell off the scaffold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . It was a case of sendin ' a boy with a pushcart to bring home a grand piano . The Old Man had done it . He 's kind of sore on the way Mr. Robert lugged Mallory in by the hair , ' cause I heard him growlin ' somethin ' about makin ' a kindergarten out of the Corrugated ; so he springs this on him . He calls for Mallory and tells him there 's a Russian gent down to the Waldorf that 's come over to place a big Gover'ment contract . " We 've got to have a slice of that , " says he . " Just you run down and get it for us . " Like that , offhand , as if it was somethin ' you could do anytime between lunch and one-thirty . Near as I could make out , Mallory goes for it in his polite , standoff , after-you way , and the closest he gets to Russky is a minute with a cocky secretary that says his Excellency is very sorry , but he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 1912 , he 'll have an hour off . " And then you backs up the alley ? " says I. " There was nothing else for me to do , " says Mallory . " He went off without giving me another chance . " " Say , " says I , " if I had all your parlor manners , I 'd organize an English holdin ' comp'ny for ' em , so 's not to be jacked up for bein ' a monopoly . Why did n't you give him the low tackle and sit on his head until he promised to behave ? Was that the only try you made ? " " No , I sent up my card twice after that , " says he , " and it came back . So I 've flunked . I think I 'd better go down in the morning and resign . " Now would n't that rust you ? " Then here goes the books , " says I , chuckin ' ' em into the corner . " If doin ' the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled spaghetti , I 'm through . " That makes Mallory sit up as if I 'd jabbed him with a pin . " Do I seem that way to you ? " says he . " You do n't think you 're givin ' any weight-liftin ' exhibition , do you ? " says I. He lets that trickle through for a minute or so , and then he comes back to life . " Torchy , " says he , " you 're right . I 'm acting like a quitter . But I do n't mean to let go just yet . Hanged if I do n't try to see that man to-night , now , as quick as I can get down there ! He 's got to see me , by Jove ! " " There 's more sense to that than anything else you 've said in a week , " says I. " Wish I could be there to hold your hat . " " Why not ? " says he . " Come on . I may need fresh inspiration . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I ; " but if I was you , and was goin ' to butt into any Fifth-ave. hotel along about dinner-time , I 'd wear the regalia . Yours ai n't in on a ticket , is it ? " It wa' n't . Mallory had to go clear to the bottom of the trunk after it ; but when he 'd shook out the wrinkles and got himself inside the view was worth while . After he 's blown up his op'ra hat and got out his stick you could n't tell him from a three times winner . " Chee ! " says I. " You 've got Silent Smith tied to a post . If you acts like you look , you do n't need me . " He would n't have it that way , though . I 'd got to go along and be ready to give him any points I thought of . We goes in a cab , too , in over the rubber mats to the carriage door , just like we 'd come to hire the royal suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovin ' his card across at the near plute behind the desk . Then the cold wave begun comin ' our way . Mister Baron was out . Nobody knew where he 'd gone . He had n't left any word . And he did n't receive callers after four P.M. , anyway . Mallory was gettin ' his breath after stoppin ' them body blows , when I pushes in . " Say , Sir Wally , " says I , leanin ' over towards the clerk and speakin ' confidential , " lemme give you somethin ' from the inside . If Kazedky misses seein ' Mr. Mallory to-night , you 'll be called up to-morrow to hear some Russian language that 'll take all the crimp out of that Robert Mantell bang of yours . Now ring up one of them bench-warmers and show us the Baron ! " But , say , you might 's well try bluffin ' your way through the fire lines on a brass trunk check , " You 'll find the manager 's office two doors to the left , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I. Course , there wa' n't any use registerin ' a kick . Orders is orders , and we was on the wrong side of the fence . Mallory and I takes a turn through the corridors and past the main dinin ' - room , where they keeps an orchestra playin ' so 's the got-rich-quick folks wo n't hear each other eat their soup . We was tryin ' to think up a new move . I was for goin ' out somewhere and callin ' for the Baron over the ' phone ; but Mallory 's got his jaw set now and says he do n't mean to leave until he has some kind of satisfaction . He 's kind of slow takin ' hold ; but when he gets his teeth in he 's a stayer . We knocks around half an hour , and nothin ' happens . Then , just as we was pushin ' through the mob into the Palm Room I runs into Whitey Buck . You know about Whitey , do n't you ? Well , you 've seen his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he runs . And say , Whitey 's the smooth boy , all right ! Him and me used to do some great old joshin ' when I was on the Sunday editor 's door . " Hello , Whitey ! " says I. " Who you been workin ' for a swell feed now ? " " That you , Torchy ? " says he . " Why , I took your head for an exit light . How 's tricks ? " " On the blink , " says I. " We 're up against a freeze out , Mr. Mallory and me . You know Mallory , do n't you ? " " What , Skid Mallory ? " says he , takin ' another look . " What a pipe ! Why , say , old man , I want you the worst way . Got to hash up a full-page sympose knockin ' reformed football , and if you 'll take off a thousand-word opinion I 'll blow you to anything on the bill of fare . Come on in here to a table while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sizzlin ' sisters ! but I 'm glad to root you out , Skid ! " He was all of that ; but it did n't mean anything more'n that Whitey sees an easy column comin ' his way . Mr. Mallory wa' n't so glad . " Sorry , " says he , " but whatever football reputation I ever had I 'm trying to live down . " " What ! " says Whitey . " Trying to make folks forget the nerviest quarterback that ever pranced down the turf with eleven men after him ? Do n't you do it . Besides , you ca n't . Why , that run of yours through the Reds has been immortalized in a whole library of kid story books , and they 're still grinding ' em out ! " Mallory turns the color of the candleshades and shakes his head . " You print any such rot as that about me , " says he , " and I 'll come down and wreck the office . I 'm out of all that now , and into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual I am . Behold , Whitey , one of the unfit ! " Then Whitey wants to know all about it . " It 's nothing much , " says Mallory , " only I 've been sent out to do business with a Russian Baron , and I 'm such a chump I ca n't even get within speaking distance of him . " " What Baron ? " says Whitey . " Not Kazedky ? " " That 's the identical one , " says Mallory . " Do n't happen to know him , do you ? " " I sure do , " says Whitey . " Did n't he and I have a heart to heart session when that sporty Russian Prince was over here and got himself pinched at a prizefight ? Kazedky was secretary of the legation then , and it was through me he got the story muffled . " " Wish you could find out where he is now , " says Mallory . " Do n't have to , " says Whitey ; " I know . He 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang of Chamber of Commerce men , who are feeding him ruddy duck and terrapin and ten-dollar champagne . He 's got a lot of steel contracts up his sleeve , you know , and --  --  " " Yes , I know , " says Mallory ; " but how can I get to see him ? " " Who are you with ? " says Whitey . " Corrugated Trust , " says Mallory . " Wow ! " says Whitey , them skim-milk eyes of his gettin ' big . " They would n't let you within a mile of him if they knew . But say , suppose I could lug him outside , would I get that football story ? " " You would , " says Mallory . " By to-morrow noon ? " says he . " Before morning , if you 'll stay at the office until I get through here , " says Mallory . " Good ! " says Whitey . " Come on ! I 'll snake him out of there if I have to drag him by the collar . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't guarantee he 'll stay more than a minute . " " That 's enough , " says Mallory . " He can talk French , I suppose ? " " What 's the matter with English ? " says Whitey . " Now let 's see what kind of hot air I 'll give him . " Whitey did n't say what it was he thinks up ; but he was grinnin ' all over his face when he leaves us outside of No. 9 and goes in where the corks was poppin ' . It must have been a happy thought , though ; for it wa' n't long before he comes out , towin ' a dried-up little old runt with a full set of face lambrequins and a gold dog license hung round his neck from a red ribbon . He had his napkin in one hand and half a dinner roll in the other ; so it did n't look like he meant to make any long stop . He was actin ' kind of dazed , too , like he had n't got somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was expectin ' some one to hand out a bomb . But Whitey rushes him right up to Mallory . " Here 's the chap , Baron ! " says he . " I could n't let you go back to Russia without shaking hands with the greatest quarterback America ever produced . Mr. Mallory , Baron Kazedky , " and then he winks at Mallory , much as to say , " Now jump in ! " And say , Mallory was Johnny on the spot . He grabs Kazedky 's flipper like it was a life preserver . " I -- I -- really , gentlemen , there 's some mistake , " says the Baron . " A quarter what , did you say ? " " Oh , " says Mallory , " that 's some of Mr. Buck 's tomfoolery -- football term , you know . " " But I am not interested in football , " says the Baron , tryin ' to back towards the door , " not in the least . " " Me either , " says Mallory , gettin ' a new grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about is steel . Now , I represent the Corrugated Trust , and we --  --  " Well say , the old man himself could n't have reeled it off better'n Mallory . Why , he had it as letter perfect as a panhandler does his tale about bein ' in the hospital six weeks and havin ' four hungry kids at home . I only hears the start of it ; for as soon as he got well under way Mallory starts for the other end of the corridor , skatin ' the little old Baron along with him like he was a Third-ave. clothing store dummy that was bein ' hauled in at closin ' - up time . Whitey did n't even wait for the overture . The minute he hands Kazedky over he fades towards the elevator . There 's nothin ' for me to do but wait ; so I picks out a red velvet chair and camps down on it to watch the promenade . That 's what it was , too ; for Mallory acts like he 'd forgot everything he ever knew except that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it was steel he was talkin ' ! Every time he passes me I hear him ringin ' in Corrugated , and drop forged , and a lot of things like that . Mallory has a right-arm hook on Kazedky and is makin ' motions with his left hand . Bein ' so tall , he has to lean over to pump his speech into the old fellow 's ear ; but every now and then he gets excited and , ' stead of bendin ' himself , he lifts the Baron clear off his feet . About the third lap some of the gents from the private dinin ' - room pokes their heads out to see what 's happened to the guest of the evenin ' . They saw , all right ! They must have been suspicious , too ; for they were lookin ' anxious , and begun signaling him to break away . The Baron did n't have no time for watchin ' signals just then . He was busy tryin ' to keep his feet on the floor . First I knew there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they was talkin ' over makin ' a rush for the Baron and rescuin ' him , I guess , when Mallory leans him up against the wall , hauls out a pad and a fountain pen , and hands the things to Kazedky . The Baron drapes bis napkin over one arm , stuffs the piece of roll into his mouth , and scribbles off somethin ' . When he 's done that Mallory pockets the pad , leads the Baron back to his friends , shakes hands with him , motions to me , and pikes for the elevator . The last glimpse I has of Kazedky , he 's bein ' pulled into the private dinin ' - room , with that half a roll stickin ' out of his face like a bung in a beer keg . " Well , Torchy , " says Mallory to me , as the car starts down , " I got it ! " " Got what ! " says I. " Why , the contract , " says he . " Chee ! " says I. " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back teeth . " CHAPTER IX DOWN THE BUMPS WITH CLIFFY Say , if you read in the papers to-morrow about how the Chicago Limited was run on a siding and a riot call wired back to the nearest Chief of Police , you need n't do any guessin ' as to what 's happened . It 'll be a cinch that Clifford 's gettin ' in his fine work ; for the last I saw of him he was headed West , and where he is there 's trouble . But you must n't tear off the notion that Clifford 's a Mr. Lush , that goes and gets himself all lit up like a birthday cake and then begins to mix it . That ai n't his line . He 's one of the camel brand . The nearest he ever gets to red liquor is when he takes bottled grape juice for a spring tonic ; but for all that he can keep the cops busier'n any thirsty man I ever saw . First glimpse I gets of him was when I looks up from the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brass rail . And say , there wa' n't any doubt about his havin ' come in from beyond where they make up the milk trains . Not that he wears any R. Glue costume . From the nose pinchers , white tie , and black cutaway I might have sized him up as a cross between a travelin ' corn doctor and a returned missionary ; but the ear muffs and the umbrella and the black felt lid with the four-inch brim put him in the tourist class . He was one of your skimpy , loose-jointed parties , with a turkey neck that had a lump in front and wa' n't on good terms with the back of his coat collar . Two of his front teeth was set on a bias , givin ' him one of these squirrel mouths that keeps you thinkin ' he 's just goin ' to bite into an apple . I watched him a minute or so without sayin ' anything , while he was pawin ' around for the gate sort of absent minded , and when I thinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Say , Profess , you 're on the right side of the fence now ; let it go at that . " " Ah -- er -- I beg pardon , " says he . " Well , " says I , " that 's a good start . " " I -- er -- I beg --  --  " says he . " You 've covered that ground , " says I. " Take a new lead . " That seems to rattle him more'n ever . He hangs his umbrella over one arm , peels off a brown woolen mitt , and fishes a card out of his inside pocket . " This is the -- ah -- Corrugated Trust Building , is it not ? " says he . " It is , yes , " says I ; " but the place where you cash in your scalper 's book ticket is down on the third floor . " " Oh ! " says he . " Thank you very much , " and he starts to trot out . He has his hand on the knob , when a new thought comes to him . He tiptoes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffs , and leans over real confidential . " I did n't quite understand , " says he . " Did you say Cousin Robert 's was the third door ? " " Chee ! " says I. " Willie , take off the other one , so you can get a good healthy circulation through the belfry . " The words seemed to daze him some ; but he tumbled to my motions and unstoppered his south ear . " Now , " says I , " what 's this about your Cousin Bob ? Where 'd you lose him ? " Watcher think , though ? I gets it out of him that he 's come all the way from Bubble Creek , Michigan , and is lookin ' for Mr. Robert Ellins . With that I lets him through , plants him in a chair , and goes in to the boss . " Say , " says I to Mr. Robert , " there 's a guy , outside that 's just floated in from the breakfast food belt and is callin ' for Cousin Robert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be Clifford ! " says he . " Then it 's true , is it , the cousin business ? " says I. " Certainly it is , Torchy , " says he . " Why not ? " " Oh , nothin ' , " says I. " I would n't have thought it , though . " " It is n't at all necessary , " says Mr. Robert . " Bring him in at once . " " I guess I can spare him , " says I. Then I goes back and taps Cousin Clifford on the shoulder . " Cliffy , " says I , " you 're subpoened . Push through two doors and then make yourself right to home . " Course anyone 's liable to have a freak cousin or so knockin ' round in the background , and I s'pose it was a star play of Mr. Robert 's , givin ' the glad hand to this one ; but if I 'd found Clifford hangin ' on my fam'ly tree I 'd have felt like gettin ' out the prunin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I had n't been a mind reader and played Clifford for a favorite from the start . Anyway , he jumps right in to feature him , lugs him off to the club for lunch , and does the honors joyous , just as though this was something he 'd been lookin ' forward to for months . I was beginnin ' to think I 'd made a wrong guess on Clifford , and the awful thought that maybe for once I 'd talked too gay was just tricklin ' through my thatch , when we gets our first bulletin . Cliffy was due back to the office about four-thirty , havin ' gone off by his lonesome after lunch ; but at a quarter of five he do n't show up . It was near closin ' time when Mr. Robert gets a ' phone call , and by the worried look I knew something was up . " Yes , " says he , " this is Robert Ellins . Yes , I know such a person . That 's right -- Clifford . He 's my cousin . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mistake . Oh , there must be ! I 'll come up and explain . Yes , I 'll sign the bail bond . " He did n't have a word to say when he turns around and catches me grinnin ' ; but grabs his hat and coat and pikes for the green lights . There wa' n't any call for me to do any rubberin ' next day , or ask any questions . It was all in the mornin ' papers : how a batty gent who looked like a disguised second story worker had collected a crowd and blocked traffic on Fifth Avenue by standin ' on the curb in front of one of the Vanderbilt houses and drawin ' plans of it on a pad . Course , he got run in as a suspect , and I guess Mr. Robert had his troubles showin ' the desk sergeant that Clifford wa' n't a Western crook who was layin ' pipes for a little jimmy work . Cliffy 's architect tale would n't have got him off in a month , and if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head they 'd had Clifford down to Mulberry-st. and put his thumb print in the collection . He was givin ' it to ' em straight , though . Architectin ' was what Cliffy was aimin ' at . He 'd been studying that sort of thing out in Michigan , and now he was makin ' a tour to see how it was done in other places , meanin ' to polish off with a few months abroad . Then , after he 'd got himself well soaked in ideas , maybe he 'd go back to Bubble Creek , rent an office over the bank , and begin drawin ' front elevations of iron foundries and double tenements . That 's what comes of havin ' rich aunts and uncles in the fam'ly , and duckin ' real work while you wait for notice from the Surrogate to come on and take your share . It wa' n't a case of hustle with Clifford . I suspicioned that his bein ' an architect was more or less of a fad ; but he was makin ' the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd laid out a week to put in seein ' how New York was built , high spots and low , and he went at it like he was workin ' by the piece . Now , say , there ai n't no special harm in goin ' around town gawpin ' at lib'ries and office buildin 's and churches . ' Most anyone could have done it without bumpin ' into trouble ; but not Cliffy . It was wonderful how he dug up ructions -- and him the mildest lookin ' four-eyed gent ever let loose . And green ! Say , what sort of a flag station is Bubble Creek , anyway ? Askin ' fool questions was Cliffy 's specialty . You see , he 'd made out a list of buildin 's he thought he wanted to take a look at ; but he had n't stopped to put down the street numbers or anything . And when he wants information does he hunt up a directory or a cop ? Oh , no ! He holds up anyone that 's handy , from a white wings dodgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wall Street broker rushin ' from ' Change out to a directors ' meetin ' . He seems to think anybody he meets knows all about New York , and has time to take him by the hand and lead him right where he wants to go , whether it 's the new Custom House down town , or Grant 's Tomb up on the drive . Throw downs do n't discourage him any , either . Two minutes after he 's been told to go chase himself he 'll butt right in somewhere else and call for directions . The worst of it was that he could n't remember what he was told for more'n three minutes on a stretch . We found out these little tricks of Clifford 's after he 'd been makin ' the office his headquarters for a couple of days . First mornin ' we started him out early for the Battery , to size up the Bowling Green Buildin ' and the Aquarium . About noon he limps in with his hat all dirt and ashes up and down his back . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been somewhere up on Washington Heights and has got into an argument with a janitor that did n't like being rung up from the basement and asked how far it was to Whitehall-st . Well , we fixes him up , writes out all the partic'lars of his route on a card , and gives him a fresh send-off . It wa' n't more'n half an hour afterwards that I was out on an errand , and as I cut through 22d-st. back of the Flatiron I sees a crowd . Course , I pushes in to find out what was holdin ' up all the carriages and bubbles that has to switch through there goin ' north . Somehow I had a feelin ' that it might be Clifford . And it was ! He was in the middle of the ring , hoppin ' around lively and wavin ' that umbrella of his like a sword . The other party was the pilot of a hansom cab that had climbed down off his perch and was layin ' on with his whip . I hated to disturb that muss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what was comin ' to him , and the crowd was enjoyin ' it to the limit . But I see a couple of traffic cops comin ' over from Broadway ; so I breaks through , grabs Clifford by the arm , and chases him down the avenue , breathin ' some hard but not much hurt . " Chee ! " says I , " but you 're a wonder ! Was you tryin ' to buy an eight-mile cab ride for a quarter ? " " Why , no , " says he . " I merely stopped the man to ask him where the nearest subway station was , and before I knew it he became angry . I 'm sure I did n't know --  --  " " That 's the trouble with you , Cliffy , " says I , " and if you do n't get over it you 'll be hurt bad . Where 's that card we made out for you ? " " I -- I must have lost that , " says he . " What you need is a guide and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow you back to the office , and you can talk it over with Mr. Robert . " He was willin ' . He 'd had enough for one day , anyhow . By mornin ' Mr. Robert has lost some of his joy over Cousin Clifford 's visit . Come to find out , he 'd never seen him before , and had n't heard much about him , either . " Torchy , " says he , " I shall be rather busy to-day ; so I am going to put Cousin Clifford in your care . " " Ah , say ! " says I. " Hand me an easier one . I could n't keep him straight less'n I had him on a rope and led him around . " " Well , do that , then , " says he , " anyway you choose . You may take the day off , show him the buildings he wants to see , keep him out of trouble , and do n't leave him until you have him safe inside my house to-night . I 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's you , " says I , " I 'll give it a whirl . But if Clifford wants to travel around town with me he 's got to shake the ear pads . " Mr. Robert says he 'll give him his instructions , and all that ; but when it came to springin ' the programme on Clifford he runs on a snag . Somewhere back of them squirrel teeth and under the soft hat there was a streak of mule . Cliffy balks at the whole business . He 's a whole lot obliged , but he really do n't care for comp'ny . Goin ' around alone and not havin ' his thoughts sidetracked by some one taggin ' along is what he likes better'n anything else . He 's always done it in Bubble Creek and never got into any trouble before -- that is , none to speak of . But he 'll promise to cut out janitors and cab drivers . As for the ear muffs , he could n't think of partin ' with them . For years he 's been puttin ' them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of March , and he 'd feel lost without ' em , just the same as he would without the umbrella . Yes , he knew it wa' n't common ; but that did n't bother him at all . Right there I gets a new line on Clifford . He 's one of these guys that throws a bluff at bein ' modest ; but when you scratch him deep you gets next to the fact that he 's dead sure he 's a genius and is anxious to prove it by the way he wears his clothes . There 's a lot of that kind that shows themselves off every night at the fifty-cent table d'hote places ; but I never knew any of ' em ever came in from so far west as Bubble Creek . Mr. Robert wa' n't on , though . He still freezes to the notion that Cousin Clifford 's just a well-meanin ' , corn-fed innocent ; so before he turns him loose again he gives him a lot of good advice about not gettin ' tangled up with strangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he need n't worry a bit . With that off he goes ; but every time the telephone rings that forenoon me and Mr. Robert gets nervous . We do n't hear a word from him , though , and by three o'clock we 're hopin ' for the best . Then Aunt Julie shows up . She 's a large , elegant old girl , all got up in Persian lamb and a fur hat with seven kinds of sealin ' wax fruit on it . She 's just in from Palm Beach , and she 's heard that Brother Henry 's boy is here on a visit . " He was such a cute little dear when he was a baby ! " says she . " He 's changed , " says Mr. Robert . " Of course , " says Aunt Julie . " I do want to see if he 's grown up to look like Henry , as I said he would , or like his mother . Where is he now , Robert ? " " Heaven only knows ! " says he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way back to Michigan . " " Why , Robert ! " says Aunt Julie . " And Clifford the only cousin you have in the world ! " " One is quite enough , " says he . That gives her another jolt , and she starts to lay out Mr. Robert good , for givin ' the frosty paw to a relation that had come so far to see him . " I shall stay right here , " says she , " until that poor , neglected young man returns , and then I shall try to make up for your heartless treatment . " Aunt Julie did n't have a long wait . She had n't more'n got herself settled , when the elevator stops at our floor and there breaks loose all kinds of a riot in the hall . There was a great jabberin ' and foot scufflin ' , and I could hear Dennis , that juggles the lever , forkin ' out the assault ' n ' batt'ry language in a brogue that sounded like rippin ' a sheet . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' his head out . " Two to one that 's Clifford ! " says I. There wa' n't any time to get a bet down , though ; for just then the door slams open and we gets a view of things . Oh , it was Cliffy , all right ! He was comin ' in backwards , tryin ' to wave off the gang that was follerin ' him . " Go away ! " says he , pushin ' at the nearest of ' em . " Please go away ! " " Ah , it 's you should be goin ' away , ye shark-faced baboon , ye ! " says Dennis , hoppin ' up and down in the door of the car . " You an ' yer Polack friends may walk down , or jump out the winder ; but divvle a ride do yez get in this illyvator again . Do ye mind that , now ? " You could n't blame him ; for the bunch wa' n't fit for the ash hoist . They were Zinskis , about twenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to look at the tin trunks and roped bundles to know that they 'd just finished ten days in the steerage . You could tell that by the bouquet . They did n't carry their perfume with ' em . It went on ahead , and they follered , backin ' Cliffy clear in until he fetched up against the gate , and then jammin ' in around him close . Chee ! but they was a punky lot ! They had jack lantern faces and garlic breaths , and they looked to know about as much as so many cigar store Injuns . " Did you have your pick , Cliffy , " says I , " or was this a job lot you got cheap ? " " Clifford , " says Mr. Robert , " what in thunder is the meaning of this performance of yours ? " But Clifford just keeps on tryin ' to work his elbows clear and looks dazed . " I do n't know , " says Cliffy , " truly I do n't , Cousin Robert . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an awful time . " " Maybe you 've been makin ' a noise like a wienerwurst , " says I. About that time Aunt Julie comes paddin ' out . " Did I hear some one say Clifford ? " says she . " You did , " says Mr. Robert . " There he is , the one with the ear muffs . I have n't found out who the others are yet . " " Phe-e-e-ew ! " says she , takin ' one sniff , and with that she grabs out her scent bottle and runs back , slammin ' the door behind her . " Cliffy , " says I , " you do n't seem to be makin ' much of a hit with your Ellis Island bunch . " " What I want to know , " says Mr. Robert , " is what this is all about ! " But Clifford did n't have the key . All he knew was that when he started to leave the subway train they had tagged after , and that since then he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped on a Broadway car ; but they 'd all piled in too , and the conductor had made him shell out a nickel for every last one . Another time he 'd dodged through one of them revolvin ' doors into a hotel , and four of ' em had got wedged in so tight it took half a dozen porters to get ' em out ; but the house detective had spotted Clifford for the head of the procession and held him by the collar until he could chuck him out to join his friends . " It was simply awful ! " says he , throwin ' up his hands . And then I notices the rattan cane . After that it was all clear . " Where 'd you cop the stick , Cliffy ? " says I. " Stick ! " says he . " Why , bless me ! I must have taken this instead of my umbrella . It belongs to that gentleman who sat next to me in the subway train . You see he was leaning back taking a nap in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I left I suppose I took his cane by mistake . " " Well , " says I , " the Zinskis goes with the cane . " It 's a fact , too . Most all them immigrant runners carries rattans when they 're herdin ' gangs of imported pick artists around to the railroad stations . It 's kind of a badge and helps the bunch to keep track of their leader . Most likely them Zinskis had had their eyes glued to that cane for hours , knowin ' that it was leadin ' ' em to a job somewheres , and they wa' n't goin ' to let it get away . " Gim me it , " says I ; " I 'll show you how it works . " Sure enough , soon 's I took it and started for the door the whole push quits eatin ' cheese and bread out of their pockets and falls in right after me . " Fine ! " says Mr. Robert , grabbin ' my hat and chuckin ' it after me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , say ! " says I. " I ai n't subbin ' for Cliffy . This is his gang . " But Mr. Robert only grins and motions me to be on my way . " If you come back here before to-morrow morning , " says he , " I 'll discharge you on the spot . " Now would n't that bump you ? " All right , " says I : " but this 'll cost Cliffy just twenty . " " I 'll pay it , " says Mr. Robert . " It 's a whizz , " says I , wavin ' the cane . " Come on , you Sneezowskis ! I 'll show you where the one fifty per grows on bushes . " What did I do with ' em ? Ah , say , it was a cinch ! I runs ' em down seven flights of stairs , marches ' em three blocks up town , and then rushes up to a big stiff in a green and gold uniform that 's hired to stand outside a flower shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of months ago , because I butted him in the belt when I was in a hurry once . " Here , " says I , rushin ' up and jammin ' the cane into his hand , " hold that till I come back ! " and before he has time to pipe off the bunch of Polackers that 's come to a parade rest around us , I makes a dive in amongst the cars and beats it down Broadway . Nah , I do n't know what becomes of him , or the Zinskis either . All I know is that I 'm twenty to the good , and that Cousin Clifford 's been shipped back to Bubble Creek , glad to get out of New York alive . But , as I says to Mr. Robert , " What do you look for from a guy that buttons his ears up in flannel ? " CHAPTER X BACKING OUT OF A FLUFF RIOT They will turn up , wo n't they ? Here I was only yesterday noontime loafin ' through the arcade , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a bookful of rush messages and his cap down over his ears . Now I ai n't sayin ' he 's the toughest lookin ' A. D. T. that ever sat on a call bench , for maybe I 've seen worse ; but with his bent-in nose , and his pop eyes , and that undershot jaw -- well , he ai n't one you 'd send in to quiet a cryin ' baby . Hunch did n't pose for that picture of the sweet youth on the blue signs outside the district offices . They do n't pick him out for these theater-escort snaps , either . Which shows how far you can go on looks , anyway ; for , if I was going to trust my safety-vault key with anyone , it would be Hunch . Not that they 'll ever use him to decorate any stained-glass window ; but I never look for him to land on the rock pile . Course , I do n't see much of Hunch and the rest these days ; but it ai n't a case of dodgin ' old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against a radiator in the main corridor and talks it over . I wants to know if Stiff Miller is still manager down at No. 11 branch , and who 's wearin ' the red stripe yet ; while Hunch he puts over a few polite quizzes as to how I 'm gettin ' on with the Corrugated people . We had n't been gassin ' but five minutes or so , and there 's ten more due on the clock before lunch hour is over , when I looks up to see our Mr. Piddie going by and givin ' me the frown . I knew what that meant . It 's another call-down . He has plenty of time to work up his case ; for I takes the limit and do n't hang up my hat until the life-insurance chimes has done their one-o'clock stunt . And I 'm hardly settled behind the brass gate before Piddie is down on me with the old mushy-mouthed reproof . " One is known , " says he , " by the company one keeps . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the answer ? " " I observed you loitering in the lower corridor , " says he . " That is all . " " Oh ! " says I. " You seen me conversin ' with Mr. Leary , eh ? " " Mr. Leary ! " says Piddie , raisin ' his eyebrows . " Well , Hunch , then , " says I. " Tryin ' to get up a grouch because you wa' n't introduced ? Do n't take it hard . He 's kind of exclusive , Mr. Leary is . " Piddie swallows that throat pippin of his two or three times before he can get a grip on his feelings enough to go on with the lesson of the day . " I merely wish to remark , " says he , " that evil communications corrupt good manners . " " How about court Judges , then , " says I , " and these slum missionaries ' ? G'wan , Piddie ! Back to the copybook with your mottoes ! I 'm a mixer , I am ! Would I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sighs , Piddie does , and struts away to freeze the soul of some new lady typist by looking over her shoulder . As an act of charity , they ought to let Piddie fire me about once a month . He 'll die of grief if he do n't get the chance sometime . And blamed if he do n't come near gettin ' his heart 's desire before the day was over ! It all begins about three o'clock , when Piddie comes turkeyin ' out of the telephone booth all swelled up with importance and signals me to come on the carpet . " Torchy , " says he , " I presume you know where the Metropolitan Building is ? " " They ai n't moved it since lunchtime , have they ? " says I. " That will do ! " says he . " Now listen very carefully . " You 'd thought from his preamble that I was going to be sent up to regulate the clock , or see if the tower was still plumb ; but all it simmers down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , hunt up Mr. Ellins , who 's attendin ' a directors ' meetin ' over there , and deliver some papers that he 's forgot to have his private secretary lug along . " And kindly refrain , " he tacks on at the last , " from stopping to talk with any suspicious characters on the way . " " Say , Piddie , " says I , " if I was you I 'd have that printed on a card . Some day you 're going to forget to rub that in . " Well , I hustles across the square , locates Old Hickory , and delivers the goods without droppin ' ' em down a manhole or doin ' any of the other awful things that Piddie would have warned me against if he 'd had more time . I tucks the empty case under my arm and was for makin ' a record trip back , just to surprise Piddie ; but while I 'm waitin ' for that flossy lever juggler on the express elevator to answer my red-light signal I hears this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wa' n't missin ' any lively disturbance like that ; for it listens like a mob scene from one of them French guillotine plays . Mostly it 's female voices that floats up , and they was all tuned to the saw-filin ' pitch . A pasty-faced young gent wearin ' a green eye-shade and an office coat comes beatin ' it up the marble steps , and I fires a question at him on the fly . " Is it a gen'ral rough-house number , " says I , " or have the suffragettes broke loose again ? " " You 're welcome to find out for yourself , " he pants , dashin ' up another flight . " Thanks for the invite , " says I. " Guess I will . " And , say , talk about your mass plays around a shirtwaist bargain counter ! Why , the corridor was full of ' em , all tryin ' to rush the door of 1,323 at once . For a guess I should say that half the manicure artists , lady demonstrators , and cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , they was a swell bunch , with more fur turbans and Marie Antoinette ringlets on view than you could see collected anywhere outside of Murray 's ! They was sayin ' things , too ! I could n't catch anything but odd words here and there ; but the gen'ral drift of their remarks seems to be that someone has welshed on ' em . First off I thought it must be one of these skirt bucket-shops that has been closed out by the renting agent ; but then I gets a look at the sign on the door and sees that it 's the Peruvian Investment Company , which sounds like one of them common twenty per cent . a month games . And it 's a case of lockout , with the lady customers ragin ' on the outside , and nobody knows what 's takin ' place behind the ground glass . That wa' n't excitin ' enough to lure me from a steady job for long , though , unless some one was goin ' to do more'n look desp'rate and talk spiteful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Did n't any lady think to bring a brick in her vanity bag ? " A couple turns around and glares at me ; but it encourages one to begin hammerin ' on the glass with her near-gold purse , and just as I 'm about to leave this turns the trick . The door swings open all of a sudden , and there stands a tall , well-built gent , with a green felt hat pushed back on his head , a five-inch cigar juttin ' out of one corner of his mouth , and his thumbs stuck in the pockets of a sporty striped vest . On account of the curly brown Vandyke , he 's kind of a foreign-lookin ' party ; but someway them smilin ' , wide-open eyes of his has a sort of familiar look . For a high pressure storm center he seems mighty placid . As he throws open the door he steps back into the middle of the room , rests one elbow against the rail of a wired-in cashier 's coop , and removes the cheroot so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a brainy play . The rush line stops like it has gone up against a bridge pier , and then spreads out in a half-circle . " Well , ladies , " says he , " what can we do for you to-day ? " Do I know who it is then ? Well , do I ! Maybe it has been months since I 've heard the voice , and maybe he does wear a set of face herbage that I 'd never seen before ; but I ai n't one to forget the only real A-1 classy boss I ever had ; not that soon , anyway . It 's Mr. Belmont Pepper , as sure as I 've got a Titian thatch on my skull ! Do I linger ? That 's what ! Why , I 've been waitin ' for him to show up again like a hired girl waits for Thursday afternoon . It 's Mr. Pepper , all right ; but it looks like he 's been let in bad , for after one or two gasps in chorus that bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a whoop . " Where 's my dividends ? I want to draw out my money ! Say , you give me back my eighteen dollars , or I'll --  -- You 'll try your bunko game on me , will you ? Hey ! I 've been waiting since noon to catch you , you --  --  " My ! but they did have their hammers out ! They called him everything that a lady could , and a few names that wa' n't so ladylike as they might have been . They shook things at him , and promised to do him all sorts of damage , from bringin ' lawsuits to scratchin ' his eyes out . Mr. Pepper , though , he goes on smokin ' and smilin ' , now and then throwin ' in a shoulder shrug just to hint that there wa' n't any use in his tryin ' to get in a word until they was all through . He almost acts like he enjoyed being mobbed ; but of course he knew better'n to choke off a lot of women before they 'd had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it out of their systems . Fin'lly he raises his hand , takes off the green lid , and bows graceful . " Ladies , " says he , " I fully sympathize with your impatience -- fully . " " You look it , I do n't think ! " sings out a big blonde , shakin ' her willow plumes energetic . Mr. Pepper throws her a smile and spiels ahead . " You will be pleased to hear , however , " says he , " that the board of directors , on the strength of cabled advices from our general manager in Peru , has just voted an extra dividend of ten per cent . " " When do we get it ? Show us some money ! " howls the kickers . " I have been requested to announce , " goes on Mr. Pepper , " that payments from this office will be resumed promptly at noon -- on the first day of next month . " Does that satisfy ' em ? Not so you 'd notice it . A bigger squawk than ever goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like rush hour at the Hudson Terminal . They starts clawin ' at his elbows , and grabbin ' his coat , and when I notices one wild-eyed brunette reachin ' for a hatpin I knew it was a case of me to the rescue or sendin ' in an ambulance call . Not that I had any notion what ought to be done in a case like this . I could n't throw him a rope or shove out a plank ; I ai n't any expert woman trainer , either ; but can I stand there with my mouth open and see an old friend get the hooks thrown into him by a class in hysterics ? Not when the hookee happens to be one that once set me up as a stockholder in a gold mine . So I lets flicker with the first fool idea that comes into my head . " Gangway ! " I shouts out , wedgin ' my way in among ' em and usin ' my elbows . " Gangway for the bank messenger ! Ah , do n't shove , girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . One side for the real money bringer ! One side now ! " And by holdin ' the leather case high up where they could all see it , and hittin ' the line like Coy does when it 's three downs with ten yards to go , I manages to get through without losin ' many coat buttons . " Here you are , sir , " says I , shovin ' the case out to Mr. Pepper and givin ' him the knowin ' look . " City National . Cashier wants a receipt . " Does he need a diagram and a card of instructions ? Trust Belmont Pepper ! " Ah , this way , " says he . " Pardon me a moment , ladies , only a moment . This way , young man . " And almost before they know what has happened him and me are behind the partition with the gate locked . " Let 's see , " says he , lookin ' me over kind of puzzled , " it's -- er -- Torchy , is n't it ? " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover off my danger signal . " I might have known , " says he , " that no one else could have put up so good a bluff on the spur of the --  --  " " Now that 's all right , Mr. Pepper , " says I ; " but the bluff wo n't hold ' em long . What you want to do is get busy and make a noise like hundred-dollar bills . I do n't know what the trouble is ; but it looks like the genuine goods to me . " " Diagnosis correct , " says he . " I 'm boxed . Now if they were only men , I could --  --  " " Oh , sure ! " says I. " But a bunch of nutty fluffs is diff'rent . They never know what they want or why they want it . Say , ai n't you got another exit ? " Mr. Pepper shakes his head . " No , son , " says he ; " but do n't you worry about me . Your strategy thus far has been excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in this mess . Skip , Torchy , while the skipping is easy . " " Mr. Pepper , " says I , " do I look like a quitter ? I ai n't forgot what you did about givin ' me them Glory Be stocks , either , and I 'm goin ' to hang around here until this little private cyclone of yours blows over . " Mr. Pepper he looks at me a minute in that calm way of his , and then he shrugs his shoulders . " All right , " says he . Then we listens to the buzz outside . Some was explainin ' to others how a bushel of money had just come in from the City National Bank , and some was insistin ' that it was just a north-pole fake . It 's a free-for-all debate with all rules in the discard . Then we hears one voice that 's louder than the others calling out for a committee . " We must organize ! " she says . " Let 's organize for action ! " " Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That looks better . " A couple of minutes more and they 've concluded to adjourn to the corridor . When they 're all out and I can hear ' em down at the further end , I gives him the tip . " Now 's your chance ! " says I. " Up one flight and you can get an express elevator . I 'll show you . " Mr. Pepper do n't like the idea , though , of doin ' the gumshoe sneak . He hates to run away from any kind of a fight , specially a lot of women . He do n't run , either ; but after awhile he consents to walk out , and we strolls towards the steps dignified and easy . It looked like a clean get-away for a minute , too ; but I had n't counted on their leavin ' a picket to watch the elevator . She sees us and gives the alarm ; so by the time we 're up to the next floor the whole mob is after us , lettin ' out the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They struck the upper corridor just as I 've got my finger on the button , and in the front ranks they 're pushin ' along the gray uniformed special cop that they 've rung up from the first floor . Also who should step out into the midst of the riot but Old Hickory Ellins , just leavin ' the directors ' meeting . He goes purple-faced and bug-eyed , but before I can dodge out of sight of course he spots me . And that 's the very minute when a couple of lady avengers points me and Mr. Pepper out to the cop and the pinch business is about to begin . " Why , what 's all the row about , Torchy ? " says he . " And who is that with you ? " He gets answers from the anvil chorus . " That 's the swindler ! " they shouts . " That 's Prentice Owens ! He 's the one that took our money , and the boy is one of the gang ! Nab ' em , Mr. Officer , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of flossy kikes ! " I throws back at ' em . " Torchy , " says Mr. Ellins , " have you been up to any swindling game ? " " Honest , I ai n't , Mr. Ellins , " says I. " I am inclined to believe that , " says he ; " but what about the other person ? Is he a friend of yours ? " " Sure , " says I. " And he 's on the level too . " " He 's Prentice Owens , is he ? " says he . " Nah , " says I. " He 's Mr. Belmont Pepper , he is , president of the Glory Be Mining Company . Why , I used to work for him ! That aggregation of female dopes is full of prunes . Mr. Pepper 's no crook . " " Hum ! " says Old Hickory , rubbin ' his chin . " A case of mistaken identity , eh ? Officer , you know me , I suppose ? " " Yes , Mr. Ellins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " oh , yes , sir . " " Then drive these deluded women downstairs and tell them their mistake , " says Old Hickory . " Come , Mr. Pepper . Come , Torchy . In with you ! " And inside of two shakes we 're shootin ' down a one hundred and fifty foot shaft with no stops until the ground floor . Not until we gets outside and Mr. Ellins jumps into his cab does Mr. Pepper say a word . " Torchy , " says he , " you 're the real thing in the friendship line . I will admit that appearances are somewhat against me , but --  --  " " Ah , say ! " I breaks in . " Do n't I know you , Mr. Pepper ? Do I have to see any books to know that you 're playin ' a straight game ? It was a matter of needin ' a little time , wa' n't it , and bein ' rushed off your feet when you did n't expect the move ? I could guess that much from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the mine gettin ' on , the Glory Be , you know ? " He looks at his feet for a second or so and kind of flushes . Then he straightens up , looks me level between the eyes , and reaches out a hand to give me the brotherhood grip . " Torchy , " says he , " there is a mine , and the last I heard it was still there . Anyway , I 'm dropping the investment business right here , and I 'm going out to see what our property looks like . I 'll let you know . " With that he whirls and dashes off across the avenue . " How is it , " says Piddie when I gets back , " that it takes you an hour and a quarter to go four blocks ? " " Hookworms , Piddie , " says I , " hookworms . I had a sudden attack . " CHAPTER XI RUNG IN WITH THE GOLD SPOONERS On the level now , what 's a he Cinderella ? And if your boss called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or throw out your chest and strike for a raise ? But , then , maybe it was only some of Mr. Robert 's fancy joshin ' . Anyway , I 'd stand in line waitin ' for a thing like that to happen again . The way it begun was when I runs across this new girl in the filin ' room and finds her snifflin ' over one of the index cases . She 's bitin ' her lips to keep from doing it and she 's red way up behind her ears ; so I knows she 's more mad than sorry . I could guess what 's happened ; for I 'd just seen Piddie come out of there looking satisfied and important . " Hello , sis ! " says I. " Weepin ' over your job so soon ? " " Shut up ! " says she . " Why , how pettish ! " says I. " What was Piddie callin ' you down for ? " " What 's that to you ? " says she . " Who are you , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm the Corrugated 's gen'ral grouch dispeller . I 'm the official little ray of sunshine . See ? " and I bobs my head so she can get a good view of my red thatch . " Huh ! " says she ; but she ca n't help lettin ' out a grin , so I sees the cure has begun . " Do n't you mind Piddie , " says I. " He do n't dare tie the can to you without reportin ' higher up . He likes to make a noise like a watchdog , that 's all . Next time you give him the merry chuckle . " And , honest , I 'd done the same if she 'd been wall-eyed and toggle-jointed , just for the sake of blockin ' off his little game . It wa' n't until a couple of days later , when she shoots over a casual flashlight look as I 'm strollin ' past , that I takes any partic'lar notice of what a Daisy Maizie she is . There 's more or less class to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rollin ' brown eyes . Course , I sends back the roguish wink , and by the end of the week we was callin ' each other by our pet names . Not that I 'm entered reg'lar as a Percy boy , or that I takes this so serious as to miss any meals ; but you know how it is . And what if she was a few years older ? She seems to like it when I sing out , " Oh , you Theresa ! " at her , and once she mussed up my hair when there wa' n't anybody lookin ' . In fact , I was almost to the point of thinkin ' that I 'd been picked as somebody 's honey boy when this Izzy Budheimer shows up as a late entry . Izzy , he 's a third assistant in the stock department , and on twelve a week he sports one of those striped green overcoats and a plush hat with the bow behind . Maybe he would n't be listed as a home destroyer ; but he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About the second week I sees him and the new girl gettin ' chummier and chummier , and , while she still has a jolly for me now and then , I knows I 'm only a side issue . That 's what hurt most . So what fool play must I make but go and plunge on a sixty-cent box of mixed choc'lates for her ! As luck would have it , Mr. Robert spots me comin ' out of the 23d-st. candy shop with the package under my arm . You would n't think he 'd notice a little clew like that , or pick me up on it ; but he does . " How now , Torchy ? " says he . " Sweets to the sweet , eh ? " " Uh-huh , " says I , and I guess I colors up some . " What is the fair one 's name ? " says he . " Tessie , " says I. " Ah ! " says he . " Thus were they ever named : Tessie , Juliet , and Helen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Torchy , and may the gods be kind ! " Which is only the brand of hot air Mr. Robert blows off whenever he has a good lunch under his vest and nothin ' heavy on his mind . It do n't mean anything at all . " Troy ! " says I. " Can it ! This ai n't for no up-State laundry hand . She comes from Eighth-ave . " Well , I stows the box away until closin ' time , and then waits around the upper corridor for Tessie to show up . Izzy , he spots me and proceeds to improve the time by givin ' me an earache about what an important party he is , how he expects to be jumped a notch soon , and about how much he makes nights on the outside , followin ' up some checkroom snap or other . " That 's fine ! " says I. " But wo n't you be late gettin ' over to Grand-st. ? " Izzy was still explainin ' how long it was since his folks moved to the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor , when Tessie floats out with her new spring lid and princess walkin ' suit on . I 'm just shovin ' out the peace offerin ' and gettin ' ready to hand over my smoothest josh , when she brushes past like I was part of the wall decoration , squeals , " Oh , Mr. Budheimer ! " and begins showin ' Izzy some tickets for the grand annual benefit ball of the Shirtwaist Makers ' Union , and tellin ' him how she was sellin ' ' em for her sister , and what a grand time it was goin ' to be . " How much ? " says Izzy , tryin ' hard to choke it back , but losin ' the struggle . " Seventy-five for a double ticket , " says Tessie . " That 's the kind you want . " " Maybe I would yet , if I could get a partner , " says he . " Ai n't that an awful sad case ? " says Tessie . " Nobody 's teased me very hard , either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Izzy . " It 's awful sudden , " says she ; " but a chance is a chance . Do n't send a cab ; the folks in the block might think I was putting on . " And me ? Why , I do n't show on the chart at all ! Right under my nose she does it , and do n't even give me a sideways glance . " Pooh ! " says I. " Pooh , pooh ! " " What a cute little fellah ! " says Tessie to him as they crowds into the elevator with the rest of the push . " Say , " says I , making a jump for the grating , " you do n't need to --  --  " " Next car ! " sings out the Johnny Flip , slammin ' the door . Now wa' n't that rubbin ' it in ? " Coises ! " says I. " Deep coises ! " and walks down eleven flights with a temperature that would have got me condemned by any boiler inspector in the business . The candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lives . The nerve of that Izzy , though ! In the mornin ' he comes around just like nothin ' had happened and wants to know if I 'll sub . for him on his evenin ' job the night he goes to the ball . To show I do n't carry any grouch , I says I will ; but he offers only half-pay and makes me agree to split the tips with him . " I could n't afford it , at that , " says he , " only this is a kid session and the graft will be light . " It 's this checkroom work of his , you know , at one of them swell Fifth-ave. joints where they have an extra night force on call for coming-out parties and dinner dances and the like . So , while him and Tessie is enjoyin ' themselves with the lady shirtwaist makers , I 'm standin ' behind the counter wearin ' a braided jacket , givin ' out check coupons , and stowin ' away hats and top-coats for Master Reginald and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the final blowout of Miss Somebody 's afternoon dancin ' class , and no one was allowed inside unless Father had his name printed in bright red ink in the social register . A hot lot of young gold spooners they was too ; some of ' em not as old as me by a couple of years , and swellin ' around in dinky Tuxes and white kids . One of ' em even hands me in a silver-headed cane . " Careful of that stick , my man , " says he . " Oh , sure ! " says I. " Puppah 'd be wild if anything happened to it , would n't he ? " And you should have heard the talk they had as they loafs around the cloakroom between the numbers ,  - -  all about the awful things they did at prep school , how they bunked the masters , and smuggled brandied peaches up to their rooms , and rough-housed durin ' mornin ' prayers . Almost made your blood run cold -- not . When they got to discussin ' the girls , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolly sort , " and others was " bloomin ' rotters , " it made me seasick and it was a relief when they took to whisperin ' things I could n't hear about the chaperons . After intermission they come sneakin ' in by twos and threes to hit up their cigarettes . It was about eleven-thirty and there was four or five of ' em in the cloakroom , puffin ' away languid like real clubmen , when in drifts a young lady all in pink silk and gold net and hails one of the wicked bunch . " Bobby , " says she , " you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! " " Run on now , Vee , " says he . " Told you when I asked you to come that I was n't a dancing man , y'know . " " Fudge ! " says she , stampin ' her foot . " You think it 's smart to take that pose , do n't you ? Well , you wait ! " And , say , you talk about your haughty beauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen I ever had a real close view of ,  - -  the slimmest feet and ankles , reg'lar cameo-cut face all tinted up natural like a bunch of sweet peas , and a lot of straw-colored hair as fine as cobwebs . She was a thoroughbred stunner , this Miss Vee was , and mad all over . " I have n't been on the floor for four numbers , " she goes on . " You just wait ! " " You would n't be cad enough to peach on us for smokin ' , would you ? " says Bobby . " Would n't I , though ! " says she . That starts a stampede . All but Bobby chucks away their cigarettes and beats it back to the ballroom . He turns sulky , though . " Tell ahead , " says he . " Who cares ? And let 's see you get any more dances ! " He 's a pasty-faced , weak-jawed youth with a chronic scowl and a sullen look in his eyes . I should say he was sixteen maybe , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and stands there starin ' at him . I 'm so much int'rested in the case that the first thing I know I 've butted in with advice . " Ah , be nice , Claude ! " says I. " Dance with the young lady . I would if I was you . " And you ca n't guess how fussy a little remark like that gets Bobby boy . He almost swallows his cigarette from the jar he gets , being spoken to by a common cloakroom checker . First off he jumps up and stalks over to me real majestic and threatenin ' . " You -- you --  -- How dare you ? " he splutters out . " There , there ! " says I. " Do n't get bristle-spined over it . I wa' n't offerin ' any deadly insult , and if it makes you feel as bad as all that I 'll take it back . " " I -- I 'll have you dismissed ! " he growls . " Ca n't do it , Bobby , " says I. " I 'm no reg'lar tip-chaser . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back to your corner , now ! There 's a lady present . " He glares at me for a minute or so , and then turns on the queen in pink . " I hope you 're satisfied , Vee , " says he . " You would come in here , though ! I ca n't help it if the attendants are insolent to you . " " Pooh ! " says Miss Vee . " The young man was only taking my part . " " So ? " sneers Bobbie . " I congratulate you on your new champion . " " He acts more like a gentleman than you do , at any rate ! " she fires back at him . " Does he ? " says Bobby . " Then why do n't you get him for a partner ? " Illustration : " G'WAN ! " SAYS I , " IT 'S A FAIR SWAP . " " If you do n't ask me for this next waltz , I will , " says she , tossin ' up her chin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Miss Vee , I 'm not going to ask you . Now ! " Say , it was gettin ' more or less personal by that time , and I was wonderin ' just how the young lady was goin ' to back out of the proposition that had been put up to her , when the first thing I know she 's marchin ' straight over to where I was . " Will you give me this next waltz ? " says she . " Say , " I gasps , " do you mean it ? " " Certainly I do , " says she . " You can dance , ca n't you ? " " I do n't know , " says I ; " but I can do an East Side spiel . " " Good ! " says she . " I know how to do that too . Come on . " " In a minute , " says I. " Just hold on until I borrow the young gentleman 's evenin ' coat . " " Wha -- what 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a smokin ' jacket , " says I. " Peel it off now , and let the fancy vest come along too ! " " I -- I wo n't do it ! " says Bobbie . " Oh , yes , you will , " says I , " or else you and me will be mixed up in a rumpus that 'll bring the chaperons and special cops in here on the run , " and with that I proceeds to shed the braided coat and my black vest . " You 're insulting ! " says Bobby , gettin ' wild-eyed . " G'wan ! " says I. " It 's a fair swap . I 'll leave it to the young lady . " And when I 'd sized her up for a thoroughbred I had n't made any wild guess . There 's a twinkle under them long eyelashes that 's as good as a go-ahead signal . " Of course , " says she . " It was you who suggested him as a partner , anyway . And hurry , Bobby , there goes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , shuck ' em ! " says I , startin ' for him hasty . I expects it was the prospects of gettin ' rung into a rough and tumble , and having to explain to mother , that changed Bobby 's mind so sudden . At any rate , inside of a minute more I 'm wearin ' the pearl-gray waistcoat and the silk-faced tuxedo , and out I sails onto the shiny floor of the green and gold ballroom with somebody 's pink-costumed heiress hangin ' to my left arm . " One-two-three ; one-two-three --  -- Now ! " says she , countin ' out the time so I should n't make any false start . But , say , I did n't need that . Course , I 'm no cotillion leader , and about all the dancin ' I ever done was at chowder parties or in the Coney Island halls ; but who could n't keep step to a tune like " Yip-I-Addy " played by a twelve-piece goulash orchestra , specially with such a crackerjack partner as Miss Vee was ? Could we spiel together ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxed maple boards like a pair of summer butterflies , pivotin ' first one way and then the other , dodgin ' in and out among the couples , and givin ' an exhibition that had any other performance on the floor lookin ' like a cripples ' parade . First it got into my heels , and then it goes to my head . I did n't know whether I was waltzin ' , or havin ' a joy ride with some biplane shuffer . I wa' n't sayin ' a word in the way of language ; but Miss Vee keeps up a string of chatter and giggles that 's enough for both . You 'd thought to see us , I expect , that we was carryin ' on a real , rapid-fire , smart-set dialogue , when all the while it was only her tellin ' me how the diff'rent parties was actin ' when they first spotted her on the floor with a ringer , and how the chaperons were squintin ' at us through their lorgnettes , tryin ' to make out who I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music stopped and I fell about a mile down through rosy clouds . " Wait ! " says Miss Vee , squeezin ' my arm . " There 'll be an encore . My aunt 's over there , and she 's just wild ; but it does n't matter . " " You 're a good sport , " says I , joinin ' in the hand-clappin ' to jog the orchestra into givin ' us a repeat . And just as they starts up the tune again I happens to glance up into the little visitors ' balcony at the end of the ballroom . Who do you guess I sees watchin ' us bug-eyed and open-mouthed ? Why , Izzy Budheimer and Miss Tessie ! See ? They 've broke away from the lady shirtwaisters durin ' the supper hour so Izzy can give his new girl a glimpse of what a real swell dance is like . Maybe he planned on stoppin ' in at the cloakroom too , and seein ' if I was holdin ' down the job proper . Anyway , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovers me out on the floor with the belle of the ball . But all I has time to do is send him up the chilly stare , and away we go again into another one-two-three dream -- me and Miss Vee . " I do n't care what becomes of me , " she hums over my shoulder . " Me either , " says I. " Silly boy ! " says she . " What 's your name ? " " Just Torchy , " says I , " after my hair . " " I think curly red hair is cute , " says she . " I could go hoarse sayin ' things like that about you , " says I. Maybe it was lucky , too , that this second installment was short , or I might have gone clean mushy ; for the way she could look at me out of them big gray eyes of hers was -- well , it was the real thing in thrills . The wind-up came just as we gets around near the cloakroom door and we stops . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee ! " says I. " Why , I could wear out all my old shoes doin ' that , and if ever you need --  --  " " S-s-sh ! " says she . " Here comes my aunt ! " Not waitin ' for any further diagram of the situation , I makes a dash into the cloakroom , where I finds Izzy Budheimer gazin ' puzzled at Bobby , who 's sittin ' tilted back in his shirt sleeves with the braided coat slung on the floor . " Look here , Torchy ! " begins Izzy . " What the --  --  " " On the job , Izzy , if you want to save it ! " says I , wigglin ' out of Master Bobby 's expensive clothes and chuckin ' ' em at him . " But why -- what --  --  " says Izzy , tryin ' again . " Do n't stop to ask fool questions of a busy society man , " says I ; " but jump into your uniform , get in your coop there , and prepare to put the timelock on your conversation works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old hens in here lookin ' for a mysterious young gent with incendiary hair who has disappeared . Your cue is to look innocent and not know anything about it . See ? If there 's any explainin ' to be done , let Bobby do it . " " Oh , I say ! " groans Bobby , jumpin ' up , and by the time I 've struck the bottom stair on my way out he 's grabbed his overcoat and is beatin ' it down to find his carriage . How Miss Vee squared it with Aunty is a puzzle I never expect to find out the answer to ; but I 'll risk her . She 's a pink queen , she is , and after that one waltz with her I can look cold-eyed at a row of Tessie girls stretchin ' from here to the Battery ! CHAPTER XII LANDING ON A SIDE STREET It was a little matter between me and Mother Sykes that starts me off to hunt a new boardin ' place . Lovely old girl , Mother Sykes is , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collects in advance every Saturday night . She 's got one of them inquisitive landlady noses that looks like it was made for pryin ' up trunk covers and pokin ' into bureau drawers . That do n't bother me any , though . It 's only when I misses my swell outfit , the one Benny had built for me to wear at his weddin ' , that I gets sore . Course , she 'd only borrowed it for Pa Sykes to wear on a Sunday afternoon call , him bein ' a little runt of a gent , with watery eyes and a red nose , that never does anything on his own hook . And if he had n't denied it so brassy I should n't have called him down so hard , right in the front hall with half the roomers listenin ' . " Dreamed it , eh , did I ? " says I. " Well , listen here , Sykesy ! Next time I has an optical illusion of you paradin ' out in any of my uniform , there 'll be doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the kitchen and saves the fam'ly honor by throwin ' an indignation fit . I do n't know how long it lasted ; but she was gettin ' purple clear up under her false front when I slid out the door and left her at it . Next day I noticed the sign hung up ; but I did n't know which sky parlor was vacant until I strolls in at five-fifteen Friday night and finds my things out in the hall and a new lodger in my room . " Oh , well , " says I , " what 's a sudden move now and then to a free lance like me ? " And as there ai n't anybody in sight to register my fond farewells with , I gathers up my suitcase and laundry bag , chucks the latchkey on the stand in the front hall , and beats it . Not until I 'm three blocks away does I remember that all the cash I 've got in my clothes is three quarters and a dime , which comes of my listenin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloomin ' savings bank . " Looks like I 'd spend the night in a Mills hotel , " says I , " unless I find Mallory and make a touch . " It was chasin ' him up that fetches me over on the West Side and through one of them nice , respectable , private-house blocks just below 14th-st . You know the kind , that begin at Fifth-ave. with a double-breasted old brownstone , and end at Sixth with a delicatessen shop . Well , I was moseyin ' along quiet and peaceful , wonderin ' how long since anything ever really happened in that partic'lar section , when all of a sudden I feels about a cupful of cold water strike me in the back of the neck . " Wow ! " says I. " Who 's playin ' me for a goat now ? " With that I turns and inspects the windows of the house I 'd just passed , knowin ' it must be some kid gettin ' gay with the passersby . There 's no signs of any cut-up concealed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sashes was raised . If it had n't been for the way things had been comin ' criss-cross at me , I suppose I 'd wiped off my collar and gone along , lettin ' it pass as a joke ; but I wa' n't feelin ' very mirthful just then . I 'm ready to follow up anything in the trouble line ; so I steps into the area , drops my baggage , shins up over the side of the front steps , and flattens myself against the off side of the vestibule door . Then I waits . It ai n't more'n a minute before I hears the door openin' ' cautious , and all I has to do is shove my foot out and throw my weight against the knob . Somebody lets out a howl of surprise , and in another minute I 'm inside , facin ' a twelve-year-old kid armed with a green tin squirt gun . He 's one of these aristocratic-lookin ' youngsters , with silky light hair , big dark eyes , and a sulky mouth . Also he 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught so unexpected ; but some of his nerve is still left . " You -- you get out of here ! " he snarls . " Not until you 've had a dose of what you handed me , sonny , " says I. " Give it up now , Reggie boy ! " " I wo n't ! " says he . " I -- I 'll have you thrown out ! " " You will , eh ? " says I , makin ' a rush for him . " O-o-o-oh , Aunty , Aunty ! " he squeals , dashin ' down the hall . Now , say , the way I was feelin ' then , I 'd have gone up against a whole fam'ly , big brothers included ; so a little thing like a call for Aunty do n't stop me at all . As he turns into the room on the left I 'm only a jump behind , and all that fetches me up is when he does a dive behind an old lady in a big leather chair . She 's a wide , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hair , and kind of a resigned , patient look on her face . Someway , she acts like she was more or less used to surprises like this ; for she do n't seem much excited . " Why , Hadley ! " she remarks . " Whatever is the matter now ? " " He -- he chased me into the house ! " whines Master Hadley from behind the chair . " Did you ? " says the old girl . " Sure , " says I. " He 's too blamed fresh ! " " There , there ! " says she . " You must n't speak that way of Hadley . He is only a little boy , you know . " " Yes 'm , " says I. " And he was only indulging in innocent play , " she goes on . " Come , Hadley , untie me now . Please , Hadley ! " Say , I had n't noticed it before , but the old girl is roped solid , feet and arms , to the chair legs , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Hadley to shoot at he 'd been usin ' Aunty for a target . The damp spots on the wall behind the chair and one or two on her dress showed that . " I wo n't , unless you 'll call Maggie and have her throw him out ! " growls Hadley . " Oh , come , Hadley , be a good boy ! " coaxes Aunty . " Sha' n't ! " says Hadley . " And next time I 'll shoot ink at you . " " Now , Hadley ! " protests Aunty . " Excuse me , lady , " says I , " but it looks to me like there was something comin ' to Hadley that I ought to tend to . This ai n't on my account , either , but yours . Now watch . Hi , freshy ! " and I makes another dash for him . Well , he knows the lay of the land better'n I do , and he 's quick on the dodge , so we has a lively time of it for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurdlin ' sofas , Aunty beggin ' us to quit and callin ' for Maggie , and me keepin ' right on the job . But at last I got him cornered . He makes a desp'rate duck and tries to butt me ; but I catches his head under my arm and down he goes on the rug . I 'd just yanked the squirt gun out of his hand and was emptyin ' it down the back of his neck , with him hollerin ' blue murder , and Aunty strugglin ' to get loose , when the front door opens and in walks a couple of ladies , one old and the other young . And , say , you talk about your excitin ' tableaux ! In about two shakes there 's all kinds of excitement ; for it seems one of the new arrivals is Hadley 's mommer , and she proceeds to join the riot . " Oh , my darling boy ! My darling ! " she sings out . " What is happening ! He is being killed ! Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , gettin ' up and exhibitin ' the squirt gun . " I was only handin ' him some of the same sport he 's been dealin ' out to others . It 'll do him good . " " You -- you young scoundrel ! " says mommer . Then , turnin ' to the old lady who came in with her , she gasps out , " Zenobia , telephone for the police ! " It 's the real thing , too , and no flossy bluff about the lady 's grouch . She 's a swell , haughty-lookin ' party , and she acts like she was used to havin ' her own way about things . So the prospects begin to look squally . Not that I 'm one to curl up and shiver at sight of a cop . Give me plenty of room to do the hotfoot act , and I do n't mind guyin ' any of them pavement-pounders ; but with me shut up in a house where I had n't been invited in , and a bunch of excited females as witnesses against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to weaken , though . " Go ahead , " says I. " Double six-O-four-two Gramercy ; that 's the green light number for this district . And Uncle Patrick 'll be glad to see you . Tell him you got charges to make on his nephew . That 'll tickle him to death . Maybe I 'll have something to say when we all get there , too . " " What do you mean ? " says Hadley 's mother . " Counter complaint , that 's all , " says I. " Your little darling soaked me first . " " It -- it is n't true ! " says she . " I do n't believe it ! " And here Zenobia comes in with the soothin ' advice . She 's another whitehaired old lady , lookin ' something like the one in the chair , only not so bulky and with more ginger about her . " Now , Sally , " says she , " let 's not talk of calling in the police over a trifle . Hadley does n't appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The idea ! " says Sally . " Why , I saw this young ruffian pommeling him . And look ! Martha is bound in her chair . He 's a burglar ! " Oh , they had a great debate amongst ' em , Aunt Martha fin'lly admittin ' it was just a little prank of Hadley 's , her being roped down ; but she was sure I had tried to murder him , just for nothing at all . Hadley says so too . In fact , he tells seven diff'rent yarns in as many minutes , each one makin ' me out worse than the last . " There ! " says his mother . " Now , Zenobia , will you send for an officer ? " Nope , Zenobia would n't ; anyway , not until she had more facts to go on . She do n't deny that maybe I 'm kind of a suspicious-lookin ' character , and says it ai n't been explained what I was doin ' in there holdin ' little Hadley on the rug ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a clear case . " You know , my dear , " she winds up with , " Hadley is quite apt to get into trouble . " " Zenobia Preble ! " snorts Sally , her eyes blazin ' . " And he your own flesh and blood ! Come , precious , mother will take you home , and you shall never , never come to this house again ! " " There , Sally , " begins Zenobia , " do n't fly into a --  --  " " When my husband 's mother chooses to insult me in her own home , " says Sally , " I hope I have spirit enough to resent it ! " Say , she had that and some left over . Inside of two minutes she 's hustled little Hadley into his things , and out they sails to her carriage , leavin ' the makin 's of a first-class fam'ly row all prepared . In the meantime Zenobia is tyin ' Aunt Martha loose , and I 'm standin ' around waitin ' to see what 's goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third degree ; but she begins with Martha . " Now what mischief was Hadley up to this time ? " she asks . And Martha sticks to it that it was nothing at all . He merely found that old plant-sprayer and discovered that by unscrewing the nozzle it made a fine squirt gun . To be sure , she had asked him not to use the water from the goldfish globe ; but he just would . Also he 'd insisted on locking all the servants downstairs , and when she tried to amuse him in other ways he 'd tied her to the chair . But it was just Hadley 's innocent fun . He had n't harmed anyone , even if he did squirt a little water on the postman and a delivery boy . She had not minded it herself , and no one had been rude to him until I 'd come chasing in and handled him so rough . That was an outrage , and Martha thought I ought to get a life sentence for it . " Humph ! " says Zenobia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what have you got to say ? " " Ah , what 's the use ? " says I. " You 've got the whole story now . I 'd do the same again . " " Relying on the fact that your uncle is a police captain ? " says she . " Nah , " says I. " That was hot air . " " There , Zenobia ! " says Martha . " I told you he was a bad boy . " " Are you ? " says Zenobia . " Well , " says I , " that all depends on how you size me up . I ai n't in the crook class , nor I do n't wear any Sunday-school medals , either . " " Who are you ? " says she . " Why , just Torchy , " says I. " See -- torch , Torchy , " and I points to my sunset coiffure . " But who are your parents ? " she goes on . " Do n't own any , " says I. " I 'm a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you live ? " says she . " Why , " says I , " I do n't live anywhere just now . I 'm movin ' ; but I do n't know where to . " " I suppose that is either impudence or epigram , " says she ; " but never mind . Perhaps you will tell me where you work ? " " I do n't work at all , " says I. " I 'm head office boy for the Corrugated Trust , and it 's a cinch job . " " Indeed ! " says she . " The Corrugated Trust ? Let me see , who is at the head of that concern ? " " Say , " says I , " you do n't mean you never heard of Old Hickory Ellins or Mr. Robert , do you ? " She kind of smiles at that ; but dodges makin ' any answer . " Well , " says I , " do I get pinched , or just given the run ? Either way , I 've got some baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . " " Why , certainly , I will have it --  --  " then she stops and looks me over sort of shrewd . " Suppose , " she starts in again , " you go and get it yourself ? " " Sure ! " says I , and it ai n't until I 'm outside that I sees this is just her way of tryin ' me out ; for I has a fine chance to beat it . " Nix ! " thinks I. " I might as well see this thing through and get a decision . " So back I goes with the suitcase and laundry bag . She had n't even followed me to the door . " Ah ! " says she , lookin ' up . " You were n't afraid to come back , then . Why ? " " Oh , I guess it was because I banked on your givin ' me a square deal , " says I. That gets a grin out of her . " Thank you very much for the compliment , " says she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I should like to have you remain a little longer , if you care to . Wo n't you leave your things in the hall there ? Your hat and overcoat too . " " Zenobia , " says Martha , wakin ' up , " surely you are not going to --  --  " " Precisely , " says Zenobia . " I am going to ask him to stay for dinner with us . Will you ? " " Yep ! " says I. " I never let any free eats get by me . " " But , " gasps Martha , " you do n't know who he is ? " " Neither does he know us , " says Zenobia . " Torchy , I am Mrs. Zenobia Preble . This is my sister , Miss Martha Hadley . She is very good , I am very wicked , and we are both women of mature years . You will probably find our society rather dull ; but the dinner is likely to be fairly good . Besides , I am feeling somewhat indebted to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , " if I can have a chance to wash up first . " " Of course , " says she . Then she gives me a key and directions how to find a certain door on the third floor . " My son 's quarters , " she goes on , " that I have kept just as he left them twenty years ago . I shall expect you to make yourself quite at home there . " Do I ? Why , say , it 's a back joint such as you might dream about : two rooms and bath across the front of the house , guns and swords and such knickknacks on the walls , a desk , a lot of books , and even a bathrobe and slippers laid out . Say , while I was scrubbin ' off some of the inkstains and smoothin ' down my hair with the silver-backed brushes I felt like a young blood gettin ' ready for a party . Then after awhile I strolls down to the lib'ry and makes myself to home some more . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice pictures on the wall , and no end of bookshelves . The old ladies has cleared out , not even lockin ' up any of the curios or sendin ' a maid to watch me . And when it comes to the feed -- why , say , it 's a reg'lar course dinner , such as you 'd put up a dollar for at any of these high-class table dotty ranches . Funny old china they had too , and a big silver coffeepot right on the table . The only bad break I makes is just at the start , when I dives into the soup without noticin ' that Aunt Martha has her head down and is mumblin ' something about bein ' thankful . " Never mind , " says Mrs. Preble . " We are n't included in this , anyway . " That begins the talk . I ai n't put through the wringer , you understand , but just follows Zenobia while she goes from one thing to another , givin ' her opinions of ' em and now and then callin ' for mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile she stops to laugh real hearty , though I could n't see where I 'd got off any crack at all . Near as I can make out , Zenobia is a lively old girl for her age . She 's seen all the best Broadway shows , knows what 's goin ' on in town , and reads the papers reg'lar . Also it comes out that she do n't follow the kind of programme you generally look for antiques to stick to . She ai n't got any use for churches , charity institutions , society , or the suffragettes . All of which seems to shock Sister Martha , who do n't say much , but only shudders now and then . " You see , Torchy , " says Zenobia , droppin ' two lumps into her demitasse , " I am an unbeliever . I do n't even believe in growing old . When I hear of other persons who have come to disbelieve in established things , no matter what , I send for them and find out all about it across the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness knows what . We denounce things , from the existing social order , to the tariff on stockings . My sister , who believes in everything as it is , usually takes a nap and snores . " " Zenobia ! " says Martha . " Oh , not in a disturbing way , " says Zenobia . " And I 'm sure I almost do the same whenever your friend the rector is here . Torchy , have you ever been talked to about your soul ? " " Once when I drifted into a mission a guy sprung that on me , " says I. " Yes ? " says Zenobia . " What then ? " " I told him to go chase himself , " says I. Hearty chuckles from Zenobia , while Sister Martha turns pale and gasps . Next thing I know I 'm tellin ' Mrs. Preble about my fallin ' out with Mother Sykes , and how I guess I 'd better be pikin ' up to engage a thirty-cent room until I can draw on my reserve and locate a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guess that conversation leads up to ? Well , it struck me all in a heap at the time , though I did n't let on ; but I could n't figure out the answer until I 'd had a talk with Mr. Robert next day . " Say , Mr. Robert , " says I. " You do n't happen to know an old party by the name of Zenobia Preble , do you ? " " I do , " says he . " It is n't exactly an accident , either . She is a cousin of my father . " " Gee ! " says I. " Cousin to the old -- to the boss ! Wh-e-ew ! " " Rather an original old lady , Zenobia , " says Mr. Robert . " And I understand , from a talk I had with her over the ' phone early last evening , that she was arbitrating the case of a young man who was in some danger of arrest in her home . How did it come out , Torchy ? " " Ah , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " Well , it was a verdict for the defense , because I promised to do it again if I ever got the chance . " Mr. Robert grins . " That grandson of hers is certainly a holy terror , " says he . " You and Zenobia parted friends , then ? " " Not yet , " says I. " We ai n't parted at all . I 'm stayin ' as a trial boarder . " " What ! " says he , sittin ' up . " Oh , I see . An experiment in practical sociology , eh ? " " Maybe that 's it , " says I. " Anyway , it depends on whether or not I can stand Aunt Martha . " And when I leaves Mr. Robert he still has his mouth open . CHAPTER XIII FIRST AID FOR THE MAIN STEM Well , I ai n't been adopted yet ; but it 's the next thing to it . Me and Zenobia are gettin ' to understand each other better every day . And , say , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lots of folks I know who ai n't lived half so long . Maybe she did do her first travelin ' up and down Broadway in a horse stage ; but that ai n't the way she wants to cover the ground now . What do you think she springs at the dinner table the other night ? Says she 's goin ' to the next aviation meet and hire some one to take her up for an aeroplane ride . " Why , Zenobia ! " says Sister Martha , so shocked her white frizzes almost stand up and wiggle . That 's Martha 's cue , all right . She do n't seem to get used to Zenobia 's ways , although they 've been livin ' together all these years . A genuine , consistent antique , Sister Martha is , who still likes to talk about the time when Horace Greeley ran for President . Accordin ' to her conversation the last real sensation that came her way was when she went over to Brooklyn and heard Henry Ward Beecher preach . But even Martha ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a harmless , well meanin ' old soul , and I 'm ' most beginnin ' to believe she 's pretty near as pious as she thinks she is . Anyway , it ai n't any Sunday pose with her . She lugs her religion right through the week , holidays and all , and spreads it around even . I got it straight from Zenobia that Martha 's even begun ringin ' me into her goodnight prayers , along with the cook and the President . Also Martha has started in on what she calls my moral trainin ' , which she dopes out as havin ' been neglected somethin ' shameful . Whenever Zenobia ai n't around to interrupt , I get a Jonah story , or a Sampson and Delilah hair cuttin ' yarn pumped into me , and if there ai n't any cogs missin ' in her scheme I ought to be buddin ' a soul before long . " Torchy , " says she real solemn the other night , " I hope you do not use profane language . Do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on the Sunday editor 's door I did used to think I could put over a few gingery ones ; but since I 've been with the Corrugated Trust I 've kind of got out of practice . " " Ah ! " says she , beamin ' . " That is good , very good ! Your associations are better ; is that it ? " " Mainly it 's on account of Mr. Ellins , " says I. " Maybe you never happened to hear him ; but , say , you ought to be there some mornin ' when he limps in with the gout in both feet and a hang-over grouch from the day before ! Cuss ! Why , after listenin ' to him grow real enthusiastic once , I got discouraged . What 's the use ? thinks I. " Well , someway that gives Martha an awful jolt ; for maybe you remember my tellin ' how it turns out that her and Zenobia are second cousins to Old Hickory . She says how she 's pained and mortified beyond words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him use such language . " Ah , that 's all right , " says I. " As long as it ai n't fired at ' em , nobody feels bad . Mostly they grins , except now and then a new lady typewriter who squirms and turns pale . He do n't whisper when he 's cussin ' , Mr. Ellins do n't . " " Shocking ! " says Sister Martha . " Does -- does he do this often ? " " It all depends on how he 's feelin ' , " says I ; " but for the past week or ten days he 's been at it pretty reg'lar . I expect he 's been havin ' a worse siege than usual . " Oh , me and Martha had a real heart to heart talk that night , and when I fin'lly goes up to my top floor suite I leaves her fannin ' herself and gaspin ' for breath . But she 'd asked for facts , and I 'd handed ' em over . How was I to guess what was goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more'n instructions about some errand or other , I ai n't any disturbed when Piddie comes up to the gate desk right after lunch next day , lookin ' as stern and solemn as if he 'd been sent to read a warrant . " Boy , " says he , " Mr. Ellins , senior , wishes to see you in his private office ! " " Well , that ai n't surprisin ' , is it , Piddie ? " says I. " You do n't suppose we can talk over big affairs like ours out here , do you ? Keep your ear off the keyhole , too ! " And with that I goes in chipper and cheerful . The minute I gets through the last door , though , I feels the frost in the air . Mr. Ellins , he lets me wait long enough for the chill to strike in , while he signs a basketful of letters . Then he swings around in his swivel chair and proceeds to size me up through them gunmetal gray eyes of his . Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under a cold shower , all at once . " So , young man ! " says he . " You have been hearing me swear , eh ? " That 's enough for me . Just from that I can sketch the whole plot . And it do n't take me a month to figure out the line of talk I 'm goin ' to use . What 's the sense in playin ' for time when your blue ticket 's all made out . " Heard you ? " says I. " Think I wear my ears full of putty ? " " Huh ! " he grunts . " And do I understand that you disapprove of my profanity ? " " Ah , who 's been fillin ' you up ? " says I. " Why , you 're an artist at it . " " Thanks , " says he . " And I suppose you felt it your duty to inform my relatives of the fact ? Very thoughtful of you , I 'm sure . " " Do n't mention it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says he , his cheeks gettin ' purple and puffy . " Ah , do n't mind the frills , " says I. " Get out the can . I 'm fired , ai n't I ? " " No ! " he shouts , bangin ' his fist down on the desk . " At least , not until I get through with you . What I want to know is why in blue belted blazes you did it ! " " Well , " says I , " first off I guess it just naturally slipped out ; then , when I saw what a hit I was makin ' with Martha -- why , I expect I sort of enjoyed givin ' her the details . " Somehow , that seems to graze his funnybone , and he has a struggle to keep a grin out of his mouth corners . " Humph ! " says he . " I -- I 'd like to have seen her then . So you went on to describe the general state of my health , did you ? " " It was you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascinating topic , I 've no doubt , " he growls ; " but I hardly appreciate the attention . Understand ? " " That 's breakin ' on me gradual , " says I. " Fortunately for you , though , " he goes on , " you did n't attempt to lie out of it . By the way , why did n't you ? " " And her just after givin ' you the whole game over the ' phone ? " says I. " Ah , say ! " " Young man , " says he , shootin ' over the quizzin ' gaze , " either you are too blickety blinked fresh to keep , or else you 're too keen to lose ; hanged if I know which ! But -- er -- well , I 'll take a chance . You may go out and report to Mr. Piddie for duty . " " It 'll near break his heart , " says I. It does , too . I expect from what he 'd heard in the private office that he was figurin ' on handin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' that he knew all along it was comin ' to me . Then there 'd be a rollcall of new office boys , with him pickin ' out one more to his taste than me . But no such luck for him . " Cheer up , Piddie , " says I. " I 'll have the warden send you an invitation when they fin'lly get me right . " Course , I do n't make any squeal at the house about my narrow escape ; for I knew Martha only meant it for the best . Next day Mr. Ellins do n't show up at the office at all , and that evenin ' Martha is better posted on his condition than I am . She 's been busy on the wire again , this time locatin ' him at home . " My poor cousin , " says she , " is in a wretched state . He has been overworking , I fear , and seems to be a nervous wreck . That will account , I have no doubt , for his recent lapses into profanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should make allowances . What he needs is rest and quiet . Luckily , I happened to know just the place for him and was able to persuade him to go there at once . He started this afternoon . " It 's called the Wesley Restorium , Martha says , and is run by an old friend of hers who used to be a missionary doctor in China . He 's an awfully good man , and she 's sure he 'll help Mr. Ellins a lot . Besides , his place is only about fifty miles off , over in North Jersey ; so Mr. Ellins could make the run easy in his limousine . Well , that leaves only Mr. Robert , Piddie , and me to manage the Corrugated , and we was all bearin ' up under the load well enough except Piddie ; when along about two o'clock there 's a long distance call from the Main Stem , and a few minutes later Mr. Robert sends out for me . " Torchy , " says he , " you seem to be elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says I. " Yes , " says Mr. Robert . " I do n't exactly understand why . He is at a sanatorium , you know , and we had arranged to send up his private secretary with the important mail this afternoon ; but he says he wants you . Says you 're responsible for his being there -- whatever that means . " " I 'm on , " says I. " When do I start ? " There 's a train at three-thirty-four ; so that gives me time to chase around to the house after a grip , then back to the office to gather up a bundle of late letters , and pike for Jersey City . And at that it 's five o'clock before I 'm landed at a little flag station umpteen miles beyond nowhere . My ! but the north end of Jersey has some up and down to it , though ! From what I 'd heard I thought the State was all meadows ; but here I am carted in a four-horse bus up the side of a hill that 's twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw so much country spread out all at once before -- nothing but hills and trees , and no signs of houses anywhere . Made me so blamed lonesome lookin ' at it that I had to shut my eyes for a spell . And when we gets to the top there 's a big shack like a new set of car barns , with hundreds of windows , and big wide veranda all around . It looks as homy and cheerful as the Art Museum . The lawn is full of rocks and stumps , and the few little flowerbeds that have been laid out looked lost and homesick . Pacin ' up and down the verandas , like animals in a cage , was about fifty people , and over at one end , all by himself , looms up Old Hickory , lookin ' big and ugly and disgusted with life . " Well ! " he growls . " So you got here , eh ? Hope you like it as well as I do . Bring that mail inside . " While he 's more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous wreck than usual . I take it that he was some tired when he got up here night before ; but that he cut out dinner and turned in for a good twelve-hour snooze instead . Then he 's had a quiet day , and I judge he was a lot better already . He 's just got well into his letters , when an attendant guy in a white duck uniform steps in and taps him on the shoulder . " Well ? " says Old Hickory . " Vesper service is beginning in the chapel , sir , " says the gent . " Let it begin , then , " says Mr. Ellins . " But , " says the gent , " it is usual for guests to --  --  " " It is n't for me ! " snaps Mr. Ellins . " You get out ! " And the gent got out . We could hear ' em singin ' hymns and so on for half an hour ; but Mr. Ellins keeps right on goin ' through his mail and makin ' notes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank heaven ! Dinner ! " says he . " Come on , Torchy ; I 'm hungry enough to eat a bale of hay ! " Then he 's hardly got into his chair in the dinin ' room before he 's snapping his fingers for a waiter . " Hey ! " he sings out . " Bring me a dry Martini right away , and a pint of Chateau Yquem with the fish . " " Excuse me , " says the waiter , " but there is n't anything like that on the bill of fare . If it 's something to drink you want , you can order buttermilk , which is extra . " " Buttermilk ! " snorts Old Hickory . " Say , where 's the proprietor ? Send him over here ! " He did n't have to call him twice ; for the boss of the Restorium had heard the row and was glidin ' our way as fast as his rubber heels would let him . He 's a short legged , pop eyed , red faced party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Albert , and a minister 's necktie . " Gently , gently , " says he , pattin ' the air with his hands and puckering his mouth . " Remember to speak softly in the dining room . " " All right , Doc , " says Mr. Ellins ; " but I want a cocktail . " " Tut , tut , brother ! " says the Doc , liftin ' a warnin ' finger and raisin ' his eyebrows . " No intoxicating liquors served here , you know . Now a glass of nice buttermilk is just what --  --  " " Bah ! Buttermilk ! " snorts Hickory . " Think I come from a dairy ? " The Doc does his best to soothe him down and fin'lly persuades him to tackle his mutton broth without the Martini . It 's a good enough feed ; but kind of plain , about what you 'd get in one of these Eighth-ave. joints , four courses for thirty-five cents . Mr. Ellins gets left again when he calls for a demitasse after the tapioca pudding . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grunts . " I suppose I may smoke , eh ? " " On the north veranda , from seven until eight-fifteen , " says the waiter . " Well , I 'll be -- blistered ! " says Old Hickory . While he 's burnin ' a couple of black perfectos out on the smoke reservation , I roams around the Restorium . It 's furnished neat and simple , with lots of varnished woodwork and a few framed railroad photos on the walls . In the parlor was four or five groups of women in rockin ' chairs , talkin ' low and doin ' fancy-work . Most of the men were tiptoein ' up and down the veranda . They was a stoop shouldered , dyspeptic lookin ' lot . Down in the basement in a place labeled " Recreation Room , " a couple of checker games was in progress , and four gents was shovin ' weights up and down the shuffleboard . Yes , it was a perfectly good place to be quiet in . I could guess why Hickory Ellins had begun to show signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marchin ' in and up to the office desk . " Where 's the billiard room ? " says he . " There is no billiard room , brother , " says the Doc , steppin ' to the front . " Here we have eliminated all of those things that might disturb our beautiful peace and quiet . " " Have , eh ? " grunts Hickory . " Then where can I find three others to make up a bridge game ? " " Card playing , " says the Doc , putting his thumb and forefingers together , " is not allowed in the Restorium . " " Sorrowing sisters by the sea ! " remarks Mr. Ellins . " No billiards ! No cards ! Say , what the merry Mithridates do you think I 'm going to do with myself from now until twelve o'clock , eh ? " " By referring to the rules of this establishment , Mr. Ellins , " says the Doc , speakin ' cold and reprovin ' , " you will see that the general retiring hour is fixed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ! " roars Hickory . " Think you 're going to put me to bed at nine-thirty ? " " You are at liberty to sit up in the dark , if you choose , " the Doc comes back at him . " Any guest who is dissatisfied with the manner in which the Restorium is conducted has the option of leaving . " " Well , say ! " says Mr. Ellins , thumpin ' the desk earnest , " I am dissatisfied ! Buttermilk and vesper services ! Huh ! Do you suppose I 've paid two weeks in advance for such a dose ? Where 's your ' phone ? " With that he calls up New York , gets his chauffeur on the wire , and orders him to have the car here first thing in the morning , even if he has to start before light . " And what is more , " says Mr. Ellins , walkin ' back to the Doc , " I propose to buy the rest of this hill and open a real live hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 'll be something going on in it all the time , if I have to make everything free , and you can bet your last dollar the wine list will have something besides buttermilk on it ! There 'll be billiard tables , bowling alleys , a dance hall , and a brass band playing all night . I 'll fix your beautiful peace and quiet for you ! " The Doc , he smiles a kind of sanctified smile and points to the clock . " In just forty-five minutes , " says he , " the lights go out . " That 's all the satisfaction Mr. Ellins gets , too ; so he takes me in tow and we beat it ' steen times around the verandas , him stating his opinions of restoriums in general , Cousin Martha in partic'lar , and now and then shootin ' a sarcastic remark at me . But when he sees the other victims begin sneakin ' off one by one he growls out : " Well , son , I suppose they 'll be locking us out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rooms . " First off I thought I could have a great snooze ; but it 's such a blamed quiet place that I found myself wide awake , with my ear strained to see if I could n't hear something . After an hour or so of that , I gets up and sits by the open window ; but as there ai n't any moon or any street lights , it 's like starin ' down a coalhole . I was wondering if the country was always as black as that at night , and what would happen to anyone that strayed out into it , when all of a sudden I hears a window raised , and way down in the basement under the dining room I sees a bright light shinin ' out . " Hello ! " thinks I. " Some of the help must be bustin ' the rules and regulations . " By leanin ' out and rubberin ' I could look down into the room . And , say , the shock almost tumbled me out . For there 's the Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green topped table decorated with stacks of chips . The Doc is just dealin ' , and before the shade is pulled down again I had time to see him reach under the lower deck and haul up a decanter that might have been full of cold tea . Well , say , I do n't do a thing but hustle into my clothes and chase down the corridor to Mr. Ellins ' room . Is he int'rested in the tale ? He 's all of that . " Torchy , " says he , " if you can lead me down to that game , I -- I 'll forgive you . Perhaps I 'll do better than that . " I used up half a box of matches findin ' the way ; but at last we located the light comin ' through the transom . " Good work ! " he whispers . " Now you go back to bed and enjoy a long night 's rest . " Sure I did -- not . I would n't have missed hearin ' that exchange of happy greetin 's for a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryin ' to explain things was somethin ' lovely . He was gettin ' himself as twisted as a pretzel , when Old Hickory breaks in . " That 's all right , Doc , " says he . " Innocent little relaxation . I understand perfectly . Now , what 's the ante ? " Well , after that the conversation was n't so excitin ' ; nothing but , " I 'll take three cards , " or " Raise you two more blues . " So I sneaks back and falls into the hay once more . At breakfast Mr. Ellins shows up more smilin ' and chipper than I 'd ever seen him anywhere before . He puts away three soft boiled eggs , a couple of lamb chops , and two cups of coffee made special for him . The Doc he follows us out to the limousine . " Sorry to have you go so soon , Mr. Ellins , " says he , rubbin ' one hand over the other , " very sorry indeed , sir . And -- er -- about those memoranda from my assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " Those I O U 's ? " says Mr. Ellins . " Oh , you tell the boys I tore ' em up . Yours , too , Doctor . I had my fun out of the game . So long . " And for the next four miles Old Hickory do n't do much but gaze out on the landscape and chuckle . " Was that a bluff about buildin ' that hotel ? " says I after awhile . " Well , " says Mr. Ellins , " not exactly ; but I think I shall present the Restorium with a pipe organ instead . " CHAPTER XIV IN ON THE OOLONG Course it was a cinch ; but Piddie ai n't got done wonderin ' yet how I did it . I can tell that by the puzzled way he has of lookin ' me over when he thinks I ai n't noticin ' . You see , we 'd been havin ' a quiet week at the Corrugated . This fine spell of weather has braced Old Hickory up until he almost forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things must have been runnin ' smooth , too ; for he can even read about the Return from Elba plans without chuckin ' the mornin ' paper into the waste basket and gettin ' purple behind the ears . Then , all of a sudden here the other afternoon , Piddie comes trottin ' out of the private office all flustered up and begins pawin ' excited through the big bond safe . He 's hardly got started at that before there comes three rings on the buzzer for him , and he trots back to see what the old man wants now . Next there are hurry calls for the general auditor and the head of the contract department , and before Mr. Ellins gets through he 's had every chief in the shop up on the carpet and put ' em through the third degree . Way out by my gate I could hear him layin ' down the law to ' em , and they comes out lookin ' wild and worried . Which do n't get me excited any at all . I worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editions go to press for that . So when I hears him yell for me I do n't jump over the desk and get goose flesh up the back . I keeps right on snappin ' rubber bands at the spring water bottle until he 's shouted a couple more times . Then I winks at the row of lady typists and strolls in , calm and easy . " Yes , sir ? " says I. " See here , boy ! " says he . " Do you happen by any chance to know where that son of mine might be found at this moment ? " " Mr. Robert ? " says I. " Nix . " " No , of course you do n't ! " says Old Hickory , glarin ' at me . " No one around this precious asylum for undeveloped cerebellums seems to know anything they ought to . Bah ! " " Yes , sir , " says I. " Do n't grin at me that way ! " he snaps . " Get out ! No , stay where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where do you think he might be found ? " " Tried any of his clubs ? " says I. He had , all of ' em . Also he 'd had him paged through four hotel grill rooms and called up three brokers ' offices . " Well , if he ai n't havin ' a late lunch , or playin ' billiards , or watchin ' the stock board , I give it up , " says I. " Maybe you 've noticed that Mr. Robert ai n't been in many afternoons lately . " " Huh ! Perhaps I have n't , though ! " grunts Old Hickory . " But this time it is important that he should be here . Young man , you seem to have less wool on your wits than most of the office force ; so I am going to confide to you that unless we find Robert before four-thirty o'clock this afternoon the Corrugated Trust Company will lose a lot of money . " " Oh , if it 's a case of savin ' the next dividend , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you asked for him at the house ? " " He was there at one-fifteen and left twenty minutes later , " says Mr. Ellins . " Yes ; but what kind of clothes was he wearin ' ? " says I. " Clothes ! " snorts out Old Hickory . " What the blithering --  --  " " Lemme ask his man , " says I , grabbin ' the desk ' phone . " Plaza -- yes , Plaza , double O double three sixty-one . Sure ! You got it . Say , Mr. Ellins , that butler of yours do n't burn the carpet movin ' fast , does he ? He must --  -- Hello ! I want to talk to Walters . Ah , never mind who I am , switch him on ! " And inside of two minutes I have the report . " Frock coat and silk lid , " says I. " See ? Society date . " " Huh ! " says the old man . " That settles it . He 's tagging around after that young lady violinist again . Might have guessed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken about as much interest in business as a cat does in astronomy . But to-morrow morning we'll --  --  " " Say , " I breaks in , " if it 's a case of young lady , why not locate her and then scout for Mr. Robert in the neighborhood ? That ought to be easy . " " Think so ? " says he . " Well , young man , you have my permission to tackle the job . Her name is Inez Webster . I do n't know where she lives , or with whom she 's staying ; but she 's somewhere in New York . Now , how will you begin ? " " By rubberin ' at Mr. Robert 's date pad , " says I. " Good ! " says Old Hickory . " No one else thought of that , " and he leads the way in and unlocks Mr. Robert 's rolltop . " Now what do those scratches mean ? " " I. W. 2:15 , " says I , readin ' it off . " The arrow points to Inez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever that is ! " growls Mr. Ellins . " Go on . " " Say , lemme think a minute , " says I , slippin ' into the swing chair and doin ' the Sherlock gaze at the desk . " Oh , certainly ! " says he , snappy and sarcastic . " Take a nap over it ! Plenty of time ! " and with that he pads back into his office and slams the door . Now I did n't like pawin ' through the pigeon-holes or drawers ; but when I happens to glance at the waste basket I feels more at home . In a jiffy I has it dumped on the rug . There was an empty cigarette box , the usual collection of circulars , a dozen torn business letters , and so on . It looked like a hopeless hunt , too , until I runs across this invitation card announcin ' that the Misses Pulsifer will be at home from two-fifteen until five-thirty . There 's a Fort Washington Road address , and down in one corner it says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoop ! " says I , stowin ' away the card . " Me for the Misses Pulsifers ' on a long shot . Hey , Mr. Ellins ! " I shouts , stickin ' my head in the door . " Can I draw two bones for expense money ? I 'm on the trail . " " The blazes you are ! " says he . " Yep , " says I. " Mebbe it 's a false scent ; but if I find him what 's the message ? " " Just ask Robert , " says he , " if it has occurred to him that those P. K. &; Q. contract copies have got to be filed with the bonding company this afternoon . That 's all . " " Right ! " says I. " P. K. &; Q. contracts . I 'm off . " Ever get as far up into the northwest corner of the island as Fort Washington Road ? Then you know how many blocks it is from the nearest subway station . Not havin ' time for a half-hour stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 157th , hunts up a taxi , and turns down the red flag . " Now do n't try zigzaggin ' around to roll up mileage , " says I to the shuffer ; " but beat it straight there . " Some swell places up in that neck of Manhattan , what ? Why , some of them folks has so much back yard they keep their own cow . When we rolls in through a pair of big stone gates I begin to suspect that the Misses Pulsifers was lady plutes for fair , and the size of the house had me stunned . " I 'm swell lookin ' front door comp'ny , I am , " thinks I , handin ' over a dollar thirty to the taxi pirate and paradin ' in across the red carpet . " Now what is it I tell the butler when he pushes out his tray ? " All the guard they has on the door , though , is a French maid , and when she starts to look me over suspicious I shoves the invitation card at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where 's the doin 's ? " " Pardon ? " says she . " What you wish ? " " Ah , where do they keep the music ? " says I. " Ze musicale ? " says she . " It is commence . S-s-s-sh ! " and she points down the hallway . " Yes , I was afraid I 'd be late , " says I. " Glad they did n't wait . I 'll sneak into a back seat . " Did I ? Well , say , I did n't know what I was runnin ' into ; for as I pushes through some draperies I finds myself on the side lines of the biggest herd of girls I ever saw collected in one room before . Why , there was rows and rows of ' em , all in white dresses , and the minute I steps in about two hundred pairs of eyes revolves my way . Talk about jumpin ' into the limelight ! I felt like I 'd wandered out on the stage while the big scene was goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elbows of passin ' the nudge along . They all forgets what 's doin ' up on the platform by the piano and pays strict attention to me . Blush ? Say , I 'll bet my ears ai n't got back their reg'lar color yet ! Seemed like my feet was stuck to the floor , too . Maybe it was an hour I stood there , and maybe it was only a minute ; but at last I takes one wild look around over that girl convention and then I backs out . I 'd seen him , though . Way over by an open window on the other side was Mr. Robert , one of the four men in that whole crowd . So out the front door I rushes and then tiptoes around the veranda until I came to him . And he wa' n't gazin ' around watchin ' for casual butters-in . Not Mr. Robert ! All he 's seein ' is the slim young lady standin ' up on the platform with the violin tucked under her chin . You could n't blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any judge of the sort of music she was teasin ' out of the strings , I 'll say this much : The way she was doin ' it was well worth watchin ' . The swing of that elbow of hers , and the Isadora Duncan sway of her shoulders as she hits the high notes sure did have some class to it . He 's so busy followin ' her motions that he do n't even know when I leans in within six inches of him and whispers . So I has to give him the gentle prod . " Eh ! " says he , whirlin ' around . " Why , what the -- Torchy ! " " Uh-huh , " says I. " Crawl out backwards , ca n't you ? " " Wha -- what 's that ! " says he , whisperin ' sort of husky . " You got to do it , " says I. " I was sent up special to get you . " " Why , what 's the matter ? " says he . " P. K. &; Q. contracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " By Jove , no ! " he groans under his breath . " I -- I forgot . " " Then it 's a case of beat it , " says I. " But -- but I ca n't ! " says Mr. Robert . " I ca n't possibly leave now , right in the middle of --  --  " " That 's so , " says I. " She 's lookin ' this way now . But where 'd you stow the contracts ? Remember that , do you ? " " Why , of course , " says he . " Third left hand drawer of my desk , in a document box . " " ' S enough ! " says I. " I 'll ' phone down and tell ' em . They 'll fix it up . Do n't move ; she 's lookin ' your way again . " " Wait ! " says he , behind his hand . " I must see you before you go back , after the concert is over . Wait for me in the garden . " " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with that I slides back to the front entrance and gets Marie to lead me to the ' phone booth . Well , I 'd got the joint all sized up now . It 's one of these swell boardin ' schools for girls , where they take piano lessons and are exposed to French and the German measles . And , now my knees has quit wabblin ' and I was safe out of the hall , I was almost glad I 'd come up and give the young ladies such a treat . I could n't help admirin ' Mr. Robert 's nerve , though ; for he must have known what he was lettin ' himself in for when he follows Inez up there . But when they get it that bad there 's no tellin ' how reckless they 'll be . If it had been all the same to Mr. Robert , my next move would have been to get away from the spot as quick as my feet would let me ; but so long as he 'd assigned me a waiting part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's help I finds the garden out at the back of the house and makes myself comf'table on a rustic seat . It 's a flossy garden scene , all right , with winding paths , and flowerbeds , and cute little summer houses , and all sorts of bushes in bloom . Now and then I could hear music driftin' ' out , and when a piece was through the hand clappin ' would commence , like a shower on a tin roof . Say , it had sittin ' behind the brass rail in the office beat to a froth , and I was enjoyin ' it , lazy and comf'table , with my feet up on the bench and my head back ; when all at once there 's a big spasm of applause , the doors openin' ' on the back veranda are swung open , everybody starts chatterin ' together , there 's a swish and a rustle and a clatter of high heels ; and the next thing I knew the whole blamed garden was full of ' em . Girls ! Say , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , thin ones , plump ones , and plain fatties . There was aristocratic brunettes , and dimpled blondes , and every shade between . They ranged from fourteen up , and they sported all kinds of hair dressin ' , from double pleated braids to the latest thing in turban swirls . And there was little Willie , hemmed in by a twelve-foot wall on three sides and solid squads of girls on the fourth ! First they began sailin ' by in groups of twos and threes and fours , all givin ' me the goo-goo stare and snickerin ' . Honest , you 'd thought I was some kind of a humorous curiosity , specially exhibited for the occasion . Ai n't they the limit , though ? And the whispered remarks they passed ! " Why , Madge ! Are n't you just killing ! Whose brother did you say you thought --  -- Yes , and so curly , too ! " I try to forget that red thatch of mine most of the time ; but this was no place to practice bein ' absent minded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my hat on or left it off , they were wise to the ruddy hair . All I could do was to squeeze myself into one corner of the seat and pretend not to notice ' em . What I wanted most was to stand up and holler for Mr. Robert . Why in blazes did n't he show up , anyway ? I 'd been enjoyin ' this gen'ral inspection stunt for four or five minutes , when maids begun circulatin ' among the mob with trays of sandwiches and plates of chicken salad , and every last one of ' em stopped at my station . " No , thanks , " says I. Think I wanted to give a food destroyin ' performance before an audience like that ? I was just wavin ' away the fourth offer of picnic grub when I hears a little squeal come from a bunch of new recruits , and when I looks up to see what 's happening now -- well , you 'd never guess . It 's Miss Vee ! You know , the pink and white queen I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' class where I subbed for Izzie in the cloakroom and was invited out to join the merry throng . She ai n't got the ballroom costume on , of course ; but I 'd know them big gray eyes and that straw colored hair and that sweet pea complexion in any disguise . For a second she stands there gazin ' at me sort of surprised and puzzled , like she did n't know whether to give me the nod or just put up her chin and sail by . If I could I 'd looked the other way , so 's to give her a chance to duck recognizin ' me ; but I could n't do anything but stare back . And the next thing I knew she 's comin ' straight for me . " Why , Torchy ! " says she , sort of purry and confidential . " You ! " And blamed if she wa' n't holdin ' out both hands . Well , say , you ca n't imagine what a diff'rence that makes to me . It was like fallin ' off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I care for that push of young lady fluffs then ? " Sure thing , it 's me , " says I , grabbin ' the hands before she could change her mind . " Say , have a seat , wo n't you , Miss Vee ? " " Oh , then you have n't forgotten ? " says she . " Me ? Forget ? " says I. " Say , Miss Vee , I 'll keep right on rememberin ' that spiel we had together until breathin ' goes out of fashion -- and then some ! Gee ! but I 'm glad you happened along ! " " But how is it , " says she , " that you --  --  " " Special commission , " says I. " I 'm waitin ' here for Mr. Robert Ellins . " " Oh ! " says she . " And have you had some salad and sandwiches ? " " No ; but I 'm ready for ' em now , " says I. " That is , if --  -- Say , you do n't mind doin ' this , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she . " Oh , well , " says I , " you see I ain't -- well , I 'm kind of outclassed here , and I did n't know but some of the other girls might --  --  " " Let them dare ! " says Miss Vee , straightenin ' up and glancin ' around haughty . My ! but she 's a thoroughbred ! There was one group standin ' a little way off watchin ' us ; but that look of Miss Vee 's scattered ' em as though she 'd turned the hose on them . Next minute she was smilin ' again . " You see , " she goes on , sittin ' close , " I 'm not much afraid . " " You 're a hummer , you are ! " says I , lookin ' her over approvin ' . " There , there ! " says she . " I see that you must have something to eat right away . Here , Hortense ! There ! Now you 'll have a cup of tea , wo n't you ? " " Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " even to tea . " It was my first offense in the oolong line , and , honest , I could n't tell now how it tasted ; but I knew all about how Vee handles a cup and saucer , though , and the way she has of lookin ' at you over the rim . Say , she 's the only girl I ever knew who could talk more'n a minute to a feller without the aid of giggles . There 's some sense to what she has to say , too , and all the way you can tell whether she 's joshin ' or not is by watchin ' her eyes . And me , I wa' n't losin ' any tricks . She tells me all about how she 's been to school here ever since she was a little girl . Seems she 's as shy on parents as I am ; but she has an aunt that she lives with between school terms . This is her finishin ' year , and as soon as the final doin 's are over she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming back in September ? " says I. " Oh , no indeed ! " says she . " Perhaps not for two years . " " Gee ! " says I. " Well ? " says she , and I finds myself lookin ' square into them big gray eyes of hers . " Oh , nothing , " says I ; " only -- only it sounds a long ways off . And , say , you do n't happen to have a spare photo , do you , maybe one taken in that dress you wore the night of the ball ? " " Silly ! " says she . " But suppose I have ? " " Why , " says I ,  --  " why , I thought -- well , say , it would n't do any harm to leave my new address , would it ! That 's the number , care of Mrs. Zenobia Preble . " " Zenobia ! " says she . " Why , I know who she is . Do you live with --  --  " " I 'm half adopted already , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And say , Miss Vee --  --  " It was just about then I had the feelin ' that some one was tryin ' to butt in on this two-part dialogue of ours , and as I looks up , sure enough there 's Mr. Robert , with his eyes wide and his mouth half open , watchin ' us . " Well , it 's all over , " says I. " Mr. Robert 's waitin ' for me . Good luck and -- and --  -- Oh , what 's the use ? Give my regards to Europe , will you ? Good-by ! " And with that we shakes hands and I breaks away . " I do n't wish to seem curious , " says Mr. Robert , as we walks out to his cab , " but -- er -- is this something recent ? " " Not very , " says I. " We 've met before . " " Then allow me , " says he , " to congratulate you on your good taste . " " Thanks ! " says I. " Same to you ; and I ai n't got so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject there ; but Mr. Robert seems so pleased over something or other that we 'd gone twenty blocks before he remembers what brought me up . " Oh , by the way , " says he , " I suppose there 'll be no end of row about my forgetting to send down those contracts . The Governor was wild , was n't he ? " " He was wild , all right , " says I , " without knowin ' whether you 'd forgot ' em or not . " " But when you ' phoned him , " says Mr. Robert , " of course he --  --  " " Ah , say ! " says I. " Do I look like a trouble hunter ? I ' phoned Piddie -- told him to sneak ' em out , send ' em down , and keep his mouth shut . All you got to do is act innocent . " Never mind the hot air Mr. Robert passes out after that . What tickles me most is the package that came for me yesterday by messenger . I finds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ladies was on hand when I opens it . " Why , Torchy ! " says Aunt Martha , lookin ' at me shocked and scandalized . " A young lady 's picture ! " " Yep , " says I. " Ai n't she a dream , though ? " And , say , Martha 'd been lecturin ' me yet if it had n't been for Zenobia breakin ' in . " Do remember , Martha , " says she , " that you were not always sixty-three years old , and that once --  -- Why , bless me ! This must be Alicia Vernon 's child . Is there a name on the back ? There is ! Verona Ashton Hemmingway , heiress to all that is left of poor Dick 's fortune . She 's a beauty , just like her mother . " " She 's all of that , " says I. It did n't make any diff'rence to Aunt Martha who she was , though . She did n't think it right for young ladies to give away their pictures to young men . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Vee , and --  --  " There , now , Martha , " said Zenobia , " suppose we do n't . " That 's how it is I can guess who it was blew themselves for a corkin ' big silver frame , and put Vee 's picture in it , and stood it on my bureau . Course , Vee 's on her way to foreign parts now , and there 's no tellin ' when she 's comin ' back . Besides , there ai n't anything in it , anyway . But somehow that picture in the silver frame seems to help some . CHAPTER XV BATTING IT UP TO TORCHY Nobody had to point him out to me . I had n't been holdin ' down the chair behind the brass gate more'n two days before I knew who was the living joke on the Corrugated Trust Company 's force . It 's Uncle Dudley , of course . And , say , my coppin ' that out do n't go to prove I 'm a Mr. Cute . Any mush-head could have picked him after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number silk lid , and the white Chaunceys he wears on each side of his face . That get-up would be good for a quiet smile even over in Canarsie ; but when you come to plant it in the midst of such a sporty aggregation as the Corrugated carries on the payroll -- why , you 've got the comic chuckles comin ' over fast . " Say , Piddie , " says I the second morning , after watchin ' it blow in , " who 's the seed , eh ? " " That ? " says Piddie . " Oh , that 's old Dudley . " " Does he wear the uniform reg'lar , " says I , " or is he celebratin ' some anniversary ? " And Piddie almost allows himself to grin as he explains how that 's the same costume Dudley has come down to work in every day for the last fifteen years . " Well , it 's a flossy outfit , all right , " says I. " What is he , one of the directors ? " No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a salary of eighteen per . You know the kind -- one of these deadwood specimens that stand a show of gettin ' the prunin ' hook every time there 's a shake-up . Most every office has a few of ' em , hangin on like last year 's oak leaves in the park ; but it ai n't often they can qualify as comic supplements . Not that Uncle Dudley tries to be humorous . He 's the quietest , meekest old relic you ever saw , slidin ' in soft and easy with his hat off , and walkin ' almost as though he had his shoes in his hand . But the faded umbrella under one arm and the big buttonhole bouquet he always wears puts him in the joke book class without takin ' the face lambrequins into account at all . Can I let all that get by me without passin ' out some josh ? You can see me , ca n't you ? Never mind all the bright and cunnin ' remarks I sprung on Uncle Dudley now ; but for awhile there I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Why , it was a cinch ! All the comeback I ever got out of him , though , was that batty old smile of his , kind of sad and gentle , as if I was remindin ' him of times gone by . And there ai n't a lot of satisfaction in that , you know . Now , I can chuck the giddy persiflage at Piddie day in and day out , and enjoy doin ' it , because it always gets him so wild . Also there 's more or less thrill to slippin ' the gay retort across to Old Hickory Ellins now and then , because there 's a giddy chance of gettin ' fired for it . But to rub it into a non-resister like Uncle Dudley -- well , what 's the use ? So after awhile I cut it out altogether , leavin ' him for such amateur cut-ups as Izzy Budheimer and Flannel Haggerty to practice on . Then little by little me and old Dudley got more or less chummy , what with me steerin ' him around to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , we must have been a great pair , sittin ' side by side in the armchairs , puttin ' away sweitzer sandwiches and mugs of chickory blend ; him in his tall lid , and with his quiet , old timy manners , and me -- well , I guess you get the tableau . I used to like hearin ' him talk , he uses such a soothin ' , genteel brand of conversation ; nothing fancy , you know , but plain , straightaway goods . Mostly he tells me about his son , who 's livin ' out in California somewhere and is just branchin ' out in the cement block buildin ' business . Son is messin ' in politics more or less too ; mixin ' it up with the machine , and gettin ' the short end of the returns every trip . But it 's on account of this reform stunt of his that the old gent seems to be so proud of him , not appearin ' to care whether he ever got elected to anything or not . He do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in Jersey ; but I do n't think much about that until after I 've let him tow me over to dinner once and met Son in Law Bennett . He 's a flashy proposition , this young Mr. Bennett is , havin ' an interest in a curb brokerage firm that rents window space on Broad-st. and has desk room down on William . Let him tell it , though , and , providin ' some of his deals go through , he 's goin ' to have Morgan squealin ' for help before the year is out . And I find that at home Uncle Dudley is rated somewhere between the fam'ly cat and the front doormat . Mr. Bennett do n't exactly gag the old man and lock him in the cellar . He ignores him when he can , and when he has to notice him he makes it plain that he 's standin ' the disgrace as well as he can . " So you came over with the old sport , did you ? " says Bennett to me . " Batty old duffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long . Manages to hang on with the Corrugated , though , do n't he ? He 'd better , too ! I 'm not running any old folks ' home here . " But it wa' n't to show off how he stood with his son in law that Uncle Dudley had lugged me along . He 'd got so used to bein ' dealt out for a twospot that he did n't seem to mind . He did n't claim to be anything more even at the office . It 's his flower garden , out back of the house , that Uncle Dudley had got me ' way out there to see ; and , while I ai n't any expert on that line of displays , I should say this posy patch of his had some class to it . Anyway , seein ' it , and findin ' out how he rolls off the mattress at sunrise every mornin ' to tend it , lets me in for a new view of him . It 's this little garden patch and the son out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of Son in Law Bennett . " Say , Dudley , " says I , " why do n't you work a combination of the two ; go out where you can raise roses all winter , if the dope these railroad ads. sling out is straight , and be with your son too ? " " I -- I ca n't do that , just yet , " says he , sort of hesitatin ' . " You see , he has n't seen me for twelve years , and since then I have -- er -- well , I 've been slipping backward . He does n't know what a failure I 've made of life , and if I gave up here and went on to him -- why --  --  " " I 'm on , " says I. " He 'd spot you for one of the down-and-outers . But you do get it rubbed in here good and plenty , do n't you ? " " From Bennett ? " says he . " Oh , he is right , I suppose . He knows how useless I am . But we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stay at the bottom and prop the ladder . " One thing about Uncle Dudley , he had no whine comin ' . He takes it all meek and cheerful , and so far as I could make out he 's most as useful around the office as a lot of others that gets chesty whenever they think what would happen to the concern if they should be sick for a week . Anyway , there 's frequent calls for old Dudley to straighten out this or that ; but somehow he never seems to get credit for bein ' much more than a sort of a walkin ' copybook that remembers what other people do n't want to lumber up their valuable brains with . Maybe it 's the white mud guards , or his habit of lettin ' anyone boss him around , that keeps him down . And I expect things would have gone on that way , until he either dropped out or got the blue envelope some payday , if it had n't been for this lid liftin ' business up at Albany . Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grafters and then another , and fin'lly , with that last swipe of the muck rake , got the Corrugated rung into the mess ? And , say , anyone would think , from some of the papers , that we was all a bunch of crooks down here , spendin ' our time feedin ' wads of hundred-dollar bills to the yellow dog . Maybe it do n't stir up Mr. Robert some thorough , though ! " Why , " I heard him say to the old man , " it 's a beastly outrage , that 's what it is ! All the fellows at the club are chaffing me about it , you know . And besides it 's disturbing business frightfully . Look at the tumble our shares took yesterday ! I say , Governor , we must send out a denial . " " Huh ! " growls Old Hickory . " Who cares a blinkety blanked blank what they say we did ? Let ' em prove it ! " Then the next day them checks was sprung on the investigatin ' committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their case against the Corrugated . Perhaps there wa' n't doin 's on the seventeenth floor that mornin ' ! Clear out where I sat I could hear the boss callin ' for first one man and then another , and Piddie is turkeyin ' in and out so excited he do n't know whether he 's on duty or runnin ' bases . Once , when he stops to lean against the spring-water bottle and wipe his dewy brow , I slips up behind and taps him quick on the shoulder . " Ye-e-e-es , sir ! " says he , before he sees who it is . " Never mind , Piddie , " says I. " I was goin ' to ask you ' Guilty or not guilty ? ' But what 's the use ? Anyone can see it was you that did it . " " You -- you impudent young sauce box ! " he begins . " How dare you --  --  " " Ah , save that for the subpoena server , " says I. " He 'll be in here after you in a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get about ten years on the rockpile . " When the special directors ' meetin ' gets under way , though , and the big guns of the Corrugated law force got on the job , there was less noise and more electricity in the air . Honest , with all that tiptoein ' and whisperin ' and serious looks bein ' passed around , I did n't even have the gall to guy one of the new typewriter girls . Kind of gets on your nerves , a thing of that kind does , and if a squad of reserves had marched in and pinched the whole outfit , I should n't have been so much surprised . Right in the midst of it too there comes my three rings on the buzzer , and in I sneaks where they 're holdin ' the inquest . Say , they 're all sittin ' around the big mahogany directors ' table , with the old man at the head , lookin ' black and ugly , and grippin ' a half smoked cigar butt between his teeth . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him yet . He was just beginning to fight , that 's all . " Boy , " says he , " bring in Dudley . " " Yes , sir , " says I. But , say , my heels dragged some as I went out . Course I did n't know what they wanted of the old boy ; but it did n't look to be such a wild guess that they 'd picked him to play the goat part . I finds him perched up on his stool , calm and serene , workin ' away on the ledgers as industrious as if nothin ' special was goin ' on . " Dudley , " says I , " are you feelin ' strong ? " " Why , Torchy , " says he , " I am feeling about as usual , thank you . " " Well , brace yourself then , " says I ; " for there 's rough goin ' ahead . You 're wanted in on the carpet . " " Me ? " says he . " Mr. Ellins wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the rest of ' em . But do n't let ' em put any spell on you . It 's your cue now to forget the meek and lowly business . I know you ai n't strong for bluffin ' through a game ; but for the love of soup put up a front to-day ! " Dudley , he only smiles and shakes his head . Then off he toddles , wearin ' his old ink-stained office coat and even keepin ' on the green eye-shade . Well , I do n't know how long they had him on the grill ; but it could n't have been more'n half an hour , for along about three o'clock I strolls into the audit department , and there 's old Dudley back on his perch writin ' away again . " Say , are you it ? " says I. Illustration : WE MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT PAIR . " Why , how is that ? " says he . " Did they tie anything to you ? " says I. " You know -- con you into takin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blame for what ? " says he . " I do n't believe I understand . But nothing of the sort was mentioned . I was merely given some instructions about my work . " " Oh ! " says I. " That 's all , eh ? And you 've gone right at it , have you ? " " No , " says he . " The fact is , Torchy , I am writing out my resignation . " " What ! Quittin ' ? " says I. " Say , do n't you see what a hole that puts you in ? Why , it makes you the goat for fair ! If you do that you 'll need bail inside of forty-eight hours -- and you wo n't get it . Look here , Dudley , take my advice and tear that up . " " But I ca n't , Torchy , " says he , " really , I ca n't . " " Why not ? " says I. " You 've got a couple of hands , ai n't you ? And what 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Say , why in blazes are you so anxious to take your chances between Sing Sing and the bread line ? " He 's there with the explanation , all right , and here 's the way it stands : Uncle Dudley has been called on because his partic'lar double-entry trick is to keep the run of the private accounts . All they want him to do is to take descriptions of a couple of checks , dig up the stubs , and juggle his books so the record will fit in with a nice new set of transactions that 's just been invented for the purpose . " But what checks ? " says I. " The five thousand plunkers to Mutt &; Mudd ? " " Why , yes , " says he . " How did you know ? " " Ah , how did I --  -- Say , Dudley , ai n't you been readin ' the papers lately ? " says I. Would you believe it ? He do n't know any more about what 's in the air than a museum mummy knows of Lobster Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office upside down ai n't so much as ruffled his whiskers . Checks are checks to him , and these special trouble makers do n't give him any chills up the back at all . He 's been told , though , to use the acid bottle on his books and write in a new version . " Well , why not do it ? " says I. " What 's that to you ? " " Why , do n't you see , " says he , " it would be making a false entry , and -- I -- I --  -- Well , I 've never done such a thing in my life , Torchy , and I ca n't begin now . " And , say , what do you know about that , eh ? Just a piece of phony bookkeepin ' that he do n't even have to put his name to , his job gone if he do n't follow orders , and him almost to the age limit anyway , with Son in Law Bennett ready to shove him on the street the minute he gets the sack ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts his signature to the resignation and hands it over for me to read . " Say , Dudley , " says I , lookin ' him up and down , " this listens to me like a bughouse play of yours ; but I got to admit that you do it sporty . There 's no ocher streak in you . " " I hoped you would understand , " says he . " In the circumstances , it was all I could do , you see . " " What I see plainer'n anything else , " says I , " is that if this goes through your career is bugged to the limit . When do you want this handed in ? " " As soon as possible , " says he . " I suppose I ought to resign at once . " " Resign ! " says I. " You 'll be lucky if the old man do n't have you chucked through the window . Better be waitin ' down in the lower corridor when I spring this on Mr. Ellins . " Nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts straightenin ' up his desk as I goes out , as calm as though he was house cleanin ' for a vacation . And while I 'm tryin ' to make up my mind how to deliver this document to the main stem and duck an ambulance ride afterwards , the directors ' meetin ' breaks up . So I finds Old Hickory alone in his private office and slips it casual on the pad in front of him . " Here , what 's this ? " he snorts , callin ' me back as he opens up the sheet . " Eh ? Dudley ! Resigns , does he ! What , that dried up , goat faced , custard brained , old --  -- Say , boy ; ask him what the grizzly grindstones he means by --  --  " " I did , " says I , " and , if you want to know , he 's quittin ' because he 's too straight to cook up the books the way you told him . " " Cook up the books ! " gasps Old Hickory , gettin ' raspb'ry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truck horse . " He 's been welshing , has he ? Perhaps he 'd like to turn State 's witness ? Well , by the great sizzling skyrockets , if that 's his trick , I 'll give him enough of --  --  " " Excuse me , Mr. Ellins , " I breaks in , " but you 're slippin ' your clutch . Tricks ! Why , he ai n't even wise to what you want him to do it for . All he knows is that it 's crooked , and he renigs on a general proposition . And , say , when a man 's as straight as that , with the workhouse starin ' him in the face , he 's too valuable to lose , ai n't he ? " " Wha-a-at ? " gurgles Old Hickory . " Besides , " says I , hurryin ' the words to get ' em all out before any violent scene breaks loose , " knowin ' all he does about them Mutt &; Mudd checks , and with what he do n't know about the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roamin ' the streets , would it ? Now I leave it to you . " Say , I was lookin ' Old Hickory right in the eye , ready to dodge the inkstand or anything else , while I was puttin ' that over , and for a minute I thought it was comin ' sure . But while he can get as hot under the collar as anyone I ever saw , and twice as quick , he do n't go clear off his nut any of the time . " Young man , " says he , calmin ' down and motion in ' me to a chair , " as usual , you seem to be more or less well informed on this matter yourself . Now let 's have the rest of it . " And just like that , all of a sudden , it 's batted up to me . So I lets it come , with all the details about Uncle Dudley 's frosty home life , and the reformer son out West that still thinks father is makin ' good . He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes in with the sympathetic sigh , or shows signs of being troubled by mist in the eye corners . He just throws in an occasional grunt now and then and drums his fat finger-tips on the chair arm . " Huh ! " says he . " Babes and sucklings ! But I 've had worse advice that has cost me a lot more . Well , I suppose an old fool like that is dangerous to have drifting around . But I do n't want him here just now , either . Um-m-m ! Where did you say this son of his lived ? " " Just out of Los Angeles , " says I. " All right , " says Old Hickory . " Tell him he goes west Tuesday as traveling auditor to our second vice president . He 'll bring up at Los Angeles about the middle of the month -- and about that time it may happen that he 'll be retired on full pay . But I 'll keep this resignation , as a curiosity . " Now do n't ask me to describe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full partic'lars of the decision it near keels him over . And what part of it do you say tickles him most ? That the books do n't have to be juggled ! " It was n't like Mr. Ellins to countenance an act of that sort , not in the least , " says he , " and I am very glad that he has changed his mind . " " Say , Dudley , " says I , " you 're a wonder , you are . " And it was all I could do to keep from askin ' him if he thought he owned the only bottle of ink eradicator there was in New York . Do I know who did fix up them entries ? Well , by the nervous motions of a certain party next mornin ' , I could give a guess . " Piddie , " says I , " if they ever get you on the stand , you want to wear interferin ' pads between your knees , so they wo n't hear the bones rattle . " CHAPTER XVI THROWING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been let in wrong on Skid Mallory . Remember him , do n't you ? Well , he 's our young college hick that I helped steer up against Baron Kazedky when he landed that big armor plate order . Did they make Skid a junior partner for that , or paint his name on a private office door ? Not so you 'd notice it . Maybe they was afraid a sudden boost like that would make him dizzy . But they promotes him to the sales department and adds ten to his pay envelope . I was most as tickled over it as Mallory was , too . " Did n't I tell you ? " says I. " You 're a comer , you are ! Why , I expect in ten or a dozen years more you 'll be sharin ' in the semi-annuals and ridin ' down to the office in a taxi . " " Perhaps I may , Torchy -- in ten or a dozen years , " says he , kind of slow and sober . I could guess what he was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that Brother Dick towed in here along last winter , some Senator 's daughter that Skid had got chummy with when he was doin ' his great quarterback act and havin ' his picture printed in the sportin ' extras . " How 's that affair comin ' on ? " says I ; for I ai n't heard him mention her in quite some time . " It 's all off , " says he , shruggin ' them wide shoulders of his . " That is , there never was anything in it , you know , to begin with . " " Oh , there wa' n't , eh ? " says I. " Forgot all about that picture you used to carry around in the little leather case , have you ? " Skid , he flushes up a bit at that , and one hand goes up to his left inside pocket . Then he laughs foolish . " It is n't I who have forgotten , " says he . " Oh-ho ! " says I. " Well , I would n't have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so --  --  " But Mallory gives me the choke off sign , and as we walks up Broadway he gradually opens up more and more on the subject until I 've got a fair map of the situation . Seems that Sis ai n't exactly set him adrift without warnin ' . He 'd sort of helped cut the cable himself . She 'd begun by writin ' to him every week , tellin ' him all about the lively season she was havin ' in Washington , and how much fun she was gettin ' out of life . She even put in descriptions of her new dresses , and some of her dance orders , and now and then a bridge score , or a hand painted place card from some dinner she 'd been to . And Skid , thinkin ' it all over in the luxury of his nine by ten boudoir , got to wonderin ' what attractions along that line he could hold out to a young lady that was used to blowin ' in more for one new spring lid than he could earn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite flowers ! " says he . " Ever buy any orchids , Torchy ? " " Not guilty , " says I ; " but they ai n't so high , are they , that you could n't splurge on a bunch now and then ? What 's the tariff on ' em , anyway ? " " At times you can get real nice ones for a dollar apiece , " says he . " Phe-e-e-ew ! " says I. " She has got swell tastes . " " It is n't her fault , " says he . " She 's never known anything different . " So what does Skid do but slow up on the correspondence , skippin ' an answer here and there , and coverin ' only two pages when he did write . For one thing , he did n't have so much to tell as she did . I knew that ; for I 'd seen more or less of Mallory durin ' the last few months , and I knew he was playin ' his cards close to his vest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation ; but he did n't indulge in high priced cafe luncheons on Saturdays , like most of the bunch ; he 'd scratched his entry at the college club ; and he was soakin ' away his little surplus as fast as he got his fingers on it . Course , that programme meant sendin ' regrets to most of the invites he got , and spendin ' his evenin 's where it did n't cost much to get in or out . One frivolous way he had of killin ' time was by teachin ' ' rithmetic to a class of new landed Zinskis at a settlement house over on the East Side . " Ah , what 's the use ? " I used to tell him . " They 'd learn to do compound interest on their fingers in a month , anyway , and the first thing you know you 'll be payin ' rent to some of ' em . " But he was pretty level headed about most things , I will say that for Mallory , specially the way he sized up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was grouchy at her about something ; and when he did n't deny , or come to the front with any reason -- why , she just quit sendin ' the billy ducks . " So you 're never going to see her any more , eh ? " says I. " Well , " says he , " I supposed until within an hour or so ago that I never should . And then --  -- Well , she 's here , Torchy ; came yesterday , and I presume she expects to see me to-night . " " That 's encouragin ' , anyway , " says I. But Mallory do n't seem so much cheered up . It turns out that Sis is spendin ' a few days with friends here , waitin ' for the rest of the fam'ly to come on and sail for Europe . They 're givin ' a farewell dinner dance for her , and Skid is on the list . The trouble is he ca n't make up his mind whether to go or stay away . One minute he 's dead sure he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what harm there would be in takin ' one last look . " But , then , " says Mallory , " what good would that do ? " " I know , " says I. " There 's a young lady friend of mine on the other side too . Say , Mallory , I guess we belong in the lobster class . " And when we splits up on the corner Skid has decided against the party proposition , and goes off towards his boardin ' house with his chin down on his collar and his heels draggin ' . So I wa' n't prepared for the joyous smile and the frock coat regalia that Mallory wears when he blows into the office about ten-forty-five next forenoon . He 's sportin ' a spray of lilies of the valley in his lapel , and swingin ' his silver topped stick , and by the look on his face you 'd think he was hearin ' the birdies sing in the treetops . " Tra-la-la , tra-la-lee ! " says I , throwin ' open the brass gate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " It 's a very special one , " says he , thumpin ' me on the back and whisperin ' husky in my ear . " Torchy , I 'm married ! " " Wha-a-at ! " I splutters . " Who to ? When ? " " To Sis , " says he , " half an hour ago . " " Eh ? " says I. " Mean to say you 've been and eloped with the Senator 's daughter ? " " Eloped ! " says he , as though he 'd never heard the word before . " Why , no -- er -- that is , we just went out and -- and --  --  " Oh , no , they had n't eloped ! They 'd merely slid out of the ballroom about three A.M. , after dancin ' seventeen waltzes together , snuggled into a hansom cab , and rode around the park until daylight talkin ' it over . Then she 'd slipped back into the house , got into her travelin ' dress while he was off changin ' his clothes , met again at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then dragged a young rector away from his boiled eggs and toast to splice ' em . But Skid did n't call that elopin ' . Why , Sis had left word with the butler to tell her friends all about it , and the first thing they did after it was over was to send a forty-word collect telegram to papa . And Mallory , he 'd just dropped around to arrange with Old Hickory for a little vacation before they beat it for Atlantic City . " So that ai n't elopin ' , eh ? " says I. " I expect you 'd call that a sixty-yard run on a forward pass , or something like that ? Well , the old man 's inside . Luck to you . " Mallory wa' n't on the carpet long , and when he comes out I asks how he made back . " Oh , bully ! " says he . " I 'm to have ten days . " " With or without ? " says I. " Oh , I forgot to ask , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll or not wa' n't botherin ' him then . He gives me a bone crushin ' grip and swings out to the elevator in a rush ; for he 's been away from Sis nearly half an hour now . Exceptin ' a picture postcard or two , showin ' the iron pier and a bathin ' scene , I did n't hear from Mr. and Mrs. Mallory for more'n a week . And then one afternoon I gets a ' phone message from Skid , saying that they 're all settled in a little flat up on Washington Heights and they 'll be pleased to have me come up to dinner . " It 's our very first dinner , you know , " says he , " and Sis is going to get it all by herself . I suggested that we try the first one on you . " " That do n't scare me any , " says I. " I 've lived on sinkers and pie too long to duck amateur cookin ' . I 'll be there . " I was on the grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was goin ' to hand him . At three minutes of closing time I was all ready to sneak out , with one eye on the clock and the other on Piddie , when in blows a ruby faced , thick waisted gent with partly gray hair , a heavyweight jaw , and a keen pair of twinklin ' gray eyes . He looks prosperous and important , and he proceeds to act right to home . " Boy , " says he , pushin ' through the gate , " is this the general office of the Corrugated Trust Company ? " " Yep , " says I. " That 's what it says on the door . " " There is employed here , I understand , " he goes on , " a young man by the name of Mallory . " Say , I was wide awake at that . " Mallory ? " says I. " I can find out . Did you want to see him on business ? " " It is a personal matter , " says he . " Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " says I. " My orders is to find out --  --  " " Very well , " says the gent , " there is my card . And perhaps I should mention that I have the honor -- er -- I suppose , to be his father in law . " Say , and here I was , up against the Senator himself . Course it was my cue to shrivel up and do the low salaam ; but all I can think of at the minute is to look him over and grin . " Gee ! " says I. " Then you 're on his trail , eh ? " Maybe it was the grin fetched him ; for them square mouth corners flickers a little and he do n't throw any fit . " Evidently you are somewhat familiar with the circumstances , " says he . " May I ask if you are sufficiently favored with the confidence of my new son in law to know where he and my -- er -- his wife happen , to be just now ? " " I admit it , " says I ; " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music on Skid , you can look for another party , for you wo n't get it out of me in a thousand years ! " " Ah ! " says he . " I see Young Lochinvar has at least one champion . Allow me to state that my intentions are pacific . My wife and I merely wish , before sailing , to pay a formal call on our daughter and her new husband . Now if you could give me their address --  --  " " Why , say , Senator , " says I , " if you ai n't lookin ' to start anything , I can do better . I 'm going right up there myself this minute , and if Mrs. --  --  " " She is waiting downstairs in the cab , " says he . " Nothing would suit us better . " And , say , maybe it wa' n't just what I should have done , but blamed if I could see how to dodge it when it 's up to me that way . So it 's me climbin ' up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , papa and mamma behind , and off rolls the surprise party . Well , you know them cut rate apartment houses , with a flossy reception room , all marble slabs and burlap panels and no elevator . The West Indian at the telephone exchange says we 'll find the Mallorys on the top floor back to the left . That meant four flights to climb , which might account for the lack of conversation on the way up . Mallory , with his coat off , his cuffs rolled back , and his face steamed up , answers the ring himself . " Ah , that you , Torchy ? " says he . " We were just wondering if you would --  -- Why -- er -- ah --  --  " and as he gets sight of the old couple out in the dark hall he breaks off sudden . " It 's all right , " says I. " He 's promised to give the peace sign . You know the Senator , do n't you , Skid ? " " The Senator ! " he gasps out . " I believe I once had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , comin ' to the front graceful . " Hope you will pardon the intrusion ; but --  --  " Just then , though , Sis appears from the kitchen , her face all pink and white , and her sleeves pushed up past the dimples in her elbows . Under a thirty-nine-cent blue and white checked apron she 's wearin ' a lace party dress that was a dream . It 's an odd combination ; but most anything would look well on a little queen like her . She takes one look at Skid , another at the Senator , and then behind the old man she spies Mother . Well , it 's just a squeal from one , and a sigh from the other , and then they 've made a rush to the center that wedges us all into that little three-foot hall like it was the platform of a subway car , and before anything more can be said they 've gone to a fond clinch , each pattin ' the other on the back and passin ' appropriate remarks . Somehow , I guess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme . I expect his plan was to be real polite and formal , stay only long enough to let the young people know he could stand it if they could , and then back out dignified . Whatever Mother might have meant to do when she started , it was all off from the minute Sis let out that squeal . And no sooner had we got ourselves untangled and edged sideways into the cute little parlor , than Mother announces how she means to stay right here until it 's time to start for the steamer . Did some one say dinner ! Good ! She 'll stay to dinner , then . At that Sis looks at Skid and Skid he looks at Sis . There was some real worry exchanged in them looks too ; but young Mrs. Mallory ai n't one to be stumped as easy as that . " Oh , goody ! " says she , clappin ' her hands . " But , Mother , what is it you do to make dumplings puff out after you 've dropped them in the lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mother . " Gracious ! Do n't ask me , child . I have n't made any for years . Does n't your cook know ? " " She does n't , " says Sis . " I am the cook , Mother . " Well , that was only the beginning of the revelations ; for while Sis and Mother was strugglin ' with the receipt book , the Senator was makin ' a tour of inspection around the apartment . It did n't take him so long , either . " Ahem ! " says he to Mallory . " Very cozy , indeed ; but -- er -- not exactly spacious . " " Four rooms and bath , " says Mallory . " Was -- er -- that the bathtub in there ? " says the Senator , jerkin ' his thumb at the bathroot door . " I fancied it might be -- er -- a pudding dish . Might I inquire what rent you pay for -- er -- all this ? " " Forty a month , sir , " says Mallory . " Ah ! Economy , I see . Good way to begin , " says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , your present salary is --  --  " " I 'm getting twenty-five a week , " says Skid , lookin ' him straight between the eyes . " Then you have a private income , I presume ? " says the Senator . " Well , " says Mallory , " my aunt in Boston sends me fifty dollars every Christmas and advises me to invest my savings in Government bonds . " At that the Senator drops into a chair and whistles . " But -- but how do you expect , " he goes on , " to -- to --  -- Pardon me , but I am getting interested . I should like to know what was your exact financial standing when you had the imp -- er -- when you married my daughter ? " He gets it , down to the last nickel . Skid begins with what he had in the bank when they starts for Atlantic City , shows the hole that trip made in his funds , produces the receipts for furniture , and announces that , after punglin ' up a month 's rent , there 's something over seven dollars left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hence the lamb stew , eh ? I do n't wonder ! So you and Sis have undertaken to live in a forty-dollar apartment on a twenty-five-dollar salary , have you ? " " That 's what it looks like , sir , " says Mallory . " And who is the financial genius that is to manage this enterprise ? " says he . " Why , " says Skid , " Mrs. Mallory , I suppose . We have agreed that she should . " " Sis , eh ? " says the Senator , smilin ' kind of grim . " Well , you have my best wishes for your success . " Skid he flushes some behind the ears ; but he only bows and says he 's much obliged . You could n't blame him for feelin ' cut up , either ; for it 's all clear how the Senator has doped out an appeal for help within thirty days , and is willin ' to wait for the call . I 'm no shark on the cost of livin ' myself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a call to dinner just then , though , and we all gathers round the stew . Anyway , it was meant for a lamb stew . The potatoes was some hard , the gravy was so thin you 'd thought it had been put in from the tea kettle as an afterthought , and the dumplin 's had n't the puffin ' out charm worked on ' em for a cent . But the sliced carrots was kind of tasty and went all right with the baker 's bread if you left off the bargain butter . Sis she tried to laugh at it all ; but her eyes got kind of dewy at the corners . " Never mind , dear , " says Mother . " I 'll telegraph for our old Martha to come on and cook for you . " " Why , certainly , " says the Senator . " She could sleep on the fire escape , you know . " And say , that last comic jab of his , and the effect it had on Mr. and Mrs. Mallory , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hard and fast , and inside of five minutes I stumbles onto an idea . " Excuse me , " says I to Skid ; " but I guess I 'll be on my way . I just thought of a date I ought to keep . " And where do you expect I brings up ? At the Ellins ' mansion , down on the avenue . First time I 'd ever been there out of office hours ; but the maid says Mr. Ellins is takin ' his coffee in the lib'ry and she 'd see if he 'd let me in . Ah , sure he did , and we gets right down to cases . " Remember how that assistant general manager stiff of yours fell down on that public lands deal when you sent him to Washington last month ? " says I. Old Hickory chokes some on a swallow of black coffee he 's just hoisted in ; but he recovers enough to nod . " Does he get the run ? " says I. " I neglected consulting you about it , Torchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called for . " " Filled the job yet ? " says I. " Fortunately , no , " says he , and I knew by the way he squints that he thought he was bein ' mighty humorous . " Possibly you could recommend his successor ? " " Yep , I could , " says I. " Would it help any to have some one who was son in law to a Senator ? " " That , " says Old Hickory , " would depend somewhat on which Senator was his father in law . " " Well , " says I , " there 's his card . " " Eh ? " says he , readin ' the name . " Why -- who --  --  " " Mallory , " says I. " You know -- hitched last week . He 's got the old boy up there to dinner now . Maybe he 'll be taken on as the Senator 's secretary if you do n't jump in quick . He 's a hustler , Mallory is . Remember how he skinned that big order out of Kazedky ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner . Well , does he get it ? " " Young man , " says Old Hickory , catchin ' his breath , " if my mental machinery worked at the high pressure speed yours does , I could --  -- But I am not noted for being slow . I 've done things in a hurry before . I can yet . Torchy , he does get it . " " When ? " says I. " To-morrow morning , " says he . " I 'll start him at five thousand . " " Whoop ! " says I. " Say , you 're a sport ! I 'll go up and deliver the glad news . Guess he needs it now as much as he ever will . " And , say , you should have seen the change of heart that comes over the Senator when he heard the bulletin . " Mallory , my boy , " says he , " congratulations . And by the way , just remove that -- er -- imitation lamb stew . Then we 'll all go down to some good hotel and have a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On your way , now , on your way ! " says I ; gazin ' haughty over the brass gate . " No window cleanin ' done here durin ' office hours ! " " But , " says the specimen on the other side , " I -- I did n't come to clean the windows . " " Eh ? " says I , sizin ' up the blue flannel shirt , the old leather belt , and other marks of them pail and sponge artists . " Well , we do n't want any sash cords put in , or wirin ' fixed , or any kind of jobbin ' done until after five . That 's General Order No. 1 . See ? " He nods in kind of a lifeless , unexcited way ; but he do n't make any motions towards beatin ' it . " I -- I -- the fact is , " he begins , " I wish to see some one connected with the Corrugated Trust Company . " " You 've had your wish , " says I. " I 'm Exhibit A. For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything more ? " He do n't get peeved at this , nor he do n't grin . He just keeps on bein ' serious and calm . " If you do n't mind , " says he , " I should like to see one of the higher officials . " " Say , that 's almost neat enough to win out , " says I. " One of the higher officials , eh ? How would the president suit you ? " " If I might see him , I 'd like it , " says he . " Wha-a-a-at ! " says I. Honest , the nerve that 's wasted on some folks is a shame . I had to sit up and give him the Old Sleuth stare at that . He 's between twenty-five and thirty , for a guess ; and , say , whatever he might have been once , he 's a wreck now ,  - -  long , thin face , with the cheekbones almost stickin ' through , slumped in shoulders , bony hands , and a three months ' crop of mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' his coat collar . Why , he looked more like he ought to be sittin ' around the waitin ' room of some charity hospital , than tryin ' to butt in on the time of one of the busiest men in New York . " It 's a matter that ought to go before the president , " says he , " and if he is n't busy I 'd like very much to --  --  " " Say , old scout , " says I , " you got about as much chance of bein ' let in to see Mr. Ellins as I have of passin ' for a brunette ! So let 's come down to cases . Now what 's it all about ? " He ai n't makin ' any secret of it . He wants the concern to make him a bid on an option he holds on some coal and iron lands . Almost comes to life tellin ' me about that option , and for the first time I notice what big , bright , deep sunk eyes he 's got . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through reg'lar , " says I. " Wait ; I 'll call Mr. Piddie . He 'll fix you up . " Does he ? Well , that 's what Piddie 's supposed to be there for ; but he do n't any more'n glance at the flannel shirt before he begins to swell up and frown and look disgusted . " No , no , go away ! " says he . " I 've no time to talk to you , none at all . " " But , " says the object , " I have n't had a chance to tell you --  --  " " Get out -- you ! " snaps Piddie , turnin ' on his heel and struttin ' off . It ai n't the way he talks to parties wearin ' imported Panamas and sportin ' walkin ' sticks ; but , then , most of us has our little fads that way . What stirred me up , though , was the rough way he did it , and the hopeless sag to the wreck 's chin after he 's heard the decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " But do n't take him too serious . He ai n't the final word in this shop , and there 's nobody gets next to the big wheeze oftener durin ' the day than yours truly . Maybe I could get that option of yours passed on . Got the document with you ? " He had and hands it over . With that he drops onto the reception room settee and says he 'll wait . " Better not , " says I ; " for it might be quite a spell before I gets the right chance . We 'll do this reg'lar , by mail . Now what 's the name ? " " Tuttle , " says he , " Tinkham J. Tuttle . " " They call you Tink for short , do n't they ? " says I , and he admits that they do . " All right , " I goes on . " Now the address , Tink . Jersey , eh ? Well , it 's likely you 'll hear from Mr. Ellins before the week 's out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turns down enough propositions to fill a waste basket every day . Express elevator at No. 5 . So long , " and I chokes off Mr. Tuttle 's vote of thanks by wavin ' him out the door . It 's well along in the afternoon before I sees an openin' ' to drop this option in front of Old Hickory , grabbin ' a minute when his desk is fairly clear , and slammin ' it down just as though it had been sent in through Piddie . " Delivered on , " says I. " Wants rush answer by mail . " " Huh ! " grunts Old Hickory , lightin ' up a fresh Cassadora . That 's all I expected to hear of the transaction ; so about an hour later , when Piddie comes out lookin ' solemn and says I 'm to report to Mr. Ellins , I do n't know what 's up . " Is it a first degree charge , Piddie , " says I , " or only for manslaughter ? " " I presume Mr. Ellins will discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , hope for the worst , Piddie , " says I. " Here goes ! " And the minute I sees what Old Hickory has in front of him , I 'm wise . " Torchy , " says he , givin ' me the steely glitter out of them cold storage eyes of his , " Mr. Piddie seems to know nothing about this Michigan option . " " If he admits that much , " says I , " it must be so . It 's a record , though . " " What I want to know , " goes on Mr. Ellins , " is how in blue belted blazes it got here . You brought it in , did n't you ? " " Yep , " says I. " It was this way , Mr. Ellins : Piddie had it put up to him and would n't even hang it on the hook ; but the guy that brings it looked so mournful that I butts in and takes a chance on passin ' it along to you on my own hook . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorts . " Sure , " says I. " I got to do the fresh act once in a while , ai n't I ? Course , if you want a dead one on the gate , I can hand in my portfolio ; but I thought all you had to do with punk options like this was to toss ' em in the basket and then have ' em fired back at --  --  " " Fire nothing back ! " says Mr. Ellins . " Why , you lucky young rascal , we 've been trying to get hold of this very property for eight months ! And Piddie ! Bah ! Of all the pin-headed , jelly brained --  --  " " Second the motion , " says I , springin ' the joyous grin . " That will do , " says Old Hickory , catchin ' himself up . " Just you forget Mr. Piddie and listen to me . Know this Tuttle person by sight , do n't you ? " " Could n't forget him , " says I. " Want him on the carpet ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at ten-thirty to-morrow morning . But find him to-night , and see that you do n't open your head about this business to anyone else . " " I get you , " says I , doin ' the West Point salute . " It 's me to trail and shut up Tuttle . He 'll be here , if I have to bring him in an ambulance . " That 's why I jumps out before closin ' time and mingles with the Jersey commuters in a lovely hot ride across the meadows . It 's a scrubby station where I gets off , too ; one of these fact'ry settlements where the whole population answers the seven o'clock whistle every mornin ' . There 's a brick barracks half a mile long , where they make sewin ' machines or something , and snuggled close up around it is hundreds of these four-fam'ly wooden tenements , gettin ' the full benefit of the soft coal smoke and makin ' it easy for the hands to pike home for a noon dinner . Say , you talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to some of these corporation shacks across the meadows ! Seventeen dirty kids led me to the number Tuttle gave me , and in the right hand first floor kitchen I finds a red faced woman in a faded blue wrapper fryin ' salt pork and cabbage . " Mrs. Tinkham Tuttle ? " says I , holdin ' my breath . " No , " says she , glancin ' suspicious over her shoulder . " I 'm his sister . " " Oh ! " says I. " Is Tink around ? " " I do n't know whether he is or not , and do n't care ! " says she . " Much obliged , " says I ; " but I ai n't come to collect for anything . Could n't you give a guess ? " " If I did , " says she , " I 'd say he was over to the factory yard . That 's where he stays most of the time . " It 's half-past five ; but the fact'ry 's runnin ' full blast , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I locates my man . Fin'lly , though , they point out a big storage shed in one corner of the coal cinder desert they has fenced in so careful . The wide double doors to the shed are shut ; but after I 've hammered for a while one of ' em is slid back a few inches and Tuttle peeks out . " Oh ! " he gasps . " You ! Say , are they going to take it ? Are they ? " " Them 's the indications , " says I , " providin ' it 's all O. K. and your price is right . " " Oh , I 'll make the price low enough , " says he . " I 'll sell out for two thousand , and it ought to be worth twice that . But two is all I need . " " Eh ? " says I. " What kind of finance do you call that ? Say , Tuttle , you know you ca n't work any ' phony deal on the Corrugated . Better give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he . " Come in , wo n't you ! " With that he leads the way through the dark shed to a sort of workshop at the back , where there 's a window . There 's a tool bench , a little hand forge with an old coffee pot and a fryin ' pan on it , and a cot bed not ten feet away . " Campin ' out here ? " says I. " I 'm not supposed to , " says he ; " but the yard superintendent lets me . This is where I 've lived and worked for nearly two years , and until you came a minute ago it was where I expected to end . But now it 's different . " " It is ? " says I. " How 's that ? " Which is Tink Tuttle 's cue to open up on the story of his life . It 's a soggy , unexcitin ' yarn , most of it . As I 'd kind of guessed by the way he talked , he wa' n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some high class scientific school up in Massachusetts , where he 'd lived before his father lost his grip . Seems the old man was a crackerjack boss machinist ; but he got to monkeyin ' with fool inventions , drifted from place to place , got to be a lunger , and finally passed in . The last four years in the fact'ry here had finished him . Tink had worked there , too , and his sister had married one of the hands . " It 's the graveyard of the Tuttle family , this place is , I suppose , " says Tink . " It got father , and it has almost got me . Some folks can breathe brass filings and carbon dioxide and thrive on it ; but we ca n't . So I gave up and hid myself away in here to work out one of my silly dreams . Last spring I caught a bad cold , and Sister sent me West . There we have an uncle . She thought the change of climate might help my cough . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that I picked up this option . That was when I saw a chance of making my dream come true . You saw what I 've been building , did n't you , as we came through ? " " I did n't notice , " says I. " What is it , anyway ? " Illustration : " TUT , TUT , " SAYS THE BOSS OF THE RESTORIUM . " Wait until I light the lantern , " says Tuttle . " Now come . This way . Do n't hit your head on those wings . There ! " And , say , it 's a wonder I could walk right by a thing of that kind without gettin ' next , even if it was kind of dark . But all I needs now is one glimpse of the outlines . " Oho ! " says I. " A flyer ! Say , every bughouse in the country is at work on one of them . " " I suppose so , " says he . " I may be as big a fool as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm doing . At any rate , I 've put my last dollar into it . That 's why my sister is so --  -- Well , she thinks I am --  --  " " Yes , I suspicioned she was some sore on you , " says I. " But what sort of a flyer is this , double or single winger ? " " It 's a biplane , " says Tuttle , " on the Farnham type , only an improved model . " " Of course it 's improved , " says I. " Tried her out yet ! " " Hardly , " says he . " I could n't buy an engine , you see . That 's what I 've been waiting for . Say , you really think the Corrugated will take that option , do you ? If they only would ! " " You must be in a hurry to break your neck , " says I. Before I left , though , he 'd shown me all over the thing , explained how it was goin ' to work , and did his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also I makes him give me the full details of how he come to get this option , and I advises him if he does manage to cash it in for two thousand , to take an ax to his flying machine and hike out for some lung preservin ' climate where he 'll have a chance to shake that cough . " Thanks , " says he , grippin ' my hand and chokin ' up . " You -- you 've been mighty good to me . I 'll remember it . " Course , I gives Mr. Ellins the whole tale in the mornin ' , about Tuttle and his bum air pumps , and his batty scheme of buildin ' the flyer ; but all that interests Old Hickory is the option and the price . " Good work , Torchy , " says he . " I 've wired our Western agents to investigate , and if they report an O. K. , Tuttle shall have his two thousand to do what he likes with . " It must have been two weeks later , and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a note from Tinkham J. , askin ' me to come over to the shed as quick as I could . Well , I did n't know whether he was havin ' a final spasm or not ; but it seemed like I ought to go , so that night I does . I finds him waitin ' for me at the yard gate . He do n't look any worse than usual , either . " Well , " says I , " did n't the deal go through ? " " It did , " says he , pattin ' me on the back . " Thanks to you , it did . The check came two days later , and I 've spent it all . " " What ! " says I. " You do n't mean to say you blew all that in on an engine for that blamed --  --  " " All but a few dollars that I put into oil and gasoline , " says he . " But the machine is all hooked up , Torchy , and it works . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Up ? " says I. " Not far , " says he ; " but enough to know what I can do . Started right here from the yard , just at daylight , and landed here again . I 've told no one else , you know . Come in and see how smooth the engine works . " And it was just while he was gettin ' ready to start the wheels that these two strangers butts in on us . One is a husky , red faced , swell dressed young sport , and the other is a tall , swivel eyed , middle aged gent dressed in khaki . They walks around the machine without payin ' any attention to me or Tuttle . " Well , what do you think of it , Captain ? " says the young sport after a while . The Captain , he shakes his head . " I ca n't tell positively , " says he ; " but these planes seem to me to be set entirely wrong . I never saw deflectors worked on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in a practical test --  --  " " They say he 's made flight , though , " breaks in the young sport . " The night watchman saw him . Hey ! You 're the chap that built this aeroplane , are n't you ? " " Yes , sir , " says Tuttle . " And did n't you make a flight ? " he wants to know . " A short one , " says Tuttle . " That 's enough for me , " says the sport . " Say , you know who I am , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes , " says Tuttle . " At least , I ought to . You 're Bradish Jones , Jr. , one of the owner 's sons . " " That 's right , " says young Mr. Jones . " And I know you . You 're the son of old Tuttle , who used to be foreman of the machine shop when I was doing my apprentice work . Thought this little trick of yours was a secret , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you I did , too . I 'm in the market . I do n't care a hoot what the Captain says , either . I want a flyer , and I 'm ready to take a chance on yours . What do you want for it ? " " Why , " says Tuttle , " I do n't believe I want to sell . " " What 's that ? " snaps Bradish . " Come , now ! Do n't try to bluff me ! I 'll admit I 'm in a hurry . These Curtiss people have been holding me off for a month , and I want to begin flying right away . So name your price . How much ? " But Tuttle , he only shakes his head . " Oh , yes , you will , " says Bradish . " Why , you 've hardly a dollar to your name . You ca n't afford to own a flyer , even if you did build it . You know you ca n't . Now show me what it cost you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hundred a week until I learn to manage the thing . Is it a go ? " " No ! " says Tuttle , sharp and quick , them big eyes of his fairly blazin ' . " This is my machine , and I 'm going to fly it . I do n't care how much money you 've got . You 've taken a sudden whim that you 'd like to fly . It 's been the one dream of my life . You 've had your yachts and your racing cars . I 've never had anything but hard work . My father wore himself out in your stinking old factory . I nearly did the same . But you ca n't rob me of this . You sha' n't , that 's all ! " And for a minute them two stood there givin ' each other the assault and batt'ry stare , without sayin ' a word . A queer lookin ' pair they made , too ; this Bradish gent , big and beefy and prosperous , and Tink Tuttle , his greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lookin ' like he was on his way from the accident ward to the coroner 's office . " Five thousand cash , then , " growls Mr. Jones . " Not if you said fifty ! " Tink comes back at him . " Bah ! " says Bradish . " Why , I could have you and your machine thrown out in the road this minute . But I 'll give you twenty-four hours to think it over . Remember , to-morrow night at six I 'll be here with the money . Then it will be either sell or go . Come , Captain , " and with that they pikes out . " Say , Tink , " says I , " you got him comin ' , all right , and if you do n't get that five thousand you 're no good . " " I know I 'm no good , " says Tuttle . " That 's why I do n't want his money . " " But see here , Tink , " says I. " You ai n't goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I am , " says he , " and I 'll tell you why . It 's because I know I 'm no good and never would be any good , even if I could live , which I ca n't . Oh , I do n't need any doctor to tell me how much longer I 've got . They gave me only three months over a year ago . I knew better . I knew I should hold out until I finished my flyer . Father did n't have anything like that to keep on for ; so he went quicker . He did n't want to go , either . And it was awful to watch him , Torchy , just awful ! But I 'm not going to finish that way . No , not now , " and he walks up to the machine and runs his hand loving along one of the smooth planes . " How 's that ? " says I. " What are you drivin ' at , Tink ? " " I ca n't tell you how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I 'm not sure . But I mean to go up once ; way , way up , out over the ocean just at sunrise . Wo n't that be fine , eh ? Just think ! Sailing off up there into the blue ; up , and up , and up ; higher than anyone has ever dared to go before , higher and higher , until your gasoline gives out and you ca n't go any more ! " " Yes ; but what then ? " says I , beginnin ' to feel some chilly along the spine . " Why , that 's enough , is n't it ? " says he . " Anyway , it 's all I ask . I 'll call it all quits then . " " Ah , say , cut out the tragedy ! " says I. " You give me the creeps , talkin ' that rot ! What you want to do is to go up for a short sail if you can , forget to try any Hamilton stunts , and then beat it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , when do you try her again ? " " At daylight to-morrow morning , " says he . " Gee ! " says I. " I 've got a notion to stick around and watch how you come out . " " No , do n't , " says he . " I -- I 'll let you know . Yes , honest I will . Goodnight and -- good-by . " He kept his word as well as he could , too . The postmark on the card was six A.M. ; but I guess it must have been dropped in the box earlier than that . All it says is : Twenty gallons in the tank , and I 'm off at four o'clock . I shall go straight out to sea and then up , up . I 've never been much good ; but I mean to finish in style . T. T. Now , what would you say to a batty proposition like that ? I could n't tell whether it was a bluff , or what . And I waits four days before I had the nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him since last Monday . And there was no flyer in the shed . Nobody around the place knew what had become of it , either . Well , it 's been two weeks since I got that postal . What do I think ? Say , honest , I do n't dare . But at night , when I 'm tryin ' to get to sleep , I can see Tink , sittin ' in between all them wires and things , with the wheel in his hand , and them big eyes of his gazin ' down calm and satisfied , down , down , down , and him ready to take that one last dip to the finish . And , say , about then I pull the sheets up over my eyes and shiver . " Piddie , " says I , " you got more sense than you look to have . Anyway , you know when to sidestep the nutty ones , do n't you ? " CHAPTER XVIII GETTING HERMES ON THE BOUNCE Anybody might of thought , to see me sittin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a big red leather chair lookin ' over the latest magazines , that I 'd been promoted from head office boy to heir apparent or something like that . I expect some kids would have stood on one leg in the front hall and held their breath ; but why not make yourself to home when you get the chance ? I knew the boss was takin ' his time goin ' through all them papers I 'd brought up , and that when he finished he 'd send down word if there was any instructions to go back . That 's how I come to get the benefit of all this mushy conversation that begins to drift out from the next room . First off I could n't make out whether it was some one havin ' a tooth plugged , or if it was a case of a mouse bein ' loose at a tea party . Course , the squeals and giggles I could place as comin ' from Miss Marjorie Ellins . Maybe you remember about Mr. Robert 's heavyweight young sister that wanted to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have an idea , except that from the " you-alls " she was usin ' I knew she must hail from somewhere south of Baltimore . Anyway , they seemed to be too much excited to sit down while they talked , and the first thing I knew they 'd drifted into the lib'ry , their arms twined around each other in a reg'lar schoolgirl clinch , and the conversation just bubblin ' out of ' em free . Miss Marjorie was all got up classy in pink and white , and she sure does look like a wide , corn fed Venus . The other is a slim , willowy young lady with a lot of home grown blond hair , a cute chin dimple , and a pair of big dark eyes with a natural rovin ' disposition . And she 's hobble skirted to the point where her feet was about as much use as if they 'd been tied in a bag . It was some kind of a long winded story she was tellin ' very confidential , with Marjorie supplyin ' the exclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred ? " says Marjorie . " ' Deed and ' deedy , he was ! " says Mildred . " Positively the handsomest man I ever saw ! I thought I could forget him ; but I could n't , Madge , I could n't ! And only think , he is coming this very night , and not a soul knows but just us two ! " " Excuse me , " says I ; " but I 'm Number Three . " " Oh , oh ! " they both squeals at once . " Who -- who 's that ? " whispers Mildred . " Why it 's only Torchy , from Papa 's office , " says Marjorie . " And oh , Mildred ! He is the very one to help us ! You will now , wo n't you , Torchy ? Come , that 's a dear ! " " Please do , Torchy ! " says Mildred , snugglin ' up on the other side and pattin ' my red hair soothin ' . " Ah , say , reverse English on the tootsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-throb matinee . G'wan ! " " Why , Torchy ! " says Marjorie , real coaxin ' " I thought we were such good friends ! " " Well , I 'm willin ' to let it go that far , " says I ; " but do n't try to ring in any folksy strangers . I 'm here on business for the firm . " Just then too down comes the maid sayin ' there wa' n't anything to go back ; so I starts to beat it . I did n't get far , though , with a hundred and ninety pound young lady blockin ' the doorway . " Torchy , you must help us ! " says Marjorie . " There is n't anyone else we can ask . And you 're always doing such clever things for Papa and Brother Bob ! " Say , it was a puffy lot of hot air she hands out ; but I admit that after two or three more speeches like that , and with her promisin ' to square anything Piddie might have to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , what 's the proposition ? " says I. " Let 's tell him all , so he will understand just what he 's to do , " suggests Marjorie . And , say , you should have heard them two , with me pinned in between ' em on the couch , givin ' me the tale in a sort of chorus , both talkin ' to once and beginnin ' at diff'rent ends . " It 's such a romance ! " squeals Marjorie . " You see , he 's coming to-night , " says Mildred , " and nobody knows . " " Yes , I got that all down , " says I ; " but what 's the first part ? Who is he and where 's he from ? " Well , it 's some yarn , all right ! Seems that Mildred was a boardin ' school chum of Marjorie 's who 'd come up from Atlanta to spend the summer with friends in Newport . As a wind-up to the season they 'd taken her on a yachtin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ! Nobody aboard but old married folks that played bridge all the time , and one bald headed bachelor who could n't sit out in the moonlight with her unless he was wrapped up in a steamer rug . So what was a girl with eyes like Mildred 's to do , anyway ? She was bein ' bored to death , when , as luck would have it , something went wrong with the propeller shaft . The yacht was ' way up off the coast of Maine at the time , and the nearest place where it was safe to anchor was in the lee of a barren , dinky little island . And they stays there three whole days , while the crew tinkers things up below and the folks yawn their heads off . All but Millie . She got so desp'rate she rowed ashore all by herself . Accordin ' to her description , that must have been a perfectly punk little island . It was all rock , except in a few spots where there was some scrub bushes and mangy grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house surrounded by lobster pots and racks of codfish spread out to dry , and she says it was the smelliest scenery she 'd ever got real close to . But Mildred was sore on the yacht and all the stupid folks on it ; so she wanders out to windward of the worst smells , plants herself on the flattest rock she can find , and prepares to read . That 's her pose when she looks up and discovers this male party with the sun kissed locks and the dreamy eyes standin ' there gazin ' at her curious . " It was n't Adonis that I called him , " says Mildred . " Who was that stunning old Greek that we had the bust of in the school library , Madge ? " " Hermes ? " says Marjorie . " That 's it ! " says Mildred . " He was a perfect Hermes ; only his curly hair was all sun bleached , and his face was tanned a lovely brown , and he had big , broad shoulders , and -- and he was smoking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompts Marjorie . " Oh , they were perfectly stunning , " says she , " real sea blue . " Well , anybody that ever read a midsummer fiction number could have supplied the next chapters . Here 's the lovely city girl , the noble browed but unsuspectin ' native , golden summer days , and no competition . Why , with a catchy title and a few mushy pictures it would make a lovely contribution to one of the leadin ' thirty-five-centers , just as it stood . And Mildred knew her cue , all right . She trains them front row eyes of hers on him , opens up with a few lines of lively chatter , and inside of half an hour she has him sittin ' picturesque at her feet , callin ' him Hermes of the Lobster Pots , and otherwise workin ' the siren spell . " You must have flirted horribly with him , " says Marjorie , sighin ' deep and admirin ' . " What else could one do ? " asks Mildred . " And it was such fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; but he was a charming listener . He would sit and gaze at me in the most soulful , appreciative way . Poor chap ! " He must have had her guessin ' some at that ; for she wa' n't dead sure whether he was a real native or not until the boss of the island shows up . He 's a hump shouldered , leather faced , bushy browed old barnacle , with a Down East dialect that it was a dream to listen to , and it was only when Mildred heard Hermes call him Uncle Jerry that she could believe the two was any relation . Uncle Jerry did n't interfere , though He let ' em moon around on the rocks without disturbin ' the game , and I judge from Millie 's report that she wa' n't missin ' any tricks . Yet she 's right there with the heartless behavior when the time comes , sailin ' away with a gay laugh and leavin ' her blue eyed young lobster man to yearn and mourn there on his smelly little island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it wa' n't until weeks later , when she 'd had her snapshots of him developed and printed , and got to summin ' up the details in this case of Victim B-23 , that she discovers how a few of her own heartstrings has been strained . Somehow she could n't seem to tear them three August days completely off the calendar ; and when the other chappies come buzzin ' around , and she had a chance to frame ' em up alongside of this fish island hero , there wa' n't but one answer . It was Hermes for hers , every day in the week ! There he was , though , out on that mussy rock ; and here she was , visitin ' in New York , leadin ' the giddy life , and gettin ' her gowns ready for the Horse Show . If Millie had passed out the heartaches casual along her former trails , here was where she gets at least one of ' em back on the rebound . You can guess how bad an attack she had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooks up this scheme of sendin ' for Hermes to come to her . Her excuse is that she wants Uncle Jerry to have the trip of his life by coming to the great city ; but incident'lly she urges him to bring his blue eyed nephew along , and the check she sends is big enough to cover expenses for both . Bein ' one of the impulsive kind , she does it the minute the notion strikes her ; and two days later comes this postal from Uncle Jerry , sayin ' how he was much obliged , and him and his nevvy was takin ' the boat for Bosting and expected to fetch up in New York sometime next afternoon by train . " Which is now , " says Mildred . " But of course I ca n't go to the Grand Central to meet him . " " Why not ? " says I. " Why balk at a little thing like that when you 've been doin ' so well ? " " Oh , but , Torchy , " chimes in Marjorie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And what with both of them coaxin ' , and stuffin ' expense money into my pockets , the next thing I know I 'm on my way down to where the Boston trains come in , and am campin ' outside the gate . I nearly wore my eyes out , too , sizin ' up the first trainload , and after an hour 's wait I was gettin ' dizzy keepin ' track of the second lot , when all of a sudden I spots this old chap with the thick underbrush over his eyes and the sole leather complexion . " Oh , you Uncle Jerry ! " I sings out , takin ' a chance and pushin ' through the crowd with my hand out . " Wall , how be ye ? " says he , real hearty . " Do n't remember seein ' you afore ; but I s'pose it 's all right . " " Sure it is , old scout , " says I. " If you 're Uncle Jerry , I 'm Miss Mildred 's reception committee ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he , jerkin ' his thumb at a big , overgrown , tow haired yawp that 's trailin ' along in the rear luggin ' a canvas valise . " You do n't mean to tell me that 's Hermes ? " says I. " I dun'no ' bout any Hermes , " says he ; " but this is my sister 's boy Jake , the only nephew I got , and , bein ' as how Miss Mildred asked so special , I brought him along . " Course , there 's no accountin ' for tastes , specially in a romantic young lady like her ; but , if this was her idea of livin ' Greek statuary , she sure was easy pleased . Why , of all the rough necked Rubes ! He 's one of these loose jawed , open mouthed , lop sided youths that walks like he was afraid of steppin ' on his own feet , and looks about as much alive as a tin rabbit that can wiggle its ears when you pull a string . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his eyes were as blue as a new set of lunch counter crockery ; and if he was all Uncle Jerry could show in the nephew line , then he must be it . " All right , " says I. " It ai n't me that 's pickin ' him . Now fall in line right behind me , and we 'll work out where he wo n't get run down by baggage trucks or be mistaken by excursionists for a spray of autumn leaves . " " Young lady did n't come down to the train , hey ? " says Uncle Jerry . " No , it makes her kind of nervous to see the cars come in , " says I. " You 're due to meet her this evenin ' , Uncle , you and Hermes . " You see , accordin ' to the plan , I was to stow the pair to some hotel , see that they was fed , keep ' em busy durin ' the early part of the evenin ' , and round ' em up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she could ask favors . If Mildred had ' em come where she was visitin ' , there 'd be no end of questions asked ; but if she sort of ran across ' em by accident at a place where there was a crowd , and could have a few words with Hermes in some quiet corner , nobody would be the wiser . It was this last part of the programme I had in mind as I was sizin ' up Jake 's travelin ' costume . And , say , how is it up there in the opodeldoc zone that they can get these high-water pant legs to fit so much like lengths of stovepipe ? They was kind of a bilious brown and cut gen'rous in the seat ; but , as far as real comic relief went , they wa' n't in it with the cute little short tailed cutaway that he sported above ' em . Honest , that coat was enough to make an eccentric song and dance artist green in the eyes ! And you can believe me when I say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Fourth-ave. to a dollar a day house patronized by some of our swellest Texas buyers . My next move is to make a report over the ' phone . " Yep , I got ' em both under lock and key , " says I to Marjorie . " Trouble to pick em out ? Ah , it was a pipe ! Specimens like that ai n't so common anyone could get mixed if they knew what day to look for ' em . Yes , the nephew 's along , all right . His real name is Jake . Well , Hermes if you insist . But , say , ask Miss Mildred if she wants him delivered in the original package , or should I hire some open face clothes for him . " The decision is that Hermes must come in a dress suit , and if he ai n't got any with him Marjorie will send down one of Mr. Robert 's old ones . " Oh , I 'm just dying to see him in evening clothes ! " gushes Mildred over the wire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe , " says I. " Only do n't forget the collar buttons and studs for the dress shirt . " Say , I wo n't dwell on the gay time I had tryin ' to keep that pair out of sight until after dinner . Honest , if I 'd been drivin ' the monkey cage in a circus parade I 'd felt a lot better ; for every fresh gink that pipes off that vaudeville costume of Jake 's has to have his say about it . At the hash house where I steers ' em up against a twenty-five-cent course dinner all the girl waiters got to gigglin ' like they 'd never seen a freak before . It would n't have been so bad with just Uncle Jerry , for he 's wearin ' an old black whipcord that would pass in the dark , and , outside the rubber collar and the plated watch chain looped across his vest , he did n't have the crossroads tag on him very plain ; but Jake might as well have had cowbells tied to him . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel and found this outfit that the girls had scraped together and sent down . " Now we 'll fix you up for the theater and high society , Jake , " says I. " By rights you ought to have some of that neck hemp sheared off ; but I do n't dare let a barber loose at you , for fear Mildred would n't know you after he got through . She raved a lot about that hair of yours , Jake . " " You go on now , Smarty ! " says Jaky boy , grinnin ' expansive . " Think I 'm goin ' to wear duds like them ? " " You do if you appear out again with me , " says I. " So peel the butternut regalia and lemme see if I can harness you up in these . " " Hee-haw ! " remarks Uncle Jerry . " Let him fix you up real harnsome , Jake . " Maybe that 's what I did ; but I would n't want to swear to it . Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the first struggle . Then , while Uncle Jerry held him gaspin ' and groanin ' on the floor , I buttoned the high collar on and fastened the white tie . Next we ended him up on his feet and pulled on the display vest and the long tailed coat . " Ug-g-gh ! It chokes somethin ' awful ! " says Jake , gettin ' purple faced and panicky . " Ah , close that pie gangway of yours and breathe natural for a minute ! " says I. " There , you 're feelin ' better already . Come , pull them knobby wrists back up into your sleeves . This ai n't no swimmin ' lesson , you know . Say , you wear a dress suit like it was so much tin armor . What 's the matter with you , anyway ! " " I -- I do n't know , " says Jake , tryin ' to stretch his head up like a turkey . " I do n't like this . " " You look it , " says I. " But think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! First off , though , you 're goin ' to a show with me . Come on Leven o'clock ! " says Uncle Jerry . " Look here , Son , I ai n't in the habit of stayin ' up all night , remember . I 'll be droppin ' off to sleep for sartin ' . " He do n't , though . All through the play , which has been a two years ' scream for Broadway , he sat as solemn as if he was on a coroner 's jury in the presence of the remains . Play actin ' was new to Uncle Jerry ; but he wa' n't going to give himself away , and he was just as wide awake as anybody in the house . With Jake it was diff'rent . I expect them washed out blue eyes of his had taken in so many new scenes since mornin ' that they could n't absorb any more . Anyway , he gets drowsy before the curtain goes up , and after he 's twisted his neck until he 's got it collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks so calm and peaceful I did n't have the heart to disturb him , and I only jabbed my elbows in his ribs when he got to tunin ' up the nose music too loud . Besides , I was hopin ' a little nap of two or three hours might leave him some refreshed and in better shape for exhibitin ' to Miss Mildred . For the more I saw of Jake , the less I could understand how a real live one like Millie could stand for three days of him , even if she did , discover him on a desert island . And as for ravin ' about him afterwards -- well , you never can tell , can you ? After the play it took Uncle Jerry shakin ' on one side and me on the other to bring Jake back to life from his woodsawin ' act . " Ah , quit it and give the orchestra a chance ! " says I. " And keep them elbows down ! Do n't try to stretch here ; wait until you get back to the open fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're about to butt into society ; so for Heaven 's sake come out of the trance ! " Not havin ' a stretcher handy , we drags him out to the curb , and I blows some more of my expense account against a taxi , which lands us safe and sound at this Fifth-ave. number up in the 70 's . " Guests of Miss Marjorie Ellins , " was to be the password , and the flunky in satin pants at the door seems to have been well posted . " Yes , sir ; right this way , sir , " says he , wavin ' us down the hall and shootin ' us into a little conservatory nook . " The gentlemen from Maine are to wait here , and you are to meet Miss Ellins at the foot of the grand staircase . She will be down in a moment , sir . " " I get you , " says I , and , after cautionin ' Jake to keep on his feet until I came back , I slips out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early arrivals comin ' down from the cloakrooms . It wa' n't a long wait ; for pretty soon down floats Mildred and Marjorie , all got up in flossy party dresses and fairly quiverin ' with excitement . " Oh , you dear boy ! " gushes Millie . " And he is really here , is he ? My splendid Hermes ! Tell me , what did he have to say about it all ? " " Who , Jake ? " says I. " Mostly he was beefin ' about the way his neck ached from the collar . " " Is n't that just like a man ! " says Marjorie . " I do n't care , " says Mildred . " I am just crazy to see him once more . I want to look into his eyes and --  --  " " Then step lively , " says I , " before they get glued up for good . Down this way . Here you are , in there among the palms ! See , there 's Uncle Jerry rubberin ' around ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . " Dear old Uncle Jerry ! But -- but , Torchy , where is -- er -- his nephew ? " " Eh ? " says I. " Why , there on the bench , doin ' the yawn act ! " " Wha-a-a-at ! " gasps Millie , steppin ' in for a closer look . " Straight goods , " says I. " That 's Hermes the lobster picker . " " That ! " says Mildred , shrinkin ' back . " Never ! " " Huh ! " says I. " I told him you would n't know him if he did n't keep that face cavity of his closed . He 's been doin ' that since eight o'clock . But he 's the real article , serial number guaranteed by Uncle Jerry . " " No , no ! " squeals Mildred , covering her face with her hands and backin ' away . " There 's been some dreadful mistake ! That is n't my Hermes . He was n't at all like that , I tell you , not at all ! " Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , when this strange gent strolls by huntin ' for some place to light up his cigarette . And just as one of us mentions Hermes again I notices him turn and prick up his ears . Next thing I knew , he 's stepped over and is lookin ' kind of smilin ' and expectant at Mildred . " I beg pardon if I 'm wrong , " says he ; " but is n't this the -- er -- ah -- the young lady whom I had the pleasure of --  --  " But that 's enough for Millie , just hearin ' his voice . Down comes her hands off her face . " Oh , I knew it ! I knew it ! " she squeals . " Hermes ! " And , say , I do n't know how that old Greek looked ; but if he had the build and lines of this chap he sure was some ornamental . Anyway , the one we had with us would have been a medal winner in any kind of clothes . Also he had the light wavy hair and the dark blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan left on his cheeks . Marjorie 's the next to be heard from . " Why , Mr. Brooke Hartley ! " says she , stickin ' out her hand . " By Jove ! " says he . " Bob Ellins ' little sister , eh ? Hello , Marjorie ! " " Then -- then --  --  " gasps Mildred , lookin ' from one to the other kind of dazed , " then you are n't a lobster man , after all ? " " Nothing so useful as that , I 'm afraid , " says Hartley . " But why were you there on that island ? " she insists . " Well , " says he , " hay fever was my chief excuse . I pretend to paint marines , you know , and that 's another ; but really I suppose I was just being lazy and enjoying the society of Uncle Jerry . " " But he is n't your uncle , truly ? " says Mildred . " Well , " says Hartley , " it 's a relationship I share with most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then a light seemed to break on Mildred . She blushes to her eartips and hides her face in her hands once more . " Oh , oh ! " she groans . " And I called you Hermes ! " " You did , " says he . " And nothing ever tickled my vanity half so much . I 've lived on that for the last two months . Please do n't take it back ! " " I -- I wo n't , " says Millie , lettin ' loose one of them rovin ' glances at him sort of shy and fetchin ' . And , say , all tinted up that way , you could hardly blame him for grabbin ' both her hands . Not knowin ' what might happen next , I proceeds to break in . " In the meantime , " says I , " what 'll you have done with this perfectly good nephew we 've got on our hands back there on the bench ? " " That one ! " says Millie . " Oh , I never want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and -- and go to bed . " " That 'll be welcome news for Jaky , all right , " says I. CHAPTER XIX WHEN MISS VEE THREW THE DARE Say , I guess I might as well tell it right out ; for , from all I hear about myself , my dome must have a glass top that puts all the inside works on exhibition . There 's Zenobia , for instance , who 's my half-step-adopted aunt , as you might say . Now , she ai n't one to sleuth around , or cross-examine , or anything like that ; but what she 's missed of this little affair that I ai n't breathed a word of to anybody is more'n I 've got the nerve to ask . Course , it was her put that corkin ' silver frame on Vee 's picture in the first place . Just found it on my bureau , you know , and , without pumpin ' me for any account of who and why , goes and unbelts reckless for the sterling decoration . A perfectly nice old girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago that was , and there has n't been a word passed about that photo since . Yes , it 's been on the bureau all the time . Why not ? When a young lady friend of yours is dragged off to Europe by her aunt , and sends you a stunnin ' picture of herself for you to remember her by , you do n't turn it face to the wall or chuck it in the ashcan , do you ? Maybe two years it would be , she said , before she came back . It ai n't so long to look over your shoulder at ; but when you come to try squintin ' ahead that far it 's diff'rent . I tried it and gave it up . A whole lot can happen in two years ; so what was the use ? Besides , look who she is , and then think of all I ai n't ! Could n't help seein ' the picture there night and mornin ' , though , could I ? Nothin ' mushy about glancin ' casual at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't got any too many friends , not so many I has to have a waitin ' list ,  - -  and outside of Zenobia and Aunt Martha , and here and there one of the lady typewriters at the office that throws me a smile on and off , they 're mostly men . And as for fam'ly , mother , or father , or sisters , or brothers , or real aunts -- well , you know how I 'm fixed . I 'm the whole fam'ly myself . So you see , when I looks at Miss Vee there , and thinks how nice she was to me them two times when we met by accident ,  - -  once at the dance where I was subbin ' in the cloakroom , and again at the tea where I 'd been sent to trail Mr. Robert -- well , even if she had n't been such a queen , I do n't think I 'd forgot her right away . Course , though , as for figurin ' out why she ever noticed me at all , that 's a myst'ry I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away that I begun sizin ' up some critical the gen'ral style and get up of the party whose hair I was combin ' and whose face I was washin ' more or less reg'lar . Startin ' with the collar , I discovered that mine gen'rally had saw edges , gaped in the middle , and got some soiled about the third day . From then on I 've been particular about havin ' a close front collar and puttin ' on a fresh one every mornin ' , whether I need it or not . Next I got wise to the fact that one tie would n't last more'n six months without showin ' signs of wear , and it wa' n't long before I had quite a collection hangin ' over the gasjet . Up to then I did n't have the tooth powder habit very strong ; but it 's chronic with me now . See the result ? I did n't stop to give myself reasons for gettin ' so finicky ; but the one main fact loomin ' up ahead seemed to be that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that maybe I might be on hand to sort of -- well , you know how you 'll frame things up ? I was to be vice president of the Corrugated by that time , most likely , and they 'd be sendin ' me abroad to look up important matters . That 's how it was goin ' to happen that I 'd find out where Vee was stayin ' . Not that I 'd think of buttin ' in on her and the aunt . Not much ! Just remember I 'd seen Aunty ! No , I was to be on the steamer , leanin ' over the rail careless , when they came aboard to go home . I was to be costumed all in gray . I do n't know just why ; but it looks kind of distinguished , specially if you 've got gray hair . Not that I could count on my ruddy thatch frostin ' up much in a couple of years ; but somehow nothing but gray seemed to fill the bill . I 'd planned on gettin ' one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from London , and a long gray ulster that 'd make me look tall , and a gray cloth hat to match , and gray gloves . Get the picture ? Well , there I am by the rail , lookin ' sort of distinguished and bored and all that , when up comes Miss Vee and Aunty . All I could think of Vee wearin ' was that pink silk affair she had on at the dance , which would n't be exactly what a young lady 'd start out on an ocean trip with , would it ? She 'd be some jarred at seein ' me , it 's likely ; but I 'd lift the gray lid real dignified , throw back the ulster so she 'd get the full effect of the tweed suit , and shoot off some remark about how " one always meets one 's most chawming friends when one travels . " Then I 'd be presented to the aunt ; and after that was over , why it would be just a romp down the home stretch , with yours truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and Vee promenadin ' the deck by moonlight for hours and hours , and gettin ' to be real old friends . But pipe dreams like that do n't often come true , do they ? I ai n't got so far as ownin ' a pair of gray gloves , and not a word has been said about makin ' me vice president , when along comes this foreign picture postcard , showin ' the Boss de Bologna on one side , and on the other this scribbled message : We sail for home on the 10th . Rah ! Rah ! Count Schlegelhessen is coming over with us . He 's a dear . V. A. H. Jolted ! Say , I was up and down so many times durin ' the next few hours I 'd most meet myself comin ' and goin ' . Miss Vee was on her way over ! I 'd bounce at that thought , and get all kind of warmed up inside . Count Schutzenfest is coming with her , and he 's a dear ! Bang ! I 'd strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest . Wa' n't anything more'n I might have looked for , of course . Aunty 's one of the kind that would pick out a Count for Miss Vee , and there was plenty of Counts over there to be picked ; but somehow I could n't picture Vee goin ' wild over one of them foreign ginks . It was clear she had , though . There it was on the postcard , " He 's a dear ! " " Huh ! " thinks I. " Most of ' em are dear -- at any price . " It wa' n't for hours , either , that I simmers down enough for the thought to strike me that I did n't have any special license to hold a court of inquiry over whether Miss Vee was comin ' back with a Count or not . After that I had time to debate with myself whether I ought just to forgive and forget , goin ' through life cold and sad ; or if I should hide my busted heart the best way I could and pretend I did n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pier and standin ' in the background to watch her come ashore with her dear Count ? I could see myself ! Oh , yes , I had it all doped out along them lines ! As Robert Mantell would put it over , " She has went out of muh life for-r-r-rever . " Ah yes ! I could have stood for anything but one of them sausage Counts . So I stows her picture away in the bottom bureau drawer , burns the postcard , and dodges Zenobia 's eye when she looks at me curious . It was all over . Yet I knew to an hour when her steamer would dock , and the mornin ' of the day it was due I rolls out of the feathers at six A.M. Just as natural as could be too , I gets out the new safety razor I 'd had hid away for a couple of months past , and inside of fifteen minutes I 'd had my first shave . Does that get by them keen eyes of Zenobia ! Not for a minute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of casual on one cheek as she comes down to breakfast . That 's all ; but she not only takes in the shave , but the best blue serge suit I 've put on , and the birthday tie , and the Sunday shoes . I only grins sheepish and slides out as soon as I can . You see , accordin ' to my plans , I would n't have gone near that steamer for any sum you could name . That being the case , it was odd I should call up the pier and find out if the boat was on time at Quarantine . Also it was some strange the way I opened up on Piddie . " Say , Mr. Piddie , " says I , " any prospects of an outside run for me to-day ? " " Not in the least , " says he . " I suppose , though , you would like a chance to waste some of the company 's time on the street ? " " Me ? " says I. " Why , I 'd hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , with all this inside work to be done . " " Humph ! " says he . " You need n't fear . I shall see that nothing of the sort happens . " " Ah , you 're a bird , you are ! " says I. " Perhaps , " says Piddie . " Then climb a tree and twitter , " says I ; for it made me grouchy to think I 'd let a bonehead like him get a rise out of me . The more I chewed it over , though , the stronger I was for breakin ' loose about dockin ' time . Maybe I did n't want to go to the pier ; but if he was bent on throwin ' the gate on me , that was another proposition . I got sorer and sorer and I was on the point of chuckin ' the job at Piddie 's head and walkin ' out on my own hook , when who should come stormin ' in , scowlin ' and grumblin ' to himself , but Mr. Robert . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torchy , " says he , wheelin ' around halfway to his office , " ring up Pier Umpty-nine and find out when that blasted steamer is due . " " The Kaiser boat ? " says I. " She 'll dock about two-forty-five . " " Eh ? " says he , some startled . " Now , how the --  -- Never mind , though . Sure about the time , are you ? " " Yep , " says I. " Dash it all ! " says he . " That 's Marjorie , though ! Any word from the Consolidated Bridge people yet ? " " Not yet , " says I , and slam goes his door . Took me three minutes by the clock to dope out the combination too , which shows how gummed up my gears was . But when I 'd fitted them two remarks together , about Marjorie and the bridge people , and had remembered the cablegram from Sister Marjorie sayin ' how their party 'd been broken up on account of sickness and she was comin ' home alone -- why , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arrivin ' durin ' business hours was likely to mess up the schedule . Course , if the bridge concern did n't send word --  --  I 'd got to that point , when in drifts my old A. D. T. runnin ' mate , Hunch Leary , draggin ' his feet behind him and chewin ' gum industrious . Now Hunch do n't look like a tempter . He 's plain homely , that 's all . But comin ' just as he did , with Piddie over there glarin ' at me suspicious -- well , I just had to do it . " Sure I got blanks on me ? " says Hunch . " Wot then ? " Right under Piddie 's nose he fixes it up too , and waits while I takes the phony message in to Mr. Robert . It wa' n't such a raw one , either ; not as if it had sent him off to wait at some hotel . " Will try to get around about two-thirty Trimble , " was all it said . And how did we know Trimble would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mr. Robert , crumplin ' the yellow sheet . " Torchy , you must do the family honors . " " Do which ? " says I , with business of great surprise . " Meet my sister Marjorie , see that she gets through the customs without landing in jail , and take her home in a taxi . Think you 're equal to it , eh ? " says he . " I could make a stab , " says I. " I 'll risk that much , " says he . And before there 's any chance for a revise I 've marched by Piddie with my tongue out and am pikin ' towards the North River with a pier pass in one pocket and expense money in another , specially commissioned to meet the very steamer that 's bringin ' in Miss Vee and her Count . All of which shows how curious things will coincide if you use your bean a little to help ' em along . Well , you know how it is waitin ' in a push of people for a steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to jump at every whistle , and stretchin ' their necks for a peek down the river . It 's as catchin ' as the baseball fever when you 're in a mob watchin ' the scores posted . I finds myself actin ' just as eager as any , and me only doin ' messenger work . Finally the boat shows up ; but instead of sailin ' in graceful and prompt , she shuts off steam and lays to out in the middle of the river , about as lifeless as a storage warehouse afloat , while a dozen or so dinky tugs begin pushin ' and pullin ' to get her somewhere near the pier . Then folks start makin ' wild guesses as to which is their friends . " There 's Uncle Fred , Willie ! " squeals a fat woman next to me , proddin ' me vigorous in the ribs . " Not mine , ma'am , " says I. " Oh , excuse me , " says she . " Why , there 's Willie , over there . Hey , Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around me , and me not even doin ' the wave act . After awhile though , I spots Marjorie . There was no doubt about it being her ; for she looms up among that crowd along the rail like a prize Florida orange in a basket of lemons . It 's plain Marjorie ai n't lost any weight by her trip abroad , and she looks more like a corn fed Juliet than ever . As she wa' n't expectin ' me , but was huntin ' for Brother Robert , I did n't see the sense in shoutin ' . I went on lookin ' over the rest of the passengers , sort of bracin ' myself for any discovery I might make . Would they show up arm in arm , or with their heads close together , or how ? I 'd looked the boat over from bow to stern and back again about three times before I happens to take another glance at Marjorie . And there , almost hid by one side of her , was a young lady in a white sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide brim , and a pair of gray eyes that I could n't mistake anywhere . It was Vee , all right ; just as slim and graceful and classy as ever , with the same independent tilt to her chin , and the same Mayflower pink showin ' in her cheeks . And , say , I want to tell you that about then I was glad I came ! It did n't make any difference if there was half a dozen Counts , and a Duke and what not besides ; just seein ' her once more , even if I did n't get a chance to put over a word , was worth while . And right there I makes up my mind that , Count or no Count , I 'm goin ' to push to the front . " Oh , you Miss Vee ! " I megaphones through my hands , just as enthusiastic as anybody on the pier . About the third call catches her ear . She sort of starts and gazes at the crowd kind of puzzled . There 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could see her turn to Marjorie and say something , and then I gets wise to the fact that the four-eyed gent with the bristly hair and the half gray set of shavin ' brush mustaches , standin ' next to Marjorie , was one of their party . Miss Vee leans over and passes along some remark to him , and he shrugs his shoulders and says something that makes ' em both laugh . " If that 's the Count , " thinks I , " he 's a punk specimen . " A couple of minutes later the boat comes alongside and the passengers break away from the rail to get in line for the gangplank . As I 'm there to welcome Miss Marjorie Ellins , I has to post myself near the E section , and inside of fifteen minutes she 's all through havin ' her suitcase and steamer trunk pawed over , and leavin ' the hold baggage to be claimed later , we streams out to where I had a cab waitin ' . " Is it all aboard , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she . " You see , I 've asked Vee to come home with me for dinner -- the girl I met on the steamer . You do n't mind waiting , do you ? " Did I ? Say , nobody would suspect it , I guess , by the grin I had on when she and Aunty and the four-eyed party comes trailin ' out . " Say , Miss Marjorie , " says I , " is that Count Schutzenbund ? " " Schlegelhessen , " says Marjorie , " and he 's a perfect --  --  " " Yes , I 've heard he was , " says I. " Little antique , though , ai n't he ? " " Why , he is n't forty ! " says Marjorie . " And he 's just too --  --  " There wa' n't time for any more bouquets , though ; for the trio was too close . Must have been some of a surprise for Vee to see me waitin ' there , and for a bit she do n't seem to make out just who it is . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of hers lights up , and them thin lips curls into a smile , and she holds out both hands in that quick way of hers . " Why , it 's Torchy , is n't it ? " says she , half laughin ' . " Uh-huh , " says I , lettin ' the grin spread wider . " Ca n't shake the name or the hair . " " Never try , " says she . " Look , Aunty , here 's Torchy ! " " Torchy ? " says the wide old girl , inspectin ' me doubtful through her lorgnette . " Why , Verona , I do n't remember --  --  " " Oh , yes , you do , Aunty , " says Miss Vee . " Anyway , I 've told you about him , and it 's so jolly to have some one to meet us . Thank you , Torchy . Now let 's see , Marjorie , how do we divide up ? Aunty goes to her hotel -- and -- and where do you go , Count ? " " Me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sure looked it . " But where the young ladies go , there I will follow . Hein ? " He shrugs his shoulders again and puts on such a comical face that it 's no wonder the girls giggled . And that one act maps out the Count for me . He 's just one of them middle aged cut-ups that 's amusin ' to have around , if the sessions ai n't too frequent . Follow the young ladies , would he ? Say , there was only three inside seats to my taxi , and I had n't planned on ridin ' with the driver . " Lemme fix that for you , Count , " says I. " Hey , Cabby ! " and I whistles up a second taxi . " What 's the number , ma'am ? " I asks of Aunty . " Oh , Perzazzer hotel . Get that , Mr. Shuffer ? Here you are , Count , right in here ! " " But is it that -- er -- the young ladies , you see , " he protests . " I haf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be all right too , " says I. " They 'll do the followin ' , though , about a block behind . In you go , now ! " and I shoves him alongside of Aunty , shuts the door , and gives the startin ' signal . Maybe it was a nervy thing , shuntin ' the Count off like that , and Marjorie seems sort of disappointed and dazed to find he ai n't comin ' with us , but by the twinkle in Miss Vee 's eyes I guessed I had n't overplayed my part . Anyway , we had a nice chatty ride on the way up , with Marjorie doin ' most of the chattin ' . Looked like that was going to be about as far as I 'd figure too , for there wa' n't a chance of my gettin ' a word in edgewise ; but when we fetched up in front of the Ellins ' house Miss Vee breaks in with delay orders . " No , Marjorie , " says she ; " you first . Run in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a dinner party on , or a houseful of guests , I 'll come . No , I shall wait until you do . " Course , she did n't plan it that way ; but it gives me about six minutes that was all to the good . " You did n't mind my sidetrackin ' the Count , eh ? " says I. " It was lovely -- and perfectly absurd ! " says Vee . " You know he bores Aunty to death , and Aunty bores him . He had planned on meeting Marjorie 's mother , too . " " Then I mussed things up , did n't I ? " says I. " I believe you did it purposely , you wretch ! " says she , shakin ' a finger at me . " Who would n't ? " says I. " See what I get by it ! " " Silly ! " says she . " I 've a mind to rumple those red curls . " " Go on , " says I , takin ' my hat off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do nothing of the kind , " says she . " You have n't even said you were glad to see me . " " I 'm keepin ' it a dead secret , " says I. " What happened to Europe ; was it on the fritz ? " " Poky , " says she . " And they found out I was no musical genius , after all . Aunty 's disgusted with me . " " She ought to take something for her taste , " says I. " Oh ! " says she , tiltin ' her head on one side . " Then you still approve of me ? " " That 's the only motto on my wall , " says I , " only I put it stronger . " " Silly ! " says she once more . And then -- well , I was watchin ' the pink spread up her cheeks , and was sort of gazin ' into them big gray eyes , and gen'rally takin ' one of them long , lingerin ' looks ; and we was both leanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides of the cab shuttin ' everything else out -- and then all of a sudden I heard her sort of whisper " Well ? "  - -  and - -  and - -  Ah , say ! With a pair of cherry ripes as close as that , what else was there to do ? " Why , Torchy ! " says she , jumpin ' away . " What made you dare --  -- Quick , now , here comes Marjorie . Over on the front seat ! And -- and perhaps I shall see you again sometime . " " Your eyesight 'll be bad if you do n't , Vee , " says I. " Good-by . " Just before the Ellins ' front door closed behind her I caught the wave of a handkerchief ; so I guess she ca n't be so awful mad . Ride back to the office ? Say , I paid off the taxi and floated down Fifth-ave. as light as if it was paved with gas balloons . " Huh ! " grunts Mr. Robert , after I 'd made my report . " Brought home a steamer friend , did she ? Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me , " says I , " it 's Vee . You remember -- the one at the girls ' boardin ' school tea party when --  --  " " Eh ? " says he . " Ah , that one ? Then it wasn't -- er -- exactly a hardship for you to meet this particular steamer , eh , Torchy ? " " Do I look it ? " says I. And Mr. Robert he winks back ; for , as I happen to know , he 's been there himself . It 's that friendly wink though , that makes me remember puttin ' up that game on him with the fake message , and somehow I felt cheap and mean . Here he was , treatin ' me white and square , and I 'd been handin ' him a piece of fresh bunk . " Mr. Robert , " says I , standin ' pigeontoed and flushin ' up some , " you remember that message from the bridge people -- Trimble , it was signed ? " " Oh , yes , " says he . " He came , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says I , and walks out . For when things start comin ' your way in clusters like that , what 's the use tryin ' to duck ? **71;2537;TOOLONG EDGAR RICE BURROUGH 'S NOVELS May be had wherever books are sold .
