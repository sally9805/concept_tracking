txt BILLY SUNDAY . Opinions of Readers on the Question Put by Princess Troubetzkoy . In your issue of May 2 you print a question from Prilicess Troubetzskoy ( Amelie Rives ) in regard to a quotation from Billy Sunday . I did not hear the remark which is quoted . If it was not made , I hope Mr. Sunday will refute it . If it was , I would like to be " one of the public " to answer the Princess emphatically in the affirmative . I do consider such language blasphemous . As a Christian woman and worker , in common with all other Christians , I would not lay a straw in the way of any good Mr. Sunday can do in this city . or any city , but no person , community , or age can rise above its conception of a God , and I feel sure many Christians feel great *regret , while giving Mr. Sunday due credit and sympathy for all his sincerity and the good he accomplishes , that he presents God and Jesus ( Thrist below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see real benefit in bringing God and Christ as familiar friends to tile man or woman to whom ? lie has seemed afar off , this age surely needs to have its sense of reverence strengthened . not weakened , and to have a God too much occupied with great events to learn modern slang . In reply to the inquiry of Amelie Rives in today 's TIMES . I should like to say that because Billy Sunday places ordinary . " vulgar slang of the street " in the mouth of Jesus Christ , he is not therefore necessarily blasphemous . If the idea behind a phrase is reverent , no language can make it irreverent . It is the idea that counts . Were Mr. Sunday to discuss his subject in proper theological terms , it is doubtful whether he would  --  or could  --  have the same effect on his hearers as he has by using the language most familiar to them , that same " vulgar slang of the street .

ONE OF " THE PUBLIC . " Princess Troubetzkoy might find an explanation of Billy Sunday 's coupling of an amazing vernacular with the name of Jesus Christ in the fact of an amazing familiarity with the personality of Jesus Christ . In terms of intimate friendship Sunday recognizes Christ and translates His message to the " lobsters , " " four-flushers , " &c.; In terms of Billy Sunday 's vernacular the Word can have its most pungent message for the proletariat . It is ' not blasphemous to call sin by Its name . We have yet to read that Sunday has blasphemed . A Shallow Concept . Princess Troubetzkoy 's " Question for the Public " in this morning 's TIMES was one I would like to have answered . Revolting as are many of Mr. Sunday 's coarse and vulgar utterances . his references to Christ make one recoil . His conception of Christ is so shallow ! What reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who without a parable spoke not unto them in the Gospel days has changed and would speak to any one in the language Mr. Sunday thinks He would use . I was very glad to see Princess Troubetzkoy 's letter , and am sure many others were . A READER , A Shock to Church Members . I agree with Amelie Rives in her letter to the public concerning Billy Sunday and his irreverent language . The spirit of Christ is what true ministers of the Gospel desire to preach and exemplify , and to many church members who have gone to hear Billy Sunday in a spirit of sympathy ho has been a shocking disappointment . E. D. M. New York , May 2 , 1917 . According to Matthew . To the Editor of The New York Times : May in answer to the letter of Amelie Rives in TIID Tares of today , ask her what she thinks of the language which Jesus used on one occasion , when He said : " Ye serpents . Al offspring of vipers. how shall ye escape the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Billy Sunday 's any stronger than this ? WILLIAM D. MURRAY . New York , May 2 , 1917 . From an Episcopalian . To the Editor of The New York Times : From my own study and interpretation of Jesus Christ I have learned to love him not only as our Saviour , but as a man who could not use such language as quoted by Billy Sunday , and my whole ideal of Christ is too exalted for me to wish to hear any one apply such sentiments or language to him . It is not for me to ignore the good that Mr. Sunday has done and is doing . I hope I am not so narrow as that . Only an Episcopalian is not used to such utterances and ca n't understand them as related to the most sacred instincts of the human soul . New York , May 2. 1917 . A FRIEND . Many Agree . To the Editor of The New York Times : In answer to the question propounded in your paper this morning . I desire to say that the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends , and I myself consider the quotation from one of Billy Sunday 's sermons blasphemous . I hope a great many others who really believe that it is will say ea.
