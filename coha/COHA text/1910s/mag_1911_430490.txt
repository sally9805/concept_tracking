 | WALL STREET , going east from Broadway , left the section of the importing drygoods merchants . Two thirds of its length down , it dipped and sloped to the East River . Here were the merchants of the raw materials . Down Pearl Street , to the south , the cotton brokers spread their white samples on their Hue-topped tables ; to the north were the merchants of tobacco and spice ; and down the slope of Wall Street the great East and West India merchants of tea and coffee and sugar sat in their dismal red-brick counting - houses . Below them , at the end of the street , they saw the spars of their square-riggers moored along South Street , which ran like a long piazza in front of old New York . Half way down Wall Street , on top of the hill behind the foreign merchants , lay the New York stock market of 185o . It was a small affair at that time ; an hour and three quarters a day was enough time for all its business . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend its money building railroads . Other sections did that ? particularly New England . New York laid aside its money , and , when hard times came , it bought bankrupt railroads low for cash . and , one by one , it brought them down to Wall Street . Now it has practically all of them . This has been done by the New York merchants . the men who know how to handle money . The merchant , in the old meaning of the word in New York fifty years ago , ? a meaning that still persists in London , ? was the last and greatest figure in commercial life . He handled money , or staple goods ? food and drink and clothing ? that were continually and readily turned into money . He was a silent , aggressive , domineering figure ; hard experience on  | land and sea had hammered him into the highest form of arbitrary and self-reliant individualism in the world . The first article of his creed was , Mind your own business ; the second , Always keep your capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't you will surely get into trouble ; if you do , you can get incredible bargains when the squeeze comes . Infant Communism and the Merchants This railroad business was certainly a strange , new , experimental thing . Hundreds of thousands of people all over this country and Europe put in the money that built these roads , in small sums . The people who contributed most of this had nothing at all to say about managing these roads ; they were merely creditors ? holders of bonds . Everybody and everything owned the stock , which had the voting power ? towns and counties , and mortgaged farmers , and sharp promoters and blacklegs . If everybody 's business was nobody 's business , as Americans were taught with their catechism , this helpless , accidental infant communism was the craziest business organization on the face of the earth . Certainly no sane merchant cared to embark in such an enterprise . There was one stock , though , that a merchant could buy ? the stock of banks . Here was an investment as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time and close out your loans ; and there was your money in your hand again . If you ran a hank right , alone or with other sound men , you got the use of still more ready money , and you had a still greater instrument of safety and profit in the day of financial disaster . Half a century ago and more the situation was clearly laid out . Here were the public , the mortgaged farmers , and the mortgaged towns , and the mortgaged counties , and the holders of bonds in Europe ; here were New England and Pennsylvania and the South ? all with their capital nailed up tight in this railroad equipment , this stuff you could neither eat not wear nor sell when you most wanted to . And here were the merchants of New York in the normal position of experienced men ? their capital where it could readily be reached , their surplus capital invested in banks . Even then they had the ready money , and the others had the stock . The Banks of the Merchants At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West India house of G. G. &; S. Howland , known throughout civilization and far beyond . The last and possibly the greatest of the great New York merchants ? Moses Taylor ? served his apprenticeship there . He was born , learned his trade , and spent his whole business life within a block or two of Wall Street . He was brought up in the strictest traditions of the merchants , his father being confidential agent for that great old trader , John Jacob Astor . In 1832 , when Taylor was twenty-six years old , he started in the West India business himself ; in 1856 he became president of the old City Bank , the bank of the merchants in raw materials . The New York merchants all had their banks , each merchant according to his kind . To the north of Wall Street , toward the East River , where the tan-yards lay in " the Swamp , " were the banks of the leather merchants . The banks of the great dry-goods trade ? the Park , the Chemical , and later the Importers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they edged up Broadway . For many years they were , quite naturally , the greatest banks of the place , for the importing dry-goods trade was enormous . The leading bank of the raw materials ? the City ? staved where it was first founded in 1812 , in the old center , the ancient banking row on the north side of Wall Street . It did not grow so fast as the banks of the dry-goods merchants . But in a new country , a continent of raw materials , it was destined at last to grow a great deal larger . To start with , Moses Taylor was the chief figure in the great raw-sugar trade . The rich Cuban planters deposited their money with him , and left him with the reams of United States government bonds into which they had put their savings against the long-expected time of Cuban revolution . In the second place , it was a strong cotton bank , the financial institution that moved a good share of the largest , safest , and most valuable American crop going abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such houses as the great importing metal firm of Phelps , Dodge &; Company , which was always represented on its board of directors . I t was ? what a strong bank must be ? a federation of interests still greater and stronger than itself . Moses Taylor , too , had his own idea of a bank . First of all , it must be strong ; his pride was his cash reserve . The City Bank was always run on the formula , not of the ordinary commercial bank , but of the richest and most conservative old-time merchant , with a great holding of surplus cash . Whenever there was a panic , the bank grew . A panic is a time when everybody puts his money , in the safest place he knows . It is the day of reckoning , the time of the survival of the fittest , in the world of business . Moses Taylor 's bank was safe and strong ; with every panic it grew stronger .  | The Beginnings of Wall Street The panic of 1857 came . Down went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculative merchants who had gone into them . Moses Taylor had looked into a new field of raw materials ? the anthracite-coal region a couple of hundred miles west of New York ; it seemed to him that there was sense in it . He took his money in his hand and went out and bought the Delaware , Lackawanna , ' &; Western Railroad , exactly as he would buy a horse and a deliverywagon . He paid cash for it ; he never bought on margin . But , by waiting , he paid $5 a share ? less than any ordinary margin . Seven years later the stock of the road was worth $240 a share to him . Nall Street was still a small and provincial stock market in 1857 . There were only 24,000 miles of railway in the country ? about a tenth of the mileage of to-day ; and on the New York stock market appeared only a dozen little local roads , none of them over 400 miles long , and most of them not built by New York capital . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , the current records showed sales of less than 5,000 shares of railroad stocks in the two New York exchanges , about one per cent of an ordinary day of recent years , and all these were in thirteen little railroads . Vanderbilt had not come into railroads yet . Moses Taylor , with his coal road , with three and a half million dollars capital , was the greatest railroad magnate in New York . He took his railroad and went hack to his bank and operated it . And so another big business in raw materials ? anthracite coal and iron ? came into the federation about the City Bank . Taylor 's mercantile business was now brought upstairs at 52 Wall Street , over his bank ; he bought largely into the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company ; made it depositary and trustee for the mortgages on his railroad ; established the offices of the coal road in the second story above it ; and put his man , Samuel Sloan , in charge of the destinies of the railroad and the trust company . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy , side-whiskered autocrat , on a platform in the rear ? always arriving , on foot , at nine o'clock . Moses Taylor and His Institutions Below him , down the aisle , he could watch his clerks at work ( clerks were nothing but irresponsible day-laborers in those days ) , and see every customer who came into the bank . Depositors were not solicited ; they came , hat in hand , to be taken in ; and they came to Moses Taylor . It was a one-man institution ? Moses Taylor 's . He would not even mail dividends to his stockholders . He made them come in and take their money out of his hands . Commodore Vanderbilt arrived , and dragged his captured country railroads into Wall Street . He was a depositor in Moses Taylor 's bank ; but never would Moses Taylor become a stockholder in Vanderbilt 's railroads . There was not room enough in one railroad for Vanderbilt and Taylor , and Taylor knew it . So Moses Taylor went his own way , with his own enterprises . He bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's cotton business came from ? in Georgia and in Texas ; his portrait went on Southern railroad bonds ? an assurance to timid investors . He bought , for cash , at a great bargain , the majority control of the greatest gas company in New York ? held it ancLoperated it . He early developed and controlled the coal-and-iron business around his Lackawanna Railroad . And all these interests ? railroads and coal companies and gas companies , and the banks where they put their money ? came into the great general federation of merchants that centered where he sat on his platform in the old City Bank at 52 Wall Street . Occasionally he would go out to attend to his other enterprises , or visit the office of his coal road . And the clerks would look up from their desks , in the narrow lane of Exchange Place , to hear the laughter of the august , side-whiskered financial presences , as John Brisbin , the fat superintendent of the road , told Gargantuan tales to Moses Taylor and Samuel Sloan in the office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at length , in 1882 , in the fulness of his years , the last of the great merchant princes died . The tow-headed boy who had watched the ships come in , from the pretty residential park on the Battery , when New York had been the low , red-brick town of the sea traders , had lived to the day of the great modern corporation , and to head the greatest federation of merchants which controlled these great business structures . Around the City Bank were assembled still the sugar merchants , the cotton brokers , the metal merchants , the strongest of the interests of anthracite coal , the greatest of the New York gas companies , and a variety of Southern railways , and , by a growing affiliation of interests , the resources of the Vanderbilts , the greatest railroad fortune of the day . Behind it all stood the enormous fortune of Moses Taylor himself , almost entirely in stocks , and  | estimated , at the prices of that day , at some $50,000,000 . Wall Street in 1882 was scarcely greater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of railroad in the United States then , nearly half as many as now . But comparatively few were dominated in New York . What were there had been dragged in ? as all roads to New York have been ? by thorough unbelievers in the much-advertised , theoretical democracy of modern corporations . Things were going badly with the irresponsible , headless , popularly owned railroads . The promoter had arrived and captured them , and was looting them or driving them recklessly into a disastrous future . But the time had not yet arrived for the conservative autocrats of ready money to take them and bring them into New York . It was impossible to get the right grip on them . The Vanderbilts had brought in their chain of the chief railroads of New York State , and the extension through Chicago into Omaha . Gould had put his blighting hand on the Union Pacific , and had taken and patched together the Wabash through the Middle West . J. Pierpont Morgan , that arch-merchant and son of a merchant , was beginning to invade Pennsylvania and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big Philadelphia house , the Drexels . But Philadelphia still controlled the coal roads , and the Pennsylvania , the greatest railroad in America . Baltimore still had the great Baltimore &; Ohio . New England still controlled its own railroads , and the strong roads of the Middle West and beyond the Mississippi which the courage and enterprise of her old merchant class had built . And the great Southern Pacific and Central Pacific roads were still held by the daring California merchants who had built them . The Wall Street market , though always noisy and spectacular , was still a small thing compared with the solid , silent influences that clustered about such institutions as the City Bank . But now , in 1882 , the great man was gone ? the strong personality that had built up this great commercial federation ; and his son-in-law reigned in his stead . Percy R. Pyne , a kindly , gentle man , who had had charge of the old Taylor mercantile business upstairs , came down to the gloomy room below , with little heart for ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the president 's desk , occupied with his own account books , while his cashier ran the bank . Then , one day , he had his stroke . He came back about his work again , a pitiful figure , not long for life . And another merchant and great leader of merchants came to rule the City Bank ? James Stillman . James Stillman ? Merchant A strange figure , James Stillman , not understood clearly by any man , except for his one main governing characteristic , which is very clear . He stands today , with one other man alone , ? J. Pierpont Morgan , ? as the chief , most uncompromising survival of the beliefs , enthusiasms , and prejudices of the old merchant class . His father , like so many of the old New York merchants , was a New Englander ; a resident , like Morgan 's father , of Hartford , Connecticut . Stillman himself , as it happened , was born in 185o at Brownsville , that far lower end of Texas , where his parents had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after a great tract of land that he had purchased for a song . Young Stillman was a shy , reticent child , trained from the first to the virtues and accomplishments of the merchant class . One of his earliest playthings , which he still preserves , was a toy bank , across the front of which he had printed " City Bank , " his father being even then associated with the City Bank interests and Moses Taylor. - He was sent to a boys ' school up the Hudson ; he was prepared for college , when his father was stricken with paralysis , and he was thrown into business at the age of seventeen . He started in the cotton business on South Street , near Wall , in New York . The older partner in the business was a close attendant of the reign of Moses Taylor in the City Bank ; his younger partner was William Woodward , a thick-set , aggressive man from Baltimore .  | Stillman did not care for routine business . His reticence , which amounts almost to an idiosyncrasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . His work was principally with the financial end of the firm . He was a great deal at his place in Newport , and on his yacht ? a rich man , and a rich man 's son , who did n't have to apply himself to business detail ; always silent , yet always with a gift for being with men of power and financial knowledge . And all this time he was under preparation for his great work of associating the chief commercial interests of the country . Stillman and William Rockefeller It was in the ' 80 's that he laid the foundations for the great commercial federation which he was to establish . By this time the American merchants of food products and raw materials had grown to stupendous proportions in two lines ? the handling of meats and oils . The men at the head of these two enterprises , the . Armours and the Rockefellers , had exactly the same business formula as the old-time merchants of New York , magnified by the size of their operations : mind your own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your hand on it . The cash accumulations of the Standard Oil Company in particular were astonishingly great . In the early ' 80 's the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul Railroad , seeking , as railroads are always compelled to do , the alliance and the assistance of the class with ready money , placed on its board of directors William Rockefeller , James T. Woodward , president of the Hanover National Bank of New York , and James Stillman . Philip D. Armour , as the magnate of the Middle West , was also a member of the board . Woodward and Stillman represented a good financial connection in the Hanover Bank . In 1876 William Woodward , Stillman 's partner in the cotton business , had bought , with his brother , James T. Woodward , a dry-goods merchant , the interest of two other dry-goods merchants , J. &; J. Stewart , which held a managing control of this bank . Stillman was supposed to be financially interested in the bank from the first , but he was not director until 1883 . The hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' personal and business connections were . In 1885 William Rockefeller was made a director of the institution . And from that time on the Stillman and Rockefeller interests have been closely tied together . The bond , as such bonds are apt to be , has been quite largely a personal one between William Rockefeller and Stillman . John D. Rockefeller has never been in close alliance with Stillman . He has rarely , if ever , put his foot inside the City Bank . But William Rockefeller and he are personal friends , as well as business associates , and their own friendship has been cemented by the marriage of their children . When James Stillman was elected president of the City Bank in 1861 , there were two chief reasons for it : first , there was no one else in sight ; and , second , he was a man of ability , sure to represent , to some extent , the traditions of the institution . He had been familiar , in both a personal and business way , with the bank since his youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the choice of Stillman  | meant the choice of a banking genius , and the tying together of the two interests in which an identical policy had reached the highest success in America ? the City Bank , with its various interests , and the Standard Oil Company . The most successful merchants of the country , the men who were at that time beginning to astonish and frighten the country with their new " trusts , " had always held to the identical old formula of Moses Taylor ? personal control , silence , and ready money . They lent their money out to Wall Street . The Arbuckles , merchants of coffee , lent millions ; and many a Wall Street man can still remember going in for his loans to the dingy offices of the American Sugar Refining Company on eastern Wall Street , passing over the sticky floor , and having his 850,000 or $100,000 check handed out to him from the little window into the office , where he pushed through his bundles of collateral in exchange . The Standard Oil concern had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in fact it owed its very existence to these qualities . For it alone had stores of money large enough to save and buy the tremendous quantities of that remarkable natural product , petroleum , which without the presence of masses of ready capital for storing it would be entirely lost ; but which can be bought for cash by the interest having money and machinery prepared for taking it , on a basis exactly similar to buying gold dollars for fifty cents. * William Rockefeller had been for twenty-five years in charge of the financial office of the Standard Oil Company in New York ? really a great bank . No living man knew better the use of ready money as a tool , or what tremendous profits it would bring of its own power against men who were on the verge of ruin for not having it . Stillman , the silent , undemonstrative , broadly observant man of business , who had passed through life without any great enthusiasms , was now aroused , his imagination touched by the unbounded power of that wonderful instrument ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant in cotton , and William Rockefeller , merchant in oil , went out , in the early ' 90 's , exactly as Moses Taylor had done half a century before , and established themselves firmly at the foundations of the financial system of New York . Moses Taylor had taken absolute control of the National City Bank . These men did exactly the same thing on a much greater scale . They put together an aggregation of the largest and soundest banks in New York . It was no temporary arrangement , likely to be overthrown . They and their close associates held or bought them ; that is , with one exception , they bought a majority of the stock of these banks . And they now own it . The City Bank is owned , through an absolute majority holding of their stock , by the Taylor estate , held in the hands of trustees , and James Stillman . William Rockefeller is a large stockholder . The Taylor estate , Stillman , and William Rockefeller own an absolute majority of the Farmers ' Loan and Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage , though not an actual majority , of  | the United States Trust Company . The Woodward family and James Stillman own an actual majority of the Hanover Bank . These are the strongest , most conservatively managed banks and trust companies in New York to-day . They preserve the best practices and traditions of the old commercial class . Eighteen years ago the Stillman-Rockefeller combination was in practical control of them . Around them were not only these banks , but the Standard Oil Company , the Taylor estate , and many of the greatest and most conservative fortunes and enterprises of America . They had not gone out and invested great sums of money in these things . They were simply in the midst of a large , cumulative power . Most of the fortunes and companies had grown from nothing in the past quarter century . The stock of the banks , held from the beginning , or bought at a comparatively early date , had required relatively little investment , compared to the resources they held . But there were tens of millions of dollars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their control . They were in a position almost unique in America . And then the panic of 1893 came . 1893 the Creation of Wall Street General disaster , threatening for at least a decade , came at once upon the great , headless , exploited , popular experiments ? the railroads of America . A third of them , including many of the largest , went bankrupt ; that is , the value of their stock was wiped out . Even the value of their bonds was cut into . In the stock market down on Broad Street , a couple of blocks from the old City Bank , and in the various markets of other large cities in the country , the world seemed to be coming to an end with a loud noise . The great promoters who had built or taken up the railroads of the country clung desperately to the vanishing stock equities by which they held them . Old Collis P. Huntington had a typical experience . The market value of his great holding of Southern Pacific stock fell straight down . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for loans . Stocks fell lower still . He pledged his miscellaneous securities . They fell again . He pledged his real estate , his pictures , the very furniture in his house . When it was all in ? every dollar he had in the world ? he went upstairs , sat down in his private room , and sent down word to his servants to tell every man who called to see him on business to " go to hell . " His courage and the very greatness of his obligations saved him . The banks dared not let him fail . And , little by little , stocks came up again , and he was saved . But Huntington was a marked exception -- an exceptional promoter and an exceptional man . The rank and file of railroad managers . small and great , lost their properties in and about this time . The irresponsible idealist , playing with other people 's money , the man who took up a property to gut it and throw it down again ? all passed with the crash . The great popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the merchants of New York reached out and took them with an iron hand , and dragged them down to Wall Street . Before the ' 90 's scarcely a third of the railroads had their main headquarters in New York .  | Five years after the panic almost all of them were there . It was the creation of Wall Street as we know it now ? the establishment of a single central stock market for the continent . There is often unnecessary wonder at the control of Wall Street . Wall Street was controlled before it existed , by the very terms of its making . It was J. P. Morgan who first took these railroads , reorganized them , and brought them under individual control . He and his chief lieutenant , Charles H. Coster ? a graduate , like Moses Taylor , of an old South Street importing firm ? were the principal figures engaged in dragging in the local roads from Boston and Philadelphia and Baltimore to New York . Each one they took they held under an absolute power of rule ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their trustees for a term of years , or until the roads paid dividends again . Morgan largely represented English capital . Kuhn , Loeb &; Company , Speyer &; Company , and other Hebrew firms , who , after him , took the most considerable part in the reorganization of American railroads at this time , represented the investments of Germany . These sources had contributed a large proportion of the actual money for building American railroads , through their purchases of bonds . The foreigners , when the period of depression began . had their money very largely in these bonds ; when it ended , they still held bonds . The merchants of New York held the stock . Teo Groups of Railroad Owners I t was , in fact , a very surprising spectacle when the American railroads emerged from bankruptcy in the late ' qo 's and early 1900 's . They had gone in under a variety of stock control , well spread out over the United States . They came out practically entirely under the control of two small groups of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Morgan had piled up , under his temporary control of the voting trust , about a fifth of the railroads of the country . Many of these he still holds , under these same trusts ; he saw to it that the rest did not go back to the vagaries of popular rule or the tender mercies of promoters . Before their voting trusts expired , he had bequeathed them by stock sale , at the nominal prices of the day , to a group of men he trusted , and of which he soon became the center . This combination might be called the railroad banking combination. * The second group , which took the greater and more profitable of the two parts of rail road ownership , was the group of the great merchants of raw materials and foods , gathered around the National City Bank . Stillman had , one by one , associated them with his bank ; by his success in building up the institution to its extraordinary power and serviceability to their needs , he had made it almost an essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had created the federation of merchants on his directorate as it practically exists to-day , holding the representation of the greatest industrial corporations in the world ? the Standard Oil , the United States Steel Company , the American Sugar Company , Armour &; Company , and the international Harvester Company . This group were the cash buyers of America . They had systematized a great new power ? the power of always being able to buy when everybody else has to sell . In a period when very many sound railroad stocks were worth from a fifth to a tenth of what they were to be worth ten years later , they had both the power and the business sagacity to buy almost indefinitely . They already controlled the greatest of the industrial concerns , and in buying their railroad stock they bought the future management of a great portion of American railways ? and with their management , as is the case in any business , a large share of their future profits . The Union Pacific Comes In The City Bank grew by leaps and bounds after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became president of the bank , it had about $12,000,000 deposits ; in 1892 it had 8i6,000,000 ; before the end of the panic year it had $31,000,000 . Men , as usual at such times , went hurrying with their money to the safest place they knew . In 1891 there were several New York banks with double the deposits of the City ; two years later it was the greatest bank in New York , and the greatest reservoir of cash in America . For this reason the bank added to its federation , in 1897 , an interest that was to become even greater than the Standard Oil Company ; that is , the Union Pacific Railroad . Kuhn , Loeb &; Company , the private bankers who reorganized the road , had had no previous affiliations with the City Bank , or the **26;362;TOOLONG interests behind it . They came to it simply because the Union Pacific reorganization ? with its payment of 845,000,000 to the United States government ? was the greatest cash transaction of its kind ; and the City Bank was the natural instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up in the  | next few years , was with exactly the same old type of men ? Jacob H. Schiff , head of the former firm of clothing merchants , Kuhn , Loeb &; Company ; Henry C. Frick , the former steel and coke maker ; Edward H. Harriman , the former stock broker . These , with James Stillman and William Rockefeller , were soon the managers and practical owners of the Union Pacific Railroad . There were no railroad men in this aggregation , although Harriman afterward became a very great one . But the time had arrived when the merchants and their legitimate successors , the New York bankers , would own the railroads , and hire the railroad men to operate them . This would seem odd in other kinds of business . In railroads it was not only natural . it was inevitable . The City Bank group did not own the Union Pacific at first ; they gradually acquired it . The reorganization syndicate got millions of stock as a fee ; Harriman and others bought millions more at between 820 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their conflict with the Morgan-Hill alliance over the Northern Pacific road , their syndicate bought outright a quarter of the stock of the Union Pacific ? raising most of the money needed by hypothecating it on the usual margin with the financial institutions of New York . From this syndicate the holding went naturally into the private ownership , where it now remains ; that is , about a third of the stock ? which constitutes an absolutely controlling interest in a property of this kind ? went into the hands of William Rockefeller , James Stillman , Kuhn , Loeb &; Company , and E. H. Harriman . The Union Pacific , as is generally known , was as much a bank as a railroad . It kept and handled great cash resources with all the skill of the interests back of it , the best skill and tradition that exists in this country . In a decade , through the brilliant management and speculations of Harriman and the solid backing of the City Bank group behind him , it had rolled up a billion and a half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the central StillmanRockefeller interest behind the City Bank , it held a working control of two billion more . Meanwhile the huge industrial fortunes behind the bank ? in a market where everything , from kerosene to railroads , was rising ? were rolling over and over for investment . William Rockefeller and his friends had a working control of the St. Paul road ; John Rockefeller , together with the decadent management of jay Gould 's estate , had control of the big Gould system , and had large investments in the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad , which dominates New England . The Rockefellers , the Taylor estate , and Stillman controlled the Lackawanna . The Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan ? somewhat less closely allied at that time ? added the control cf nearly all of the remaining strong railroad groups in the country to the federation about the bank . Between them all they held a practical control of three quarters of the railroads in the country . The Triumph of Individualism The world had moved a great way since Moses Taylor started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of little enterprises owned by small capitalists had grown into great industrial enterprises , in the private hands of a few inconceivably successful men . The careless communism that had built and begun to operate the railroads had come to an end . For hundreds of thousands of owners . without adequate knowledge or voice in the management of these enterprises , had been substituted the control and management of the fiercest and most aggressive type of individualism in the world . It had been a duel for ten years between a loose and inefficient industrial democracy and a keen and highly trained autocracy . And although every surface indication and every outcry had been in favor of democracy , the management of industrial affairs had gone steadily , and toward the last very rapidly . into private hands . The greatest of the industrial enterprise were either in the family ownership or the control of a few men . The railroads , tied together into large systems , were held largely by two small federations of capitalists on a very simple plan , worked out by half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of the stock of the great central railroad systems . The bonds that made three fifths of the railroad capital of the country , and the other two thirds or three quarters of the railroad stock , were scattering more and more widely into the ownership of the public . But the controlling interests remained in private hands . And now these individual owners were seen to be gathering more or less clearly about the banking interests of Wall Street . There was a loud public outcry . For what good reason was the concentration of corporate wealth in single hands to be concentrated once again ? What was this Wall Street , this " money power , " this City Bank ? . ' The Rise of the " Money Power " Now , before the panic of 1803 there was no ' money power . " There was none because  | there was no Wall Street , no central continental stock market , as there is to-day . The greatest hanks of New York City and the country were not Wall Street banks ; they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park and the Importers ' and Traders ' . The greatest of them had barely touched $25,000,000 Of $30,000,000 in deposits . The modern trust company had not arrived . Then the railroad panic came , the formation of the great new industrial combinations , the great corporate development of the ' 90 's . The merchants took charge of Wall Street , and established and built up , through a period of fabulous expansion , their old favorite investment and business instrument ? the conservative and aggressive bank . In 189o , in the combination that came together three or four years later in the StillmanRockefeller banking alliance ? that is , in the City and Hanover , banks , and in the Farmers ' Loan and United States Trust companies ? there were only $125,000,000 of resources , all told ; less , that is , than half of the present resources of the City Bank alone . Times revived ; a series of great crops , accompanied by European famine , built up the re-  | sources of the West ; money was accumulating throughout the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . by the public contribution of capital to the vast improvements , against which the railroad managements were issuing bonds ; second . by the huge surpluses piled up by industrial enterprises . The money raised for railroad improvements was generally stored in the New York banks until it was needed . The great industrial corporations placed their surpluses there . Country banks sent in their balances to lend on stock collateral . It was a financial revolution . With the creation of modern Wall Street , and the final centralization of the corporate life of the country about it , - those huge new structures , the financial banks , began to mount up out of the old banking ley el , like the skyscrapers out of the old commercial town of New York . James Stillman started at once to construct in the City Bank the greatest institution on the continent . He had , as deposits ? or could secure when mutually profitable ? the tens of millions of cash reserves of the Standard Oil Company ; the cash resources of the Union Pacific during its earlier period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still is , the chief depositary of the city of New York ? often holding 5i o , 000,000 of its money at a time . In 1891 the deposits in the City Bank had been Si 2,000,000 ; they had risen with the panic to $31,000,000 in the last of 1893 ; they grew again , in i$q7 , with the Union Pacific reorganization , to $05,000,000 . By i9oo they had touched yr20,000,000 . The total resources of the bank in that year were Si9o,000,00onine times what they had been in 189o . The City Bank had liquidated one large downtown bank and had got most of its deposits ; the owners of the City Bank had bought half a dozen smaller New York banks by ' goo or inoi ; the owners of the Hanover Bank had bought two more . In all , the resources of the New York banks in the Stillman-Rockefeller group had reached $450,000,000 in 1900 . The growth of the great corporations and fortunes that stood behind them had been greater still . The City Bank now occupied , in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil Company , ? the distinction of being the leading institution of the " money power . " But James Stillman was not concerned by the attacks on the growing power of his bank and its alliances . Far from being- an occasion for apology , they were a matter of deep pride to him . His whole training and tradition taught him that the greatest possible service to mankind , rich and poor , was the establishing of sound financial institutions at the foundation of business . He had taken in 1891 a bank of S1,000 , - 000 capital , which had been raised to S 10,000,000 in 1901 . I n 1902 ? in the midst of the unsound development of the trust-company craze ? he determined to make an institution strong enough to carry any possible strain , and he established the first hank with 825,000,000 capital in America . The capital of the City Bank was made 825,000.000 , its surplus 815,000,000 . That is. it had 840,000,000 working capital of its own before a dollar of deposits was taken into account .. In the nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , growing into more and more millions every year , until to-day the bank 's own working capital is Sbo , oco , 000 . There are only- eight States in the Union whose entire banking capital is larger than this . The foundation of the bank was safe beyond any possible strain , and would be in the future . James Stillman's'further ambition was to make it the greatest and most efficient banking instrument in America . Very early he ' had secured the strongest possible banking connections through Europe , and established a great business in foreign exchange . He did the banking of the strongest corporations in the country ; lie could offer corresponding hawks valuable business in their own towns in return for what they could give him in New York . Some eighteen hundred of the seven thousand national banks in the United States are now the City Bank 's correspondents . The bank , within ' ten years after Stillman took it , was no longer , by any possibility , a one-man enterprise . Stillman saw this , and brought around him a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taken in. the latter very largely from the Middle West . Frank A. Vanderlip , now president of the bank . was one of these Western men , and his ability and previous experience as a financial journalist and Assistant Secretary of the " treasury contributed much to broaden the outlook and field of the institution . The work of adding corresponding banks was pushed . the entire United States being covered by agents to get this business . Stillman bought a large interest in the Riggs National Bank , of Washington , opposite the Treasury Department , and arranged for it to act as Washington agent for the City Bank 's correspondents throughout the country . A bond department was built up , which takes issues of bonds in blocks of millions or tens of millions , and sells them to banks and other investors . - In 1908 the City Bank moved into its new 85,000,000 banking house , just across Wall Street from its location of the preceding century . The old custom house formerly the Mer-  | chants ' Exchange , in which sixty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less than two hours a day ? was remade into a building covering one of the irregular blocks of the old city . Two thirds of this is occupied by the bank itself , and in the heart of it , 188 feet long , 124 feet wide , and occupying a height of four ordinary stories , is the magnificent main banking room ? the great central temple of American money . The Great Money Plant Yet it is not as a piece of architecture that the new bank is most interesting . but as a wonderfully equipped plant for handling money and securities . In the center of it is the two-storied steel vault , about the size of a workingman 's cottage . I n this there is generally at least 85oo,000 , - eoo in cash and actual securities . The cash ranges from SSo , 000,000 to 875,000,000 . There are from $150,000,000 to 200.000,000 worth of securities held as collateral against loans , and $250,000,000 or $500,000,000 of American securities held as agent for foreign owners ? largely financial or brokerage houses . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attacked by a mob , there is an apparatus by which live steam could he thrown out , enveloping the whole vault , and scalding to death any one approaching it . Around the vault is a high marble inclosure , behind which , in a score of bronze cages , the various clerks and tellers do their business with the public . At the left , the vice-presidents and cashiers sit behind a low railing . At the rear is the office of the president , Frank A. Vanderlip . Every arrangement is made to promote the accessibility of these men to anybody who has legitimate business with them . Upstairs . above the office of the president , is James Stillman , ? now chairman of the directors. ? out of immediate contact with the public : a silent . swarthy , melancholy-eyed man , planning , in the retirement of a big , isolated room . the policies of his bank . Much of his time he spends in Paris ; but he is never out of touch with his bank . In this extraordinary plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cable room connects directly with every part of the world ; there is every type of machine for carrying papers , and for talking or writing messages ; there is a big library ; there is a kitchen , and a dining-room accommodating one hundred and fifty people at a time , where the bank serves luncheon free of charge to its employees every day ; there is a suite of two bedrooms for the use of officers kept in the bank for some sudden necessity , such as a crisis in a great panic ; and in the basement there is a big clubroom for the clerks of the establishment . Four hundred and fifty men are needed to operate this great work-shop . Forty messengers carry the drafts and general business of the institution through the city ; roomfuls of clerks sort checks and drafts and keep the records of correspondents ' accounts ; a special department keeps filed away the information relating to the tens of thousands of individuals and enterprises that have applied to the bank for loans . Throughout the twenty-Four hours of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clerks goes on at the end of the regular working day , and stays until midnight . From midnight until eight o'clock half a dozen clerks are sorting the mail ? receiving then a great part of all that comes in from out of town . There are from three to five thousand out-oftown letters every day , containing from fifteen to twenty thousand checks . They must be ready by ten o'clock for presentation at the clearing-house , or the clients of the banks will lose a full day 's interest on their money . In an institution-that has presented total demands as great as $75,000,000 in a single at at the clearing-house , carelessness or delay in handling checks and drafts might easily mean a daily loss of hundreds or even thousands of dollars . The daily interest on Sio , 000,000 at four per cent is over a thousand dollars . At half past eight or nine o'clock the messengers go out through the city , taking the hundreds of drafts to business houses for acceptance : at ten the settlement at the clearing-house is made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . The great plant is running , full of life and energy , at high speed again . I t needs to he . Here , by the growth of Wall Street , the centralization of corporations in New York , the necessity of banks to find a temporary place for the use of surplus money , is the center of the ready resources of the country ? a volume of money always fluctuating , often very violently . The training of half a century has gone to evolve in this and other Wall Street banks the highest possible development of a system for keeping assets liquid . The deposits of this bank have varied Si 5,000,000 in a day . It is necessary to be everlastingly ready . The total deposits of the City Bank now run about 8250,000,000 ; 1B total resources are about 8310,000,000 . Of this sum S6o,000,000 are in cash . This is the first line of reserve . The second line is call loans of some 877,000,000 . The third line is some S35,000,000 in bonds . All of the $170,000,000 or more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be carried profitably .  | The call loan , of all these three , is the most significant of the New York financial bank . Practically the only place in the country that makes real call loans ? that is , loans on Collateral , which are made on an absolutely impersonal basis and can be called at any time , regardless of the borrower 's feelings ? is Wall Street . Across the center of the long desk where the loan clerks of the City Bank stand , in a little channel under a glass , runs the constantly moving tape of Wall Street quotations . An average fall of one point in the market will mean a decline of $1,500,000 or $2,000,000 in the value of the securities pledged for loans with the institution . Four clerks can stand and watch this momentous moving strip of paper , in case of panic . In drawers around them are arranged the names of every borrower , with their loans and collateral , recorded on cards arranged in alphabetical order ; in other drawers are addressed envelops , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be sent out immediately . Loans for 525,000,000 can be called in fifteen minutes through the bank messengers . The City Bank Group The City Bank , always ready , sits at the center of the financial operations of the country ? perpetuating the most successful traditions of the old trading merchants of New York . There are $300,000,000 of resources always in its hands . It buys and sells money , and credit , and securities , exactly as it would buy and sell cotton or sugar or coal . Upon it , and its alliances , has been concentrated the tremendous power that has accrued to it as custodian of the greatest central body of available cash and quick assets of the country . Behind this City Bank , in the second line of strength in this section of the so-called " money power , " are the various other Stillman-Rockefeller banks ? tied to it by common ownership . The resources of these batiks and trust companies , including the City , were $700,000,000 at the beginning of 1911 . Behind these , in the third line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the fortune of William Rockefeller , estimated several years ago by one of his most intimate associates at $400,000,000 ; of John D. Rockefeller , his brother , considered the richest man in the world ; the Taylor and Harriman estates , estimated at $ioo , 000,000 each ; the Armour property , now estimated at $100,000,000 ; the fortunes of such men as Jacob Schiff , James Stillman , and the Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan . No one but the owners themselves can estimate how great their accumulations are . They go high into the hundreds of millions . Together they very likely pass the billion mark . Back of these , in the fourth line , are the huge enterprises that these men control . That central and almost identical group ? the StillmanRockefeller banks , the Standard Oil Company , and the Union Pacific system ? embody corporate property worth four or five billion dollars . There were only seven States in the Union whose property , by the census of 1904 , exceeded four billion dollars . In addition , the close , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Bank ? like the Vanderbilts and Armours and J. P. Morgan ? certainly controlled as much more capitalization in industries and railroads . Financial groups are not fixed , accomplished things ; they are organisms still in process of formation . In 1906 ? as far as the control of the railroads and the greatest industrial enterprises and the large financial institutions of the United States were concerned ? there were two groups quite clearly defined . The first of these was the one gathered around the City Bank , founded on the most tried and successful principles of the traders in merchandise and ready money . It possessed a tremendous and cumulative power ? the power of buying for cash when everybody else has to sell , and of buying to a practically unlimited extent . These operations , based on an exact mathematical certainty of growth , ? a certainty as sure as the recurrence of business fluctuations , ? were backed by individual fortunes that had already accumulated to the size of the wealth of large cities , and by corporate properties that had accumulated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on ' a very similar principle , around other New York banking institutions , will be described in the next article of this series .
