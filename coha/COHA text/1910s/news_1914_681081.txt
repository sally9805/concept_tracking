txt That the Government is stilt facing a situation of extreme difficulty is proved by the fact that Premier Asquith was not in a position last night to make his promised statement in Parliament , and it was consequently postponed until today . Premier Asquith , according to a statement by Mr. Lloyd George , Chancellor of the Exchequer , earlier in the day , was to make an announcement in the House last night on the resignations of high army officers . A question was asked at the opening of the session by a member , who inquired whether Sir John French and Sir John Ewart had resigned . Mr. Lloyd George replied in the absence of the Premier , who load gone to Buckingham Palace to see King George . Field Marshal Sir John French . Chief of the Imperial General Staff and virtual head of the army , and Sir John Spencer Ewart , the Adjutant General , who resigned from the Army Council yesterday , were signatories with Col. Seely of the memorandum to Brig . Gen. Hubert Gough , giving guarantees to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ulster Unionists and they regarded the repudiation of the document by the Government as a slight . The rumor persists that other members of the Army Council have resigned . but this can not be confirmed : At midnight Field Marshal French authorised the statement that his resignation had neither been accepted nor withdrawn . Nothing is likely to be known officially until Premier Asquith makes his statement in the House of Commons to-day , when it will probably be found that the removal of Col. Seely from the War Office is the price paid for the withdrawal of the resignations of Field Marshal French and Gen. Ewart , and that the arrangement of this matte/ was the reason for the postponement of the Premier 's statement . Negotiations and conferences between Buckingham Palace , the War Office , and Downing Street were carried on throughout the day , and it was known that the strongest efforts were being made to induce Field Marshal French and Gen. Ewart to reconsider their action . Cabinet Hurriedly Called . The Prime Minister called a hurried meeting of the Cabinet at his residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir John French was summoned to an interview with Mr. Asquith after the Prime Minister had seen King George , and subsequently the Field // BRITISH AIM HEADS RESIGN // Marshal proceeded to Buckingham Palace to confer with the King . Liberals Distrust Seely . Much comment was aroused yesterday by a conference at the War Office of all the principal commanding Generals of the army . These included Field Marshal French , Lieut. - Gen . Ewart , Gen , Sir Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrlen , Aid de Camp General to the King , and Lieut. - Gen . Sir James Moncrieff Grierson , General in command of the Eastern District of England . with headquarters in London . According to the best information , the conference at the War Office was called to enable Sir John French and Sir John Ewart to explain that their resignations were a personal matter , arising solely from the fact that they signed the Gough memorandum , which the Government had since repudiated , and they urged that all the other officers should remain at their posts . Then followed Interviews with the Ministers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducing the officers to reconsider their nation . Rut both Sir John French and Gen. Ewart remained firm in their decision that it . would be impossible for them to retain their post while Col. Seely remained Secretary for War . They were willing , however , to withdraw their resignations If Col. Seely were removed . Faced by this ultimatum and the knowledge that a strong feeling against Col. Seely existed among . a large section of the Raclicansupporters of the GovernIntent , the Prime Minister seems to have arrived at the conclusion that he must abandon Col. Seely . The difficulty in rearranging the Ministry has caused the delay in Mr. Asquith 's statement . There hits been talk of appointing John Burns , who is now President of the Local Gov ' ernment Board , Secretary for War , and a report has also been current of an exchange of portfolios between Lewis Harcourt ( Colonial Secretary ) and Col. Seely . It is generally believed , however , that It will be found that Col. Seely has again I resigned , and that his resignation has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and that Lord Emmott , Under Secretary for the ' Colonies , will be promoted to be Colonial Secretary . Many Liberals think Premier Asquith should have accepted the resignation of ; Col. Seely at first , for he has always been suspected of being really more Unionist than Liberal in his sympathies . The Liverpool Post , a Liberal newspaper , says that the month of June is give as the latest date for a general election . It intimates that as a suit of the intervention of King George an agreement has been reached by the Unionists and the Liberals under the terms of which the Home Rule for Ireland bill and the Welsh Disestablishment bill will be passed with the understanding that a general election shall follow . The only thing not absolutely settled in the agreement between the Parties was , says the newspaper , that the Plural Voting bill also should be passed , but the difficulties in regard to this bill are likely to be surmounted : In Ireland no change has occurred . Belfast remains quiet , and , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign because of the repudiation of Col. Seely 's guarantee by the Government , no actual resignations so far as is known have been tendered . It is stated . however , that the majority of the regimental officers of the mounted units at the Curragh are determined to maintain their refusal to serve against the Unionists in Ulster . The Times understands that Lord Haldane is engaged in drafting an explanatory document which may be addressed by Gen. French to Gen. Gough , to the satisfaction of both , The . Times 's . Paallamentary correspondent alleges tla'e existence of documentary . evidence.Preving that the majority of the infantry officers in Ireland agreed to go to Ulster only on being informed that this was in accordance with the King 's wish , and in loyalty to lilt Majesty and the army . Before this statement was communicated to them they had expressed their willingness to be dismissed rather than go . Many renewed rumors appear in the morning papers of the resignations of officers at Aldershot and the Curragh , but none has yet been confirmed . The Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignations must be dealt with by instant dismissal , The Chronicle also admits that it is no longer possible to think of postponing the dissolution of Parliament until next year . " A general election , " it says , " must come very shortly , and the issue of popular freedom versus army dictation is bound to dominate it . " This probably means that the elections will be held in June , directly after the Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment hills are passed . Much interest is being shown in the almost daily conferences between Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George and James Ramsay Macdonald , M. P. , the well-known Independent Labor member . They are interpreted In some quarters as meaning a new coalition between the Labor Party and the extreme Radicals , who place the land question and social reform to the forefront . FRENCH 'S FINE RECORD . Made a Great Reputation in the Boer War  --  Relieved Kimberley . Field Marshal Sir John D. P. French , Chief of the General Staff , is , after Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener , perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few commanding officers who emerged from the South African war with an enhanced reputation , and , indeed , he made his name in the war as a dashing and skillful cavalry leader . Born in 1852 , the son of Capt . French of the navy , he was himself sent to sea , but after serving in the navy for four years he resigned and entered the army by way of the militia . After ten years ' peace service in the Nineteenth Hussars he was sent with that regiment on the Nile campaign , and took part in Sir Herbert Stewart 's fruitless dash across the desert to save Gordon , being present at the engagements of Abu Klea , Gubat , and aletemneh . He became commanding officer of his regiment in 1893 , and for the next ten years was busy with regi mental staff duties at the Horse Guards or Aldershot .

In that battle he handled his forces so well that he practically annihilated the Johannesburg commando , and he showed equal fighting ability to the battles of Reitfontein and Lombard 's Hop , in ' which he commanded the cavalry division . As the burghers drew their lines around Ladysmith it was evident that there was no good in retaining within it the brilliant cavalry leader . Sir George White sent him to the base and he departed in the last train which was able to make its way out , and had , as it was , to run the gantlet of the Boer outposts at Colenso . Then , during the dark period of the war , Gen. French proved what was in him . Buller was checked on ' the right arthe Tugela River , Methuen was held back on the left at the Modder River , the centre was in charge of French .

' While the fate of the war was trembling in the balance he kept the centre intact and saved Cape Colony from invasion . When Lord Roberts arrived he placed Gen.

The British were advancing to the relief of Kimberley and the fate of that town , in which was besieged Cecil Rhodes , seemed ' td depend upon the . speed With which aid ' could come . French was 100 miles away , and the veldt was swarming with commandos . With his entire division he set off and , fighting almost every inch of the way , swept into Kimberley ninetysix hours after he had started . He continued in command of Roberts 's cavalry on the march to Bloemfontein and Pretoria , and during the rest of the war held Important commands in the Eastern Transvaal and Cape Colony .
