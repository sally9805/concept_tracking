txt HOW DOES THE MOON it . The aether offers no resistance to our grasp ; we can not handle it . We move about in it as if it did not exist . It is most mysterious . But we know many things that this mysterious ether does . We know that the light which comes to us from the Sun , and from the stars , and from our electric lamps , and from the incandescent mantles in gas lamps , and every other kind of light , is merely waves in this great ocean of mother . We know that when you are sitting in front of a bright fire , and when you feel the fire sending out heat , it is really waves in the nether which are reaching you from the fire . What makes the waves in the ether ? It is the fire , of course . Please do n't ask " How ? " at present , or we shall never finish this explanation of how the Moon keeps up in the sky ! Some day we must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how it is a fire can make waves in the aether . Another thing that we know about the aether is that when we make very large waves in it we can send wireless telegraph messages . I have told you something about this wireless telegraphy in Our Good Slave Electricity , but some day I shall tell you more about the aether 100 STICK UP IN THE SKY ? waves . These waves are very real although they are quite invisible . But what has all this to do with the Moon ? It is this same nether which binds the Moon to the Earth . If I had merely told you that the Moon is connected to the Earth by the aether , it might have seemed very strange to you . It is still very mysterious , but you are not so surprised about it when you realise that light , and heat are carried to us by this same aether cr . One boy says that he can imagine waves in the aether bringing us impulses of light and heat , but he does not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . Neither do I ! If I lie force of gravity is not waves in the aether , what is it ? We think it must be some sort of strain in the aether . All I can do is to make some kind of mental picture that may help you to realise the fact that the naether causes the force of gravity . We call these mental pictures analogies . Picture yourself lifting a heavy stone on the sea shore . You know that the weight does not fruity belong to the stone , for you remember our experiences with the book and with ourHOW DOES THE MOON Perhaps you wonder if it would not be possible to shoot something , right away from the Earth , with so much force that it would never come back again ! I can tell you how this could be done . I mean I can tell you what you must do , but at the same time I could offer you a prize of anything you wish if you succeed . It does not matter if I have the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no possibility of you earning the prize . What you must do is to give the object a speed of six or seven miles per second , which means about four hundred miles per minute . With that rate of travel , the object will defy the Earth 's force of gravity . No doubt you have heard the story about Sir Isaac Newton and the falling apple . We believe the story to be a true one . This is what happened some three hundred years ago . When Newton was plain Isaac , and was a student at Cambridge , he had to leave his studies and go to his home in the country , because of the Great Plague , which occurred in the year 1665 . The disease was so prevalent that all the colleges in Cambridge had to be closed . You may have heard about the terrible 104 STICK UP IN THE SKY ? loss of life through this Plague . In London alone there were about sixty thousand people died in a few months . Newton had often wondered how it was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon accompanies the Earth in its ceaseless journey around the Sun . When Newton was at home , during the time of the Plague , he happened to be thinking about the Moon when he noticed an apple fall from a tree . I wonder sometimes if the apple struck Newton when it fell . In any case I think it must have fallen near enough to startle him , for lie was so absentminded that he seldom noticed what was going on around him . However that may be , it is a fact that the falling of this apple suggested to Newton that it might be the force of gravity which held the Moon to the Earth . Newton knew what the pull of gravity would be on the material of the Moon , since he believed lie knew how far the Moon was from the Earth , and he knew how . fast the Moon was travelling , so he made a calculation to see if the force of gravity could account for the behaviour of the Moon . He found that the pull // f gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . But many years later Newton heard that a Frenchman had made a lore careful measurement of the Earth , and ad found it to be larger than the earlier measurements . This meant that the Earth being greater than had been supposed when he distance from the Moon was calculated , hat distance had to be increased now . So Newton made a new calculation and found that he force of gravity of the Earth could keep he Moon exactly where it is . When Newton proved that it was common gravity that held the Moon circling around the Garth , then the whole of the Creator 's plan became clear . The force of gravity exerted by he Sun was sufficient to keep all the planets circling around it . Newton had discovered one f the great plans of the Creator . // WHAT MAKES THE TIDE GO OUT AND COME IN ? WHEN you have been living at the sea , did you ever wonder what it is that causes the tide to go out and come in ? Sometimes you may have been disappointed to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to launch a rowing-boat which happened to he lying far up on the beach . What a lot of bard work it meant to pull the boat down to t lie sea ! How you wished the tide had been full in , and you would have been saved all this trouble . t h- other occasions you may have been sorry that . the tide was full in when you wished to blithe , the nice sandy parts of that particular shore being reached only at low tide . And the worst of it was that there was no use of your trying to arrange your lunch-hour to suit the tide for it had a bad habit of changing from day t o day . One day the tide would be full in just after // breakfast-time , but in a few days it would be time for lunch before the tide had come full in . You would soon find that the tide was getting later and later each day . How much later ? One day you might find that the full tide was just half-an-hour later than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have reckoned on it being half-an-hour late , only to find that it was more than an hour late . All boys and girls who have lived much at the sea must have noticed that the tide comes in and goes out twice in each day of twentyfour hours . If you were to note the times of full and low tides , you would find that it took the sea about six and a quarter hours to go from full tide to low tide , and another six and a quarter hours to come in again . To do this double journey twice in each day it requires about twenty-five hours , hence its lateness each day ; it can not complete its work in the twenty-four hours , so it has to finish a bit of it during the next day , and that makes it later in reaching full tide . That is how the tides behave around the British Isles ; but in other parts of the World the two tides are not always equal . But what makes the sea rise and fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably you have heard that the tides are caused by the Moon . This is no new discovery . The people who lived long before the time of Christ knew that the Moon caused the tides , but how the Moon managed to do this they could not tell . No one had any idea of thee cause until Sir Isaac Newton discovered he action of the force of gravity between the Earth and the Moon . You know that not only does the Earth at I ract the Moon , but the Moon also attracts the Earth . Neither succeeds in drawing the of her any closer to it , because of their steady motion in their orbits , or what we called their ce-courses . But the waters of the oceans do respond to the attraction of the Moon , and could rise immediately beneath the Moon if the Earth were not rotating . Of course if there had been water on the Moon , oceans of water would have been attracted the Earth to an even greater extent than oceans arc by that smaller body ? the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that although there are dark patches , called seas , and there on the surface of the Moon , there really no water . // Now when I ask how the tide goes out and comes in , one boy says that the Moon attracts the water of the oceans , and when the Moon rises and sets , the waters rise and fall . Quite a good answer so far as it goes , but I ask this boy how often the Moon rises and sets in each day of twenty-four hours . He knows that the Moon only rises and sets once each day , and he . knows that the rising and setting of the Moon is really produced by the Earth turning round once in each day of twenty-four hours , just as the Sun appears to rise and set for the same reason . The effect , so far as the tides are concerned , is just the same as it would be if the Moon did really go round the Earth each day . The boy says now that he would expect the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in again . There ought to be only one full tide and one low tide in each day of twenty-four hours . But he knows that there are really two full and two low tides , and he knows that a single journey out or in takes only about six and a quarter hours . He can not account for these two full tides each day , so he gives up the problem . 112 GO OUT AND COME IN ? One of the girls says she thinks she knows bow there are two full tides per day . She says I hat the Sun also attracts the oceans , and that I he Sun produces the second tide . She is quite correct in saying that the Sun does attract the oceans , but she is wrong entirely in supposing t hat the Sun produces the second tide ; their is no division of labour such as she thinks . Resides , the Sun is so very much farther away than the Moon that the Sun 's pull on the oceans , though large , is small compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen is this . When the ( Km causes the oceans to bulge out from the Earth on the side of the Earth facing it , the cans on the other side farthest away from the Moon also bulge out from the Earth in exactly the same fashion . Therefore when there is full tide at Great Britain , there will be full tide New Zealand also . Of course you all wish to ask why , but I am going to put you off ; must wait till you are older before you can understand the reason why . Now I wish you to follow a very simple experiement , which can be made quite conveniently in our imagination . We picture a // WHAT MAKES THE TIDE party of boys and girls , who are playing one of those old-fashioned ging-a-ring games , in which they dance round in a ring . We tell the boys and girls that we wish them to pretend that they are the oceans of water surrounding the Earth . They are to keep standing in a ring , but they are to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . The reason for standing in this fashion is so that they may watch what goes on outside of the ring . The empty ring will , of course , represent the Earth , with the ring of movable waters on its surface . I select a good strong girl to represent the Moon , and a small boy to represent the Sun . But you suggest that the Sun ought to be very much bigger than the Moon . That is quite true , but in our experiment the Sun is supposed to be so very far away from the Earth that a little boy will represent it better . We can put the Sun to one side for a moment till I show the ring of boys and girls what they have to do . The Moon is going to walk around the outside of the ring , and as the boys and girls are facing outwards they can watch her passing round . 114 GO OUT AND COME IN ? The room happens to be a good deal longer than it is broad , so that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , and two which are quite apparently the side walls . Although the ring is round , we shall t It ink of it as having four corresponding parts ; two ends and two sides . When the Moon stands opposite one of the ends , the boys and girls facing the Moon are to take one step forward towards the Moon . At the same time the boys and girls forming the tiler end of the ring are to take a similar step forward towards the wall which they are facing . When these two ends of the ring go outwards , the two sides have to take one step inwards , otherwise the ring would part company . We remind the children forming the ring that they are imitating the water of the oceans on the surface of the Earth , and that the tide is full in at the too ends , and full out at the sidles . When our girl-moon walks round to one side of the ring , the two sides are attracted forward just as the ends were , and the ends go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now full in at the two sides and full out at the ends . // When we began the experiment the ring was alike all round , so that we may picture that normal position , which is neither out nor in , as the waters at half-tide . The children took one step forward from half-tide to full tide , but now that the sides had moved one step backwards to represent low tide , they must move two steps forward from low tide to high tide . In the same way when the ends are at high tide they must take two steps backwards to reach low tide . We continue our experiment by the girl-moon walking round to the next end of the ring . Her attraction causes it to be high tide at the two ends for the second time , and , of course , low tide at the two sides . Her next move to the side causes a second high tide at the sides , and so on . You see from this simple experiment how it is that all parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready for the little boy to join in the game . You will remember that I have chosen a small boy to represent the Sun , so that the boys and girls in the ring will remember that he can not attract them nearly so well as the big girl representing the Moon . 116 GO OUT AND COME IN ? The Irises and sets each day , it appears to circle round the Earth , but you know that it is really the Earth which turns round . The little boy who is to imitate the Sun must walk round the ring just as the girl-moon did . If he were to walk round by himself the result would be a rise and fall of tide similar to that produced by the Moon , but a much smaller movement . There would be only a slight advance at the ends and a slight inward movement of the sides , when the Sun was opposite either of the ends . And when the Sun was opposite one of the sides there would be a small advance at the sides tad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to see the result of the Moon and the Sun both acting on the waters of the ocean . How are we to place the Try and girl ? I f you think of the experiment which made with the lamp and the orange , you have no difficulty . You remember that the orange represented the Moon and the lamp presentcd the Sun , and you will remember that during part of the Moon 's monthly journey he Earth it was on the same side of the of the Earth as the Sun was , while at another time it at t Ile opposite side . Therefore sometimes // the girl-moon and the boy-sun must walk round together : that will represent what happens each day at one part of the month . Then they must walk round facing opposite sides , and so on . Let us see what effect these different arrangements have on the ring of waters . First of all we shall suppose that the Sun and Moon are on the same side of the Earth ; the boy and girl walk round together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl-moon attracts the ends to move outwards as before , but the boy-sun also attracts them a little , so that they must move just a little farther forward . The sides will , of course , move a little farther in , for the same reason . In the real oceans this means that when the Sun and Moon are acting together the high tide will be higher , and the low tide will be lower , than is the usual . These extra high tides are called " spring tides , " but as they take place every month of the year it is quite evident that they have no special connection with the season of spring . They will occur twice every month . Why ? Let us see what our experiment with the boys and girls has to say in the matter . Suppose we place the boy-sun at the end of 118 GO OUT AND COME IN ? the ring directly opposite to the girl-moon , the result will be just the same as when the boy and girl were both at one end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing a second spring tide during the same revolution of the Moon , or , in other words , during the same I month . During another part of the month the Moon ' will he acting on one of the ends while the Sun is acting on one of the sides . We place the girl and boy to represent these positions , and we watch the result . While the Moon is attracting the ends out and forcing the sides inwards , the Sun is doing just the reverse . The children at the sides of the ring are pull ( , backwards or inwards by the girl-moon 's action on the ends , but the same boys and girls are pulled forward the attraction of the boy-sun who is acting directly on the sides . Of course the Moon 's forceing of the sides to go inwards is considerably greater than the Sun 's attraction , so there is still a low tide , but not so low as usual . If we look at what is happening to the children forming the ends of the ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the boy.sun , by acting on the sides , is tending to // pull the ends inwards . This prevents the Moon raising the tide as high as usual . We call these " neap tides , " and these inferior tides will , of course , occur twice in each month , just as the spring tides do . During your next holidays at the coast , if you watch the behaviour of the tides you will see that on two occasions during the month the tide comes up higher and goes out farther than the average tide . You will remember that during such times the Sun and Moon are acting together . On other two occasions during the month you will find the tide taking a lazy turn and failing to rise as high as usual . You will know that the Sun and the Moon are opposing each other , as was represented by the girl being at one end , and the boy at one side , of the ring . One boy , who has lived a great deal at the sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he used to think that it was the full moon which caused the extra full or spring tide . He used to think that a full moon could attract the waters better than a half-moon . But later on he noticed that the spring tide occurred also when it was 120 GO OUT AND COME IN ? new moon , at which time he could scarcely see the dark moon at all . Then it occurred to him that the appearance of the Moon could have no effect on the waters , for the whole of the Moon was always there , although only a part of it might be seen . He had often meant to ask someone about this subject , but now he sees that the spring tides are produced by the Sun and Moon acting together , and that to pull together they must be opposite to one another , as at full moon , or they must be both on the same side of the Earth , as at new moon . And it is now clear to him that the inferior or neap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite nor together , but in the positions represented by the boy being at one end of the ring of children , and the Moon at one of the sides . In these positions the Sun canlight only one half of the Moon 's face , and so we have half-moon at the same time as we havethese inferior tides . When Julius Caesar was getting his troops on board his ships to invade Britain , he noticed that tide was exceptionally high , and he told the people that this was due to the full moon .. We know now that he was wrong , // and that the spring tide and the full moon are both due to the positions of the Sun and the Moon both are caused by the Sun and Moon being on directly opposite sides of the Earth . // OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS IN SPACE U UR imaginary trip to the Moon helped us to realise that the Moon is very much nearer to us than the stars are . We found that , travelling at the speed of Light it would take only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon , whereas it would take us years to reach the nearest fixed stars , travelling continuously at the same enormous speed . But there arc some neighbours in space very much nearer to us than we are to the fixed stars . Some of these near neighbours could be reached in a few minutes with the aid of our wonderful flying machine ; others could be reached in a laws . You can see some of these near neighbours when you look up into the sky at night . You Would call them stars , but you would notice that some of them are much brighter and bigger looking than the stars . If you were to make a study of the positions 1 ' 25 OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS occupied by these near neighbours from month to month , you would find that they seem to wander among the stars . The ancients noticed this and they called these " the wanderers , " and we have a special name for them to-day . We call them planets , and this English word is made up from the Greek word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these planet s wander about in an aimless fashion . I remember being present at a lecture about the planets , many years ago , and the lecturer showed on the lantern screen " the paths of the different planets among the stars . " I remember wondering how many of the audience would imagine that the planets really travelled to and fro as shown on these lantern slides , for the lecturer made no remark about these being the apparent paths . When the ancients traced out these very curious paths which the planets seem to follow in space among the stars , they believed that the planets did wander about in that fashion , but when it was realised that the Earth and all these planets were journeying in almost circular paths around the Sun , the apparent wanderings // of t lie planets were explained ; our point of viewing the planets was changing continually . There are eight planets travelling round and Annul the Sun , and you and I are being carried rough space on the surface of one of these gl i t , planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the planet upon which we live called the Earth . There is no fear of collision between any of these planets , as each has a pantie race-course quite apart from its neighcourses . We picture the great Sun at the centre of all race - courses , as shown in the accompanying wing . We call these great circles the orbits w planets . We have made up this word a Latin word which means a wheel-track . C word orbit is not one to which you have accustomed , I shall continue to speak of gnat paths of the planets as their races , allowing the word orbit to creep in occasionally . Now we wish to take a look at drawing which is marked Fig. 7 . You see that the planet Mercury has the smallest course to travel round , and that Venus round outside Mercury 's orbit , while the conics next , and then the planet Mars . // These are the four innermost of the eight racecourses . Why does the drawing not show the whole eight at one time ? Because the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn on this size of page . The only way in which I can show you the whole eight race-courses at one time is to draw them all on a very much smaller scale . You will understand that in the drawing ( Fig. 8 ) the four innermost race-courses are represented by the tiny ring at the centre ; that is the size of Mars ' orbit in proportion to the others . // Suppose we set out on another trip in our wonderful flying machine , in order to have a look at each of these eight planets . We shall take a run down to the neighbourhood of the Sun , and then merely cross over each of the race-courses in turn , going at the speed of Light the time , so that we may form some look each of the planets . After getting clear of the ocean of air which surroundse Earth , it will take us only a few minutes to get : as near the Sun as we care to go . 129 OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS Turning our back upon the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are past it and near to the race-course of Venus in less than three minutes . We have a passing glimpse of Venus in the distance , and in two minutes we reach the racecourse , or orbit , of our own planet , the Earth . Fortunately we are quite clear of this planet , - as we do not wish to pass through its ocean of air , or we should be forced to reduce our speed , and then we could not compare the distances between the race-courses . When I announce that in other five minutes we shall cross the race-course of Mars , every boy and girl is anxious to have a good look at this planet . They wish to see if they can detect any signs of human beings on its surface . But Mars does not happen to be anywhere near the part of the race-course over which we cross . We see Mars some distance off , and although it looks very much bigger than it does from the Earth , we can not see any details of its surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our journey without stopping , but I promise that on our return journey we shall hunt down each planet , and have a good look // at all the detail which is visible . If we were to do that now , we should have no idea of the positions of the different race-courses . It has taken us rather less than a quarter of an hour to reach the race-course of Mars , starting from the neighbourhood of the Sun , and we have passed the race-courses of Mercury , Venus , and the Earth on our way to Mars . Fig. 7 , on page 128 , shows a map of our journey so far . A very few minutes brought us from one race-course to its neighbour , but now we shall have to travel full speed ahead for half-an-hour before we reach the next racecourse , along which the planet of Jupiter travels . I feel a little bit worried about this crossing from Mars to Jupiter , but I need not worry you boys and girls with it ; you may speak to one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of t h e journey ; I shall tell you all about it ter on . When we reach the race-course of Jupiter without any mishap , the boys and girls are all greatly surprised at the enormous size of Jupiter , but we shall stop and have a look at this giant planet on our return . 7 ' 4. reach the next race-course , the one belong- // ing to Saturn , will take us another half-hour , but it is a still longer journey from that racecourse to the neighbouring one , belonging to Uranus . This crossing takes us one and a quarter hours , and the remainder of our journey out to the race-course of Neptune takes us another one and a half hours . When I intimate that this is the end of our outward journey , one of the boys is very anxious that we should continue our journey outwards and discover if there are any more planets farther out in space . This would be of special interest , as the astronomers on the Earth can not discover if there are any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already nearly three thousand million miles from the Earth , I think we ought to be content . Another reason why I am unwilling to go farther is that the distances between the neighbouring planets has gone on increasing the farther out we have come . It took us only a few minutes from the Earth to Mars , but ii has taken us an hour and a half from Uranus to Neptune . You must remember also that although we have taken only about four hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune , it will take // us a very great deal longer to go home by the zigzag path necessary to bring us close to each planet . And we are not going to be content to fly past the planets at the rate of eleven million miles per minute . First of all we pay Neptune a visit , and one boy proposes that we should anchor our flying machine to this planet , and let it pull us once round its race-course . I shake my head quite decidedly , for , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchorage . It seems to be made of great clouds of heavy vapour , and it is quite apparent that Neptune is very hot , for its clouds are continually on the move , just although they were boiling . Neptune 's clouds are quite different from the clouds which float in the air around our Earth . Our clouds are masses of water vapour raised by the heat of the Sun , but Neptune is far too distant from the Sun to be affected in that way . Neptune 's clouds are made of the materials of " Which the planet itself is formed , and it is the intense heat of the planet which throws up clouds and keeps them in constant motion You will agree with me that even if there // should happen to be a solid centre in this great planet , it would not make a suitable anchorage . One girl suggests that Neptune is much likcr the Sun than the Earth , but it is really not like either of them . It is not a compact , solid ball like the Earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun . It is between these two conditions , and is at a stage through which we believe our Earth passed millions and millions of years ago , when the Earth was , as we read in the first chapter of Genesis , " without form and void . " There is no doubt that both Neptune and the Earth were once so hot that they sent out light as the Sun does to-day . Neptune looks as though it were just past the red-hot stage , and you know that our Earth is in a condition which you would describe as cold . But we were talking about letting Neptune pull us round the Sun . The boy who made this proposal can not find anyone willing to fall in with it ; all say that they are not anxious to stay away out in space here for a whole year . They are much more unwilling when I explain that Neptune 's " year , " or complete journey around the Sun , is a very great deal longer than // our year . It takes Neptune about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round its great race-course ; we should all be dead before we had got one half-way round Neptune 's course . Not only is Neptune 's race-course a very great deal longer than the race-course of the Earth , but Neptune is travelling at a very much slower rate than the Earth . One girl says that Neptune is an old slow-coach , but if this girl could travel as fast as Neptune does she could win all the prizes given on the Earth for tests of speed . She could enter with confidence in a race against a motor cyclist ; she could overtake , and run past , an express train , and she could travel faster than the fastest aeroplane . Indeed she could go as far in one minute as an aeroplane could go in one hour , for the speed of Neptune is about two hundred miles per minute , or twelve thousand miles per hour . No one can call Neptune a slow-coach . Now we shall make our way back to Uranus . We have become accustomed to the jet-black sky , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 is certainly lighter than the best moonlight night , which we have experienced on the Earth , // but it is very far short of daylight on the Earth . I answer this boy , in real Scotch fashion , by asking him another question . Where is the Sun ? Some point to one tiny speck of light and some to another , but which of these two objects is the Sun they can not decide . They are surprised when I tell them that neither of these is the Sun ; these are the planets Saturn and Jupiter . That small star away in the distance is the Sun . It looks very much as the planets appear from the Earth ; indeed from here you might easily mistake the Sun for Venus . This reminds us how very far distant we are from the Sun and from the Earth . It is a good thing that we have not to travel back at our second speed of one hundred miles per hour , for it would take us three thousand years to reach the Earth . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could be home in a few hours , but we wish to spend a little time at each planet on our way . We set off now for Uranus . We were talking , a little while ago , about the speed of Neptune , and we saw that this farthest-out planet was not such a slow-coach // as one of the girls tried to make out . But it is hardly fair to compare the speed of a planet with that of railway trains or aeroplanes ; these have so much air-resistance and friction to overcome , whereas the planets have none . It will be more reasonable to inquire how Neptune will fare in a race with one of the other planets , say with our own Earth . Suppose we time the two planets over a , distance of five thousand miles ! We find that the Earth reaches the end of this measured distance in five minutes , whereas Neptune does not reach the end of the same course for halfan-hour . The Earth is travelling through space mix times faster than Neptune . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets , but it is of interest to notice that the nearer a planet 's course is to the Sun the faster does that planet travel . We are coming near to Uranus , and it seems strange to us that the planet has more than one moon circling around it . As Uranus has practically the same appearance as Neptune , we need hardly pull up here , but rather set our course to overtake Saturn . As we fly away from Uranus , we try to count // how many moons are circling around that planet . We manage to count four moons , and indeed there may be more . We ought to have counted the moons going round Neptune , but all we can be sure of now is that there was one moon at least . Probably we should have found more if we had been oil the look-out for them . We shall pay more attention to the number of moons attached to the other planets . We are well on our way to Saturn , and we are looking forward to an examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // A CURIOUS PLANET AND A GIANT ONE CHAPTER IX A CURIOUS PLANET AND A GIANT ONE WE are going to make no mistake about the number of moons possessed by the planet Saturn , so we begin to count them as soon as we can see them distinctly . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ! Fancy a planet having ten moons ! One boy suggests that there may be a collision some day between two of Saturn 's moons , but I shake my head . Why ? One girl guesses that they are all travelling at exactly the same speed , so that no one can overtake another . But that is not the case ; some are travelling very much faster than others . Besides , one of the moons is travelling in the opposite direction to all the others , which is an unusual thing , although Uranus and Neptune have each a moon moon going contrariwise also . The reason why there is no fear of collision between the ten moons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race-course of its own , just // as the planets have . Indeed Saturn and its ten moons are not unlike the Sun and its planets , only Saturn does not send out light as the Sun does . Saturn is hot like Neptune and Uranus , and it sends some heat to its moons , but it is no longer red-hot . We are near enough now to see Saturn 's great ring very clearly . You will see a picture of this wonderful planet on the page facing this . When we pull up to have a good look at Saturn , we stay at a very respectable distance , for the planet is so large that we could not get a proper view of its ring otherwise . We see that the huge ring is made up really of three separate rings , one within another . The two outermost rings are bright , and are separated from each other by what looks to us like a narrow , dark space . The innermost ring is not so bright as the other two , and we notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the body of the planet through it . There is a clear space separating this ring from the planet , so that the three rings really float in space around the planet . Taking a nearer view of the rings , and looking right down upon them , they form a broad // band , which seems to be as wide as one half of the great planet itself , which means that the band is about forty thousand miles in breadth . A regiment of planets the size of our Earth could stand five abreast on the width of this great band . If you can not picture such a regiment , think of the four planets , Mercury , Venus , the Earth , and Mars , all standing side by side on the width of Saturn 's rings ! They would occupy only about one half of the available room . Of course I am speaking all the time of the width or breadth of the band formed by the three rings . We can see now quite clearly that the rings are not stuck on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space between , and this space must measure thousands of miles . From our present position we can not see how thick the band of rings is , but one thing we do see is that the rings are not solid . They seem to be made up of millions and millions of separate particles . The particles do not look bigger than grains of dust , but they may be as large as pebbles . The rings do not look so nice and regular when you get near them , the particles seem even to 143 A CURIOUS PLANET surge about as they go round in this neverending dance . Their perpetual motion in this fixed race-course is a grand demonstration of the force of gravity ; the particles are really attached to the great planet by the mysterious ether of space , just as our Moon is attached to the Earth . One boy says that his grandfather told him that there were people living on Saturn . The astronomers of fifty years ago did believe that , and this boy 's grandfather probably read some of the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturn , but he has not read more recent books , or he would have found that astronomers do not believe this now . If astronomers had believed still that there were people living on Saturn , we could have taken back word to the astronomers on the Earth that they were quite mistaken , for we can see that Saturn is in very much the same turbulent condition in which we found Neptune and Uranus . See how the hot clouds of vapour produce the appearance of dark and bright belts on the planets ! These belts keep changing from time // to time . If Saturn is solid at all , it must be only in the centre . The heat is intense , but not sufficient to make the planet red-hot ; it only shines by reflecting the sunlight . As we leave the neighbourhood of Saturn , we have to alter our course again in order to reach the giant planet Jupiter . But where is the Earth ? We can not see the Earth anywhere . I try to pick it out , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects so little light compared to the light of the Sun , although it too appears quite a small object from this distance . One girl asks what will happen if we can not find our way back to the Earth . I remind her that we have the different planets as stepping4ones , and that in any case we could calculate how long it would take us to travel from Saturn to the Earth . We should find that it would take us a little more than an hour , so if we were to steer straight for the Sun and then pull up in an hour 's time we should be somewhere near the invisible race-course round which the Earth is travelling . However , we can see the giant Jupiter , and that is our next object of interest . Looking back at Saturn , one boy declares // A CURIOUS PLANET that its great rings have shrunk to the thickness of an ordinary wedding ring . As we proceed a little farther on our journey one of the girls says that the rings are no thicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . But we must remember that we are already a considerable distance from Saturn , and we are looking at the rings edgewise . When I ask the boys and girls to guess how thick the rings are really , some say so many inches , while others say so many yards . They are a little surprised when I guess fifty miles , but I am really not guessing ; I know that astronomers on the Earth have been able to measure the thickness of the rings and that they find it to be about fifty miles . This very curious planet , Saturn , looks like a mere point of . light when we view it from the Earth , unless we look through a telescope and then we see its rings . One boy says that his father has often pointed out Saturn to him , but he has never shown him Neptune or Uranus . The fact is that you can not see Neptune without a telescope , and Uranus is practically invisible also . In certain years Uranus might be seen very faintly without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and when to look . The best part of half-an-hour has passed since we left Saturn , and we are so near Jupiter that we can see only a small part of it at a time . Its surface is very much like that of Saturn ; it is enveloped in hot clouds of heavy vapour . While we watch the great markings on its surface change , we realise that the inside of the great planet must be very hot still . We can see that it is no longer red-hot , although astronomos of not so very long ago did believe that Jupiter was still shining by its own light . It is difficult to realise what a giant Jupiter really is ; even when I tell you that if all the other planets , including the Earth , were rolled together into one great ball , it would not be so large as Jupiter . You remember that we found i t. would take us about ten days to fly once round t h e Earth in a flying machine going at the constant speed of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter would take us more than a hundred days . As we fly onwards we count Jupiter 's moons . We manage to count nine moons , although some of these are not very large . One is about the // size of our own Moon , and three are still larger , but the other four are very much smaller . One of the moons is travelling in the opposite direction to the others , so you see it is quite the fashion for these great planets to have a retrograde moon ; you remember that Uranus and Saturn each have one travelling in what you might call this backward fashion . It is worth while noting that Jupiter 's nine moons together do not reflect nearly as much light as our one Moon does , but you must remember that our Moon is very much nearer to the Sun . It will take us about half-an-hour to cross over to the race-course of Mars , but we have had longer journeys from Neptune to Uranus , from Uranus to Saturn , and from Saturn to Jupiter . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars and Jupiter on the outward run , and I may tell you I have the same uneasy feeling about recrossing this space , but if none of you bother me during this run I shall explain matters when we reach Mars . When we have got safely over this crossing , I ask the boys and girls if they can guess why I have been more worried about this particular // space between Mars and Jupiter than I have been with even the more distant parts of the journey . One boy thinks he can explain . Remembering the alarming adventure on our journey from the Earth to the Moon , he suggests that there are meteors flying about in this space between Mars and Jupiter ; but he is wrong . Another boy suggests that Mars has a great atmosphere around it , and that I was afraid our flying machine might enter it suddenly , and cause us to become red-hot vapour , as did the meteor . But this boy is wrong also . Another boy suggests that there is some great dark planet in this space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the Sun 's light , and that I fear a collision . Ile is wrong also , but his idea is much nearer the truth . There is not one large , dark planet , but there are seven hundred or more very small planets . These are all flying around the Sun in this space between Jupiter and Mars . No wonder I was a little anxious about this crossing . About how big are those small planets ? I knew that question was sure to come , and I believe you might quarrel with me for having // called some of them " small . " One of them measures between four and five hundred miles across ; we say that its diameter is about five hundred miles . But even that is really small compared to Mars , which measures four thousand miles in diameter . We might even describe the five-hundred-mile planet as " tiny " compared to the giant Jupiter , whose diameter measures eighty-five thousand miles . These small planets have been named asteroids or planetoids . Only four of them can boast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seven hundred asteroids exceed twenty-five miles , while some do not appear to be more than ten miles in diameter , but we have no exact measurements of the smaller ones . When you are down on the Earth you can not see these asteroids . There is one of the four large ones which might be seen without a telescope under very favourable conditions , but even it is very faint and would require a practised eye to pick it out . There are many of the asteroids which can not be seen even with the best telescopes . How then do we know of their existence ? I was quite prepared for this question , and I // could see that some of the boys and girls thought I was romancing a little , for how could we possibly know of asteroids that no astronomer has ever seen ? We know of these invisible asteroids because they have appeared in our photographs of the sky . The asteroids are easily distinguished from the fixed stars appearing in the photographs , for the asteroid , being on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what you would describe as a streak of light . We must remember to have a talk about the photographing of the stars when we get back to the Earth . One boy asks how it comes about that there are hundreds of small planets in this space between Mars and Jupiter . Ile wonders if there was at one time some great planet in this space , and somehow or other it has gone to pieces . Another boy suggests that there may have been two planets , and that they collided with each other , and that the asteroids are the fragments . These suggestions are all quite reasonable . The idea of the asteroids being fragments of an exploded planet was accepted by astronomers at one time , but reasons have been advanced // to show that this is not likely to have been the case . Other astronomers have suggested that certain influences have prevented a planet forming in this space , and that these asteroids are made of the material which , but for these supposed influences , would have gone to make another large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the asteroids came to be there . You will notice that while we have been discussing these asteroids all the suggestions have been made by boys ; the girls have been looking out at Mars in the hope of finding some signs of human beings on its surface . // ARE THERE PEOPLE LIVING ON MARS W E have heard so much about Martians , the people who live on : that we are very curious to see them , if are such people . We have seen that no one could possibly on any of the great planets which we visited . Neptune , Uranus , Saturn , and Jr are not the cool , solid planets which might : comfortable homes for living beings . four outermost planets are all intensely and their surfaces at anyrate are compos heavy clouds of heated vapour . But M. quite different . We can see that Mars is a solid p ) Indeed , from the clear view we have of i should guess that there is no air arour and we can not see any clouds . That ( lark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon , has a Latin name ti means the hour-glass Sea . It has been n. // also the Kaiser Sea , not after the German Emperor , but after a Dutch astronomer whose name was Frederick Kaiser . Are there many seas on Mars ? There are none . The earlier astronomers made the same mistake about Mars as they did about the Moon . Is there any water on Mars ? Looking at the great snow-caps at the poles , we should say that there must be water , for these snows melt in summer-time and appear again in winter . However , some people suggest that this snow is not really frozen water , but is frozen carbonic acid gas . So far as we can see , there are no traces of water over the surface of Mars , and we certainly see no signs of human beings . This is a great disappointment to those young people who had hoped to see the Martians . We must not forget to count how many moons there are circling around Mars . One girl says that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he speaks of " Moonless Mars . " But Tennyson was wrong , although we have to blame the astronomers and not the poet . At that time the astronomers said that Mars had no moons , but 156 LIVING ON MARS ? later on it was discovered that this had been a mistake . We have difficulty in picking out any moons around Mars , but at last we see two very small moons circling close to the planet . The one which is making the wider circle does not look more than ten miles in diameter , while the one closer to the planet may have a diameter of about forty miles . But we can not see them very clearly , for they reflect so little light . No wonder that the astronomers away down on the Earth had difficulty in finding these moons with their telescopes . The larger of the two moons , which is nearest to Mars , makes a complete journey around the planet in seven and a half hours . If there had been people on Mars they would have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their day is about twenty-five hours . The smaller moon , which is farther out , takes one and a quarter days to get once round Mars . We look forward again to see the Earth , but it still looks just like a star , only it is much brighter than it was a little while ago . Five minutes will take us to the Earth 's race-course , but , as the Earth happens to be away round // near the other side of its great course , it will take us fully a quarter of an hour to reach it . On this journey towards the Earth 's racecourse we might have caught sight of a very small planet called Eros . You never heard of it before ? It is there all the same , and is constantly circling around the Sun in a racecourse of its own between the race-courses of Mars and the Earth . But none of us noticed Eros ; it may be that we were too busy discussing the possibility of there being people on Mars , or it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race-course which we have just crossed . We could not have picked Eros out from any distance , as its diameter only measures about twenty miles . It is just about the size of many of the smaller asteroids . One boy says that he does not see how it was possible for astronomers to discover Eros , seeing they can never hope to see so small an object at this distance from the Earth . You and I know how they would manage , and I fear the boy who has put this question has not been listening when I was explaining that astronomers had discovered the asteroids by means of photography . You remember how 158 LIVING ON MARS. ? these moving asteroids left a trail of light on the photographic plates , proclaiming themselves to be " wanderers " ( planets ) and not fixed stars . While we have been talking about Eros , we have got fairly near to the Earth , but I wish to steer clear of it , as we have still to visit Venus and Mercury . In two minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have to go off at an angle to catch up on that planet which has passed this part of its racecourse some time ago . A boy and girl are having a discussion as to how people ever got the idea that there were human beings living on Mars , and they apply to me for an explanation . We have seen already that astronomers at one time believed Saturn to be inhabited by people , and at an earlier date it was declared that even the Sun was inhabited . The people were not supposed to live on the hot surface of the Sun , but to dwell on a cool , solid centre with an envelope of warm and shining clouds overhead . And so we need not be surprised that it seemed possible for Mars to be inhabited . When astronomers came to possess really // good telescopes , they were able to say quite definitely that the planet Mars was solid , and was not composed of vaporised material , as the four outermost planets are . Indeed it became quite certain that Mars had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead state in which we find the Moon . Mars is older than the Earth ; but even if Mars were just the same age , it would be colder , because it is very much smaller . You know that the Moon was once part of the Earth , so that at the moment of parting company they were of the same temperature , but the Moon , being smaller , has lost its heat much quicker than the Earth . In the same way the Earth and Mars were both part of one great glowing Sun in the long , very long ago , so they set out on their own account at something like the same temperature . Mars parted company with the Sun earlier than the Earth did , and so it has had longer to cool down . But , what is of more importance , Mars is just about one half the diameter of the Earth . Better still , if we consider the mass of material in each of these planets , we find that the mass of the Earth is nine times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
