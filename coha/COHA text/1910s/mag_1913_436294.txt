Scene , Brown 's apartment . BROWN ; enter JONES . Brown . ? How d ' do , Jones , delighted to see you . I hope that you are very well . Jones . ? Very well , my dear boy , and you ? How are you getting on with your work ? Have you the German microscope under your eye ? Are you putting the atomic theory to use in history ? Enter RonmsoN1 Robinson . ? How d ' do , how d ' do ? How are you , parson ? And how are you , Mommsen Gregorovius Macau-lay ? Brown . ? I have been loafing lately . I felt the need of contrast , of looking about me a little at the actual world . If one does not turn away from dead records occasionally , one is in danger of forgetting that history professes to be a record of life . Jones . ? Does it ? If the histories chat I see record life , the world has been horribly dull . All past generations of Germans must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history should ' The Loeb Classical Library . Edited by T. F. PAGE and W. H. D. Ronan . The Macmillan Co. 34 be a record of life ; it certainly should record enough of human experience to teach us , the living , what to do and what to let alone . History ought to be of service ; that is its justification . Robinson . ? Yes , service in a broad sense , that whatever adds an interest to life is serviceable . I do n't mean to correct you , won view ; but I am afraid you are tarred with the notion of a moral interpretation of history . Jones . ? You ca n't avoid the moral interpretation of history , man cher , unless you are willing to eliminate from our lives metaphysics , ethics , relig ? Robinson . ? Gladly , gladly ! Brown . ? Have a cigar ? They take cigars and light ihenil Jones picking up a book . ? Hullo ! You , too , have got the Loeb Classical Library . Have you looked at it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volumes that have come out . Robinson . ? I subscribed the other day . I have an empty shelf at the top of my bookcase that needs to be filled up . I call it my Via Appia , because I bury the classics there . Jones . ? Do you frequent it ? Robinson . ? I read them on Sunday mornings as an excuse for not attending your church . Jones . ? I 'm more than glad to have you listen to louder preachers of piety than I am . Brown . ? Seriously , how do you like them ? I mean do you think it worth while to republish the classics ? This publication sounds like a challenge . Robinson . ? It is a challenge , a serious challenge . It raises the question of the worth of the classics in its broadest form . Jones . ? You mean the value of the classics in education as opposed to the value of science ? Robinson . ? No , although that question is included . This is a challenge , not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? I mean from a man who is interested in literature and professes a belief in the classics , ? demanding to know what we honestly , not professionally , not conventionally , but what , honor-bright , we think of the classics . The Loeb Classical Library says as dist inctly as a dozen or twenty published volumes , with ten-score-odd to follow , can say : ' Come , you are no longer able to take refuge in the inadequacy of your school and college ; you can no longer say that if you had but the necessary time to polish up your Greek , to practice your Latin , you would have Euripides in one pocket and Lucretius in the other , and in odd moments be gratifying your natural appetite for the classics . You have no further excuses . Do you or do you not care a rap about us ? ' Here is , indeed , an embarrassing question for us who have always upheld the classics with our lips , for it does not come from the camp of the men of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics were safely locked up in their Greek and Latin cupboards , we were always able to defend ourselves with an if . ' This hypothetical , and , it is to be feared , sometimes hypocritical , defense , is no longer open to us , now that the cupboards are unlocked ; we have but to turn the handle and we shall be able to satisfy our hunger . Mr. Loeb has done the cause of honesty a good turn . We can no longer shuffle and evade , we must confront the question , What do the classics mean to us ? Brown . ? Well , if this is a challenge , it is a fair challenge . Mr. Loeb has taken a generous view of the classics . His library , according to the announcement , will contain not merely the literatures of ancient Greece and ancient Rome , but also the literature of early ' Christianity , as well as whatever there is of value and interest in later Greek and Latin literature until the fall of Constantinople . So wide a range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have raised to a narrower selection . Jones . ? Suppose that we were to take up the challenge and endeavor to frame an answer to this question . Should we not first have to face the preliminary question , what does literature in general do for us ? Must not that question be answered before we say just what the classical literatures mean to us ? Brown . ? Well , let 's see if we do not agree on the value of literature in general . In the first place we all agree that life is a marvelous happening . We find ourselves here in the midst of a vast flux of forces . Men of science bid us fit ourselves for this wonderful experience by studying matter and energy , the earth and its materials , the air , gases , electricity , chemical activities , germs , all the phenomena that touch our senses . This is sound advice ; we human beings are frail creatures , sensitive to the play of this infinite variety of forces . We feel , we suffer , we enjoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect and guard our sensitiveness . Yet these forces of nature , these mysterious gods , so potent in sky , air , and earth , noble and terrible in lightning and tempest , in comet and earthquake , in the very great and the very little , manifest themselves still more terribly and still more nobly in human form . Our fellow men are the forces that make our life a pleasure or a pain , a happiness or a vain thing . From them come love , affection , sympathy , approbation , distrust , disapproval , hate . They are the forms of energy that we need chiefly to study , and as it is difficult to learn lessons from actual life , it is important to study these human energies in the past , where at our leisure we can go over and over the record ; there the results of causes are chronicled as well as the causes themselves . Robinson . ? But you are talking of history , not literature . Brown . ? Literature is the only real history . The main records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guizot , in Egyptian tombs , or in the fossils of the Wind River beds , but in the books of men who have recounted their experience of life . From their experience we learn how best to fulfil the duty of self-preservation . Robinson . ? You give literature a terribly utilitarian twist . You present the obverse of the Delphic motto , Know Thyself ; you say , Know Other Men . Jones . ? Brown is right so far as he goes ; but he stops short . Brown is too eager to meet the men of science on their own ground ; he forgets what we of the cloth regard as more important than the body . The primary function of literature is to feed the soul . Robinson . ? The soul is a matter of metaphysics ; but literature is a part of our earth , it grows in the ground like an oak . Define what you mean . Jones . ? I ca n't ; the soul wo n't submit to definition . It is illimitable . It is as much a yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into relation with God , on the other to matter . It 's relation to material things is to take what they have to give , to nourish itself by that taking , to feed on love , on self-purification , to grow strong by detaching itself from hate , from vulgarity , from grossness . The preservation of the soul is quite as important as the preservation of the body , and it needs not only the robust food offered by daily life , but the daintier food , often more nourishing , more invigorating , of literature . For in literature the souls of men express themselves with more freedom and greater clearness than they do in actual life . It is hard to express the soul in deeds ; for life offers many hindrances , and the deeds of the soul are often blurred by the trivial or gross happenings of life , so that they no longer exhibit the qualities of the soul , whereas in literature the soul has been able to reveal itself most completely . So I value literature chiefly as the record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps my own spiritual life . Robinson . ? That may apply to Thomas-a-Kempis or the Vita Nuova , but how about Madame Bovary , or It Fuoco ? Jones . ? The records of a sick soul , of a dying soul , teach lessons as well as the records of a healthy soul . The pathology of the soul is a necessary part of spiritual knowledge . Robinson . ? You fellows take professional views . Your wits have been subdued to your callings . Life is not an endeavor to attain or to ward off , it is a matter of entertainment ; it is neither a school nor a chapel , it is a theatre . Melancholy Jacques said the last word on that subject . Men and women are players , endlessly playing tragedy , comedy , farce , or more commonly a piece composed of all three . We must look at life objectively . The spectator 's business is to interest himself in the plot , to welcome the thrill of tragedy , to smile at the comic , to laugh at the farcical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play as a privilege , to value the lighted theatre far higher than the unknown without , where there is neither light nor sound . Literature is the record of past life . It is a play within the play and to be taken at the same estimate as life , as an opportunity for a most varied entertainment . Brown . ? If our views are professional , your view is the most professional of all . This universe as we see it , the result of toil , patience , energy , beyond the reach of man 's imagination Robinson . ? Exists for the sake of the dilettante . Precisely ; there is no other possible hypothesis . Jones . ? Well , let us not wander too far from the subject . How does all this apply to the three literatures that Mr. Loeb has gathered together for the sake of challenging us ? II Brown . ? Our opinions of literature are , as I understand them , of this general purport . Literature , according to me , shows us the nature of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force which most affect us during our pilgrimage through life , and therefore enables us to use those forces to our advantage or to prevent them from doing us hurt . According to Jones , literature , being in its deepest sense the tale of the spiritual experiences of men , of the success or failure of the human soul , teaches us how to educate our own souls . Or , if we follow Robinson , and regard life primarily as a spectacle , then literature adds immensely to the richness of the show by supplementing the incompleteness of the present with the greater completeness of the past , and so adds to the value of life . If we commit ourselves to these principles , how do we apply them to the three literatures which the first volumes of the Loeb Classical Library present to our attention ; how , to begin with , to the literature of early Christianity ? That seems to fall rather more in your province , Jones , than in ours . What do you think of the volumes of the Apostolic Fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall have to begin , as I used to begin my lectures at the theological school , with some general statements . Will you please bear with me , Robinson ? Robinson . ? Reverie , if not sleep , is always open to me . Jones . ? Christianity is the fruit of the maternal tenderness in humanity ; it was born of the great throbs of compassion for mortal sorrows , and at birth dedicated itself to the ennoblement of mankind , for in ennoblement , as it believed , lies our only hope of happiness . The first disciples were sensitive men , ignorant of , or indifferent to , the pleasures of the world , who rejoiced in the belief that self-sacrifice for an ideal is the solution of life 's enigma . The history of the beginning of Christianity is the most famous literature in our western world , and , I suppose , fulfills Robinson 's requirements as well as Brown 's and mine . In that first period of Christian history the sacred fire was lighted . In the second period the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the sacred fire alive , and so , in order to protect it from the winds and rain , the disciples of the first disciples built about it the great edifice of the Church . In the book of the Apostolic Fathers , which contains the Epistles of Clement , of Ignatius , and of Polycarp , this devout process is plainly at work . Jones goes to the table and picks up The Apostolic Fathers . ' The scene is in the Roman Empire , the time is at the end of the first and the beginning of the second century , and yet we are at once aware that we have left the precincts of the ancient world and have entered the purlieus of the Middle Ages . There , before us , crowned with light or darkness , as you may please to think , rises the mighty fabric of the Holy Roman Church . Certainly , my dear Robinson , by this event the theatre of history was greatly enriched . Robinson . ? The early Christians make a most interesting episode . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was inclined , like me , to look upon life as a theatre , wrote to his friend Servianus a few words about the Christians in Egypt . ' Egypt , which you praised to me so warmly , my dear Servianus , I found altogether frivolous , unstable , and shifting with every breath of rumor . Their one god is money , him Christians , Jews , and Gentiles alike adore . ' Jones . ? The emperor was looking for diversion and failed to get anything more than diversion ; and so when he wished to satisfy his longing for beauty , for an element of poetry in life , he could rise no higher than the gaze at AntinOus . The Christians of Egypt may have adored Mammon , but there were Christians in Syria and Asia Minor who did not . Here in this book is proof . It contains poetry , exquisite poetry ; it asserts that poetry is the order of the universe , that poetry is truth . It is worth while , in our search after nourishment for the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life there may be many such people , but they are hard to find ; those who live poetry are , in my experience , very shamefaced about it . Let me read you this . Reads from Clement . ' The heavens moving at his appointment are subject to Him in peace ' ; ? but no , that is too long , I will merely read you his prayer . ' Grant us to hope on thy name , the source of all creation , open the eyes of our heart to know thee , that thou alone art the highest in the highest , and remainest holy among the holy . Thou dost humble the pride of the haughty , thou dost destroy the imaginings of nations , thou dost raise up the humble and abase the lofty , thou makest rich and makest poor , thou dost slay and make alive , thou alone art the finder of spirits and art God of all flesh , thou dost look on the abysses , thou seest into the works of man , thou art the helper of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creator and watcher over every spirit . . . Save those of us who are in affliction , have mercy on the lowly , raise the fallen , show thyself to those in need , heal the sick , turn again the wanderers of thy people , feed the hungry , ransom our prisoners , raise up the weak , comfort the faint-hearted ; let all " nations know thee , that thou art God alone , " and that Jesus Christ is thy child , and that we are thy people , and the sheep of thy pasture . ' Is there not something to be learned from people whose life is centred in poetry ? Does not their idea of what is worth while teach us something , which we , looking about us , would not be able to find for ourselves ? Do we not need , in a world preoccupied with chemistry , physics , biology , to remember that many men have found extraordinary help in prayer ? Listen to this : ' Love of joy and of gladness , ' says the epistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of righteousness . ' ' None of these things sundry duties to be done are unknown to you if you possess perfect faith towards Jesus Christ , and love , which are the beginning and end of life ; for the beginning is faith and the end is love , and when the two are joined together in unity , it is God , and all other noble things follow after them . No man who professes faith sins , nor does he hate who has obtained love . ' On these wings the early Christians flew high above poverty , sickness , oppression , envy , and meanness ; they found the key that unlocked for them the riches of life ; they discovered what we are all seeking ; they became , as Barnabas says , - asma ds6poenivris , Children of Mirth . If a knowledge of early Christian literature will help us to learn from them , there is something to be said for it . Robinson . ? I agree that the picture of these men dragging their chains from Antioch to Rome , merely fearful last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being devoured by wild beasts , is highly melodramatic . The Roman amphitheatre has claims on the gratitude of posterity . Brown . ? The interest really lies in the singular power that these men displayed . Here is a belief-engendered energy that shames the dynamo . Poly .. carp had a countless line of ancestors , stretching immeasurably back to the beginnings of organic life on this globe , and each parent in that countless line transmitted to his child one great duty , to shun death ; and for unnumbered generations every child obeyed , until there in Antioch , Polycarp , under the influence of a fantastic belief , broke that primal law as if it had been a dry twig . In fact , these Christians claimed to control a very potent form of energy , and their method of exercising that control was by prayer . This is a matter of psychological interest ; we can not study this power too closely , nor can AC make too many experiments in the hope of becoming able to draw upon it at will . I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the value of literature . Jones. ? As I seem to have the floor , I will go ahead with this other book , these two red volumes , ' The Conies- Mane of St. Augustine , which , in point of history constitutes another stage in the development of Christianity . The pages , it is true , contain a great mist of rhetorical piety ( if that phrase is not too unsympathetic ) ; but out of this mist every now and again emerge some human details , with the peculiar charm that bits of landscape have when a fog lifts and the greens of field and wood shine in summer sunlight . St. Augustine certainly has not neglected to gratify Robinson 's taste for the theatre . But the real significance of the Confessions lies in its contribution to our understanding of the soul . Will you bear with me while I read a little more ? Brown . ? Fire away . Jones . ? The twelfth chapter of the eighth book recounts Augustine 's retreat to a garden after a struggle between the Spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcame him , how he flung himself down under a fig tree and cried out between his sobs reacle : ' And then , 0 Lord , how long , how long , Lord , wilt thou be angry ? for ever ? Remember not our former iniquities ( for I found myself to be still enthralled by them ) . Yea , I sent up these miserable exclamations , How long ? how long still , " to-morrow and to-morrow " ? Why not now ? Wherefore even this very hour is there not an end put to my uncleanness ? ' Then he heard a young voice , like a boy 's or girl 's , say in a sort of chant , ' Tolle , lege , ? Take up , and read . ' So he went back to the apostle 's book and read , ' Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfill the lusts thereof . ' He needed to read no further , for instantly .. . all the darkness of doubting vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine 's experience , shares in its effect . They go to Monica , ? hide ad matrem ingredimur , indicamus : gaudel . There is a simplicity and direct- ness in the Latin that is ill-rendered by ' From that place we went to my mother and told her . She was overjoyed . ' And if any one is impatient to learn , in the space of a single page , the cause of the triumph of Christianity , let him turn to the tenth chapter of the ninth book , where Augustine and Monica , while they wait at Ostia for a ship to carry them home to Carthage , commune with one another on their religion , leaning out of the window that looked into the garden . They are considering what the Gospel means by the words , ' Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord . ' I use my own translation in part . Saint Augustine says reads : ' Suppose that the tumult of the flesh be still , that the phantasm of the earth , the waters , the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be silent , and by not thinking of itself transcend itself , that dreams be silent and all the revelations of the imagination , and every tongue and every sign ; suppose that every moving thing be silent altogether ( for , if any one listen , all things say , we have not made ourselves , but He that is everlasting made us ) . Suppose , after they have said this , that they keep silent , since they have lifted up our ears to Him that made them , and that He speak alone , not by them but of Himself , so that we hear his voice , not by tongue of flesh , neither by voice of angel , nor by sound of thunder , nor by the riddle of allegory , but that we hear Him , whom in his creatures we love , that we hear Him without them ? just as we now reach out and by swift thought touch the eternal wisdom that overspreads all things . Suppose that this exaltation of soul continue , and that all visions that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seer , swallow him up , and immerse him in inward joy , so that his life forever shall be such as was his moment of understanding , for which we have yearned . Is not this : Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord ? ' Brown . ? You are right . Such lives are lessons in the largest sense . What you have read is not merely the meditation of a philosopher , pondering over an hypothesis that the mind might entertain , but a vital , creative energy sprung from a particular , definite belief . Such a life as his gives significance to metaphysics . Here is a force as little understood as radium or the magnetic pole , and it seems to have a greater power than they ; Augustine 's belief dominated his life , and through him dominated a world , bringing nobleness and joy . I quite agree with you , Jones . Robinson . ? As a spectator , I applaud . Had Augustine not lived , my seat in this singular playhouse would have been of less value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome and Greece constitute the bulk of the Loeb Library . It is they that ask , ' What do we mean to you ? ' Jones . ? I suppose that you have in mind their direct influence upon us ; for indirectly , we all admit , they have affected us enormously . Brown . ? Yes , their direct effect upon us . Robinson . ? Unfortunately , they have no direct effect upon us . Jones . ? Because we neglect them ? Robinson . ? No ; but because with our inheritance , we can not , or at least do not , look upon the classics with our own eyes . Brown . ? Explain yourself . Robinson . ? We are children of the Italian Renaissance . That movement , so far as it concerns the classical world , was an interpretation ; and the interpretation that the Renaissance adopted has been handed down to us . This tradition has determined how we shall look , how we shall see , what , in short , our conception of the Greek and Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of scholars , are you ? Robinson . ? No ; I speak of the conventional conception of the classics entertained by persons who are not scholars . Scholars have their own academic conventions concerning the classics , contrived by Selden , Porson , Jebb , and their coadjutors of Paris , Leipsic , and Berlin ; with that I have nothing to do . I refer to the definite , conventional conception of the classics that has become a part of our western culture . This conception was shaped for us by the Italians of the Renaissance . To them the great world of Rome , of law , of culture , of civilization , that lifted its distant head above the coarse , inane happenings of the Middle Ages , was a golden time ? Saturnia regna ; it appeared to them as the Alps first appeared to young Ruskin , rising in snow-capp 'd , inaccessible glory . In this matter , we are disciples of the Renaissance . We dress our minds in clothes of its fashioning . Dante 's invocation to Virgil , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or se ' to quel Virgilio ? is , as it were , the first modern cry of greeting to the great figures of the ancient world . Then follows Petrarch 's adoration of Cicero , and Boccaccio 's eulogy of Rome . All the stirrings of the Italian mind turned toward the mighty past of Rome . From Italy this Italian conception of the classics spread to the north . France took fire . On and on the admiration of the achievements of antiquity proceeded , invading England and Germany ; and finally in the eighteenth century it burst out again with renewed power . But , as you know , Brown , far better than I , of all this multitude of ad- mirers , imitators , and eulogists of the classical world , they who have had most effect in fashioning our popular idea of what that world means , are the great Germans , Winckelmann , Leasing , and Goethe . They , more than the others , justified the tradition and imposed upon us the conception that the antique world was compact of sobriety , poise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our word ' classical . ' Leasing says , somewhere , ' It was the happy privilege of the ancients never to pass beyond or stop short of the proper limit . ' Winckelmann expressed the same idea , and Goethe spent a lifetime seeking to impress this same conception upon conduct . ' A man , ' he says , ' may accomplish much through directing individual abilities to one goal ; he may accomplish the unusual through the union of several capacities ; but the wholly unpredictable , the Unique , he achieves only if all his powers unite together in even measure . The last was the happy lot of the Ancients , especially the Greeks of the best time . ' Brown . ? Nevertheless , in spite of Goethe 's reference to the Greeks , in spite of Winckelmann 's and Lessing 's belief that they were holding up Greek models to the world , in spite of the French classical tragedy , or the universal admiration of Homer , the meaning of the word ' classical ' for them was Latin , not Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brown . ? Therefore , although sobriety , measure , repose , are contained in our word classical , there is a definiteness , a circumscription , a conventionality , a practicality , in the phrase , that could only have come from Latin influence . Our conception of the classics is Latin or at best Grseco-Latin . If the shapers of the classical tradition had been bred upon Greece instead of upon Rome , they never could have attempted to cram the meaning of ancient Greece into a conception which could be represented by a single phrase , even when that phrase ? sobriety , measure , repose ? has so much convenience to recommend it . You agree to this , Robinson , do n't you ? Robinson . ? Oh , yes ; you are perfectly right . My point was that we accept the classics upon a wholly traditional valuation ; and I was going to add that one of the great services which Mr. Loeb 's classical library renders is that we are morally obliged to look at the classics , so far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own minds about them . We must take the word classical down from its pedestal and see what it really means . Jones. ? You were quite right , Robinson , to call our attention to this tradition , but you have digressed from the point . Let us get back to the subject we started with : What do these Greek and Latin classics mean to us ? Robinson . ? Excuse me , parson , but I meant to remove an obstacle from our path . Jones . ? It is for me , sir , to apologize ; you were wholly right . Unluckily the clock warns me that we have gone past half our time . IV Brown . ? We all agree , I suppose , that the study of poise , measure , sobriety , self-control , would be of great advantage to us . And if tradition , no matter how it originated , ascribes to the literature of Greece and Rome those qualities , it is worth while to consider the matter and find out if there be any truth in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature will contradict tradition very flatly , and show that these traits were no more characteristic of the Greeks as human beings , than of ourselves . Goes to bookcase and takes down one or two books . Take Homer , and you see that the Greeks acted under the push of passion with the energy of their southern temperament . When Achilles is angry with Agamemnon he says : ' Thou heavy with wine , thou with face of dog and heart of deer . ' And when he has struck down Hector of the glancing plume , he spurns his entreaties : ' Entreat me not , dog , by knees or parents , Would that my heart 's desire could so bid me myself to carve and eat raw thy flesh , for the evil thou hast wrought me , as surely there is none that shall keep the dogs from thee , not even should they bring ten or twentyfold ransom and here weigh it out , and promise even more ; not even were Priam , Dardano 's son , to bid pay thy weight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee on a bed to mourn her son , but dogs and birds shall devour thee utterly . ' And after Hector is dead , ' Other sons of the Achaians ran up around , who gazed upon the stature and marvelous goodliness of Hector . Nor did any stand by but wounded him , and thus would many a man say looking toward his neighbor : " Go to , of a truth far easier to handle is Hector now than when he burnt the ships with blazing fire . " Thus would many a man say , and wound him as he stood hard by . ' Achilles is a passionate child , and the Homeric Greeks an emotional , excitable people . In Sophocles , you remember how the mad Ajax is described as mistaking sheep for his enemies . ' Of part , he cut the throats on the floor within ; some , hewing their sides , he rent asunder . Then he caught up two white-footed rams ; he sheared off the head of one , and the tongue-tip , and flung them away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized a heavy thong of horse-gear , and flogged with shrill , doubled lash , while he uttered revilings which a god , and no mortal , had taught . ' The Trojan Women is one long wail , and Philoctetes is almost as full of self-pity as Obermann . Even the aphorisms of Sophocles are often as intemperate as the utterances of the Hebrew prophets : ' Searching out all things , thou in most men 's acts wilt find but baseness . ' ' A woman 's oaths I write upon the waves . ' ' Man is but breath and shadow , nothing more . ' Jones . ? How about the lyric poets ? Brown . ? From Archilochus to Bion there is passionate intensity . Passion can never be temperate , it forgets all else and concentrates itself on its own piercing sensation ; that was true of the Greeks as of all hot-blooded human beings Robinson . ? I suppose that those early Italians really based their classical formula on architecture , on the Greek temple and the Roman arch , and on sculpture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always confounded the arts ; they apply , terms of painting to music , of music to architecture , of architecture to literature , and call their confusion criticism . Brown . ? Poor fellows ! Perhaps you need not put them all into one category . But Robinson is right , I think , in assuming that the traditional idea of Greek literature has been taken from Greek sculpture and architecture . The makers of the tradition did not know Greek literature . You can not compress the Greeks ' expression of their experience of life into a single formula . Professor Wheeler says that /Eschylus is ' mystic and transcendental ' ; Professor Shorey that ' the antithesis of classical and realistic is as false as the opposition of classic and romantic . ' Mr. Gilbert Murray speaks of the ' terrible emo tional ' power possessed by Thucydides ; and in another passage he warns us of the danger of serious misapprehension that lies in inferences based upon the judgment of the scribes who selected but a small portion of the great mass of Greek literature for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads accounts in textbooks of the characteristics of the Greek mind : its statuesque quality , its love of proportion and order and common-sense , its correct rhetoric and correct taste , its anthropomorphism and care for form , and all those other virtues which sometimes seem , when added together , to approach so dangerously near the total of dull correctness and spiritual vacuity , it is well to remember that the description applies not to what the ancient Greeks wrote , but to what the late Roman and Byzantine scholars preserved . ' Robinson . ? How about Latin literature ? You stated that the tradition of classical sobriety , so far as it is based on literature at all , is based much more on the Latin classics than on the Greek ? Perhaps Latin will justify , at least to some extent , the traditional view . Brown . ? I can see no better ground for the tradition with regard to Latin than to Greek . Italian tradition having assumed that the ancient Roman character was like the masonry of the Colosseum , went further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if we go behind the tradition and look directly at the Latin literature which depicts Roman character , we find that the ancient Romans were very much like ourselves , with no more poise , measure , sobriety , or repose than we Americans of to-day possess , if indeed as much . They were men like ourselves . Terence 's famous line , ? Homo sum : humani nil a me alienum puto , ? sums up , as well as is possible in a single line , our two modern charac- teristics , human curiosity and human sympathy . Terence 's dramatis person have no suggestion of brick , travertine , or mortar . Take the familiar lines of Catullus , ? Read the verses in which Propertius bids his fellow-poet Gallus beware of falling in love with Cynthia , And again , take his complaint , Or , since Propertius fills one of the first volumes in the Loeb Classical Library , read the beautiful last farewell of Cornelia , daughter of Cornelius Scipio , to her husband Paullus , ? Evidently the Romans had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tibullus to Delia tell the same tale : Robinson . ? But , if you disregard the meaning and listen only to the words , you find a dignity , a massiveness , in the Latin syllables that modern literature seldom or never has . Brown . ? There you come close to the cause of the tradition . Compare Italian with Latin and you perceive why the humanists of the Renaissance found poise , measure , sobriety , and repose in classical literature . Jones . ? I am a little confused . Am I to understand that you wholly reject the tradition of poise , measure , sobriety and self-control , as having no affinity with classical literature ? Brown . ? Not at all . The tradition , begun by the Italians of the Renaissance , is based on a false analogy to sculpture and architecture , and on the contrast between our modern Romance languages and Latin ; but I believe that those qualities , though they do not lie in the character or disposition of the ancients , are qualities of their method of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hod-carrier .

Mathematics are the same in German , Italian , and English ; but the simplest word has an individuality as marked as that of a human child . To the ears of familiarity and affection no other sequence of syllables can reproduce the tenderness of the mother tongue . By means of the Loeb Classical Library the reader of little Latin and less Greek has an opportunity to turn from the English and pick up a phrase or two , a word , perhaps , here and there ; merely to do so puts him in the spiritual presence of the original . He is then , as it were , reading about a person 's experiences , with the privilege at any moment of looking up to see that per- son 's face . Jones . ? That is true ; but our question is , how do the classics themselves help us ? Robinson . ? The answer lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any modern literature , teach us art , and art is the conscious purpose of man to make this world more beautiful . Philip Sidney says that the object of poetry is to make this too-much-loved world more lovely ; I should extend his definition a little further and say that the object of art is to make this world more lovely , more lovable , and more loved . Modern literature , compared with ancient literature , is careless , slipshod , not wholly grown-up ; it has little sense of responsibility . The chief duty it sets before itself is to hold the mirror up to nature and reflect the unintelligible happenings of life , in all their confusion , their inconsistency , their inanity . Ancient literature was dominated by a very different purpose , it had a profound sentiment of high duty . The creation , so it seemed to the ancients , had been left incomplete , and man , as the creature most divine , was charged with the labor of carrying on the uncompleted task . With bold hearts the Greeks set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially with poetry , to make up for the neglect of the gods by human achievement . I look on those ancient Greeks and Romans as I do on workmen who fill in the marshy shallows of our river fronts , put earth upon the spongy ooze , sow grass , set out trees , plant flowers , and create a garden where before was merely mud and slime . Brown . ? Life , as Wordsworth said , and I am glad to see that Robinson supports him , requires an art , and of all the arts the art of living is the most useful , the most admirable . All conscious art is an attempt to transfer emotion or thought from him who feels or thinks it to other human beings . Art is the necessary consequence of human sympathy . Men are not happy in isolation ; they undergo the experience of emotion , of thought , and they are impelled to impart this wonderful experience to others . Some men make use of marble or bronze , some of pencil and paint , some of written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wide reaching , as means to impart emotion and thought , are manners and speech . I hardly know which of the two is more important . By manners I mean the bearing of the body , in every part , from head to foot , the whole outward man . Our human instinct , the inner impulse , the will to live , insists , for one purpose or another , upon our imparting emotion and thought ; to do so well requires art , to do so excellently is a fine art . To pass on emotion and thought unimpaired in their first vigor , in their first freshness , adds the life of each to the lives of all ; it increases , intensifies , and expands all life . Feelings , thoughts , are seeds , shaken from the parent stalk , that lodge and fructify in new soil . Each feeling , each thought , should pass on as free as light from mind to mind . This art ? the human art I may call it ? lies in the choice of words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what Petrarch calls it bel tacere , the art of silence , and in ' holding and moving the body , ? eyes , lips , arms , hands ? so that mind shall communicate with mind , free from obscurity or blur , as through an open window . Art is all one . We talk of the fine arts ; but that is an arbitrary distinction . Our abilities and our time are limited , and naturally we give ourselves up to that form of art which seems most suited to our purposes ; but one thing we are all bound to do , and that is to remain staunchly loyal to all art . The Greeks were the supreme artists , and we must go to them as to the fountain head of the waters which alone can quench the human thirst for human sympathy . They teach us how best to live . By studying delicacy , beauty , power , clarity , in their written speech , we learn how much those qualities add to the fullness of life , and we take away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , and the lives of our friends , fuller , more complete , more in accord with the possibilities of life . Robinson . ? Yes . As Brown was saying , the special qualities , sobriety , self-control , repose , which tradition assigns to the classics , although not true of Greek or Latin feelings , are in great measure true of the form in which those feelings are expressed in Greek and Latin literature . Tradition is wrong to attribute those utterly non-southern qualities to living Greeks and Romans , but it is right to recognize that they are the chief qualities in classical form . Form is the legacy of antiquity to us . Life is movement , it does not concern itself with form . Life at its best , at its highest , is passion . Passion is the one sacred quality that exists , so far as man can see , in the universe . The chief duty of art is to perpetuate passion by putting it in such form that all who behold shall be quickened and take away more life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent passion is through restraint ; that sobriety and measure offer the least imperfect means to depict life in its intensity . That is the lesson of art for the theatre , as Hamlet knew before me . That is the lesson that Brown clamors for , the lesson of conduct . To learn it we must go to school to the classics . If the Loeb Classical Library helps us to comprehend the immense significance of restraint in the delineation of life , it has achieved a great thing . Jones . ? I have much in common with both of you , but , probably because I am a clergyman , my point of view is a little different . I advocate the classics because they constitute a retreat , in which the spirit may commune with the high thoughts of the past . Modern literature is modern ; it concerns itself with actual life , with our distractions , our trivialities , our romance , our getting on in the world , with all our coarser appetites ; but in the remote classics , in that cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation , to meditation , to the high influences that always stoop to the soul 's call . This remoteness of the classics affects me as my remembrance of gracious figures in my childhood . The people there seem to have a nobler aspect , a more goodly presence , larger sympathies , a wiser and a kinder attitude . We do not apply the lessons we learned from them directly to life , but we know that somehow the most valuable lessons in our lives came from them ; we can not say just what we learned , but we possess a memory of quietness , of ripeness , of wisdom , of qualities that lie near the centre of life , and we feel that to them is due whatever gain we have made in grace and moral stature . Greek literature has a like effect upon us . We need , profoundly , times of seclusion , of withdrawal from the outer world , from the domination of the senses ; we need to escape from the current notion that life lies in motion , in rush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opposing experience . We can no longer betake ourselves to a Carthusian monastery or a Benedictine abbey : the East is too strange , too little akin to us ; but the classics of Greece and Rome offer us a retreat , a refuge for the tired spirit , a home for the unquiet mind . I , for one , long to put on from time to time cow ! , cord , and sandals , and dwell in the sequestered and cloistered classics , far from the senseless noises of the world . As to art , I agree that the classics teach it , that we need it , that self-expression is or should be an art ; and for me the function of this art of self-expression is to reveal the more delicate , the more subtle , the more spiritual elements of the soul . Many people , I believe , possess fine qualities , but because of inability to master their medium of expression , whether act , word or silence , those qualities , as Shakespeare says , ' die to themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to transmit their sweetness , is one of the problems of religion , a problem that needs the help of art . Without great art , conscious or unconscious , the self-revelation of all great spiritual souls would have been impossible . David , if the psalms are his , St. Augustine , Thomas-h-Kempis , John Bunyan , Jonathan Edwards , are great artists . More than all other people the Greeks possessed the art of portraying the finer qualities of the soul , as well as the ' deep and dazzling darkness ' that encompasses humanity . Robinson . ? The business of art ? I merely add this in order to define my own position ? is not merely to quicken all life , to heighten its pulse , by means of a fuller and freer intercommunication of thought and feeling . Art must always be up and at work , refashioning the things of the earth for the good of man . Architecture can make a city beautiful , sculpture and painting can add their loveliness ; but those arts merely concern things material . Literature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human experience is made of , work upon it , and convert it into nobler , more beautiful , more stimulating shapes . Literature must tear away the curtain of familiarity that hides the beauty in common things . Or , as Parson Jones would put it , literature is the angel , the mon , the demiurge , that redeems this gross life and helps wipe out its shame . Would you rather see the England in which Shakespeare , Chaucer , Wordsworth lived , or that England as they have pictured it ? Would you rather have lived in France under Louis Philippe , in Russia under Alexander II , or as Balzac and Tolstoi described the one and the other ? I find all life chaotic until it has passed through the mind of an artist . Jones . ? Robinson grows lyrical . That means that it is very late , and time to go to bed . Good night , Brown . Robinson . ? Who cares for what the isles of Greece were to the common men who lived in them ? But the realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are still the home of beauty . Jones . ? Come on , Robinson . You are a literary Niobe , all words . Brown . ? Good night : Come again . Robinson . ? Good night . My last word is Greece .
