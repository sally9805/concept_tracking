 | THE United States is ? so we say . Not long ago we said the United States are . The change in thought came rather quickly . Economic changes made it come . We are now greatly in need of similar change in thought whereby we shall think in world terms . As we have recently added national thinking to state thinking , so we need a geographic imagination that we may add to ourselves world thinking , world feeling , and world acting . The war is making us think that way , whether we will or no . It has shown us that on the economic side we are already doing world living and we are rapidly waking up to the rest of the idea ? that we must also do world thinking and world governing . We have spent a century building up a world trade and a world interdependence , until finally it has got to the point where not only our comfort , but actually our physical life , depends upon continued access to the sea and lands oversea . Witness Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the population is saved from starvation only by the charity of governments and individuals working through the highly organized Belgian Relief , depending upon the future for its pay . The fate of Belgium would come even more quickly to New England under the plan of conquest laid down by the German General Staff , which is to cut America in two parts along the natural defense lines made by the Potomac , the Susquehanna , the Hudson , and Lakes George and Champlain . Grant continued trade , as of 1913 , and the population of our western world can yet increase several times over . But it all depends on access to the sea and sea trade . This means that access to the sea and peaceful trade is the greatest thing in the world , for upon analysis the object of everything is a chance to live , a chance to live a more abundant life . If one life is precious , ten lives are more so , ten million much more so , and one hundred million yet ten times more so . Block a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence , with increased numbers , they would perish even more quickly . Therefore , the preservation of the life of peoples and the utilization of this earth as the home of man depends upon the uninterrupted flow of goods across the sea , the world highway which connects the many parts of the world , and makes it one . A people should have no more question about their access to the sea than a man has about access to the street . And any particular nation should have no more control of the sea than a man has of the street . We thought this fine new thing , this world trade , was guaranteed by a set of precedents and gentlemen 's agreements that we called international law . It proved on test to be a mere scrap of paper . What next ? Government , real government . The world must have one . The independence , the comfort , nay , the life of all depend upon it . The question now is , " Shall the ruling power be one nation acting with the irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better way , by agreement of several nations , acting through some kind of international government or super-state ? " Government has been gaining ground of late ; witness the United States . In 1789 thirteen independent nations became one nation and peace has prevailed , save during the period of the Civil War , from 1861 to 1865 , when certain parties tried to break up the league by appealing to armies rather than to votes . Italy , which was recently a group of independent kingdoms , has become one kingdom . Germany , a group of states of various sizes and kinds , has become one empire , a belated follower of France and of the United Kingdom in the process of unification . We need but one more step in the unification , and seven or eight powers can keep the peace in the world as easily as the United States keeps the peace among the forty-eight States of this country . The Civil War , 1861-1865 , was really a struggle to see whether the bullet method or the ballot method should prevail in this league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled it in favor of the more orderly method .  | For such a world government , for such a league of peace all constructive pacifists must resolve to fight just as they would fight defensively to save the organization of their villages , their townships , their counties , and their States from anarchy . It is a peculiar fact that such a league of peace will be peaceful just as long as its members are resolutely warlike and not divided into nearly equal camps . The nation which is sure it has to fight the rest of the world will keep the peace . Hence the importance of public opinion . If some strong nation is uncertain as to world opinion , it might be willing to undertake a war for its own ends . Granting that Germany started this war ( as most of us believe she did ) , it is reasonably safe to assert that she thought she was dealing with a chaotic , disunited world that she could conquer piece by piece . It is scarcely to be supposed that the German administration would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresee the world aligned against it as at the present moment . Therefore the object of American public policy at this time should be to bring the world to such a condition that any nation starting a war unauthorized by the group would find itself the enemy of a world even more hostile than that in which Germany now finds herself . We must make an end of the right of national conquest as we have made an end of the right of personal conquest ? highway robbery . The little peoples , the small nations must be as safe as a lame man in Boston , and the big ones must be as orderly as is a big potential bully on the streets of that city . As the lame man and the pugilist have equal access to the streets of Boston , so the land-locked peoples must , like the great peoples , have free and untaxed access to the all-important sea . The price to be paid for this Utopia is the resolute willingness to fight for it , to fight at the drop of the hat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimatum such as Austria sent to Serbia , threatening national war for national ends , without being authorized by a decision of court after investigations of the facts . Perhaps such an attempt to control society may result in one more great war . If so , it , like our Civil War , will settle something . Such war can only occur if by calamitous cosmic accident the league should happen to divide along nearly equal lines . Who should oppose such a world organization ? Only he who wants to gratify the lust of conquest . How does it fit the needs of Teuton , ally , and neutral ? Take the Teuton . The league guarantees to fight him if he tries to conquer . To fight for him if someone tries to conquer him . It also guarantees him free and untaxed access to the sea . Under these conditions Germany has no more need of Holland and Belgium or Bulgaria than Canada has of New England in January , when her trade goes out through Boston and Portland , or than the United States has of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so freely down the St. Lawrence . Grant such conditions and there is no excuse for a great German army , for " Deutschland Ueber Alles , " or for " Britannia Rules the Waves . " Deutschland could not be ueber Alles . Britannia could not rule the waves . The league would be over all and would rule the waves . Under such conditions the Germans could resume their plowing , their chemistry , their music , and their schools ; so could the English and French , so could the neutrals . The little nation would no longer have to live under arms for fear of being eaten alive . Nor would they have to beg piteously for bread as giant combat closed the arteries of trade . All this is not so revolutionary as at first glance it may appear . One example will prove my point and also the next point ? the proper treatment of the disorderly , the anarchistic . The examples of Haiti and San Domingo are most- opportune . By the Monroe Doctrine they have been protected from foreign conquest . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected from some of the extremes of internal disorder ? private conquest from within . The so-called republics of Haiti and San Domingo have been through a course of treatment that is strikingly analagous to that of a delinquent family in any wellordered municipality . They are excellent exhibits , as to method , for the world organizer . The example of Haiti needs but to be extended to another hemisphere , made somewhat more judicial , and the small nation is protected from both conquest and chaos . It can go on with the great service of social experiment , and man , whether his country be big or little , can begin to live .
