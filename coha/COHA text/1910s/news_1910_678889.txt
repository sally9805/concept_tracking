txt Admitting defeat upon the question of enlarging N sec changing the membership of the Committee on Rules , but still striving despetettely to prevent the personal humiliation of Speaker Cannon through his forcible elimination from that committee , the regular Republicans in the House this afternoon gained the help of enough insargents to bring about a postponement of the whole matter until to-morrow , so ac to give time for rest and for further effort to reach a salisfactery compromise . It is no longer a question of winning a victory en er the Insurgent-Democratic combination and preserving the rules and the House organization intact . It has developed into a question merely of saving .. knew Speaker 's face , and on that his friends are working with even greater energy than they dispaiyed in the straight-out struggle for the rules . The matter rests almost wholly with the Speaker himself . There is an alternative , to winch some of his friends cling with desperate hope , but even among the most sanguine of them there is very little belief that it can succeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either through the force of , their own arguments or by the interfer.enee of President Taft enough of the more conservative insurgents can be detaehed from the insurgent-Democratic combinat Ion to defeat the proposition to take the Speaker from ' the Rules Commit:E ... ! . by vote of the House . It is recognizeld , however , that this alternative is of small promise . Cannon the Only Obstacle . The real question is whether the Speaker can be persuaded to-night to eliminate himself from the Rules Committee . If he will do that it is believed by both regulars and insurgents that a compromise satisfe.ciery to both camps can be effected . bleb will tend to bring the two Republican factions together again and enable them to present something like a united front to the Democrats in the approaching election . It is admitted on all hands that the Norris resolution is impracticable and would result in endless confusion and disorganization . There was a time yesterday when if it could have been brought cSo a vote it would certainly have been . adopted , But the debate during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own account have brought about such a change of attitude toward it that it is now known that it could not be adopted . Some substitute for it , providing for the election of a new Rules Committee by the House and avoiding the cumbersome and unworkable idea of division of the membership into groups , will undoubtedly be passed when the time for voting ' finally is reached . Even the stanchest of the regulars admit that . The only question yet to be solved is whether or not the new resolution shall declare in terms that the Speaker shall not be a member of the new committee . If Mr. Cannon would consent to eliminate himself it is believed that substantial agreement between the Republican factions as to terms could be reached in a comparatively short time . It would then be adopted by Republican votes , and the . Democrats could do what they pleased about it . Pressure on the Speaker . . lip to the time of this writing Mr. Cannon has refused to take that step . The regulars are working hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pennsylvania delegation went to John Dalzell , one of their most prominent members , and a stanch friend and supporter of Speaker Cannon , and bold him hluntly that it was up to him to persuade Mr. Cannon to take that step . It was their idea that the way should be made as easy as possible for the Speaker . The plan involved the holding of a general Republican conference . It was not to be a caucus , for a good many of the insurgents would not enter such a meeting , A caucus is held to be binding upon those who attend it , and if a man refuses to abide by its verdict he bolts his party . , The insurgents who : have been insisting ' upon their true Republicanism do not care to give the regulars who have been trying to read them out of the party such a handle to their argument . A conference is a different matter , not binding upon those who attend it . It is a " gentleman 's agreement " way of settling differences . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference Speaker Cannon should declare his recognition of the situation that confronted the Republican Party , and should 7etpress his willingness , not to be a candi'date for membership upon the new Rules Committee . This would leave the way open for the - adoption of a substitute for . the Norris resolution , which would pro-vide for the election of the new committee , but would not mention the matter of the ' Speaker 's membership on it . This would save the Speaker 's face , and , in the Judgment of many regulars and insurgents , would lead to such improved relations among the Republicans as almost to insure the election of a Republican House next November . Cannon Declines to Quit . It is a hard proposition , however , that Se being made by his friends to the Speaker . Mr. Cannon . began his Congressional career thirty-Seven yeaas ago . Of the i nineteen Congresses that have assembled since then he has been a member of all except one . Tnroughoutt his public life one conspicuous trait of character has been steadily exhibited . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . " Never has i that quality been more , clearly displayed than during the present contest . Now , 1 with his back to the wall in a finish fight . it is proposed to him , even by lila friends , that he shall Quit . He has told ids friends that he has the courage to abandon public life , or to decline to stand again for the Speakership. i He has not yet reached the point where he can bring . himself to take a step which he would regard as a reversal of all he had been and had stood for during his I I long career . He holds that his retirement from the Rules Committee under the present circumstances would be quitting under . fire . This phase of the situation Is perfectly understood by the men who are nevert ( less urging him to make the eaertriee . They are telling him that it is not on their account that they ask  --  him to do so , but for the sake of the party , whose interests are above those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truest of the regulars put it this afternoon : " There is no trouble In any district . My people are with me and there are 20,00e more Republicans than Democrats in the district . But the day is going to come some time when I have got to say to them that for the good of the party they roust choose some one else to represent them here . That is a thing that is going to happen to almost every one of us here . Who is there who would n't rather recognize tile situation for himself and take that step of his own accord than , have it thrust upon him ? " Now , that is what is suggested to the . Speaker . He knows the situation . ' Whether he stays in the fight or takes himself out will not affect me in the least . I am for him , always have been , and always will be as long as he is in the garnet and he knows it . I am not asking I him to take himself out in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind . But it is for the best interest of the party that he shall take this step , and I I hope he will be big enough to make the sacrifice . " Plan For Cannon to Quit Office . Still another proposition has been brought forward this evening . The efforts to prevail upon the Speaker to retire from thealiallen Committee voluntarily not having met with much success , and the prospect of detaching enough insurgents to prevent the Speaker 's elirninatton by vote not being very bright , some of the regulars very close to dir. ( ' annon have been working 1111 a ? new plan . It is to agree to the election of whatever I sort of a Rules Committee the insurgents I demand , whether of ten or ' eifteen meenbers. to be chosen in any practicable way i by the House , but without the eliminetion of the Speaker from it : then the Speaker to agree that at the expiration of this Congress , on March -i of next year , he would retire from the committee . . That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would retire from public life . It is already apparent to his friends , if not to Mr. Cannon himself , , tf.at he can not be elected to tile Speakerehiu again , even if the Republicane carry the next House , and it is very doubtful if he would care to return to Congress under such circumstances . In fact . he had agreed once to announce at the opening of this session that he would retire from Congress at the end of this term . and had planned-to make an extended trip abroad , The prospect late this evening is that this new scheme of compromise will not be any more successful than the others . All these schemes are based on the recognition by the regulars of the fact that there are two factions among the insurgents . There are the extremists , whom the regulars charge with caring , nothing whatever for the ultimate welfare of their party or for the effect of this contest upon the legislative programme for this session . The other faction  --  dubbed by the ultras the " cold-feet " ones ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get matters straightened out among the Republicans themselves if posstble , so as to do the least possible damage to the party and to help toward the election of a Republican House next Fall . Many Conferences Are Held . The day has been one of constant cone ferences between groups of insurgents and groups of regulars . It began last night , when Butler of Pennsylvania , a solid Cannon man , and Woods of Iowa , one of the steady insurgents , got together and began to discuss the possibility of a compromise . They , kept at it most of the night . being joined occasionally by others of both sides . This morning , at about 8 o'clock , the first meeting that could be dignified by the title of conference occurred . It was between Daizell and Tawney for the regulars and Hayes and I.enroot for the insurgents . They met in the HOuse me fice of the Ways and Means Committee . and for an hour or more talked over the matter . The insurgents stuck to their Proposition that the resolution to be adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference led to another that began within an hour or so after this first one ended . It was attended by Dalzell . Tawney , and Walter Smith of Iowa for the regulars and by Gardner , Lenroot. and Norris for the insurgents . Most of the insurgents had gathered in Representative Gardner 's room , while the Speaker 's chief supporters were assembled in his room . It was soon evident I that a compromise could be reached on every point except the one dealing with the Speaker 's membership on the Rules Committee . On that there was an absoflute deadlock . ' Whenever the subject of his retirement was brought to the Speaker he declared with characteristic vehemence that he would never quit . in tile insurgent headquarters the proposition to omit the provision for his forced retirement from the resolution always brought omit vehement denunciation . IDecide on a Day 's Postponement . Finally , just before noon , the whole crowd of insurgents gave up the chance of agreement in cenferenet and trooped back into the House . There the proceedings droned on again as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , however , Dalzell and Tawney were still working first with the Speaker and then with the insurgent leaders . So it went for another hour and a half , when a. motion to i take a recess until 4 o'clock was finally carried . The two hours of recess were spent in ' 1 conferences all aimed at reaching a compromise , and all without material effect . But enough was accomplished to cause the leaders of all except the " ultra-insurgents to hope that the means of agreement might ? still be found if time enough were allowed , and some of the moderate insurgents signified a willingness to vote for further time . Then the House reconvened . Speaker Cannon , as alert and active as if he had not been kept on the rack for twenty-eight consecutive hours , with his red carnation as fresh as ever and the only sign of conflict about him his somewhat wilted collar , surprised the Insurgent-Democratic coalition by announcing that he was ready to deliver the longdelayed and otter-demanded ruling on the point of order that had held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could begin Ills ruling Tawney had-moved a recess until to-morrow : . Promptly Bartlett of Georgia raised a point of order against the motion which the Speaker sustained . Then Gaines of West Virginia . one of the steadiest of the Cannon men , moved to postpone the whole matter until 12:05 to-morrow . This , being . a motion to " postpone to a day certain , " was privileged under the rules , arid a rolleall was.ordered . Twelve insurgents voted for it , and the motion was carried , 164 to 150 . The twelve were Davidson a ' Wisconsin , Fish of - New York , Gardner of Massachusetts , Hayes of-California , Hinshaw of Nebraska , Kendall of Iowa , Kinkaid of Nebraska . Miller of Minnesota , Pickett of Iowa . - Steenerson ? of Minnesota , Volstead of Minnesota , and Woods of Iowa . " Then , after the transaction of a little routine business , the House adjourfied , and ' most of the weary members hustled home to bed : But the leaders of both insurgents and regulars went back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . At 11. o'clock there is no better prospect of reaching a- compromisethan before . Instead , the prospect is that the crisis . will be . reached . in a vote early to-morrow afternoon and  --  that then Speaker Cannon will be overthrown . ? Think Cannon Should-eteasin . ' There is , rage almestindescribfeble among the regulars , coupled with bitterness most intense . Among  --  tile ultra insurgent ? there is. a similar . - feeling , Net . ' in , mangayears has there been suca a fight In the House . and the last time a situation approached this in intensity . of emotion  --  when the Reed rules ? were adopted  --  there was no party split to increase the bitterness . The regulars , or some of them . are talking wildly to-night of what ought to be done after their idol has been overthrown . Some of Clem are saying that immediately after announcing the vote which both sides expect will provide for his retirement from the Rules Committee Speaker Cannon should declare his own resignation from the Speakership . The idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of opposition and endeavor to force upon the coalition the responsibility for all legislation . ' Phu impracticability of this scheme only shows the extent of the rage of the regular , for it would Involve the election of an Insurgent to be Speaker in Cannon 's place by the solid Democratic vote to begin with . Another suggestion , from the regulars is that the overthrow of the Speaker should he followed by a motion to vacate all the committees . thus necessitating the election of new committees and the Coing over again of an immense amount of work . Such action would throw the Hoi " e into complete chaos and destroy the legislative nromeramme as well as , dis . rapt the Republican Party . There would he no telli " g when the cession would end if such a thing were to be done . Democrats in a Dilemma . The Democrats are in a.mighty uncomfortable situation over the row . They are voting and working for something that they hope very greatly will not be accomplished  --  the undoing of the Speaker . They recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaching Congress campaign , and they are afraid that . the elimination of the Sneaker from the Rules Committee now will also bring about his elimination . from the campaean. thus losing them their vital issue . At the same time they see that they are bound to vote against him on every Dossib ) e occasion and to make the most of their present opportunity to overthrow ' him . If they do n't they lose the force of their issue if it is preserved for them until the campaign comes on . So they are hoping that the regulars will yet find some way out of the mesa and be able to muster enough votes to beat the insurgent resolution . Last night some of them went to the Speaker and urged him to hustle in his men and get it over wilh They put It on the ground of physical weariness , bet their real motive was something diffferent . Night Session a Memorable One . The long session of yesterday and today will be long remembered in the history of Legislative Assemblies . No one here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house was compelled to resort to such measures as were employed by Speaker Cannon and the sego- ' lars to avert a decisive vote . Probably , never before was the courtesy . which puts no limit on the time a Speaker shall hero to render a decision on rules . put to the use of preventing the humiliation of the presiding officer . and probably no other majority party in such a body ever broke a quorum as the aide- means of averting its overthrow . It was the Democrats who kept up the long session after the regular Republicans staidenlei deserted the House end I broke the quorum at 2:30 o'clock this morning . Some of the insurgents were willing to go home and let the matter go over until the regular meeting or the Rouse . but Champ Clark , the Democratic leader . insisted- on driving home the fact that the House organization had been forced to the most desperate measures , and his united party backed him up in defeating every attempt to stop proceedings . Under the Constitutional provision which gives less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the t eSeesr.geant at Arms and his deputies were sent out to find and arrest abAngry Member Brought In . These officers , who naturally were in sympathy with the Cannon forces . found one lone Republican  --  Hollingsworth of Ohio  --  peacefully asleep at his hotel . They served the house warrant , required the Ohioan to get tip and dress and come before the bar of the House . He came , protesting indignantly that he was re ularly paired and entitled to be in bed . " I want to know . " he shouted , " who made the motion on which 1 was arrested . " During his whole speech , which was a long one , the House was in a gale of laughter . Mr. Clayton of Alabama gravely suggested that no Republican who stayed at ale expensive hotel had a right to be Paired with any Democrat . For half an hour the fun went on , the Democrats shrieking with laughter at Mr. Hollingsworth 's protest . Finally lie was excused . A hot debate about the possibility of appointing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent members began about 5:31.1 o'clock . It was the general opinion that the sergeant-at-arms and his deputies were making no sincere effort to find the missing Republicans . Mr. Dalzell , in the chair , ruled that the minority there present was helpless to appoint any additional officers of the House : Representative Hardwick ( Dern. ) of Georgia moved the aappointment of a temporary Assistant Sergeant at Arms with authority to employ additional assistants to bring in the missing Representatives . The chair ruled the motion out of order , but on appeal was overruled with a shout . Then new officers were named and went out to look for the missing Republicans . Cannon Shows His Anger . Speaker Cannon himself came on the scene about 6 A. M. He had been around all night , and had only an ' hour 's sleep . Mr. Burleson of Texas demanded to know whether he had signed new warrants for the absentees " as ordered by this House ? " " Uncle Joe 's " voice quivered with rage as he replied with a bang of the gavel : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . " Mr. Burleson 's face was very red , and Ins voice , too , shook with passion , as be said : a Am I to understand that the Speaker declines to obey the mandate of this House ? Have not these Warrants been issued ? " 4 " Warrants were issued . " shouted the Speaker , " under the rules for the summoning of each of the absentees . " 0I mean the warrants ordered by thisHouse to be given to ' Joe ' Sinnott , . who was appointed by this House a special assistant Sergeant at Arms , " persisted ' ti , Mr. Burleson. a The chair has no knowledge of any ? Joe ' Sinnott , whoever he may be , " area toiled the Speaker , with scornful deliberation . Then followed a lively interchange , participated in by : Messrs . Underwood of Ala .. bama , Olmsted of Pennsylvania , James of Kentucky , and the Speaker ; the latter evidently suppressing - his emotions with much difficulty . The end of it was that the Speaker refused to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrants for anybody . After a few moments , however . the Speaker modified his aggressive tone and remarked that the long night vigil had evidet tly ' ed certain members to be somewhat careless in the use of language and k to cast suspicion upon faithful employes i " I have never known a quorum to be obtained in the early morning hours or before daybreak , " he said . There was some desultory argument , but everybody seemed to lose interest thereafter in the nen ? assistant Sergeantat-Arms and his unsigned warrants . probably not fifty nwinbers were left in their seats at 8 o'clock , and some of them were asleep . some read the morning papers , others gathered in groups wearily discussing the situation . The Speaker : : held his post . idly toying with his gavel.1 Some of his Democratic friends took ad- , vantage of the opportunity of a social visit with him , and the conversation was jovial . Many members went to breakfast . There was another outburst shortly beg : fore 12 o'clock . " The Speaker of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shouted " Representative Shackleford of Missouri . The debate drifted along with but " small. , : interest on the part of the House . It Was ? known that a committee representing the insurgents was conferring with representatives of the regular Republicans , and the debate was regarded-as-a means of permitting efforts looking toward some agreement . Then came the recess at 2 o'clock , and finally the adjournment .
