EVERY boy passes through the most critical period of his entire life in the years when , leaving childhood behind , he enters youth . Many boys ' lives are wrecked during these years , simply because boy nature is not understood as it should be . Therefore , as a mother of sons now grown to manhood , and as an acquaintance of hundreds of boys , I plead for a better chance for those who are boys today . This will come only as parents , teachers , and the community realize and understand that so-called bad boys are , in most instances , the direct result of failure to understand boyhood 's needs , and of the consequent mistaken methods of discipline and education . In a wide acquaintance with boys whom the world called bad , I have never seen one whose heart could not be touched and his higher nature brought out through sympathetic understanding and confidence . I have seen so many boys driven from home , causing heart-break to their parents and ruin to the boys , because their fathers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have seen so many boys driven into criminal lives because of ignorant , mistaken treatment of boyish faults , that I know of no greater need than to promulgate faith in boyhood 's nobility and its possibilities for useful manhood . And with this faith should go the knowledge of how to guide the boys through the maelstrom in the stream of life into the smooth current of manhood . Those who have studied child development claim that children do not reason according to adult standards before the age of fourteen . Therefore , before then , it is not just to hold them responsible as one ' would an adult . Aristotle fixed the beginning of the age of reason at fourteen . Then the youth is no longer willing to submit without question to the commands of parents , nor to take unquestioningly any statements .  | The relationship of parent and child should at this time begin to change into that of friend and companion . The homenest becomes too restricted , and unless the parents are wise enough to understand and meet the change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often friction and rebellion result because the parents still treat the boy as a child , and they lose any possibility of helpfulness to him . Often , too , their attitude drives him from home . Never will the boy stand in greater need of wise counsel than now , though he is unconscious of it . Wiser and older heads should recognize that his confidence in himself and his desire to argue about everything are a part of his normal development . No one who wishes to retain the confidence and friendship of a boy can ignore the strong tastes , the likes and dislikes , that manifest themselves at this time . Ridicule is fatal ; scolding and harshness are almost as bad . However trying these years may be for parents , they are equally trying for the boy . His physical changes are very marked . Often the growth of his arms and legs is so rapid that he appears awkward and ungainly because he has not learned to adjust himself to the sudden change . The voice , too , changes , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he himself hardly understands what it all means . The physical changes which bring to him the powers of manhood often bring mental changes requiring most careful , loving counsel by parents if the transition is to be made safely . It is the time of all times in life when it is the parents ' duty to explain to the boy what each individual should know about himself . High and pure and noble ideals of life should be laid before him , and he should be taught to cherish and not to debase the man that is in the making . Practical explanations of physiology and hygiene should be given , including the use of the different parts of the body , the treatment they should receive , and their functions . In such teaching one should hold up the ways to ensure normal healthful conditions , rather than the consequences of abuse , in the hope that fear will prevent such abuse . It is impossible to overestimate the wrong parents do their boys by failing to give right ideals of life and true teachings concerning themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will influence all his future . It counts eternally whether they are true or false , whether they are given by those who from experience of life and pure living can impart high ideals , or whether they are given by those who have perverted and low views of life . Happy is the boy , and thrice happy are the parents , when they have kept near in spirit to their boy , so that it is to them he looks for the most sacred and holy lessons of life . The normal , healthy boy is not dwelling on any one special function of his rapidly growing body more than another , and parents should endeavor to hold him in this balanced attitude by seeing that he has all he needs to keep mind and body busy . The fact that the boy does not like to go to school should not cause great anxiety . Schools are usually too confining to interest boys at this time . Even if he is fortunate enough to attend a school where there is manual training , there . is usually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no chance for exercise and use . To run , to jump , to climb , to play baseball and football , are the natural instincts of boyhood which can not be crushed or ignored without injury . Farm life , with its varied occupations in the open air , is of incalculable value to boys , and in it they may learn lessons that are as valuable as those given in schools . It is safe to say that were schools to be established on farms , with baseball or football before and after lessons , with arithmetic and geography taught by practical work with real things , with lessons in nature , walks and climbs and talks by the way , it would be easy to keep boys in school . In some way the relation of lessons to real life should be made clear in order to inspire more boys to continue their years of study beyond the elementary grades . It is easy to learn when once the desire to know is created . The education of boys should recognize their natural tastes for things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hands , and that will keep mind and body occupied in most wholesome ways . Scientific papers should now replace the books and magazines designed for children ; they will be read and studied with avidity . What the boy reads will have much to do with shaping his life . Stories of men who have done great things are always inspiring . Travel and adventure always appeal , for the desire to see the world , to know other places , is strong in nearly every boy 's heart .  | That is a natural instinct which leads many boys from home to " see the world , " to " seek their fortunes . " The instinct is so strong in some boys that repeatedly they run away from home , while if their parents only understood they might gratify the desire by arranging long walks or camping parties and even longer travels . When planned by parents , these would be free from the dangers that come to the runaway boy . Do n't blame the boy for this roving spirit ; he inherited it . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as-serts itself very strongly before the growing boy becomes accustomed to the harness of body and spirit which civilization demands . It 1 is not a wicked or unnatural instinct which calls him to see more of nature and the world . The ancient Greeks devoted half of their education-time to physical development , for they reasoned that moral and mental perfection would ? be best developed in a healthy body . Training in athletics and in swimming is especially valuable for boys . To be physically strong becomes an object worth self-denial , and is far more effective than any prohibitions of parents can ever be . While the physical changes from childhood to youth are great , the mental and spiritual nature is going through processes of growth equally rapid and important , and requiring sympathetic understanding by parents and teachers . One of the first things to be learned by par- ents is to have faith in the boy , to belies e that he wants to do what is right , and to expect it of him . At no time in life does me aspire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the dreaming days of youth . The dreams give the vision which may light the path of their future lives , or which may be dimmed and shattered because in the uncouth , awkward boy the dreams and the vision buried deep from the sight of those with whom his life is cast . Do n't forget it , though , the dreams and the vision are in the heart of every boy who has had half a chance , and only need the touch of inspiration to come out into deeds and acts . It is then that a man or woman friend or teacher w h o can see beneath the surface may stir into action the aspirations so deeply hid den . It is then that God be-comes real ,  | when the life of Jesus may be made an ideal which will be the inward guide all through life ; for what is religion but to do justly , to love mercy , to walk humbly with God , and to hold intact the faith that a loving Father is ever ready to help those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That faith and that ideal the heart of youth is ready to accept if they come in sincerity and genuineness , but for cant and pretense the clear-seeing eyes of youth have no use . To inspire a boy with the desire to do right , to place before him the ideal of true life , is to strengthen him for the battles of life as can be done in no other way . Whatever talents one may possess count for little without the sheet-anchor which enables one to meet every question with the test of conscience , ' right , and justice . Many are the boys who leave school before reaching high school or soon after entering it , but that does not necessarily imply that they are dull or stupid . It does signify that the school is not interesting them as much as other things are . Some of the world 's greatest men were counted as failures by their teachers . James Russell Lowell was suspended from college for negligence and inattention . Wagner was a failure in school . So were Byron , Schiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teacher said he was the dullest boy she ever taught . Isaac Newton was frail and delicate physically , and preferred to make toys rather than to study . Parkman was another of the delicate boys who did not fit into the educational scheme of the school . Countless others could be named , who , if judged by the verdict of their teachers , were dull and stupid and failures , but who , in the school of life , touched the spark of a living interest , and became men who gave the world things that were original and worth while . Individuality must be taken into consideration and reckoned with . Because a boy does not fit the prescribed mold is no reason for declaring him stupid . Of the countless men and women on earth no two are alike in face and form , and neither are any two alike in mind and spirit . In race tendencies the periods of childhood and youth go through similar phases and experiences , but there is the difference which makes each human being individual and different from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a boy , and to give him the chance to work it out , is the part of education . With some boys the bent is so strong it overcomes all obstacles , as in Benjamin West , who , born amid the plain life of Friends , seeing neither art nor painting in the primitive days of Colonial life , made his own paint-brushes from a cat 's tail and began portrait-painting as a boy . The play of Benjamin Franklin with kites may have won no recognition by his teachers , but by his play he worked out the secrets of electricity and changed the world . There are great secrets of God and nature yet to be revealed to men , and they , too , will be given through the living  | interest of youths who will not walk in the beaten track , but who strike out for the discovery of something that has come to them , and which they will strive to develop . No greater injury can be done to a youth than to map out life for him and force him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a parent , can decide the future or the vocation that a boy should choose . To develop physical perfection , to give true principles of life , to lay the foundations of mental growth , to keep the spirit of comradeship , and to encourage individual choice as to the life work , is the part parents should take . Information they may give ; full discussion of all the pros and cons of different vocations is valuable ; but in the final moment the boy should be free to choose for himself . The social instinct of boys is very strongly developed in the years of adolescence . The choice of companions at this time is a matter in which parents may have a guiding hand , provided they use it quietly and unos tentatiously , for bad company has caused the downfall of many a good boy . By making the home his social life , by making his friends welcome , by knowing those with whom he associates , a protec tion can be given which means much at this time of life . Interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits are superseded b y w e 11-brushed hair , clean hands and face , a desire to h a v e well pressed clothes . Ties and hosiery assume an importance never before accorded to them . Girls , for whom he has had but little use , now begin to interest him . The greatest injury is done by grown ups who speak flippantly and lightly of these boy-and-girl fancies and who , by their tactless remarks , inject selfconsciousness into what would other wise be natural friendships . Now is the time when mother and father may save much future unhappiness by placing before the boy the ideal of true marriage , with all it involves to make the relation happy for both . It should be held before him as something which gives the greatest happi ness when entered ' into with true affection , an unselfish desire to be real helpmates , and the same standard of morality for both . Before the time for choice comes , when the youth 's thoughts begin naturally to turn in that direction , is the time when frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of marriage in its highest sense .  | The failure of parents to give any instruction in regard to this , and the tendency to speak lightly of it , if at all , should give place to the definite implanting of pure standards of thinking and living and a true conception of all that it means to found a new home . Indeed , it is quite as much the duty of parents to prepare children to meet the duties involved in these vital relations of life as to prepare them for business or a profession . The temptations that are placed in the way of boys are many . To resist them , every boy should be protected by high ideals and standards set before him by his parents . Distaste and disgust will then prevent his yielding to the lures that are set in his way . The day is past when the world recognizes one code of law for boys and another for girls . Hereafter , they will stand or fall together . Happy homes and happy marriages depend as much on the disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore cultivate under the home roof the qualities which are essential to comfortable relations with other people . Thoughtfulness of others , courtesy , and regard for others ' wishes are the oils which make many hard places smooth and lessen opportunity for friction . Unhappiness in marriage often has its beginning in little thoughtless acts and words . The courtesies of life are not arbitrary conventions of society , but have come with reason in the development of civilization based on Christianity . Boys may ridicule them as foolish , but when they go out into the world ( hey will surely be at a disadvantage unless they are drilled in the forms and language of well-bred people by the every-day use of them in their own homes . Mothers render a most important service to their sons in requiring of them the observance of all the habits of refined society . The good son makes the good husband , and the mother trains the son to be a good husband by constant requirement of the manners and deeds which she herself recognizes are necessary in making home life happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early life deserve all credit , but , unless it were better for youth to have the teaching and guidance of parents in shaping character , the Creator would not have so planned the universe . The mother who educates her son to respect and reverence womanhood , to feel that he should treat all women with the courtesy and respect he would desire for his own mother or sisters , has done much to ensure his future happiness and true nobility of character . In the home the foundations for a man 's life work in business or a profession are laid . Habits of industry , faithfulness , and honor underlie success , whatever vocation may be chosen . Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well , which means thoroughness . At the present time greater emphasis seems to be laid on short hours of work than on doing work well . No real success is ever made by trying to see how little one can do , but by making oneself so proficient that one may stand among those who are reliable , trustworthy , and interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work for the day 's pay . It may mean work over-hours at times , but the willingness and ability to do what is necessary at the time it is most needed are vital factors in success . Not how little work , but how much work , and how well it can be done , should be the spirit of one who wishes to climb the ladder of business prosperity . In addition to this , the habits of courtesy and consideration for others , so essential for a happy home , are also important in business . The sunny , cheerful disposition , the courteous , cordial manner , win friends in all walks of life . Personality has much to do with success in life , and personality is the result of the habits and character formed in the home . Parents with experience and a broader vision of life back of them can give invaluable assistance to youth in cultivating the qualities on which so much will depend when entering into active business in the world . Success is not an accident , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree than others . As I have said before , God gave parents the duty of preparing their children for life , and that includes citizenship . At twenty-one years of age the state recognizes that the boy has come to manhood 's estate , and gives him a voice in the policies of the country . The qualities which have been mentioned as valuable in the home and in the business world are also a foundation for the making of a good citizen . There are other lessons for boys to learn before passing from youth into the responsibilities of manhood , and these the home should give . Intelligent citizenship , ani- mated by the principle of regard for the general good , rather than personal advancement , political or financial , is what is needed in the United States . It is possible in the home to give that trend to the ideals of youth which , in manhood , will develop in the life . There are many ways of doing this . Current events bring into the public eye men whose lives spell service to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence the purpose to grasp every opportunity to lift themselves , regardless of the sacrifice of others and of the common good . The object-lessons are before us all the time . The application can be made in the discussion of live issues , bringing out in strong light what is high and fine , in contrast to the lower types of citizens . The history of other nations , their rise and fall , and the reasons for the same , broadens the viewpoint and gives the benefit of others ' experience , enabling one to avoid the pitfalls into which they have fallen . Fathers and mothers who take no interest in public affairs , who are indifferent to the great questions before the nation , can not do what they should in preparing their boys to become the highest type of citizens . It is the indifference of those who care nothing for the political questions which decide so many of the conditions under which we live that is a real menace to the country . Where judgment is so greatly needed in making choices , one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a citizen than to have reached the age of twenty-one years . Universities and even high schools require entrance examinations , but to enter the great school of life and citizenship the test rests on the attainment of a certain age . The United States has moved a step forward in the principles of government , and has become the hope of the downtrodden and oppressed throughout the world . Whether it retains its supremacy will be decided by its citizens . In the years of youth , when the heart is open to high aims and noble purposes , the inspiration should be given to every boy to become an all-around man , animated by the love of God and of his fellow men , desiring to fill well his place in every department of life .  |
