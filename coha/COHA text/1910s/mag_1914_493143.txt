Presidential Complacency T HE real interest of the letter which President Wilson wrote to Secretary McAdoo on Tuesday is psychological rather than political . How can a man of his shrewd and masculine intelligence possibly delude himself into believing the extravagant claims which he makes on behalf of the Democratic legislative achievement ? His letter reads like one of the dithyrambs which used to be delivered by Mark Hanna upon the abounding benefits which the administration of Mr. McKinley had bestowed upon the American people . The Democratic legislation " has done away with agitation and suspicion because it has done away with certain fundamental wrongs . " " New things have been put into action , which are sure to prove the instruments of a new life . " " The future is clear and bright with the promise of the best things . " " Fundamental wrongs once righted , as they may easily and quickly be our italics , all the differences will clear away . " " The future will be very different from the past , which we shall presently look back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad dream " ; and all these wonderful results have been accomplished in part as a result of tariff revision and anti-trust legislation , but chiefly because the Federal Reserve Act has supplied " means of accommodation in the business world , and an instrumentality by which the interests of all , without regard to class , may readily be served . " We must repeat : How can a man of President Wilson 's intelligence see in tinkering with the tariff and anti-trust laws , and in a reorganization of the banking system of the country , the causes of a better social order ? How many sincere progressives follow him in believing that this legislation has made the future clear and bright with the promise of best things ? Where will such leadership finally land the Democratic party and the progressive movement ? President Wilson could not have written his letter unless he had utterly misconceived the meaning and the task of American progressivism . After every allowance has been made for his justifiable pride at the excellent legislative record of the Democrats and for the natural exaggerations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer misunderstanding . Any man of President Wilson 's intellectual equipment who seriously asserts that the fundamental wrongs of a modern society can be easily and quickly righted as a consequence of a few laws passed between the birth and death of a single Congress , casts suspicion either upon his own sincerity or upon his grasp of the realities of modern social and industrial life . Mr. Wilson 's sincerity is above suspicion , but he is a dangerous and unsound thinker upon contemporary political and social problems . He has not only , as he himself has said , " a single-track mind , " but a mind which is fully convinced of the everlasting righteousness of its own performances and which surrounds this conviction with a halo of shimmering rhetoric . He deceives himself with these phrases , but he should not be allowed to deceive progressive popular opinion . If the " New Freedom , " after less than two years of actual operation , has done away with the causes of agitation and suspicion , and promises to the country an era of good feeling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bad dream , then the New Freedom is an essentially mechanical and an essentially conservative doctrine . It is mechanical because it claims to accomplish as the result of a few changes in legal mechanism so much too much . It is conservative because it becomes so fatuously complacent about its own achievements , and it makes the exorcism of a few " bad dreams " an excuse for taking refuge in a sound but stupefying slumber . Education With a Bias U NTIL recent years the attitude of business toward the economic doctrines taught in school and college was prevailingly one of indulgent contempt . The old-time tariff beneficiary could afford to smile at the free-trade teachings of the college which he was helping to support . Experience had taught him that a few years of struggle in the hard conditions of practical life would transform the college free trader into an ardent protectionist . Protectionism , after all , is in the blood of most of us . Whatever economic logic may pretend to establish , we can not get it entirely out of our minds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . We have , however , passed beyond the stage in which the chief political interest of business centers in the tariff . Not much less than one-fifth of all the private capital of the country is now invested in railways and other forms of public service enterprises . These vast interests are , in last analysis , dependent upon the popular will ; they will thrive or languish according to the course of legislative action and judicial interpretation . The protected interests can rely upon a deep-seated popular prejudice in their favor . Not so with the public service enterprises . In every part of the country there exists a smoldering popular distrust of the public service corporation , likely at any time to be fanned into a flame of hostile legislation . Accordingly it is not surprising that practical business men are now looking upon public opinion as a natural force to be conserved and put to financial use ; a force which , if neglected , may work widespread havoc .
