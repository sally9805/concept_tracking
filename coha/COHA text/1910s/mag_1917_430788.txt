 |p762  PERHAPS there never was a time when education received so much general attention as it does to-day . The world is deluged with books , pamphlets , and reviews on the subject , new systems are continually jostling the old out of place , new methods are constantly being applied , the very end and aim of education itself seems to change from time to time . That the object of education should be to fit the child for life , is such a trite and well-worn saying that people smile at its commonplaceness even while they agree with its obvious common sense . But the many ways of fitting the child , and the very various and diverse lives that have to be fitted for , are so perplexing that it is small wonder that curriculums multiply and still multiply their subjects in order to keep up with the complexity of modern existence . More and more of late years has the old education by means of the humanities been broken down , and instead of it we see substituted a sort of vocational training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older systems , they were taught to think . It is as if we had learnt to distrust what we can not see , to demand an immediate tangible result for the outlay of preparation . This is perhaps largely due to our national temper . We are always in a hurry . But does this constant haste produce the results desired ? " Evolution , not revolution , is the order of development , " says Mr. Hughes , in his book on comparative education , and education is a process requiring much time . Nature can not be hurried ; there is no such thing as cramming possible to her methods . A congested curriculum results in the proper assimilation of no one subject ; and what can we think of a primary school , boasting only one teacher , in which the children were taught seventeen subjects , with fifteen minutes given to each sub-  |p763  ject , as was the case some years ago in a school that came under my observation ! No educator is so insensate as to approve of such a method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this idea of dropping the humanities has been evolved . But , in considering the means as the end , to what are we led ? What is the result of an over-insistence upon fact , and an under-emphasis upon the development of faculties ? It is a result little realized for the most part ? one which may fit in with the views of the more extreme socialists , perhaps , but hardly in accord with those rights of the individual which have always been America 's brightest ideal . For it is precisely the humanities which develop individuality . A knowledge of facts does not make us men ; it is the active use of brains which does that . Whatever tends to make the brain supple and self-reliant is a direct help to personality . Perhaps the two qualities which more than any others go to the making of a strong personality are character and imagination . Character means courage , and there is a great difference between the collective courage of a mass of people all thinking the same way , and the courage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows his own chosen path unswervingly . Our national ideal as to the moral attitude is high ; what the people understand , and what they all agree about , that they will do ; but it is not so easy to find men who are willing to think and act at variance with the opinions of their neighbors . We see this trait constantly in those people who live beyond their incomes ; who must have this and that because their friends have it . This weakness gnaws at the foundation of our national existence like an insidious disease . For , with all our talk of individualism , we are among the least individual of nations . The era of machine-made articles has swept over the land , and nowhere is its product more deteriorating than in the machine-made types which our schools turn out . I do not wish to be misunderstood : I do not mean that these types are poor or bad types , on the contrary , machines work with a wonderful precision ; but these types are run in a mould , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity . But there is a danger here which we do not quite foresee . Machines are controlled by the men who make and work them . Upon the few with the brains to create and guide , the destinies of the others therefore depend . There  |p764  has never been such a machine-made people as the Germans ; and we can see clearly to-day , as we could not some years ago , what happens to such a people when the guiding powers are unscrupulous and wrought upon by an overweening ambition . A democracy can succeed only through an enlightened proletariat . If character and imagination are the essentials to a strong personality , one capable of directing itself and not at the mercy of demagogues and fanatics , then we should leave no stones unturned to gain this end . I think I make no unwise statement when I say that it is only in those minds possessing but a modicum of imagination that the value of the humanities as an educational factor is denied . It is clearly not my purpose , in this paper , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into all the ways in which the faculty of imagination might be stimulated , but there is one , and I think the most important one , the value of which is only imperfectly understood . I mean literature , and more especially poetry . We all agree that the aim of education is to fit the child for life . But the differences of opinion as to how that fitting is to be done are almost as many as there are men to hold them . Again , we all agree as to the necessity of building up a strong character , but here again we are at variance as to the method to be employed . Still , upon these points the world is in accord ; the point on which it differs radically is precisely that of imagination . Fully half of our pedagogues can not see that imagination is the root of all civilization . Like love , it may very fairly be said to " make the world go round . " But as it works out of sight , it is given very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a science , which would seem a start in the right direction , were it not that true science must be exact , mathematically so , and capable of being proved backwards . The slightest mistake in facts or reasoning throws the result hopelessly out . Is it possible that , with all our scientific pretensions , we have overlooked a primary link in a logical chain ? Is it possible that that link is the importance of the subconscious ? Can it be said that the very lack of imagination in the pedagogic mind is responsible for this fatal error ? But let us leap to no conclusions . Even if we think we see an end , let us not postulate upon it until we have reached it , step by step , and have proved its existence . Character is no new thing in the world , neither is imagi-  |p765  nation , nor , indeed , education . Our ancestors were as much interested in these things as we are . Like us , they talked of character and education , and , like us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it can easily be proved that their methods were more favorable to its development than our own . Let us forget theories for the moment and take our stand upon an unassailable truism : namely , that the object of education is to educate . Now , once more , forgetting the dusty cobwebs of twentieth century discussion , let us consider the old dictionary definition of " To Educate , " which is " To bring forth and form the natural faculties " : to bring forth and form the natural faculties , to bring out the best that the child has in him so that no talent nor power shall be left latent , and then so to train and cultivate these talents and powers that the child shall obtain perfect control over them , and make them of the fullest use . Nothing is said here about fitting the child for life . Our ancestors considered that so obvious a fact as to need no stating , and this very reticence proves an imaginative attitude which we seem to have lost to-day . It might be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one learnt , but was not taught : that what the mind was ready for , the mind received , that what the mind was not ready for fell away and was forgotten . Therefore the true end of education as such must be to train the mind . Another truism , you will say . Granted ? but how is this same training to be done ? The last generation believed in the old classic education ; they had forgotten why , in many cases , but the prejudice remained that Greek and Latin were the best training . The reason was a perfectly valid one , Greek and Latin were hard to learn and needed brain application , also they could not be learnt by rote ; the boy had to use his mind and his imagination , and being accustomed to using his mind and imagination in his studies he brought them to bear on other things as well . We have not dropped the old classical education entirely , but we have added many other things to it , and in so doing have diminished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently the amount of benefit to be derived from it . Of the things which we have added , some are really good , others appear so , but the total effect does not seem so very far in advance of the old method after all .  |p766  Our children are turned out with a smattering of many subjects , but can we say that they are any better educated than the men and women who preceded them ? Are they better equipped for life , do they find the problems that they have to solve easier of solution ? For there is one great fault in our educational systems to-day , they teach but they do not train ; and the one faculty without which no other can come to fruition is never really trained at all , for we can not deny that imagination is forced to strive against adverse circumstances both at home and in school . Years ago , before the education of children was considered so important a subject as it is now , lessons were given in certain well-defined subjects ; reading , writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staple of the school course , supplemented by geography , Latin , and in the case of little girls , sewing . Dreary enough these lessons must have been , for a-b , ab , many times repeated , fails to germinate any interesting train of thought ; and pot hooks and hangers scrawled in interminable succession with a squeaky slate pencil on a slate leave the imagination cold . But even if the lessons themselves were not in the least alluring , this same imagination was stimulated by the best of all methods , by the good old-fashioned fairy story ; either told by some old nurse , or read out of enchanting books with innumerable quaint woodcuts , so that forever after the names of certain tales were inseparably bound up with the woodcuts in question , and to name the one was to see the other . There was no moral hidden away in these stories , except the somewhat vague one that the good always triumphed in the end ; their aim was to amuse , to charm , and even sometimes to terrify , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and beautiful world of romance . Romance is a grasp of the ideal , an endeavor to express by symbols the great truths of life . Wedded to rhythm it becomes poetry . It is the striving of the soul after the unattainable . And into this rich world the child entered through the portals of the fairy story , as thousands of years before the nations in their childhood had entered ; as the Nibelungen Lied , the Norse sagas , and the myths of every land are here to testify . But to-day the fairy story is discountenanced , or if the child is beguiled into reading a book purporting to be about a certain Jack Frost , a sprightly elf , he speedily discovers  |p767  that he is really reading a treatise on the action of frost . One child 's magazine absolutely forbids fairy stories , and , in all , information , whether given outright or cleverly disguised as in the Jack Frost story , preponderates . This is a work-a-day world and solid information is at a premium . So we have " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daring , " " How a Big City is Lighted , " " The Children 's Room at the Smithsonian , " " English Public Schools , " " The Fairy Land of Science , " and many more articles and books , very informing doubtless , but doubtless also very uninspiring . These deal with the facts of life , and facts are most important things ; but fancies are important too , and the fancies are not much cultivated to-day . It is doubtful if fancy can be cultivated directly ; it is too subtle and elusive , it must grow of itself ; but conditions can be made conducive or the reverse . To be conducted through the realms of poetry and romance by a grown-up person , as one of a class of children all with differing needs and perceptions , at a given rate of speed , is not conducive to such growth . To gain the greatest amount out of a book , one must read it as inclination leads , some parts are to be hurried over quickly , others read slowly and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dwell upon it , and make it its own . Its connotations are really what make a book of use in stimulating the imagination . As a musical note is richer the more overtones it has , so a book is richer the more it ramifies into trains of thought . But there must be time and space for the thought to develop , the reader must not be interrupted by impertinent comments and alien suggestions . We all hate the poetry we learnt at school . Why ? Is it because it was in school that we learnt it , or is it because the conditions were such that we never really learnt it at all , because the fine inner sense of it and its beauty of expression were both hidden from us . Children never know why a thing is beautiful . but if their taste has not been perverted they often feel that it is so . This feeling can be cultivated and improved until the time comes when the child can know why . There are two ways in which books stimulate the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by beauty  |p768  of form . It takes a much wiser head than a child 's to say why certain combinations of words are beautiful , but even a child can feel their charm . A story well told and a story ill told are as the poles asunder . At first one might deny that a child could have artistic perception enough to notice the difference . But that would be merely to confuse with technical jargon . The primary test of good writing is really very simple . It consists in the effect produced . The well told story will make the child thrill with delight , its scenes will be real to him , its people his own dear friends ; the ill told story will not keep his attention , and nothing in it will interest him much . For the object of writing is to produce a given effect . The writing will be good according as the effect is produced or not . Simple actions are easily described ; the old spelling book did not need to be possessed of much literary ability when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , " but it was good writing as far as it went . From that to Shakespeare 's poetry and Pater 's prose is merely a question of degree . The effect is infinitely more subtle , more penetrating , but the words are equally adequate , and convey the meaning in the same succinct manner . At first the child merely knows that this story or that story is interesting , that certain other stories are not interesting , he does not attempt to analyze why . Later he will make his first true criticism , he will say , " It does not seem real , " or " Nobody would do so . " He has detected bad writing , his imagination refuses to give credence to what his instinct declares not to be true . Gradually these criticisms of matter are added to by criticisms of form , and we have , " Nobody would talk like that . " What makes the child think that nobody would do thus and so , or that nobody would talk in such and such a way ? Partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . But he has lived a very small life , his experiences have necessarily been few . But through the life of his imagination he has been able to live much more , he has gained a conception of life far beyond anything that he has ever experienced . If one can imagine oneself a child of twelve years old denuded of any knowledge or idea of anything except what he can have known or seen in his daily life , one will at once see how much more meagre his conceptions would be than is actually the case . Therefore , what makes the child think  |p769  that this or that thing which he is reading about is false , is the knowledge that he has gained through his imagination . The power of judgment is like water running up hill , it can not rise higher than its own level , and judgment can not go beyond the experience which informs it . To be sure that the judgment is sound , the school in which the experience is gained must be true to life . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is with the best in literature and art that our children must be familiar . There is a popular impression that so-called " children 's books " are the proper reading for children , and certainly very few children 's books can be classed as belonging to the best in literature . But also the really great books are few in any literature , and there is much inspiration and profit to be got from books below this highest grade . Homer , Dante , and Shakespeare are like mountain peaks , the horizon is wider on the heights , the air purer and more invigorating ; but literature has its byways , and shady lanes , and quiet sequestered places as well , and because we enjoy mountainclimbing does not prove that there is no profit to be got in rambling through these simpler paths . Many books purporting to be written for children are very good , have become classics indeed ; Alice in Wonderland , Through the Looking Glass , George Macdonald 's Princess and the Goblin , and Thackeray 's The Rose and the Ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books are poor with a poverty only varying in degree . This brings us to the question of whether children 's reading should be confined to juvenile books . The old argument that children do not understand grownup books is really a groundless one . Some books written for older people are more enjoyed in childhood than they ever will be later . Longfellow 's Hiawatha is a good example of this , and in the case of many people it would be true also of the novels of both Scott and Dickens . Even in cases where the full meaning is only faintly grasped , there is often much pleasure to be gained and consequently much profit . This is especially true of poetry . Children are often captivated by poetry which they can not possibly understand , and the charm lies partly in the images j it conjures up and partly in the music of the syllables ; the main purport of the poem remaining concealed . But who shall say that this enjoyment in something so balanced and  |p770  beautiful as a great poem has not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that when he was a very little boy his sister used to read him to sleep with Spenser 's Faerie Queene . It was the first poem he ever heard and he was very fond of it , but it was not until many years later that he discovered that it had a double meaning . How much his early intimacy with Spenser and other authors of the same class had in determining the extreme delicacy of his literary perception it is impossible to tell , but it is certain that it was not without effect . It is always difficult to decide how much , early environment has to do with later development , but all education is based on the belief that it has much to do with it , and one could cite instance after instance to prove this theory . There is a remarkable example in the case of Charlotte Bronte . Her style has great vigor and beauty . It is exquisitely proportioned , quick , sure , and subtle . This seems extraordinary in the daughter of a poor country clergyman , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was passed in a little country town , only varied by a few attempts at teaching as a governess in the country houses of richer families , and by one year and ten months in a pension in Brussels . But when we consider what her reading was as a child it does not seem so strange . In Mrs. Ward 's introduction to Jane Eyre in the Haworth edi. tion of Miss Bronte 's novels , is the following passage : There were no children 's books at Haworth Parsonage . The children were nourished upon the food of their elders : The Bible , Shakespeare , Addison , Johnson , Sheridan , Cowper , for the past ; Scott , Byron , Southey , Wordsworth , Coleridge , Blackwood 's Magazine , Fraser 's Magazine , and Leigh Hunt for the moderns ; on a constant supply of newspapers , Whig and Tory ? Charlotte once said to a friend that she had taken an interest in politics since she was five years old ? on current biographies , such as Lockhart 's Life of Burns , Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wolf 's Remains ; and on miscellaneous readings of old Methodist magazines , Mrs. Rowe 's Letters from the Dead to the Living , the British Essayist , collected from the Rambler , the Mirror and elsewhere , and stories from the Lady 's Maymine . They breathed , therefore , as far as books were concerned , a bracing and stimulating air from the beginning . Nothing was softened or adapted for them . It will be objected that Charlotte Bronte was a genius , that her reading alone would never have enabled her to write as she did . True ; but even genius needs to be trained !  |p771  But what has style to do with imagination , some people will ask . Style has everything to do with imagination . A really good style can not exist without imagination . As we have said that the test of good writing is in the effect produced , and that the object of all writing is to produce a given effect , so that effect must first be clear to the mind of the writer , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of imagination , and through the power of imagination the idea takes form again in the reader 's mind , the vehicle of transmission is the writer 's style . The more fully developed the imagination of both writer and reader , and the more adequate the style , the more perfectly transmitted is the idea . Imagination is behind all the great things that have been said and done in the world . All the great discoveries , all the great reforms , they have all been imagined first . Not a poem has been written , not a sermon preached , not an invention perfected , but has been first conceived . And yet imagination must take a second place to-day and give room for the learning of so-called useful things ! In a list of the books for Boys and Girls in a large public library near Boston , the subjects are divided under headings . " Poetry " takes up only a part of one page out of a catalogue of twenty-nine pages ; " Fairy Tales and Folk-lore " have another page , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Occupations , " and one page to " Outdoor Life . " Of course , some of the books that come under other headings , such as " Famous Old Stories " and " Other Countries " are really good literature , but appallingly few . Leaving out those sections devoted to " Younger Readers " and " For Older Boys and Girls , " that is , taking the middle section which is especially adapted for children of the Grammar School age , I find , out of a total of four hundred and seven books that the only ones which could be considered good literature are Aldrich 's Story of a Bad Boy , Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe , Hughes ' Tom Brown 's School Days , Stevenson 's Treasure Island , Mark Twain 's The Prince and the Pauper , Mary Mapes Dodge 's Hans Brinker , Kipling 's Jungle Book , Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , Don Quixote ; Hawthorne 's Wonder Book , Tanglewood Tales , and Grandfather 's Chair ; The Iliad and The Odyssey ( Meyer , Leaf and Butcher 's translations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sleepy Hollow ; Malory 's Sing Arthur ;  |p772  Shakespeare ( The Ben Greet Edition ) ; Gulliver 's Travels ; and Marryat 's Masterman Ready and Children of the New Forest . The poetry list is unaccountably inadequate , consisting almost entirely of individual poems . The only volumes listed are : Longfellow 's Evangeline and Hiawatha , Macaulay 's Lays of Ancient Rome , Scott 's Lady of the Lake and Marm-ion , Stevenson 's Child 's Garden of Verses , Tennyson 's Idylls of the King , and Whittier 's Snow-bound . The rest of the list is as follows : Matthew Arnold 's Sohrab and Rustum , Browning 's The Pied Piper of Hamelin , Coleridge 's The Ancient Mariner , Eugene Field 's Lullaby Land , Holmes 's Grandmother 's Story of Bunker Hill Battle , Jean Ingelow 's High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire , Longfellow 's Courtship of Miles Standish , and Lowell 's The Vision of Sir Launfal . Here , it will be observed , are a number of poems of an inferior order ? classics indubitably , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Mariner , for Shakespeare is , amusingly enough , listed , not under " Poetry , " but under " Famous Old Stories , " as though the plays were more important as plots than as poems . There are also collections of poetry , ten of them , of which the best are Henley 's Lyra Heroica , Lang 's Blue Poetry Book , and Lucas 's Book of Verses for Children . The fairy tale section is even worse , and how dreary the inclusion of the word " Folk-lore " in a catalogue intended for the use of children ! Certainly , the erudite person who made this selection never reads fairy stories for amusement . The pseudo-scientific flavor of " folk-lore " has intrigued him sadly , else why include Kingsley 's Greek Heroes under " Fairy tales , " why entirely exclude Thackeray 's The Rose and the Ring and George Macdonald 's Princess and the Goblin and Princess and Curdy , these last both better books than At the Back of the North Wind , by the same author , which has been allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Alice in Wonderland is here , and here without the asterisk which tells the child that the library contains other books by the same author . Think of growing up conversant with only half of Alice ! Where are the delightful fairy tales of Mrs. Molesworth , where are those of Perrault , of Lord Brabourne , and why are Andrew Lang 's long series of colored fairy books represented by only one , @#  |p773  and again with no asterisk ? Poor little children , at the mercy of such elders as this compiling gentleman ! The list for older boys and girls is somewhat better , and here we find Through the Looking Glass , though why it should be considered too advanced for younger readers I can not imagine . But the fact that this older section starts out with Miss Addams 's Twenty Years at Hull House is eloquent of the attitude of the present day . Alas for imagination , when the inclusion of such a volume in such a list is possible ! It is true , a child can have any book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children who frequent the library belong to the poorer classes , and their only chance of becoming familiar with books out of school is at the Public Library . At home , they are not surrounded with a large culture which makes the names of the great writers household words to them . How do they know what to ask for ? A catalogue tells them nothing , and the only shelves they have access to until they are eighteen are those containing the books in the list I have been quoting . And this is in a town famous for its educational system ! Probably the catalogues intended for the use of children in our large libraries would show conditions to be less unfortunate , but I think the one I have quoted is at least typical . There is no education like self-education , and no stimulus to the imagination so good as that which it gives itself when allowed to roam through the pent-up stores of the world 's imaginings at will . There is a class of people known to all librarians as " browsers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , now there ; sometimes dipping into ten books in the hour , sometimes absorbed in one for the whole day . If we look back to our childhood we shall see how large a part " browsing " had in our education . One book suggested another , and as we finished one we knew the next that was waiting to be begun . They stretched on and on in a delightful and never ending vista . The joy of those hours when we sat cross-legged on the floor , or perched on the top of a ladder , a new world hidden behind the covers of every book within reach , and perfect liberty to open the covers and enter at will , can never be forgotten . We talk about " creating a demand for books " among the children of the masses , and about " giving them the read/ ing habit . " The best way to do this is to have a well-stocked reading room of good books , books for grown-up people as well as for children , and let the children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading strange things often ? strange from the point of view of the grown-up person , that is . But in most cases their instincts will be good guides , and they will read what is best for them . There is too much teaching to-day . We love and admire certain things rather in spite of what people say than because of it . We like to compare notes with some one who enjoys the same things that we do , but the real enjoyment was there before . Beauty can not be proved as a mathematical problem can . If beauty is its own excuse for being , it is also its own teacher for perceiving . Contact with beautiful things creates a taste for the beautiful , if there is any taste to be created . Not every one has a great deal of imagination , but every one has a certain amount capable of cultivation , and the chief stimulators of imagination are the arts ? poetry , music , painting ; the humanities as opposed to the materialities . The boy who said that his Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the boys were pressed for time , they only read the notes , was giving the most eloquent testimony as to the absolute unfitness of his teacher . Doubtless the teacher would have been horrified had he known of this state of things , but his own imagination must have been very much in need of cultivating for him not to have noticed it . For the last two years of my school course , we were given lectures on Shakespeare by an eminent Harvard professor . I remember those lectures very well , they made an indelible impression . We learnt everything about the plays we studied except the things that mattered . Not a historical allusion , not an antiquarian tit-bit , escaped us . The plays were made mines of valueless information . Out of them we delved all sorts of stray and curious facts which were as unimportant to Shakespeare as to us . Not once in those two years were we bidden to notice the poetry , not once was there a single aesthetic analysis . The plays might have been written in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They became merely " quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore , " and if what we learnt at those lectures were a criterion , might indeed have been promptly  |p775  and satisfactorily dismissed . So much time and energy had been wasted in finding out these things , and when found out their proper goal was the bonfire . In my own case , however , I was saved ? saved from the clutches of ignorant and unimaginative Academia ? by coming across a volume in my father 's library which opened a door that might otherwise have always remained shut . Browsing about one day , I found Leigh Hunt 's I magination and Fancy . I did not read it , I devoured it . I read it over and over , and then I turned to the works of the poets referred to , and tried to read them by the light of the new aesthetic perception I had learnt from Hunt . So engulfed in this new pursuit was I , that I used to inveigle my school-mates up to my room and read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Beaumont and Fletcher . Guided by Hunt , I found a new Shakespeare , one of whom I had never dreamt , and so the plays were saved for me , and nothing was left of the professor 's lectures except an immense bitterness for the lost time . I have often thought that in this book of Leigh Hunt 's we have an excellent text-book for what should be the proper teaching of literature , and especially of poetry . Poetry is an art , and to emphasize anything else in teaching it is to deny its true function . The study of what is now called the " science of aesthetics " is a difficult one . Such a book as Mr. Willard Huntington Wright 's The Creative Will is immensely stimulating to the artist , but would be only confusing to school-children , even to those of High School grade . But much of this volume , much of the many volumes on the subject , could be expressed in simple terms . Beginning by stimulating the child 's aesthetic perceptions in the very primitive manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I gave earlier in this article , the teacher can easily inculcate certain rules and touchstones , enlarging upon them from year to year , and in this manner lay a firm foundation for literary understanding ; for it is only through understanding that literature , and particularly poetry , can function as a direct stimulus to imagination . I realize perfectly that this method would put a great strain on our teachers . It is comparatively easy to learn a series of antiquarian allusions and reel them off to a class ; to analyze an aesthetic scheme is a much more difficult mat/ ter . I was interested to come across this very idea in an essay of Professor Dowden 's which I read lately . But , having pointed out the difficulty , the wise professor ignored it , and proceeded to write his paper without the inclusion of a single aesthetic preoccupation . To be sure , he apologized for this in the preface , but the essay was published . We see , therefore , that to permit poetry to exert its imaginative training upon youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which it is taught . We must lay aside the academic tricks of the trade . Our teachers and expounders must first put themselves to school ; they must desert the easy path of historical anecdote for the difficult one of aesthetic comprehension . They must teach their pupils what poetry is , and why it is good , greater , greatest . They must be enthusiastic pioneers for themselves and for their classes . They must forget the mass of criticism ( most of it mischievous ) grown up about the classics , and rediscover them with delight . An excellent way to begin would be to conduct a course upon living poets . The most significant thing in America to-day is the popular demand for poetry . It has grown by leaps and bounds . I read recently in a newspaper that the demand for poetry at the training-camps was extraordinary . In the Book News Monthly for July is an interesting chart showing the increase in the publication of books on poetry and the drama since 1902 . In that year , 220 such books were published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 663 . More volumes of this kind were issued than of any other kind except fiction , and fiction exceeded only by seventy-three volumes . The publication of fiction has markedly diminished of late years . Why ? Simply because poetry is really much more vital than fiction . Once poetry had thrown off its shackles , once it had begun to speak freely , sturdily , with the voice of its own age , it found a ready audience . Even Academia is listening , puzzled a little perhaps , but still becoming daily more attentive . I have had various teachers tell me sadly that the difficulty in speaking of it to a class is that they do not know the good modern poetry from the bad , it is all so " different . " What is the matter ? What has happened to the critical faculty within the walls of learning ? I am sorry to have to say it , but the answer is " pure laziness . " It is so much easier to run through a couple of volumes of somebody else 's conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own by first-hand contact with works of art . And then , too , it opens one to an awful danger . One may be wrong ! Still , the world is growing , and humanists , no more than scientists , can afford to live in an intellectual backwater . The humanities are not yet a dead letter ; one can not push out of place something which is daily proving itself an emotional force of profound importance . Granted that , as taught , they might as well go , so might science if it taught that the world was fiat . Taught as they should be , imagination might once again assert its saving power over a materialistic world .
