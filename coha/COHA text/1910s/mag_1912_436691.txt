WHAT happened next was Dover Street . Outwardly , Dover Street is a noisy thoroughfare cut through a South End slum , in every essential the same as Wheeler Street . Turn down any street in the slums , at random , and name it what you will , you will still observe there the same fashions of life , death , and endurance . Every one of those streets is a rubbish-heap of damaged humanity , and it will take a wise surgeon to mend it . Dover Street is intersected near its eastern end , where we lived , by Harrison Avenue . That street is to the South End what Salem Street is to the North End . It is the heart of the South End Ghetto , for the greater part of its length ; although its northern end belongs to the realm of Chinatown . Its multifarious business bursts through the narrow shop-doors , and overruns the basements , the sidewalk , the street itself , in pushcarts and open-air stands . Its multitudinous population bursts through the greasy tenement doors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side streets , pushing in and out among the pushcarts , all day long , and half the night besides . Rarely as Harrison Avenue is caught asleep , still more rarely is it found clean . Nothing less than a fire or flood would cleanse this street . Even Passover can not quite accomplish this feat . For although the tenements may be scrubbed to their remotest corners on this one occasion , the cleansing stops at the curbstone . A great deal of the filthy rubbish accumulated in a year is pitched into the street , often through the windows ; and what the ash-man on his daily round does not remove , is left to be trampled to powder , in which form it steals back into the houses from which it was so lately dislodged . We had no particular reason for coming to Dover Street . It might just as well have been Applepie Alley or Letterbox Lane . For my father had sold , with the goods , fixtures , and good-will of the Wheeler Street store , all his hopes of ever making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he got a silver dollar the more for them . Still we had to live somewhere , even if we were not making a living , so we came to Dover Street , where tenements were cheap . By this I mean that the rent was low . The ultimate cost of life in those tenements , in terms of human happiness , is high enough . Our new home consisted of five small rooms up two flights of stairs , with the right of way through the dark corridors . In the parlor ' the dingy paper hung in rags , and the plaster fell in chunks . One of the bedrooms was absolutely dark and air-tight . The kitchen windows looked out on a dirty court , at the back of which was the rear tenement of the estate . To us belonged , along with the five rooms and the right of way aforesaid , a block of upper air the length of a pulley line across this court , and the width of an arc described by a windy Monday 's wash in its remotest wanderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one partner ? my sister Dora . A mouse could not have led a cat much of a chase across this room ; still we found space for a narrow bed , a crazy bureau , and a small table . From the window there was an unobstructed view of a lumber-yard , beyond which frowned the blackened walls of a factory . The fence of the lumber-yard was gay with theatre-posters and illustrated advertisements of tobacco , whiskey , and patent baby-foods . When the window was open there was a constant clang and whirr of electric cars , varied by the screech of machinery , the clatter of empty wagons , and the rumble of heavy trucks . There was nothing worse in all this than we had had before , since our exile from Crescent Beach ; but I did not take the same delight in the propinquity of electric cars and arc lights that I had at first . I suppose the tenement began to pall on me . It must not be supposed that I enjoyed any degree of privacy because I had half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five rooms ; we were bound to be always in each other 's way . And as it was within out ' flat , so it was in the house as a whole . All doors , beginning with the street door , stood open most of the time ; or if they were closed , the tenants did not wear out their knuckles knocking for admittance . I could stand at any time in the unswept entrance hall and tell , from an analysis of the medley of sounds and smells that issued from doors ajar , what was going on in the several flats , from below up . That guttural , scolding voice , unremittent as the hissing of a steampipe , is Mrs. Rasnosky . I make a guess that she is chastising the infant Isaac for taking a VOL. 169-NO. 3 second lump of sugar in his tea . Spam , band yes , and she is rubbing in her objections with the flat of her hand . That blubbering and moaning , accompanying an elephantine tread , is fat Mrs. Casey , second floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vengeance of Mr. Casey ; to propitiate whom she is burning a pan of bacon , as the choking fumes and outrageous sizzling testify . I hear a feeble whining , interrupted by long silences . It is that scabby baby on the third floor , fallen out of bed again , with nobody at home to pick him up . To escape from these various horrors I ascend to the roof , where bacon and babies and child-beating are not . But there I find two figures in calico wrappers , with bare red arms akimbo , a basket of wet clothes in front of each , and only one empty clothes-line between them . I do not want to be dragged in as a witness in a case of assault and battery , so I go down to the street again , grateful to note , as I pass , that the third-floor baby is still . In front of the door I squeeze through a group of children . They are going to play tag , and are counting to see who should be ' it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid picture of the life , manners , and customs of Dover Street , no description of mine can ever do so . Frieda was married before we came to Dover Street , and went to live in East Boston . This left me the eldest of the children at home . Whether on this account , or because I was outgrowing my childish carelessness , or because I began to believe , on the cumulative evidence of the Crescent Beach . Chelsea , and Wheeler Street adventures , that America , after all , was not going to provide for my father 's family ? whether for any or all of these reasons , I began at this time to take bread-and-butter matters more to heart , and to ponder ways and means of getting rich . My father sought employment wherever work was going on . His health was poor ; he aged very fast : Nevertheless he offered himself for every kind of labor ; he offered himself for a boy 's wages . Here he was found too weak , here too old ; here his imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a few short terms of work at this or that ; I do not know the name of the form of drudgery that my father did not practice . But , all told , he did not earn enough to pay the rent in full and buy a bone for the soup . The only steady source of income , for I do not know how many years , was my brother 's earnings from his newspapers . Surely this was the time for me to take my sister 's place in the workshop . I had had every fair chance until now : school , my time to myself , liberty to run and play and make friends . I had graduated from grammar school ; I was of legal age to go to work . What was I doing ? sitting at home and dreaming ? I was minding my business , of course ; with all my might I was minding my business . As I understood it , my business was to go to school , to learn everything there was to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family rich . Surely it was not shirking to lay out such a programme as that for myself . I had boundless faith in my future . I was certainly going to be a great poet ; I was certainly going to take care of the family . My self-confidence was fed by the undiminished enthusiasm of the family in my cause . Since Graduation Day and its triumphs , my father 's ambition for me had soared to such a height that he determined to keep me in school till I was prepared for college , when , he was sure , I could take care of myself ; and there was no one to dispute the wisdom or justice of this course . When it was time for me to choose a school , I made a memorable excursion into the suburbs , to interview Mr. Tuttle , at that time the principal of both the Girls ' Latin and High Schools . In a matter so important as the choice of a school , I could not consider the advice of a lesser man . A new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . Until then I had gone to school with my equals , and as a matter of course . Now it was distinctly a feat for me to keep in school , and my schoolmates were socially so far superior to me that my poverty became conspicuous . By these tokens I should have had serious business on my hands as a pupil in the Latin School , but I did not find it hard . To make myself at home in an alien world was within my talents ; I had been practising it day and night for the past four years . To remain unconscious of my'shabby and ill-fitting clothes when the rustle of silk petticoats in the schoolroom protested against them was a matter still within my moral reach . Half a dress a year had been my allowance for many seasons ; even less , for as I did not grow much I could wear my dresses almost indefinitely . And I had stood before editors , and exchanged polite calls with my teachers , untroubled by the detestable colors and archaic design of my .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without trembling from hunger was something more of a feat , because I sometimes went to school with little or no breakfast ; but even that required no special heroism ; at most it was a matter of self-control . I had the advantage of a poor appetite , too ; I really did not need much breakfast . Or if I was hungry it would hardly show ; I coughed so much that my unsteadiness was self-explained . Everything helped , you see . My schoolmates helped . Aristocrats though they were , they did not hold themselves aloof from me . Some of the girls who came to school in carriages were especially cordial . They rated me by my scholarship , and not by my father 's occupation . They teased and admired me by turns for learning the foot-notes in the Latin grammar by heart ; they never reproached me for my ignorance of the latest comic opera . And it was more than good breeding that made them seem unaware of the incongruity of my presence : it was a generous appreciation of what it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin School , on the way to college . If our intimacy ended on the steps of the school-house , it was more my fault than theirs . Most of the girls were democratic enough to have invited me to their homes , although to some , of course , I was ' impossible . ' But I had no time for visiting : schoolwork and reading and family affairs occupied all the day-time , and much of the nighttime . I rarely was in a mood to care whether my neighbors spurned or embraced me . My own life sufficed me . Everything of consequence was well with me . Poverty was a superficial , temporary matter ; it vanished at the touch of money . Money in America , was plentiful ; it was only a matter of getting some of it , and I was on my way to the mint . If Dover Street was not a pleasant place to abide in , it was only a wayside house . And I was really happy , actively happy , in the exercise of my mind in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that satisfy a studious girl in the middle teens . From sunrise to sunset the day was long enough for many things besides school , which occupied five hours . There was time for me to try to earn my living ; or at least the rent of our tenement . Rent was a standing trouble . We were always-behind , and the landlady was always very angry ; so I was particularly ambitious to earn the rent . I had had one or two poems published since the celebrated eulogy of George Washington , but nobody had paid for my poems ? yet . I was coming to that , of course , but in the meantime I could not pay the rent with my writing . To be sure , my acquaintance with men of letters gave me an opening . A friend of mine introduced me to a slightly literary lady , who introduced me to the editor of the Boston Searchlight , who offered me a generous commission for subscriptions to his paper . If our rent was three and one half dollars per week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Searchlight was one dollar , and my commission was fifty per cent , how many subscribers did I need ? How easy ! Seven subscribers a week ? one a day ! Anybody could do that . Mr. James , the editor , said so . He said I could get two or three any afternoon , between the end of school and supper . If I worked all Saturday ? my head went dizzy computing the amount of my commissions . It would be rent , and shoes , and bonnets , ? everything for everybody . Bright and early one Saturday morning in the fall I started out canvassing : in my hand a neatly folded copy of the Searchlight ; in my heart faith in my lucky star and good-will toward all the world . S 'M A KINGDOM IN THE SLUMS I began with one of the great office buildings on Tremont Street , as Mr. James had advised . The first half hour I lost , wandering through the corridors , reading the names on the doors . There were so many people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered , which was Wilson &; Reed , Solicitors , and which C. Jenkins Smith , Mortgages and Bonds ? I decided that it did not matter : I would call them all Sir . ' I selected a door and knocked . After waiting some time , I knocked a little louder . The building buzzed with noise ? swift footsteps echoed on the stone floors , snappy talk broke out with the opening of every door , bells tinkled , elevators hummed ? no wonder they did not hear me knock . But I noticed that other people went in without knocking , so after a while I did the same . There were several men and two women in the small , brightly-lighted room . They were all busy . It was very confusing . Should I say Sir ' to the roomful ? Excuse me , sir , ' I began . That was a very good beginning , I felt sure , but I must speak louder . Lately my voice had been poor in school ? gave out , sometimes , in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not need to repeat myself . The back of the bald head that I had addressed revolved and presented its complement , a bald front . Will you ? would you like ? I 'd like I stared in dismay at the bald gentleman , unable to recall a word of what I meant to say ; and he stared in impatience at me . Well , well ! ' he snapped . What is it ? What is it ? ' That reminded me . It 's the Boston Searchlight , sir . I take sub ? ' Take it away ? take it away . We 're busy here . ' He waved me away over his shoulder , the back of his head once more presented to me . I stole out of the room in great confusion . Was that the way I was going to be received ? Why , Mr. James had said nobody would hesitate to subscribe . It was the best paper in Boston , the Searchlight , and no business man could afford to be without it . I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business ? I 'd never heard of it , and very likely I had spoken to C. Jenkins Smith . I must try again ? of course I must try again . I selected a real estate-office next . A real-estate broker , I knew for certain , was a business man . Mr. George A. Hooker must be just waiting for the Boston Searchlight . Mr. Hooker was indeed waiting , and he was telling ' Central ' about it . Yes , Central ; waiting , waiting ? What ? ? Yes , yes ; ring four ? What ' s that ? ? Since when ? ? Why did n't you say so at first , then , instead of keeping me on the line ? What ? ? Oh , is that so ? Well , never mind this time , Central . ? I see , I see . ? All right . ' I had become so absorbed in this monologue , that when Mr. Hooker swung around on me in his revolving chair I was startled , feeling that I had been caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he only said , ' What can I do for you , miss ? ' Encouraged by his forbearance , I said , ? Would you like to subscribe to the Boston Searchlight , sir ? ' ? Sir ' was safer , after all . ? ' It 's a dollar a year . ' I was supposed to say that it was the best paper in Boston , and so forth but Mr. Hooker did not look interested , though he was not cross . ' No , thank you , miss ; no new papers for me . Excuse me , I am very busy . ' And he began to dictate to a stenographer . Well , that was not so bad . Mr. Hooker was at least polite . I must try to make a better speech next time . I stuck to real estate now . O'Lair &; Kennedy were both in , in my next office , and both apparently enjoying a minute of relaxation , tilted back in their chairs behind a low railing . Said I , determined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , Would you like to subscribe to the Boston Searchlight ? It 's a very good paper . No business man can afford it ? afford to be without it , I mean . It 's only a dollar a year . ' Both men smiled at my break , and I smiled too . I wondered would they subscribe separately , or would they take one copy for the firm . The Boston Searchlight , ' repeated one of the partners . ' Never heard of it . Is that the paper you have there ? ' He unfolded the paper I gave him , looked it over , and handed it to his partner . ' Ever heard of the Searchlight , O'Lair ? What do you think ? can we afford to be without it ? ' I guess we 'll make out somehow , ' replied Mr. O'Lair , handing me back my paper . ' But I 'll buy this copy of you , miss , ' he added , from second thoughts . And I 'll go partner on the bargain , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample , ' I said . I do n't sell single papers . I take subscriptions for the year . It 's one dollar . ' ' And no business man can afford it , you know . ' Mr. Kennedy winked as he said it , and we all smiled again . It would have been stupid not to see the joke . ' I 'm sorry I ca n't sell you my sample , ' I said , with my hand on the doorknob . That 's all right , my dear , ' said Mr. Kennedy , with a gracious wave of the hand . And his partner called after me , Better luck next door ! ' Well , I was getting on ! The people grew friendlier all the time . But I skipped ' next door . ' It was ' Mortgages and Bonds . ' I tried ' Insurance . ' The best paper in Boston , is it ? ' remarked Mr. Thos . ' F. Dix , turning over my sample . ' And who told you that , young lady ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is Mr. James ? ? The editor ! Oh , I see . And do you also think the Searchlight the best paper in Boston ? ' I do n't know , sir . I like the Herald much better , and the Transcript . ' At that Mr. Dix laughed . ' That 's right , ' he said . ' Business is business , but you tell the truth . One dollar , is it ? Here you are . My name is on the door . Good-day . ' I think that I spent twenty minutes copying the name and room number from the door . I did not trust myself to read plain English . What if I made a mistake , and the Searchlight went astray , and good Mr. Dix remained unilluminated ? He had paid for the year ; it would be dreadful to make a mistake . Emboldened by my one success , I went into the next office without considering the kind of business announced on the door . I tried brokers , lawyers , contractors ; and all , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more addresses . Most of the people were polite . Some men waved me away , like C. Jenkins Smith . Some looked impatient at first , but excused themselves politely in the end . Almost everybody said , ' We 're busy here , ' as if they suspected I wanted them to read a whole year 's issue of the Search- light at once . At last one man told me he did not think it was a nice business for a girl , going through the offices like that . This took me aback . I had not thought anything about the nature of the business . I only wanted the money to pay the rent . I wandered through miles of stone corridors , unable to see why it was not a nice business , and yet reluctant to go on with it , with the doubt in my mind . Intent on my new problem , I walked into a messenger boy ; and looking back to apologize to him , I collided softly with a cushion-shaped gentleman getting out of an elevator . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I saw an office door standing open . It was the first open door I had come across since morning , ? it was past noon now , ? and it was a sign to me to keep on . I must not give up so easily . Mr. Frederick A. Strong was alone in the office , surreptitiously picking his teeth . He heard me out good-naturedly . How much is your commission , if I may ask ? ' It was the first thing he had said . Fifty cents , sir . ' ' Well , I 'll tell you what I will do . I do n't care to subscribe , but here 's a quarter for you . ' If I did not blush , it was because it is not my habit , but all of a sudden I choked . A lump jumped into my throat ; almost the tears were in my eyes . That man was right who said it was not nice to go through the offices : I was taken for a beggar : a stranger offered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I started to go out . But Mr. Strong jumped up and prevented me . ' Oh , do n't go like that ! ' he cried . I did n't mean to offend you ; upon my word , I did n't . I beg your pardon . I did n't know ? you see ? Wo n't you sit down a minute to rest ? That 's kind of you . ' Mr. Strong was so genuinely repentant that I could not refuse him . Besides , I felt a little weak . I had been on my feet since morning , and had had no lunch . I sat down , and Mr. Strong talked . He showed me a picture of his wife and little girl , and said I must go and see them some time . Pretty soon I was chatting too , and I told Mr. Strong about the Latin School ; and of course he asked me if I was French , the way people always did when they wanted to say that I had a foreign accent . So we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we both jumped up , surprised , when a fine young lady in a beautiful hat came in to take possession of the idle typewriter . Mr. Strong introduced me very formally , thanked me for an interesting hour , and shook hands with me at the door . I did not add his name to my short subscription list , but I counted it a greater triumph that I had made a friend . It would have been seeking an anticlimax to solicit any more in the building . I went out , into the roar of Tremont Street , and across the Common , still green and leafy . I rested a while on a bench , debating where to go next . It was past two by the clock on Park Street Church . I had had a long day already , but it was too early to quit work , with only one half dollar of my own in my pocket . It was Saturday ? in the evening the landlady would come . I must try a little longer . I went out along Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bicycle stores all along the way looked promising to me . The people did not look so busy as they did in the office building ; they would at least be polite . They were not particularly rude , but they did not subscribe . Nobody wanted the Searchlight . They had never heard of it ? they made jokes about it ? they did not want it at any price . I began to lose faith in the paper myself . I got tired of the name Searchlight . I began to feel dizzy . I stopped going into the stores . I walked straight along , looking at nothing . I wanted to go back , go home , but I would n't . I felt like doing myself spite . I walked right along , straight as the avenue ran . I did not know where it would lead me . I did not care . Everything was horrid . I would go right on until night . I would get lost . I would fall in a faint on a strange doorstep , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't that be interesting ! The adventure might even end happily . I might faint at the door of a rich old man 's house , who would take me in , and order his housekeeper to nurse me , just like in the story-books . In my delirium ? of course I would have a fever ? I would talk about the landlady , and how I had tried to earn the rent ; and the old gentleman would wipe his spectacles for pity . Then I would wake up , and ask plaintively , ' Where am I ? ' And when I got strong , after a delightfully long convalescence , the old gentleman would take me to Dover Street ? in a carriage ! ? and we would all be reunited , and laugh and cry together . The old gentleman , of course , would engage my father as his steward , on the spot , and we would all go to live in one of his houses , with a garden around it . I walked on , and on , gleefully aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to feel shaky ? Yes ; I should certainly faint before long . But I did n't like the houses I passed . They did not look fit for my adventure . I must keep up till I reached a better neighborhood . Anybody who knows Boston knows how cheaply my adventure ended . Columbus Avenue leads out to Roxbury Crossing . When I saw that the houses were getting shabbier , instead of finer , my heart sank . When I came out on the noisy , thrice-commonplace street-car centre , my spirit collapsed utterly . I did not swoon . I woke up from my foolish , childish dream with a shock . I was disgusted with myself , and frightened besides . It was evening now , and I was faint and sick in good earnest , and I did not know where I was . I asked a starter at the transfer station the way to Dover Street , and he told me to hop on a car that was just coming in . I 'll walk , ' I said , ' if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spend five cents out of the little I had made ? But the starter discouraged me . You ca n't walk it before midnight ? the way you look , my girl . Better get on that car before it goes . ' I could not resist the temptation . I rode home in the car , and felt like a thief when I paid the fare . Five cents gone to pay for my folly ! I was grateful for a cold supper ; thrice grateful to hear that Mrs. Hutch , the landlady , had been and gone , content with two dollars that my father had brought home . Mrs. Hutch seldom succeeded in collecting the full amount of their rents from her tenants . I suppose that made the book-keeping complicated , which must have been wearing on her nerves ; and hence her temper . We lived , on Dover Street , in fear of her temper . Saturday had a distinct quality about it , derived from the imminence of Mrs. Hutch 's visit . Of course I awoke on Saturday morning with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its feet and glowered down on me , while the rest of my consciousness was still yawning on its back , was the **29;551;TOOLONG ' s-no-rent feeling . The landlady , of course , was only one symptom of the disease of poverty , but there were times when she seemed to me the sharpest tooth of the gnawing canker . Surely as sorrow trails behind sin , Saturday evening brought Mrs. Hutch . The landlady did not trail . Her movements were anything but impassive . She climbed the stairs with determination , and landed at the top with emphasis . Her knock on the door was clear , sharp , unfaltering ; it was impossible to pretend not to hear it . Her good-evening ' announced business ; her manner of taking a chair suggested the throwing down of the gauntlet . Invariably she asked for my father , calling him Mr. Anton , and refusing to be corrected ; almost invariably he was not at home ? was out looking for work . Had he left her the rent ? My mother 's gentle ' no , ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to repeat what Mrs. Hutch said . It would be hard on her , and hard on me . She grew red in the face ; her voice grew shriller with every word . My poor mother hung her head where she stood ; the children stared from their corners ; the frightened baby cried . The angry landlady rehearsed our sins like a prophet foretelling doom . We owed so many weeks ' rent ; we were too lazy to work ; we never intended to pay ; we lived on others ; we deserved to be put out without warning . She reproached my mother for having too many children ; she blamed us all for coming to America . She enumerated her losses through non-payment of her rents ; told us that she did not collect the amount of her taxes ; showed us how our irregularities were driving a poor widow to ruin . My mother did not attempt to excuse herself , but when Mrs. Hutch began to rail against my father , she tried to put in a word in his defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silenced my mother impatiently . Sometimes she addressed herself to me . I always stood by , if I was at home , to give my mother the moral support of my dumb sympathy . I understood that Mrs. Hutch had a special grudge against me ; because I did not go to work as a cash-girl and earn three dollars a week . I wanted to explain to her how I was preparing myself for a great career , and I was ready to promise her the payment of the arrears as soon as I began to get rich . But the landlady would not let me put in a word . And I was sorry for her , because she seemed to be having such a bad time . At last Mrs. Hutch got up to leave , marching out as determinedly as she had marched in . At the door she turned , in undiminished wrath , to shoot her parting dart ? ' And if Mr. Anton does not bring me the rent on Monday , I will serve a notice to quit on Tuesday , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother wiped away a few tears , and went to the baby , crying in the windowless , air-tight room . I was the first to speak . ' Is n't she queer , mamma ? ' I said . She never remembers how to say our name . She insists on saying Anton Anton . Celia , say Anton . ' And I made the baby laugh by imitating the landlady , who had made her cry . But when I went to my little room I did not mock Mrs. Hutch . I thought about her , thought long and hard , and to a purpose . I decided that she must hear me out once . She must under- stand about my plans , my future , my good intentions . It was too irrational to go on like this , we living in fear of her , she in distrust of us . If Mrs. Hutch would only trust me , and the tax-collectors would trust her , we could all live happily forever . I was the more certain that my argument would prevail with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I understood her point of view . I even sympathized with her . What she said about the babies , for instance , was not all unreasonable to me . There was this last baby , my mother 's sixth , born on Mrs. Hutch 's premises ? yes , in the windowless , air-tight bedroom . Was there any need of this baby ? When May was born , two years earlier , on Wheeler Street , I had accepted her ; after a while I even welcomed her . She was born an American , and it was something to me to have one genuine American relative . I had to sit up with her the whole of her first night on earth , and I questioned her about the place she came from , and so we got acquainted . As my mother was so ill that my sister Frieda , who was nurse , and the doctor from the dispensary had all they could do to take care of her , the baby remained in my charge a good deal , and so I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years older , and my outlook was broader ; I could see around a baby 's charms , and discern the disadvantages of possessing the baby . I was supplied with all kinds of relatives now ? I had a brother-in-law and an American-born nephew , who might become a president . Moreover , I knew that there was not enough to eat before the baby 's advent , and she did not bring any supplies with her that I could see . The baby was one too many . I resented her existence . I recorded my resentment in my journal . I was pleased with my broad-mind- edness , that enabled me to see all sides of the baby question . I could regard even the rent question disinterestedly , like a philosopher reviewing natural phenomena . It seemed not unreasonable that Mrs. Hutch should have a craving for the rent as such . A schoolgirl dotes on her books , a baby cries for its rattle , and a landlady yearns for her rents . I could easily believe that it was doing Mrs. Hutch spiritual violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehemence with which she pursued the arrears . Yes , I could analyze the landlady very nicely . I was certainly qualified to act as peacemaker between her and my family . But I must go to her own house , and not on a rent day . Saturday evening , when she was embittered by many disappointments , was no time to approach her with diplomatic negotiations . I must go to her house on a days of good omen . And I went , as soon as my father could give me a week 's rent to take along . I found Mrs. Hutch in the gloom of a long , faded parlor . Divested of the ample black coat and widow 's bonnet in which I had always seen her , her presence would have been less formidable , had I not been conscious that I was a mere rumpled sparrow fallen into the lion 's den . When I had delivered the money , I should have begun my speech ; but I did not know what came first of all there was to say . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my books , and asked about them . I thought this was my opening , and I showed her eagerly my Latin grammar , my geometry , my Virgil . I began to tell her how I was to go to college , to fit myself to write poetry , and get rich , and pay the arrears . But Mrs. Hutch cut me short at the mention of college . She broke out with her old reproaches , and worked herself into a worse fury than I had ever witnessed before . I was all alone in the tempest , and a very old lady was sitting on a sofa , drinking tea ; and the tidy on the back of the sofa was sliding down . I was so bewildered by the suddenness of the onslaught , I felt so helpless to defend myself , that I could only stand and stare at Mrs. Hutch . She kept on railing without stopping for breath , repeating herself over and over . At last I ceased to hear what she said ; I became hypnotized by the rapid motions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spell was broken . I went over to the sofa with a decided step , and carefully replaced the tidy . It was now the landlady 's turn to stare , and I stared back , surprised at my own action . The old lady also stared , her teacup suspended under her nose . The whole thing was so ridiculous ! I had come on such a grand mission , ready to dictate the terms of a ? oble peace . I was met with anger and contumely ; the dignity of the ambassador of peace rubbed off at a touch , like the golden dust from the butterfly 's wing . I took my scolding like a meek child ; and then , when she was in the middle of a trenchant phrase , her eye fixed daggerlike on mine , I calmly went to put the enemy 's house in order ! It was ridiculous , and I laughed . Immediately I was sorry . I wanted to apologize , but Mrs. Hutch did n't give me a chance . If she had been harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to insult her ? she wanted to know . Was n't it enough that I and my family lived on her , that I must come to her on purpose to rile her with my talk about college ? college ! these beggars ! ? and laugh in her face ? ' What did you come for ? Who sent you ? Why do you stand there staring ? Say something ! College ! these beggars ! And do you think I 'll keep you till you go to college ? You , learning geometry ! Did you ever figure out how much rent your father owes me ? You are all too lazy ? Do n't say a word ! Do n't speak to me ! Coming here to laugh in my face ! I do n't believe you can say one sensible word . Latin ? and French ! Oh , these beggars ! You ought to go to work , if you know enough to do one sensible thing . College ! Go home and tell your father never to send you again . Laughing in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? How old are you ? ' Mrs. Hutch actually stopped , and I jumped into the pause . ' I 'm seventeen , ' I said quickly , ' and I feel like seventy . ' This was too much , even for me who had spoken . I had not meant to say the last . It broke out , like my wicked laugh . I was afraid , if I stayed any longer , Mrs. Hutch would have the apoplexy ; and I felt that I was going to cry . I moved toward the door , but the landlady got in another speech before I had escaped . " Seventeen ? seventy ! And looks like twelve ! The child is silly . Ca n't even tell her own age . No wonder , with her Latin , and French , and ? ' I did cry when I got outside , and I did n't care if I was noticed . What was the use of anything ? Everything I did was wrong . Everything I tried to do for Mrs. Hutch turned out bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rent , and nobody wanted the Searchlight , and I was told it was not a nice business . I wanted to take her into my confidence , and she would n't hear a word , but scolded and called me names . She was an unreasonable , ungrateful landlady . I wished she would put us out ; then we should be rid of her . ? But was n't it funny about that tidy ? What made me do that ? I never meant to . Curious , the way we sometimes do things 1%e do n't want to at all . ? The old lady must be deaf ; she did n't say anything all that time . ? Oh , I have a whole book of the Xneid to review , and it 's getting late . I must hurry home . It was impossible to remain despondent long . The landlady came only once a week , I reflected as I walked , and the rest of the time I was surrounded by friends . Everybody was good to use at home , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillingham , and her friend who took me out in the coun try to see the autumn leaves , and her friend 's friend who lent me books , and Mr. Charles , who put my poems in the Transcript , and gave me books almost every time I came , and a dozen others who did something good for me all the time , besides the several dozen who wrote me such nice letters . No , a single landlady could not spoil a world so fair as mine .
