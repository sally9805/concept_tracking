txt LEARNING WOODCRAFT . That Is the Prime Object of the Boy Scouts Movement . I think your correspondent is slightly mistaken in regard to the object of the movement of the " Boy Scouts . " Having been Instructor of Camp Baden-Powell No. 1 of New Hampshire for some time past I can speak of it " ex libra , " as It were . We have some twentyfive boys ranging in age from 9 to 16 years , and our object is to teach them woodcraft . Nothing at all " military " or " barbarous " in our teaching . Our symbols are the flag , patriotism , the oak leaf , bravery , the hatchet. service , the compass , guide , and the laurel , victory . Our boys learn to know the trees and the wild flowers , how to build a camp , make a fire , catch fish , snare animals , find their way through the woods , cook a meal ; In fact , to matte them self-reliant , useful , courageous , and intelligent . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woods , the only uniform a khaki jumper , overalls , and cap . Do you think any of these things appeal to the " savage part of our make up " ? There are a number of minor lessons in morals the boys are taught . such as clean living , chivalry . kindness , &c.,; and we find a marked improvement in the boys of the village since this camp was started ; it keeps the boys from being idle and useless during their Summer vacation . I hope the Boy Scouts will grow until every State In the Union hag an organization and every town its Camp .
