txt When the police A Promising enforce , as they Plan promise soon to do , . Attacked Is the new provision of I law which forbids automobiles from passing within eight feet of a street car that has stopped to take on or let off passengers , there is no doubt that for a while , at least , and in the places of most crowded traffic , not a few automobiles will frequently be brought to a standstill . This will greatly irritate their occupants and make in some degree harder of solution the already difficult problem of vehicular congestion , but confident predictions that these troubles are irremediable and the eight-foot prohibition therefore impracticable are rash in that they ignore , several factors of the situation . For one thing , the policemen whose specialty is the managing of street traffic say that the regulation is good  --  that it will help , not hinder , them in the performance of their task  --  and their opinion has weight . For another thing , the experiment is not as new as New York , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been followed for some time elsewhere  --  Washington , for instance  --  and it works all right , which proves , indeed , not that it will work as well here , where the conditions are different , but that it is not essentially bad . Moreover , as was Pointed out the other day , ' the constitutional objections of chauffeurs to stop for people on foot will strongly tend to make them keep on streets where they will not be subjected to this cruel indignity . That in itself would do much to relieve congestion . The suggested substitution of a fivemile speed limit for one of eight feet space , on the ground that there will be endless disputes as to the exact number of feet between street cars and automobiles , ignores the unquestionable fact that distance can be guessed with greater accuracy than speed . The prophecy that chauffeurs will not obey the eightfoot rule , but simply grin when their attention is called to it , depends for fulfillment ' on failure of the police to be active and the Magistrates stern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such failure seems unnecessarily unkind , and not justified by the present attitude of either . I While not wholly denying the need for speed limitations , our own inclination has always been to replace them as much as possible by a " rule of reason . " When and where speed is safe there is no sense in limiting it arbitrarily . Fifty miles an hour may be safe ; five miles , or even two , may be intolerably dangerous . Careful attention is Argentina . deserved by the arguLeads ment made by Dr. America . JUAN VIJCEITCII , the Ai ' gentine identification expert , who had much to do with bringing the utility of finger prints to the knowledge of the police of the world , in defense of the demand that the application of this wonderful system be extended far beyond its present limits . By restricting it to criminals , and especially to convicted criminals , a foolish prejudice is created and good citizens quite needlessly are deprived of many and important benefits which could otherwise be derived from the discovery , made many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of , every human being remain the same from birth till death ; that those of no two persons are alike , and that the individual differences can be recorded and recognized . The possibility of mistake does exist , indeed , but it is a possibility so remote as to be negligible , and finger-print evidence is so nearly certain that the courts no , longer commit the absurdity of denying to it that merit . Now and then a stupid or ignorant juryman still does this , and now and then a lawyer with a particularly bad case solemnly expatiates on the chance that his client 's lines are duplicated on the fingers of somebody else , but these instances are rapidly becoming rarer and will soon be gone . They are already of trivial importance . What is serious is that by taking and preserving the finger prints only of criminals we have rendered it disgraceful to have one 's identity thus established . Yet we all know perfectly well  --  or would if we stopped to think ? that conditions are constantly arising when it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of identifying good people who for one reason or other , including that of death , can not tell or prove who they are . Signatures , too , can be forged , but with finger prints that is practically impossible . In progressive Argentina , it seems , everybody is thus recorded in a public bureau as a part of vital statistics , and it is no more disgraceful than the records of births , deaths , and marriages . There only the criminals and the criminally inclined object to the plan , and their ? objections , naturally , do not count . The uses are many , including the political and the social , and the facilitation of police work is , as it should be , merely incidental . So rapidly is the Taking a habit of demanding View health certificates Too Narrow . before performing marriage ceremonies spreading among our clergymen that it promises soon to become general with them , and the eugenists , who not so long ago were derided by most of the people who did ' not denounce them , feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some ministers who are adopting the new plan , however , fail to make it as advantageous as they should by a too cautious limitation of its scope . The result of this , in at least one respect , will be to create unnecessary embarrassment and antagonism . Tills happens whenever it is assumed that in a single group of maladies lies the only disqualification for marriage that should be recognized . When that is done , refusal to marry an applicant inflicts a terrible disgrace , deserved , perhaps , but more likely to cause anger and resentment than reform , and sure to delay popular appreciation of the new plan . It is right as well as sensible and expedient to recognize that there are innocent as well as guilty bars to marriage . That would be only an extension or paralleling of the consanguinity prohibitions , which trouble nobody .
