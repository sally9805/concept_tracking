A DISTINGUISHED foreigner who visited the United States not long ago was asked to state , and state freely , what had impressed him most . He had been hurled through subways , jerked into sky-scrapers , flung from New York to Chicago on a fast train , and in general taken care of with that breathless assiduity which characterizes American hospitality . The question was received with an interrogating glance . " You want me to say that ? really ? " " I certainly do . " " Well , in that case , what I have most remarked is your lack of respect for your superiors . " The American flushed hotly . " Our superiors ! Where are they ? " Emerson speaks of manners as " personal and uncommunicable properties , " and traces their origin to a class or aristocracy which dominated or led because , though not necessarily wiser or stronger than their fellows , they were able to accomplish things through certain qualities of leadership or assurance . In other words , manners were produced by the ability to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to achieve has produced ruthlessness , arrogance , impatience , and a guarded and cynical reserve . We are no longer debonair . We have lost the facon de vivre . We are panting beneath what we call our opportunities , and the land of opportunity has much to answer for . We resemble the man who is shaved and manicured and has his boots cleaned all at once . We have no time in which to attend individually to our intellectual garnishings . In educated people , manners spring from a natural allegiance to a natural code or from that self-respect which desires to create a good impression , and by education is meant the ability to establish harmonious and pleasant relations with life in general . With the uneducated , manners are a matter of individual perception . Even the aboriginal achieves a certain nobility , because he is in unity with the wilderness of his own domain . To recall an instance which has been referred to elsewhere . The writer , on an exploring journey , found himself far from camp on a winter evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil of gray smoke from a valley spoke of a neighboring humanity . An Indian trapper 's teepee , hidden in a clump of spruce , offered hospitality . The trapper himself , grave and silent , did the honors . His wife spent the night keeping up the fire and mending the stranger 's snow-shoes . Food in abundance was offered . At daybreak the trapper strapped on his own shoes and spent two hours tramping with the explorer over the proposed route of the coming railway , displaying an intimate knowledge of his hunting-grounds and giving valuable information . When money was pressed on him , he drew himself up and shook his head . " You would have done the same for me . " With this he disappeared , and the snow-laden forest closed behind him . Manners ? yes , admirable manners of the most refined type . Expecting nothing , giving largely , proud , personal , and primitive , unstained by possessions , seized of the instant need of things . " You would have done the same for me . " Would we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now too often one who has something to sell . He is suave , bland , conciliatory , and complimentary , and it is an axiom in business that the " poorer the article , the smoother must be the sales- man . A grotesque situation ? this assumption of the unnatural for a purpose clearly visible to the one it is desired to influence ? often by the concealment of truth . It has been said that to reach the child one must begin with his grandparents . In America ? the term eliminates the forty-ninth parallel ? the undertaking looks rather hopeless . It is possible that one should not expect manners in a democracy , especially a democracy that is overcursed with the jade of opportunity . It also must be admitted that monarchical tradition did establish a mode , a method , a maniere ? for the latter there is no English ? that has been ruthlessly knocked about in a country which devotes most of its energies to the pursuit of the sempiternal dollar . On whom in America does the responsibility for manners rest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been destroyed by what we call modern competition , one is almost prone to suggest that those who have achieved a position in which they can find time to be polite should make the first move . One should certainly not apply to the man who scans with satisfaction a letter reading : " Dear sir ? Yours 15th received , contents noted . Terms accepted . Yours truly , " and who depends upon the engraved heading and the quality of the paper to give the desirable touch of distinction . Nor perhaps would it be wise to approach the office-boy or clerk who is dabbling in stocks and anticipates that turn of the wheel which will make a job unnecessary and put him perhaps financially ahead of his employer . We are too practical for anything like that . The man who is doing things is emancipated thereby from any obligation as to manners , and the officeboy ? Well , he may be doing them next week , in which case one will extend to him , also , carte blanche to eat and talk as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor go hand in hand ? Is the man who devotes obvious and postprandial attention to a toothpick not aware of the joke ? Does the man who speaks crudely and often with a suggestion of insolence , grasp at the fact that his auditor is too occupied in the national pursuit to care how a thing is put , provided he gets the sense of it , or , far back in the puritanical dust-bin of our brains , do we associate ease and grace and savoir vivre with that unmorality which tradition drapes with such fascinating folds over some of its most charming and notable characters . Is it ignorance or unwillingness , narrowness or indifference , preoccupation or provincialism ? Manners are , after all , the expression of a state of mind , and are distinct from what we are pleased to call morality , which is in itself merely another mental condition . It was Wilde who remarked that " immorality begins at home . " This is where manners generally end . And , should the home suggest the child , the North-American child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as an outlet for that pride which its parents can not always reasonably take in themselves . It is petted , cajoled , pampered , overdressed , and under-disciplined , till there is evolved a strange pygmy for whom the world soon grows banal , who is destitute of the petitionary appeal of childhood , and who surveys an already anticipated and thoroughly analyzed future with the cold eyes of unnatural knowledge . The world is its football . It is smart beyond description . But there is in the forced garden of its life no sheltered bed where may bloom the flowers of graciousness or peace . Of such will be the new aristocracy , and its traditions will be of grandfathers who , by virtue of that fine nativeAmerican long-headedness , delivered the goods of their period and were promptly and suitably rewarded . But there will be few traditions of courtliness , scant reminders that noblesse oblige , and but scattered memories of inherited responsibilities . The sempiternal dollar will still dominate . One generation was too busy collecting and the other will be too busy spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third but little . The fourth will probably open a new and finer cycle . It is a curious fact that manners improve as the degrees of north latitude diminish . The quality of seasons has in it something bland , if soporific . With the lessening of physical effort comes  | that which is in effect milder . It acts as an unguent . It soothes our temperamental wrinkles till we feel as did Bishop Blougram when he talked to Gigadibs , and " rolled him out a mind long crumpled , till creased consciousness lay smooth . " The voice of Pittsburg is not so rough when heard in Florida , and the rasp of Minneapolis takes on a gentler accent in New Orleans . The pores of the skin of the inner man become moist beneath the deeper blue of alien skies . Even the negro porter , whose sable familiarity saturated his cushioned domain in Illinois , now exudes a new respect . The broker , who in an elevator with his wife takes off his hat only on the entrance of another lady , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbuttoned , salutations hover on the lips ? and all because the thermometer has gone up thirty degrees . Is it climate that makes us strong , and weather that breeds our incivility ? In a general way , the race that does not know how to play will never achieve courtesy . Spending is not playing . It lacks that balanced pride of give and take which characterizes true sport . When the aspiring golfer learns to laugh at his own foozled drive , and to congratulate his opponent on a perfect stroke , he is temperamentally moving ahead . The unmannered man contributes nothing to the picture of life . His motions , acts , and speech are divested of natural relationship . He is at variance with this and that . He is uncomfortable because no attitude of defiance will banish from his mind the recurrent sense of something that he lacks . He regards the gentleman with , suspicion and distaste , claiming that what he terms his own rough heartiness is of sterner and worthier stuff than the method of the citizen of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence can not surmount those barriers of defense which surround the man of culture and within which he moves with poise and calm assurance . For , after all , only to him who has established his code of ethics comes the ability to happily plan his campaign of life . Nothing can be further from the truth than the conception that personal delicacy means personal weakness . It is the use of the rapier rather than the bludgeon , the enlistment of swiftness and agility against the easily anticipated blows of a clumsy if muscular adversary . De Tocqueville , that astute observer , said , in 1835 : " True dignity in manners consists in always taking one 's proper station neither too high nor too low ; and this is as much within the reach of a peasant as of a prince . In democracies all stations appear doubtful , hence it is that the manners of democracies , though often full of arrogance , are commonly wanting in dignity . . . . The men who live in democracies are too fluctuating for a certain number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodbreeding and in forcing people to follow it . " The hope of the future is , then , that the new world will reach a breathingspace when armistice will be declared with competition and material progress . In such a period there may arise out of the consciousness of physical achievement that calm , that natural hauteur , that dignity of reserve , that responsibility for the method of expression which best bespeaks security and serenity of mind . Such a development will impose its code upon the class and not merely upon the individual . It will be fundamentally undemocratic , but the future beauty of democracy lies in its ability to produce certain quasi-alien qualities of self-adornment without sapping its own underlying strength . To be continuously practical and constructional is to be desperate . De Tocqueville was probably right when he wrote , " I am persuaded that in the end democracy diverts the imagination from all that is external to man and fixes it on man alone . " It is necessary to distinguish sharply between manners and manner . The one evidences harmony with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals only the point of view concerning the matter in hand . It is desirable , or undesirable , emotional , pleading , authoritative , suggestive ? as the case may evidence ? but it does not interpret . It exhibits nothing of the essential attitude of the inner man . Thus one would choose to be marooned with a cultured  | cynic rather than with the uncultured philanthropist . Life would be less insipid , more suggestive ; less shackled , more aristocratic . The link between manners and art is undeniable . The bourgeois who arrives at the point of art creation is registering the protest that his life is somewhere lacking , or else shrouds in a new form of expression an imagination that can find no vehicle within the boundaries of his own station . Art , like manners , is nondemocratic . It is essentially the product of the mind which has expanded beyond the contemplation of material things . It is amiably divorced from our national North-American industry ? the pursuit of the dollar . Art is in fact the medium and voice of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony with the larger life . There are , on the other hand , undeniable advantages , comparative though they be , in the way in which the social pragmatist has divested himself of ancestral traditions . Not suddenly in the throb of revolt have they been laid aside , but in a season of social evolution he has slipped from them as the snake glides from his outworn sheath into a keener and crisper light . There is less now to intervene between the essential man and the glare of modern life . Manners evidence , rather than make , the man who continually and quite consciously reveals himself . The veneer , he has decided , is something that must be discarded like an overcoat when actual work begins . And since business now induces the social communication ? while formerly the reverse was true ? the nakedness of commercial dealing has robbed social expression of much of the hollowness that formerly distinguished it from the dealings of the market-place . There is to-day no necessity for those delicate voyages of discovery which once preceded affairs of importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can afford to be lax about the temperamental if the mental and scientific meet our requirements . We are , it is true , more brutal , but are we not less resentful ? Our passions and desires are gratified in an outburst , but there is less licking of . lascivious lips . What we have lost in poise is largely compensated by a certain unwritten code which demands that our word and our bond shall be equal and interchangeable . And all this is recognized in ? if we may use a mistakenly inclusive term ? our literature . The code , the form , the vehicle is of secondary importance provided that it transmits life , bare , unadulterated , and unashamed . Ungrammatical dialect recreates for us the sandy-haired yokel , and the slang of the diamond is the breath of the baseball gladiator . The depiction of unbroken manners has become a shirt of Nessus that irritates the body corporate , because such formality does not ring true to life . There is a story afloat of an aspiring young novelist who in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiration was to rivet the reader 's attention in his first sentence . What could the publisher suggest ? The latter , a cynic , pondered , then ventured : " Hell ! ' said the duchess , and lit another cigarette . " He was probably quite right . In the duchess we perceive a woman who , though subject to hereditary influences , had nevertheless struck up a working agreement with modern times . Undoubtedly of strong impulses , she expressed herself with a directness doubly striking amid luxurious surroundings , a directness flavored with the very essence of democratic freedom . The cigarette , of course , convinces us that , while outspoken , she was unquestionably subtle , for this is the recognized purpose of the cigarette . A forceful picture ? over it the dwindling nimbus of a traditional aristocracy ; animating it , the brusque impatience of democracy . Retrospect uncoupled with forecast being regarded as banal in the twentieth century , consider what lies beyond the horizon . It is admitted that vast congregations of humanity are detrimental to manners . It is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character there is little chance for the gracious things of life . The tendency of science and invention is to make existence more automatic and less personal . As years pass , there looms before us a period in which electricity , subservient to our slightest wish , will  | at length almost entirely replace the already disappearing domestic servant . It is to be assumed , therefore , that unless we are reduced to the pulpy colloid of the Martian we shall have more time to ourselves . More time for what ? Possibly for music , art , and sport , in which case we shall improve our manners , but , equally possibly , for a still more arduous pursuit of wealth . On the assumption of the latter , there is only one outcome ? social and economic revolution . And should revolution take place and the under-dog pull down his too plutocratic master , there would immediately out of the chaos be produced such a renaissance of manners as once transformed France into a newborn republic of chivalry . An aristocracy whose only pride is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making any other than a gilded mark upon the ethics of its time . Its differentiation depends upon that which it has , so to speak , extracted from the democracy at large . And though democracies have clumsy tongues , they have , nevertheless , long memories . Only with the ruins of the plutocrat can a nation adorn itself . Manners when conscious become artificial . The habitues of the Hotel de Rambouillet , that social experiment of the seventeenth century , termed themselves " Precieux et Precieuses , " but whatever influence that movement gained in the court of Louis XIV . was lost in the swift " Ridicules " of Moliere . The tact and temper of Chesterfield had availed him nothing were he not as well a brilliant diplomat and administrator . Even those dying words , " Give Dayrolles a chair , " might have been whispered by a prig and a poseur , had he not lived the code so exquisitely portrayed in the immortal Letters . The future can hold for society only that which is natural . All else has in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day is a phase of transition , and our lack of manners will serve bravely as a background for that advance which another generation must indubitably make . The choice of nations is , in the long run , for natural conditions , and it is a healthy sign when we take to pieces the picture-puzzle of social life and find that no contriving will reassemble it . That materialism will disappear is neither to be expected nor desired . It was Charles Lamb who said that " the mercantile spirit levels all distinctions ? as all are beauties in the dark . " The same perfectionist wrote , in 1823 , in his essay on " Modern Gallantry , " that he would believe that the principle of deference toward females actuated AngloSaxons , indeed , when " the practice of whipping women in public , of hanging them and of hissing them off the stage , had been discontinued , or when we assisted apple-women to pick up the fruit scattered by an unlucky dray . " And , as a matter of fact , we do pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , a respect of which the significance is more profound than it was in the Hotel de Rambouillet . There is comradeship as never before . The intellect is becoming a warmer thing . And if the modern enemy of manners is self-love , which Rochefoucauld analyzed as being " imperious and obedient , sincere and false , piteous and cruel , timid and bold , " our greatest weapon is the greater knowledge ? to which moderation is twin brother . The active agent must come from within , and be of pure , uncalculating volition . We are in the condition of having , as a Scotchman remarked , " considerable means but no presence . " It is the plaint of the essayist that the essay reaches only those in need of no conversion . It is like a ball pitched from one trained hand to another . But sometimes the ball flies afield to be retrieved by an onlooker , who scans it curiously for a moment ere hurling it back into the game . Thus , perchance , the faulty aim of an essay may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least its surface may present something of interest or suggestion .  |
