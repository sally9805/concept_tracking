OSS , me no lika dis job . Give me my money . 1 goin ' home . " The speaker was an Italian member of America 's , ; new National Army .  - -  - 402:41 And , , his captain to me , " that 's all the conception a lot of them have of why they are here . " I went to the great cantonments expecting to see a great body of Americans . I found Americans , but I found also thousands of Italians , Poles , Russians , Rumanians , Greeks , and others ? all potential Americans , to be sure , but with a long way to travel yet ! In each of several camps of 30,000 to 40,000 men I found from 4,000 to 5,000 who understand little English and speak still less . Of course this proportion would be determined in each cantonment by the districts from which the men come . I talked with scores of colonels and other officers , and all agreed that this was one of their greatest problems . One regiment had about eighty per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . Whole companies were made up mostly of Poles or some other foreign nationality . Imagine these fellows from the slums of Chicago , Milwaukee , Detroit , Cleveland , New York , getting off their trains , being taken to camp , marched to i their quarters , given instructions which they could little understand , and beginning immediately a life as new and strange to them as aeroplaning would be for you and me ! You may be amazed to learn that America 's first draft army includes more than 76,000 foreigners of many nationalities . Among this number are 18,131 Russians and other Slays , 15,148 Italians , 13,233 Austrians , 5794 Mexicans , 3,675 Greeks , 1,600 Turks , 1,335 Swedes , 1,000 Norwegians , over goo Portuguese , more than soo Japanese , 280 Chinese , 550 Dutch . and thousands of Belgians , French , Rumanians , Serbians , Swiss , Bulgarians , and other nationalities . VOL . CXXXVII. ? No. 818. - 36 Altogether there are over 243,000 aliens registered in the first draft . Although all reports are not in yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second draft . To build real soldiers out of this material is a slow process , requiring infinite patience . One captain told me this as a joke on himself : " To-day when drilling my men I was provoked so many times by one fellow who refused to listen or obey orders that I sailed into him before the whole company . After I had completed what I thought was a rather impressive speech one of the non-commissioned officers saluted and said , Excuse me , Captain , but that man does n't understand a word you 're saying ! " When a new crowd of men comes to camp it is no uncommon sight to find men wandering helplessly around in their off hours , absolutely lost . They do not know the number of their regiment , company , or barracks , and in a camp of five thousand acres and more all barracks look alike . One of these huge cantonments is a maze for any newcomer , even for the educated American who does not hesitate to inquire his way . Fancy some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " first papers , " grasping quickly the fundamentals of our government , the real meaning of our war , the bewildering nomenclature and courtesies of the army camp ! It all seems so impossible . One afternoon I had the privilege of being in one of the barracks while a colonel was explaining to his captains the exact way everything should be arranged . " Exact " hardly describes it . Of course the bed had to be made just so , the poncho had to be folded exactly right at the foot , the mess-kit had to be hung on a certain nail , a few things were permitted to be visible , the rest " under the mattress , " etc . There by the door stood a dozen foreigners , just arrived , who could hardly speak a word of English , and my thoughts went beyond them to the boarding-houses and industrial plants whence they had come . Yet to-morrow these same foreigners would be following out those same strict orders , making their own beds with a precision that would dismay the tidiest housekeeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps it is done with one stroke of the pen , overnight ! A few days later I saw those same " rookies , " in army garb , drilling , and I could barely recognize them . There is something profoundly inspiring about it all . At the same time there is something very pathetic about the ignorance of these men . The officers , on the whole , are showing splendid patience and a fine spirit in the face of great difficulties . There are humorous as well as pathetic stories . Joe came in after hours one night and was greeted by the guard in the usual manner : " Halt ! Advance and be recognized ! " In answer to the question , " What 's your name ? " Joe replied , " Ah , vou no guess it in a thousand years. ? . He probably went to the guardhouse , and , as one colonel said , " There are many there because of ignorance rather than viciousness . " At Camp Upton one evening a major was stopped by a " Halt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentry advanced and again said , " Halt . " " Well , what do you want ? " inquired the major , with rising anger . " Halt ! Now I think about time you run ? I shoot ! " Of course the sentry was taken to task , and it was discovered that he had misunderstood the order to shoot if any man refused to halt after being ordered to do so three times . The major , however , sympathized with the foreign sentry and admitted that he was a good sport in at least telling him to run ! And everybody says : " Uncle Sam has called these men . What are we going tia do with them ? " The Young Men 's Christian Association is finding the answer . In each of the sixteen big National Army cantonments and sixteen National G-uard camps there are from seven to fifteen large Y. M. C. A. buildings with from thirty-five to eighty secretaries trained for this and other great tasks . They have tackled this problem promptly and fearlessly . Numerous classes in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American government , civics , and citizenship have been organized with amazing rapidity . Teachers are selected from each company with the help of its captains . They are privates or non-commissioned officers of experience and ability , and are given all the training and equipment necessary . Each company generally has an educational representative , and every regiment has a general educational officer , often the chaplain , who helps supervise the work . To show how rapidly the organization can he set up ? in one case the " Y. M. C. A. man " interviewed the colonel and readily secured his co-operation and the necessary " order . " That evening the colonel and his entire staff of officers and forty teachers selected by the captains attended a " demonstration lesson . " There in a company mess-hall twenty foreigners of several nationalities were taught their first English . In half an hour , by the rapid-fire Y. M. C. A. method , they had memorized seventeen sentences in English and understood them ? all without the aid of an interpreter . Both officers and men were amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , new encouragement had been given the men . The next night the teachers came together for normal instruction , another demonstration , and the receiving of equipment , such as charts , lesson sheets , books , etc . The third night all the teachers were handling their own classes in their respective barracks . The classes were graded and every man was in his right place . Thirty classes are now running with military precision in that regiment three evenings a week , and the teachers meet regularly for conference and normal instruction . The Y. M. C. A. educational director visits the classes and keeps in close touch with all the work . Multiply this by ten or fifteen , and you have some idea of the vast task of instruction to foreigners in a single cantonment . This generally means at least 25o classes with .4,000 men in each camp where the need really exists . As small groups of men move from one camp to another the camp educational director sends word ahead , and the director in the new camp immediately arranges to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from teachers in France describing the successful continuance of the work there . Recently one of the teachers received a post-card : DEAR TEACHER , -1 want thank you all you teache me before I come ? If die , I die as good American citizen . If I come back America some day I find you and learn some more and get better job and be better American . Your respectful pupil , In several instances the organization of classes and teachers is so effective that definite plans have been made to continue it overseas as far as practicable . It may well be asked how the Asso-ciation is able to gear up its machinery rapidly enough to take care of the exceedingly important task of educating a large proportion of these 76,000 foreigners in the camps . The answer is that for ten years the Association has been using with tremendous effectiveness the simple and efficient method of teaching English to foreigners devised by one of its own secretaries , Dr. Peter Roberts , of the Industrial Department , International Committee . Therefore , the Association did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survivor of many experiments , a method recognized by experts as scientific , accurate , and particularly rapid . Inasmuch as the Association was teaching over 5o,000 foreigners in our industries by this method , it was a comparatively simple task to take over as many men and more in the army camps ; particularly as there the military organization invited the Association 's co-operation and put all the facilities at its disposal . The Roberts method , as it has been called , takes a group of foreigners absolutely ignorant of the English language and teaches them all equally well , even though there may be a dozen nationalities in the class at the same time . There are three fundamental principles of the method : First , that the ear and not the eye is the organ of language . That is to say , we learned our native tongue by hearing it spoken by our parents and others . We did not learn from books until long after we had learned to speak . The Association experts , therefore , realize that they must first teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are really children ) how to speak . The reading and writing come later in the lesson . Second , that each lesson must deal with a common experience of every-day life . Third , that each sentence must suggest what the next sentence shall be . That is , the sentences must be logically arranged and all bear on the main theme . A teacher , therefore , proceeds as follows : He says to his men , " You say this after me ? Awake . " The class in unison then repeats the word , which as yet they do not understand the meaning of , and the teacher corrects their pronunciation . He then gives them the second word --  " open . " They repeat this . He follows with " look , " " find , " " see . " Very quickly the men memorize these five words in the order given , until they say them without the teacher 's help . Incidentally , you will note that the men have been learning verbs , the vitally active part of each sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each sentence slowly and with dramatic precision , : " I awake from sleep . " " I open my eyes . " " I look for my watch . " " I find my watch . " " I see what time it is . " In from five to ten minutes the men memorize perfectly these five sentences . They understand the meaning , because the teacher carefully enacts each word and sentence . The teacher then has his pupils memorize the second set of sentences : " It is six o'clock . " " I must get up . " " I throw back the bedclothes . " " I get out of bed . " " I put on my pants . " " I put on my sucks and shoes . " And so on through the process of getting up in the morning . If an hour to an hour and a half is allowed for the lesson , about half of the time is well spent in this acting out of the lesson and memorizing . It is amazing how quickly men really understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When that point is reached the teacher exhibits a large chart upon which the lesson is printed . The men then connect what they have seen dramatized and what they have memorized with what they now see in print . Thus they say the lesson from memory while looking at theprinted words , with the result that they very quickly learn to recognize the printed forms of the words already learned . Then each student is given a lesson sheet to keep ? on one side the lesson in print and the reverse side in script . They then read in unison both sides of the sheet many times until , they are actually , in spite of themselves , learning to read . The instructor then gives some simple grammar with immediate applications to the lesson learned , and closes with a review in which the lesson is finally impressed upon the mind of every pupil . The men are given copy-books and urged to write the lesson and submit it for correction next time . Thus , in an hour , or an hour and a half at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalities can learn very accurately the entire lesson of from fifteen to twenty sentences , understand its meaning , remember it , and learn considerable reading , writing , and grammar . For very elementary men the Association educational directors use the lessons which have been prepared on such subjects as " Getting up in the Morning , " " Getting Wood to Light the Fire , " " Lighting the Fire , " " Getting Breakfast , " " Table Utensils , " etc . Many of the men are able , however , to start at once with the special Military Series . The same method is used and charts and lesson sheets are also provided . Military series No. i deals with " Going to Camp , " " In Camp , " " In Quarters and Mess-hall , " " Drills , " " Inspection of Arms , " " Exercises , " " The Salute Indoors , " " The Salute Outdoors , " " Keeping Clean , " " Care of Clothing . " Military series No. 2 deals with such subjects as " Reveille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Commanding Officer , " " Guard Mount , " " Changing Posts , " " Pay-day , " " Evening Parade , " A Soldier 's Duty . " Series 3 takes up " Rifle and Bayonet , " " Care of the Rifle , " " Commissioned Officers , " " Noncommissioned Officers , " " Our Flag , " etc . At the end of twenty or thirty lessons the soldier is able to understand readily such a lesson as this : am am a soldier of the U. S. Army . follow train = follow the Rag of my country . = I now train to be a good soldier . exercise = I exercise my body and keep my-self clean . learn = I learn to use my hands and arms . must have = A good soldier must have a clear mind . must give = He must give attention to the officer . must have = He must have control of his body . must learn = He must learn the drills well . must keep = He must keep his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . must be = He must be loyal to his company . must serve =Fie must serve and respect his comrades . will reverence = He will always reverence the flag . will fight = He will fight bravely for his country . For intermediate men a series of three Beginners ' Readers have been provided dealing with many helpful subjects . For advanced work there is a special Military Reader with such lessons as the following " Democracy or Despotism ? Which ? " " The Eyes of the World are on You , " " The Message of the Flag . " " The Fourth of July . " " Our War . " " America 's Cantonments . " " All Classes Respond . " " Carry On . " " War Against War . " " Love of Home . " " The Pride of Americans . " " American Soldiers in France . " " French Impressions of American Troops . " " The Challenge . " There is provided also an Advanced Reader which contains some remarkablelessons in history , geography , government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , there are used with telling effect the " Home Reading Course for Citizen Soldiers " and other special pamphlets published by the Committee on Public Information , Washington , D. C. For supplementary work a series of pamphlets has been collected from various agencies throughout the United States dealing with American history , patriotism , the opportunities in America , temperance , thrift , alcoholism , sex hygiene , citizenship , and many other subjects . Thus the Association is wise enough to prepare these men not only for immediate necessities of army life , but for their future place in America . After one class a captain said : " Please give particular instruction to that man Pete . He is a wonderful soldier . Was two years in the Rumanian army . I want to make an officer of him as soon as he knows English . " And there are many others . One Greek had been in the British service until his ship was torpedoed and had spent twenty-one long hours in a fife-boat before being rescued and brought to America . What wonderful soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. is knocking out the " if " ! At many camps most of the colonels are excusing their non-English speaking men from one hour 's lecture , recreation , or drill period four days each week in order that they may attend these classes . The teachers are relieved from all other duties . In a large number of camps a general order has been issued which makes attendance of teachers and students compulsory . Many of the instructors are college men who have used these same methods in Y. M. C. A. classes of foreigners in their undergraduate days . It is impossible to appreciate the great eagerness of the men . As one adjutant expressed it after one of our demonstration classes at Camp Grant : " When the class started it was amazing . After five sentences it was pathetic . I never realized they could learn so quickly . " If this means much to the single man , it means far more to the man with family obligations . I shall never forget one coal-miner who had , through the mistake of his draft board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been unable to explain his case , and who cried himself to sleep every night . Did he want to learn English ? 1 have had the privilege of helping to train hundreds of the teachers fer many of these classes in camps all over the United States . I know that in their exceedingly busy camp life these teachers are making heroic sacrifices four or five days a week in order to help their fellow-men . They are rendering a service which will never be forgotten by their grateful students or by their officers , and they themselves are acquiring the sort of experience which will some day make them the finest kind of officers and which will certainly prepare them for a larger life after the war . After a class the other night I overheard a young Italian say to his teacher : " Teacher , I want thank you . Before I came here I no have chance learn any much English . Now I learn whole lot , I be better soldier . " In one camp the military authorities turned over 3,5oo men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institute some rapid training for several hundred teachers immediately . All the prospective teachers were gathered in the great Y. M. C. A. auditorium . Twenty-five of the most ignorant foreigners in the entire camp were seated on the platform and it was necessary for me to give them a demonstration lesson . It was exceedingly embarrassing for the foreigners , but they caught the spirit of it and soon forgot that there was any audience but themselves . Thus , in a half-hour we were able to give the teachers a real demonstration of how it could be done . After that every instructor was enthusiastic and went to his work with a vigor which assured effective results . I have no doubt many of them used originality and ingenuity enough to improve greatly on the demonstration lesson which theyobserved . Fortheensuing two days a series of conferences was held to train the teachers by groups , to answer their questions , and to discuss the best methods of putting the work on a thoroughly comprehensive and efficient basis . All of this work has a distinctively human side and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged to enjoy . One Saturday afternoon , not long after a new group had arrived at one camp , a Y. M. C. A. secretary noticed two men sitting on a dirt-pile near one of the barracks , looking much depressed . His cheery greeting brought little response , but he discovered they were Syrians who knew very little English . They were not out playing games , because they did not know it was their afternoon off . They were afraid to go far , because they did not know how to get back . The secretary found out the number of their barracks , wrote it down , and put the information in their pockets . One of them remarked in broken English that his people might die and he would never know it . So their newfound friend took them to the nearest " Y " building , wrote two newsy letters to the home folks , and sent their correct address . Then he explained many other things to the homesick men . Next day they met him in another " Y " building , greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. C. A. ? that 's damnedest biggest company we ever see ! Everywhere we go , Y. M. C. A. ! " The fellow had hit the truth , after all , for no soldier can get far from the Association . It is firmly intrenched in 65o different buildings and tents in 245 different camps , forts , naval training stations , and other special posts . Over 3,000 trained building secretaries , educational , physical , social ; and religious work directors are now at work in the United States . Nearly 2,000 more have been sent to the work with our boys in France and with the soldiers of all our allies in training - camps , hospitals , among prisoners of war , and even in the front trenches . Premier Clemenceau and General Petain have endorsed a request for r , 000 secretaries , to be sent at the rate of 25o a month , to take charge of the Foyer des Soldats , and this need is being met . To support these vast activities the Association in its last drive raised $53,100,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9oo post-exchanges for our boys in France . Tons of every conceivable equipment are constantly being shipped . Present demands call for forty new secretaries each day for an indefinite period for the work overseas . I do not want to give the impression that all of the need for work with foreigners is confined to the sixteen National Army camps . As a matter of fact , there is a surprising need in many National Guard camps . In my last visit to Camp McClellan I found over 1,000 foreigners being taught English under Y. M. C. A. auspices or in classes organized by the various chaplains . This has been true at many others of these camps . Of course , these men are influenced not only through classes in English and other subjects , but also through patriotic and loyalty talks , motion pictures , stereopticon lectures , cartoons , and through contact with their officers , their teachers , and their associates . After a recent lecture on the war in one Y. M. C. A. building a young Armenian came to the speaker and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been massacred , sent to the desert , or placed in harems by the Turks or German officers . With clenched fists he added : " That 's where my sister is now . I not bloodthirsty , but ? " He turned away in emotion and it was easy to see that there will be no more earnest fighter in our American army . In several camps special classes and talks have been arranged for alien enemies who have been segregated . This has resulted in entirely changing their attitude toward the war and many have come out loyally for America . At one camp a series of meetings for different groups of foreign-born was called by division orders . The Association co-operated in securing speakers in various foreign languages and splendid results were secured . At just about that time the War Department order granting discharges to all subjects of Austria-Hungary was announced . Over Goo of these men refused to accept discharges as a direct result of these meetings . In one instance , at a gathering attended by 250 men , only seven said they would accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Powers , and the changed attitude of the men is well illustrated by one Bohemian , who said : " We want to go'across to fight ; not to stay here and do nothing ; we know why we are fighting ; we have been fighting the Germans for a thousand years . " There is something about the army uniform that levels men upward and makes the foreigners look as fine as they really are . Few things in America to-day are more inspiring than the way the vast majority of these adopted nephews of Uncle Sam are taking their place with men of other nationalities all really Americans ? and are gaining self-respect , health , weight , better physique , mental alertness , moral character , in real con-fidence in themselves and n their country . Most people do not realize that there are over 40,000 native illiterates in the camps , many of them from the Southern mountains . There are many more negroes , a large proportion of whom are illiterate . There are also over 300,000 other men who have not gone further in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is oppor- tunity fur a veritable university in every army camp in the country . Many of the same methods and courses , especially adapted , are used with native illiterates and negroes . When we stop to think that probably fourteen out of fifteen of these men will return to civil life after the war , we get some comprehen- sion of the vast good that is being accomplished which will permanently affect the life of the nation . It is impossible for one to realize , without actually having been in the homes of the Southern mountaineers , how ignorant some of them are when they first reach camp . An Association secretary discovered one of these men crying himself to sleep in his barracks . When asked what Was the matter he replied , " I do n't like it here in France . " It took considerable time for the secretary to convince the man that he was not in France , but in reality only a few hundred miles from home . The secretary did everything he could for the man . He saw that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he was in a much happier frame of mind . If English is in demand in our cantonments , what shall we say of French ? It seems as though everybody wanted to learn French , particularly now that the big drive is on and our boys feel that they must get over soon . In addition to scores of classes in French , many important sentences are taught by an interpreter , by projecting the words on the screen in between movies . There are signs in French in many of the camps , and thus the men learn some important phrases in spite of themselves . In many regiments French is made a part of the work in the regular officers ' schools . Then , of course , for the more advanced there are classes in mathematics , modern history , stenography and typewriting , automobiling , etc . There are current-events clubs , special bulletin boards illustrating the news of the day , " what to read hours " to stimulate helpful reading , thrift talks to help men understand the larger meaning of thrift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough ahead to help men begin their studies along lines of new vocations , to help prepare them for better positions after the war , and to assist them toward a larger life in every way . As one visits scores of these camps and finds in varying degree the ever-present problem of illiteracy , one naturally asks , " Why have these men not beeneducated long ago in the communities from which they have come ? " Experiences in the army camps have certainly placed this responsibility square upon the shoulders of our home communities . If we have never been awake to our immigration problem before , we certainly must be thoroughly alive to it now . In time of war it is at once one of our gravest problems and one of our greatest opportunities . There are in America to-day approximately ts , 000,000 foreign-born and zo , - 000.000 more of foreign parentage . There are only about 4. , 000,000 foreign-born voters , and fully 5,000,000 who speak very little English . More than 3,00o,000 aliens of military age are exempt from draft because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us see to it that every agency in every city in America be commandeered to help educate and inspire with loyalty these men from other lands , whether aliens or citizens and whether or not they are to be drafted ! If this can not be accomplished before they are drafted , much can certainly be done by intensified work between the time they are drafted and the day they are actually called to leave for camp . Special receptions , patriotic meetings , lectures , short-term classes , and other features will contribute largely to this end . Already exemption boards , public schools , churches , Y. M. C. A. 's and other organizations have co-operated in such programs with remarkable results . Large plans are being made to help men of the second draft in every way before they leave . All such efforts must be multiplied a thousandfold during the coming months if we are really to help win a decisive victory for democracy . Our foreign brothers must he aided , not merely because they are prospective soldiers , but because they are prospective American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed also the most comprehensive program of education , recreation , and inspiration that America has ever known . And fortunately this is one of those great undertakings where each one of us can do his share !
