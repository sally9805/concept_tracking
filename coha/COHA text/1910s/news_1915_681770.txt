txt Unlicensed . There are at present 150 eligible chauffeurs on the civil service list awaiting appointments . When an ordinary citizen seeks employment from the City of New York as a chauffeur or automobile engineman he is compelled to pass State automobile and municipal civil service examinations , including a demonstration ? Having passed these examinations , he must pay for his operating privilege , that . is to say , he pays for his license . There are city officials in New York who personally operate the city cars . thus combining the chauffeur 's task with their own official duty . These city officials are exempt from examination . Furthermore , they are not compelled by the law to buy a chauffeur 's license . The city official who operates the city cars and who is not examined is more likely to injure persons because of his inexperience . Why are the chauffeurs thus discriminated against ?
