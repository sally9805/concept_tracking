 | NEWSPAPER MORALS ASPIRING , toward the end of my nonage , to the black robes of a dramatic critic , I took counsel with an ancient whose service went back to the days of Our American Cousin , asking him what qualities were chiefly demanded by the craft . The main idea , ' he told me frankly , is to be interesting , to write a good story . All else is dross . Of course , I am not against accuracy , fairness , information , learning . If you want to read Lessing and Freytag , Hazlitt and Brunetiere , go read them : they will do you no harm . It is also useful to know something about Shakespeare . But unless you can make people read your criticisms , you may as well shut up your shop . And the only way to make them read you is to give them something exciting . ' You suggest , then , ' I ventured , a certain ? ferocity ? ' I do , ' replied my venerable friend . Read George Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with a bladder on a string , usually with a meat-axe . Knock somebody in the head every day ? if not an actor , then the author , and if not the author , then the manager . And if the play and the performance are perfect , then excoriate someone who does n't think so ? a fellow critic , a rival manager , the unappreciative public . But make it hearty ; make it hot ! The public would rather be the butt itself than have no butt in the ring . That is Rule No. 1 of American psychology ? and of English , too , but more especially of American . You must give a good show to get a crowd , and a good show means one with slaughter in it . ' Destiny soon robbed me of my critical shroud , and I fell into a long succession of less aesthetic newspaper berths , from that of police reporter to that of managing editor , but always the advice of my ancient counselor kept turning over and over in my memory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whenever I acted upon it I found that it worked . What is more , I found that other newspaper men acted upon it too , some of them quite consciously and frankly , and others through a veil of self-deception , more or less diaphanous . The primary aim of all of them , no less when they played the secular Iokanaan than when they played the mere newsmonger , was to please the crowd , to give a good show ; and the way they set about giving that good show was by first selecting a de , serving victim , and then putting him magificently to the torture . This was their method when they were performing for their own profit only , when  | their one motive was to make the public read their paper ; but it was still their method when they were battling bravely and unselfishly for the public good , and so discharging the highest duty of their profession . They lightened the dull days of midsummer by pursuing recreant aldermen with bloodhounds and artillery , by muckraking unsanitary milk-dealers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought constructive campaigns for good government in exactly the same gothic , melodramatic way . Always their first aim was to find a concrete target , to visualize their cause in some definite and defiant opponent . And always their second aim was to shell that opponent until he dropped his arms and took to ignominious flight . It was not enough to maintain and to prove ; it was necessary also to pursue and overcome , to lay a specific somebody low , to give the good show aforesaid . Does this confession of newspaper practice involve a libel upon the American people ? Perhaps it does ? on the theory , let us say , that the greater the truth , the greater the libel . But I doubt if any reflective newspaper man , however lofty his professional ideals , will ever deny any essential part of that truth . He knows very well that a definite limit is set , not only upon the people 's capacity for grasping intellectual concepts , but also upon their capacity for grasping moral concepts . He knows that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state his ethical syllogism in the homely terms of their habitual ethical thinking . And he knows that this is best done by dramatizing and vulgarizing it , by filling it with dynamic and emotional sig= nificance , by translating all argument for a principle into rage against a man . In brief , he knows that it is hard for the plain people to think about a thing , but easy for them to feel . Error , to hold their attention , must be visualized as a villain , and the villain must proceed swiftly to his inevitable retribution . They can understand that process ; it is simple , ' usual , satisfying ; it squares with their primitive conception of justice as a form of revenge . The hero fires them too , but less certainly , less violently than the villain . His defect is that he offers thrills at second-hand . It is the merit of the villain , pursued publicly by a posse comitatus , that he makes the public breast the primary seat of heroism , that he makes every citizen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ever the aim of the sagacious journalist to foster that sense of personal participation .

I assume here , as an axiom too obvious to be argued , that the chief appeal of a newspaper , in all such holy causes , is not at all to the educated and reflective minority of citizens , but frankly to the ignorant and unreflective majority . The truth is that it would usually get a newspaper nowhere to address its exhortations to the former , for in the first place they are too few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements , and in the second place it is almost always impossible to convert them into disciplined and useful soldiers . They are too cantankerous for that , too ready with embarrassing strategy of their own . One them to feel .

On the contrary , his attitude toward them is almost always one of frank cynicism , with indifference as its mildest form and contempt as its commonest . He knows that they are constantly falling into false reasoning about the things within his personal knowledge , ? that is , within the narrow circle of his special education , ? and so he assumes that they make the same , or even worse errors about other things , whether intellectual or moral . This assumption , it may be said at once , is quite justified by the facts . I know of no subject , in truth , save perhaps baseball , on which the average American newspaper , even in the larger cities , discourses with unfailing sense and understanding . Whenever the public journals presume to illuminate such a matter as municipal taxation , for example , or the extension of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , or the control of public-service corporations , or the revision of city charters , the chief effect of their effort is to introduce into it a host of extraneous issues , most of them wholly emotional , and so they contrive to make it unintelligible to all earnest seekers after the truth . But it does not follow thereby that they also make it unintelligible to their , special client , the man in the street . Far from it . What they actually accomplish is the exact opposite . That is to say , it is precisely by this process of transmutation and emotionalization that they bring a given problem down to the level of that man 's comprehension , and what is more important , within the range of his active sympathies . He is not interested in anything that does not stir him , and he is not stirred by anything that fails to impinge upon his small stock of customary appetites and attitudes . His daily acts are ordered , not by any complex process of reasoning , but by a continuous process of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely intellectual argument , even when its theme is his own ultimate benefit , for such argument quickly gets beyond his immediate interest and experience . But he is very responsive to emotional suggestion , particularly when it is crudely and violently made , and it is to this weakness that the newspapers must ever address their endeavors . In brief , they must try to arouse his horror , or indignation , or pity , or simply his lust for slaughter . Once they have done that , they have him safely by the nose . He will follow blindly until his emotion wears out . He will be ready to believe anything , however absurd , so long as he is in his state of psychic tumescence . In the reform campaigns which periodically rock our large cities , - and our small ones , too , ? the newspapers habitually make use of this fact . Such campaigns are not intellectual wars upon erroneous principles , but emotional wars upon errant men : they always revolve around the pursuit of some definite , concrete , fugitive malefactor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belong to popular sport rather than to the science of government ; the impulse behind them is always far more orgiastic than reflective . For good government in the abstract , the people of the United States seem to have no liking , or , at all events , no passion . It is impossible to get them stirred up over it , or even to make them give serious thought to it . They seem to assume that it is a mere phantasm of theorists , a political will-o ' - the-wisp , a utopian dream , ? wholly  | uninteresting , and probably full of dangers and tricks . The very discussion of it bores them unspeakably , and those papers which habitually discuss it logically and unemotionally ? for example , the New York Evening Post ? are diligently avoided by the mob . What the mob thirsts for is not good government in itself , but the merry chase of a definite exponent of bad government . The newspaper that discovers such an exponent ? or , more accurately , the newspaper that discovers dramatic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reform wave of the highest emotional intensity . All that it need do is to goad the victim into a fight . Once he has formally joined the issue , the people will do the rest . They are always ready for a man-hunt , and their favorite quarry is the man of politics . If no such prey is at hand , they will turn to wealthy debauchees , to fallen Sunday-school superintendents , to money barons , to white-slave traders , to unsedulous chiefs of police . But their first choice is the boss . In assaulting bosses , however , a newspaper must look carefully to its ammunition , and to the order and interrelation of its salvos . There is such a thing , at the start , as overshooting the mark , and the danger thereof is very serious . The people must be aroused by degrees , gently at first , and then with more and more ferocity . They are not capable of reaching the maximum of indignation at one leap : even on the side of pure emotion they have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because even emotion must have a quasi-intellectual basis , because even indignation must arise out of facts . One fact at a time ! If a newspaper printed the whole story of a political boss 's misdeeds in a single article , that article would have scarcely any effect whatever , for it would be far too , long for the average reader to read and absorb . He would never get to the end of it , and the part he actually traversed would remain muddled and distasteful in his memory . Far from arousing an emotion in him , it would arouse only ennui , which is the very antithesis of emotion . He can not read more than three columns of any one subject without tiring : 6,000 words , I should sat- , is the extreme limit of his appetite . And the nearer he is pushed to that limit , the greater the strain upon his psychic digestion . He can absorb a single capital fact , leaping from a headline , at one colossal gulp ; but he could not down a dissertation in twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it deal with a single and capital fact . It must be McGinnis Steals $1,257,867.25 , ' not McGinnis Lacks Ethical Sense . ' Moreover , a newspaper article which presumed to tell the whole of a thrilling story in one gargantuan installment would lack the dynamic element , the . quality of mystery and suspense . Even if it should achieve the miracle of arousing the reader to a high pitch of excitement , it would let him drop again next day . If he is to be kept in his frenzy long enough for it to be dangerous to the common foe , he must be led into it gradually . The newspaper in charge of the business must harrow him , tease him , promise him , hold him . It is thus that his indignation is transformed from a state of being into a state of gradual and cumulative becoming ; it is thus that reform takes on the character of a hotly contested game , with the issue agreeably in doubt . And it is always as a game , of course , that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim be a political boss , a police captain , a gambler , a fugitive murderer , or a disgraced clergyman , his interest in it is almost purely a sporting interest . And %  | the intensity of that interest , of course , depends upon the fierceness of the clash . The game is fascinating in proportion as the morally pursued puts up a stubborn defense , and in proportion as the newspaper directing the pursuit is resourceful and merciless , and in proportion as the eminence of the quarry is great and his resultant downfall spectacular . A war against a ward boss seldom attracts much attention , even in the smaller cities , for he is insignificant to begin with and an inept and cowardly fellow to end with ; but the famous war upon William M. Tweed shook the whole nation , for he was a man of tremendous power , he was a brave and enterprising antagonist , and his fall carried a multitude of other men with him . Here , indeed , was sport royal , and the plain people took to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manacled , the show is over , and the people take no further interest in reform . In place of the fallen boss , a so-called reformer has been set up . He goes into office with public opinion apparently solidly behind him : there is every promise that the improvement achieved will be lasting . But experience shows that it seldom is . Reform does not last . The reformer quickly loses his public . His usual fate , indeed , is to become the pet butt and aversion of his public . The very mob that put him into office chases him out of office . And after all , there is nothing very astonishing about this change of front , which is really far less a change of front than it seems . The mob has been fed , for weeks preceding the reformer 's elevation , upon the blood of big and little bosses ; it has acquired a taste for their chase , and for the chase in general ; Now , of &sudden,; it is deprived of that stimulating sport . The old bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belabor and pursue ; the newspapers which elected the reformer are busily apologizing for his amateurish errors , ? a dull and dispiriting business . No wonder it now becomes possible for the old bosses , acting through their inevitable friends on the respectable side , ? the solid ' business men , the takers of favors , the underwriters of political enterprise , and the newspapers influenced by these pious fellows , ? to start the rabble against the reformer . The trick is quite as easy as that but lately done . The rabble wants a good show , a game , a victim : it does n't care who that victim may be . How easy to convince it that the reformer is a scoundrel himself , that he is as bad as any of the old bosses , that he ought to go to the block for high crimes and misdemeanors ! It never had any actual love for him , or even any faith in him ; his election was a mere incident of the chase of his predecessor . No wonder that it falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday ! This is what has happened over and over again in every large Amefican city ? Chicago , New York , St. Louis , Cincinnati , Pittsburg , New Orleans , Baltimore , San Francisco , St. Paul , Kansas City . Every one of these places has had its melodramatic reform campaigns and its inevitable reactions . The people have leaped to the overthrow of bosses , and then wearied of the ensuing tedium . A perfectly typical slipping back , to be matched in a dozen other cities , is going on in Philadelphia to-day . Mayor Rudolph Blankenberg , a veteran warhorse of reform , came into office through the downfall of the old bosses , a catastrophe for which he had labored and agitated for more than thirty years . But now the old bosses are getting their revenge by telling the people that he is a violent and villainous boss himself . Certain newspapers are helping them ; they have concealed but powerful support among  | financiers and business men ; volunteers have even come forward from other cities ? for example , the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely this insidious campaign is making itself felt ; the common people show signs of yearning for another auto-du-P . Mayor Blankenberg , unless I am the worst prophet unhung , will meet with an overwhelming defeat in 1915 . And it will be a very difficult thing to put even a halfdecent man in his place : the victory of the bosses will be so nearly complete that they will be under no necessity of offering compromises . Employing a favorite device of political humor , they may select a harmless blank cartridge , a respectable numskull , what is commonly called a perfumer . But the chances are that they will select a frank ringster , and that the people will elect him with cheers . Such is the ebb and flow of emotion in the popular heart ? or perhaps , if we would be more accurate , the popular liver . It does not constitute an intelligible system of morality , for morality , at bottom , is not at all an instinctive matter , but a purely intellectual matter : its essence is the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate desire to the distant aim . But such as it is , it is the only system of morality that the emotional majority is capable of comprehending and practicing ; and so the newspapers , which deal with majorities quite as frankly as politicians deal with them , have to admit it into their own system . That is to say , they can not accomplish anything by talking down to the public from a moral plane higher than its own : they must take careful account of its habitual ways of thinking , its moral thirsts and prejudices , its well-defined limitations . They must remember clearly , as judges and lawyers have to remember it , that the morality subscribed to by that public is far from the stern and arctic morality of professors of the science . On the contrary , it is a mellower and more human thing ; it has room for the antithetical emotions of sympathy and scorn ; it makes no effort to separate the criminal from his crime . The higher moralities , running up to that of Puritans and archbishops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temptation ; they hold it to be no defense of a ballot-box stuffer , for example , that he had scores of accomplices and that he is kind to his little children . But the popular morality regards such a defense as sound and apposite ; it is perfectly willing to convert a trial on a specific charge into a trial on a general charge . And in giving judgment it is always ready to let feeling triumph over every idea of abstract justice ; and very often that feeling has its origin and support , not in matters actually in evidence , but in impressions wholly extraneous and irrelevant . - Hence the need of a careful and wary approach in all newspaper crusades , particularly on the political side . On the one hand , as I have said , the astute journalist must remember the public 's incapacity for taking in more than one thing at a time , and on the other hand , he must remember its disposition to be swayed by mere feeling , and its habit of founding that feeling upon general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this means that the campaign against a given malefactor must begin a good while before the capital accusation ? that is , the accusation upon which a verdict of guilty is sought ? is formally brought forward . There must be a shelling of the fortress before the assault ; suspicion must precede indignation . If this preliminary work is neglected or ineptly performed , the  | result is apt to be a collapse of the campaign . The public is not ready to switch from confidence to doubt on the instant ; if its general attitude toward a man is sympathetic , that sympathy is likely to survive even a very vigorous attack . The accomplished mob-master lays his course accordingly . His first aim is to arouse suspicion , to break down the presumption of innocence ? supposing , of course , that he finds it to exist . He knows that he must plant a seed , and tend it long and lovingly , before he may pluck his dragon-flower . He knows that all storms of emotion , however suddenly they may seem to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their gathering is really a slow , slow business . I mix the figures shamelessly , as mob-masters mix their brews ! It is this persistence of an attitude which gives a certain degree of immunity to all newcomers in office , even in the face of sharp and resourceful assault . For example , a new president . The majority in favor of him on Inauguration Day is usually overwhelming , no matter how small his plurality in the November preceding , for common selfrespect demands that the people magnify his virtues : to deny them would be a confession of national failure , a destructive criticism of the Republic . And that benignant disposition commonly survives until his first year in office is more than half gone . The public prejudice is wholly on his side : his critics find it difficult to arouse any indignation against him , even when the offenses they lay to him are in violation of the fundamental axioms of popular morality . This explains why it was that Mr. Wilson was so little damaged by the charge of federal interference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence brought forward , and involving a serious violation of popular no- tions of virtue . And this explains , too , why he survived the oratorical pilgrimages of his Secretary of State at a time of serious international difficulty ? pilgrimages apparently undertaken with his approval , and hence at his political risk and cost . The people were still in favor of him , and so he was not brought to irate and drum-head judgment . No roar of indignation arose to the heavens . The opposition newspapers , with sure instinct , felt the irresistible force of public opinion on his side , and so they ceased their clamor very quickly . But it is just such a slow accumulation of pin-pricks , each apparently harmless in itself , that finally draws blood ; it is by just such a leisurely and insidious process that the presumption of innocence is destroyed , and a hospitality to suspicion created . The campaign against Governor Sulzer in New York offers a classic example of this process in operation , with very skillful gentlemen , journalistic and political , in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally brought to impeachment were not launched at him out of a clear sky , nor while the primary presumption in his favor remained unshaken . Not at all . They were launched at a carefully selected and critical moment ? at the end , to wit , of a long and well-managed series of minor attacks . The fortress of his popularity was bombarded a long while before it was assaulted . He was pursued with insinuations and innuendoes ; various persons , more or less dubious , were led to make various charges , more or less vague , against him ; the managers of the campaign sought to poison the plain people with doubts , misunderstandings , suspicions . This effort , so diligently made , was highly successful ; and so the capital charges , when they were brought forward at last , had the effect of confirm- 296 NEWSPAPE  | ations , of corroborations , of proofs . But , if Tammany had made them during the first few months of Governor Sulzer 's term , while all doubts were yet in his favor , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ground had to be prepared ; the public mind had to be put into training . The end of my space is near , and I find that I have written of popular morality very copiously , and of newspaper morality very little . But , as I have said before , the one is the other . The newspaper must adapt its pleading to its clients ' moral limitations , just as the trial lawyer must adapt his pleading to the jury 's limitations . Neither may like the job , but both must face it to gain a larger end . And that end , I believe , is a worthy one in the newspaper 's case quite as often as in the lawyer 's , and perhaps far oftener . The art of leading the vulgar , in itself , does no discredit to its practitioner . Lincoln practiced it unashamed , and so did Webster , Clay , and Henry . What is more , these men practiced it with frank allowance for the naivete of the people they presumed to lead . It was Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a homely way with him , that he could reduce complex problems to the simple terms of popular theory and emotion , that he did not ask little fishes to think and act like whales . This is the manner in which the newspapers do their work , and in the long run , I am convinced , they accomplish far more good than harm thereby . Dishonesty , of course , is not unknown among them : we have newspapers in this land which apply a truly devilish technical skill to the achievement of unsound and unworthy ends . But not as many of them as perfectionists usually allege . Taking one with another , they strive in the right direction . They realize the massive fact that the plain people , for all @# their poverty of wit , can not be fooled forever . They have a healthy fear of that heathen rage which so often serves their uses . Look back a generation or two . Consider the history of our democracy since the Civil Var . Our most serious problems , it must be plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deafening newspaper urging and , clamor . Men have been washed into office on waves of emotion , and washed out again in the same manner . Measures and policies have been determined by indignation far more often than by cold reason . But is the net result evil ? Is there even any permanent damage frc. a those debauches of sentiment in which the newspapers have acted insincerely , unintelligently , with no thought save for the show itself ? I doubt it . The effect of their long and melodramatic chase of bosses is an undoubted improvement in our whole governmental method . The boss of to-day is not an envied first citizen , but a criminal constantly on trial . He is debarred himself from all public offices of honor , and his control over other public officers grows less and less . Elections are no longer boldly stolen ; the humblest citizen may go to the polls in safety and cast his vote honestly ; the machine grows less dangerous year by year ; perhaps it is already less dangerous than a camorra of utopian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official morality which actually rises above our private morality . Bribetakers are sent to jail by the votes of jurymen who give presents in their daily business , and are not above beating the street-car company . And so , too , in narrower fields . The white-slave agitation of a year or so ago was ludicrously extravagant and emotional , but its net effect is a better conscience , a new alertness . The news-t  | papers discharged broadsides of 12-inch guns to bring down a flock of buzzards ? but they brought down the buzzards . They have libeled and lynched the police ? but the police are the better for it . They have represented salicylic acid as an elder brother to bichloride of mercury ? but we are poisoned less than we used to be . They have lifted the plain people to frenzies of senseless terror over drinking-cups and neighbors with coughs ? but the death-rate from tuberculosis declines . They have railroaded men to prison , denying them all their common rights ? but fewer malefactors escape today than yesterday . The way of ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mathematical pun , a sort of drunken hyperbola . But if we thus move onward and upward by leaps and bounces , it is certainly better than not moving at all . Each time , perhaps , we slip back , but each time we stop at a higher level . @#
