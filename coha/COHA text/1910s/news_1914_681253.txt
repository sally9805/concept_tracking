txt Street Cleaning Commissioner Fetherston replied ? yesterday to the charge made by William Bullock of the new Bureau of City Inquiry that the city paid excessive rates to the contractors last Winter for removing snow . Some trucks , Mr. Bullock said , earned from $30 to $100 a day removing snow , while the city regularly paid $5 to $6 a day , or a maximum of $42 a week , for trucks . Commissioner Fetherston said Mr. Bullock overlooked the , fact that the contractors Were paid not only for trucking the snow , but for piling , picking ice , loading , and dumping . The present snow-removal contract , the Commissioner said , was based on a charge for removing a cubic yard of snow . The Belmont Contracting Company , in which the Bradley brothers and others were interested , obtained a contract for the entire Borough of Manhattan for 56 cents a cubic yard . The company , the Commissioner said , entered into sub-contracts for different parts of the borough , and what the subcontract prices were the Commissioner did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cubic yard . which covered both the short and long haul work , one offsetting the other . Mr. Bullock , he said , particularly referred in his criticism to the short-haul work , where the maximum number of loads was made operatinfvnear the river . e rounci , ' ? said the Commissioner , " on a tabulation of the number of loads removed in the first snowstorm that the average day 's work for a truck was ten and a half loads . Assuming a truck of five yards ' capacity . the total amount would be fifty-one cubic yards . At the contract price , this would make $28.56. including piling , loading , dumping , and supervision . Regarding his connection with Mr. Bullock , Commissioner Fetherston said : Mr. Bullock , who. until Jan. lb , worked with me in the efficiency staff of the Board of Estimate , came to me several times during the last few months to discuss snow removal matters . I told him very freely that we were not at all satisfied with our present snow removal methods . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as he could . and gave him a number of suggestions for investigation . We shall be glad to receive Mr. Bullock 's complete report . All that I have seen of it up to date is what has appeared in the newspapers . " Mr. Bullock calls attention to a number of difficulties involved in removing snow . The principal difficulty is to organize a large force on short notice and to pay for this force promptly , as we must , on a fair basis . A good deal of thought has been given to this . Last Winter special precautions were taken . to secure honesty and fairness . All wagons were measured by the Bureau of Weights and Measures . The loading and trucking were under the supervision of the department 's Inspectors and special Inspectors assigned by the IDeDartment of Finance . A staff of inIvestlgators of the Commissioner of Accounts office was kept in the field during snow removal time to detect any irregularities and report their observations to the Street Cleaning Commissioner . Two special staffs of private ( detective agencies were engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given by the Bureau of Municipal Research . " I am just as anxious as Mr. Bullock is to cut down the earnings of the trucks , and with this in view I have been spending a good deal of time the past few months preparing for next year 's work . The only way to cut down truck earnings is to get rid of the snow without trucking This I propose to do to the greatest possible extent by using the sewers . A plan for next year 's snow removal has already been worked out and submitted to the Mayor . We have received no suggestions from Mr. Bullock on how to better the conditions he is so concerned about , but if he has any to make , I shall be very glad to entertain them . " Commissioner Fetherston said that while 56 cents a cubic yard was perhaps too high , contractors who had bid for lower amounts In other years had defaulted on their contracts . " It is more than I want to pay for removing snow . " said the Commissioner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get our new methods into operation , but the contract in force was entered into in July , 1913 . All the talk about the earnings of the trucks is mere headline stuff . It does not mean anything when we come to analyze it , except the one single fact that perhaps the rate a cubic yard paid by the city is too high . We paid for getting rid of the snow . What individual trucks earn is a matter between the truck owner and the contractor . I intend to go Into Mr. Bullock 's charges very carefully , as I have already investigated other allegations that we were outdone by the sub-contractors. ' '
