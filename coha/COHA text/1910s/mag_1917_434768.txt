To many of his readers Nietzsche is simply a writer of aphorisms that express his passing moods . He is a skeptic from this point of view concerning all ultimate truths . On occasion , as his own words indicate , he doubts altoget her the value of truth . Life is experience or activity . Man lives to express himself , not to conform to something not himself . As.a fact , there are expressions of Nietzsche which arc distinctly in this spirit . But to others of his readers and commentators Nietzsche is the expositor of a system . The difficulty of maintaining this thesis is the difficulty of extracting from his aphorisms any one consistent whole doctrine . Consequently , those who go to Niet'zsche for positive teaching of permanent thought vary greatly in their interpretation of what is fundamental for his thought . The freedom of the writer of aphorisms is not only dangerous in itself , but misleading to the reader who is in search of permanent instruction such as he ran restate or apply .

With Walt Whitman he has not a few features of ideal and of doctrine in common . But in any case , like both Emerson and Walt Whitman , Nietzsche feels perfectly free to follow the dialectic of his own mental development , to contradict . himself , or , as Walt Whitman said , ' to contain milli it tides . ' On the other hand those misinterpret Nietzsche entirely who conceive the prime motive of his teaching as sensualism , or as the love of self-indulgence , or as pride , or as any form of merely self-cent red narrowness . Ile is an individualist , without . question . His ideal of life belongs among the many well-known forms of ethical Titanism .

Faust , Cain , Manfred , and the other heroes of individualism in the literature of ideals , must first conic to mind , that one may see to what vast constellation this star of Nietzsche 's belongs ; although one would go wrong , and seriously wrong , if one identified the ideal or the problem of Nietzsche with those which these names suggest . The interest of the man lies just in the fact that he is not merely an individualist , but a very original one , adding to the well-known forms of the Titanic ideal a distinctly new one . The central motive of Nietzsche seems to me to be this . It is clear to him that the moral problem concerns the perfection , not of society , not of the masses of men , but of the great individual . And so far he , indeed , stands where the standard of individualistic revolt has so often been raised . But Nietzsche differs from other individualists in that the great object toward which his struggle is directed is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Titan of the type of Goethe 's or Shelley 's Prometheus proclaims his right to be free of Zeus and of all other powers . But by hypothesis Prometheus already knows who Ile is and what he wants . But the probkin of Nietzsche is , above all , the problem , Who am I ? and , That do I want ? What is clear to him is the need of strenuous activity in pressing on toward the solution of this problem . His aristocratic consciousness is the sense that common men arc in no wise capable of putting or of appreciating this question . His assertion of the right of the individual to be free from all external restraints is the ardent revolt of the strenuous seeker for selfhood against whatever hinders Min in his task . He will not be interrupted by the base universe in the business ? his life-business ? of finding out what his own life is to mean for himself . He knows that his own will is , above all , what lie calls the will for power . On occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in ideal , whoever shall hind ? r him in his work . But the problem on which he agonizes is the inner problem . What does this will that seeks power genuinely desire ? What is the pcm er that is worthy to be mine ? Nietzsche 's contempt for popular morality is , therefore , only to be understood as a hatred for the spiritlessnes , for the submissiveness , and , as he some . times adds , for the treachery that seelo ; to avoid conflict , to escape from life ' , ; strenuous task , and to use the wiles , , 1 the morality of pity and human kindliness as a means for disarming the stronger and for leveling life to the commonplace . But it is unfair to interpret the austere , the unpitiful , the stern elements of Nietzsche 's ethical doctrine , as themselves the expression of his central interest . If he is unpitiful he is so , most of all , toward himself . If he makes light of human suffering , it is above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In seeking self-expression , mastery , might , he is seeking somethiihf , above all internal , perfectly consistent , with the utmost sensitiveness to the pathos of life , and to the needs of humanity . If Nietzsche would sacrifice ordinary human interest and lives to the higher individuality , it is his first purpose to appeal to individual men as they are to sacrifice themselves to this higher selfhood . In the often-quoted introductory speech of Nietzsche 's Zarathustra , to the people , this view of die ideal is ' expressed in classic ; form . In this sense Nietzsche 's doctrine is unquestionably not merely an individualism . Even against his will doctrine , as soon as articulated , has the universality of a Kant Ian categori2 cal imperative . Nothing is worthy of expression but the ideal individuality . Therefore the first task of every human being is indeed to revolt against tradition , but still more to revolt against his own narrowness and pettiness of sentiment , and to prepare for a sacrifice of what is dearest to his sentiment in order that he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ideal individual is to mean . It is in the light of these considerations that we are able to get the most general perspective of Nietzsche 's ethical doctrine . The values of life are internal values . In your heart are the issues of your own life . Whoever has inflicted upon you the law from without has degraded your moral individuality . If you have accepted this law merely as it came to you , and because it came to you , you are one of the slaves . You are the mere material to be used up in the process of humanity 's higher growth . And the morality of Nietzsche treats you , in so far as you are contented with your lot , or are willing to remain the slave of your ethical destiny and of your religious tradition , with aristocratic contempt . But does his appeal awaken you , then you are one of those who may take part in the task of aiming toward the higher individuality . You then become conscious that your will is the will for power . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is self-possession . You do not possess this power unless you are able to endure any degree of suffering and sacrifice of sentiment for the sake of discovering your meaning and your selfhood . Woe unto those that are at ease in this new Zion ! Nietzsche 's virtue has this at least in common with Christian charity , that it . suffereth long , even if it appears rather unkind . Unsparing you are , but least of all do you spare what is commonplace about yourself . Ye have made your way from worm to man , and Much within you is still worm . Once ye were apes ; even now man is ape in a higher degree than any ape . Behold , I teach you beyond man . ' II Of all Nietzsche 's writings the book called Thus Spoke Zarathustra is evidently the most frequently read , though also in some respects the most mysterious and t he most in need of a commentary . Nietzsche 's choice of a name for his ideal hero has nothing to do with an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian Zoroaster , whose name is thus employed . Zarathustra has in common with the Persian seer the tendency to think out his doctrine in solitude . The original Zoroaster notoriously made use of the fundamental contrast between a good and an evil principle . Nietzsche 's Zoroaster is to overcome on a higher level the very oppositions on which the original doctrine of the Persian depended . These considerations , together with a good many oriental associations and the general desire to depict the career of the founder of a new faith , are responsible for the choice of the hero 's name . Zarathustra is in part an idealized Nietzsche , in part the type of a hero whose existence must be conceived as a dim future possibility , for which the humanity of to-day is not worthily prepared . Long years of loneliness separate hint from human kind . Communion with the secrets of nature , and with his own heart , has given him a higher wisdom . The negative part of his wisdom is summed up in the first article of his creed , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to live on I lie earth and under earthly conditions without any of the hope with which an older supernaturalism had surrounded his life . The positive aspect of this creed is summed up in t he first place in the doctrine of the Superman . The Superman is defined sometimes as an inevitably coming being , a product such as the doctrine of evolution requires us to anticipate . He Will not C0010 on earth as a result of any mir- le . lie Will be related to man as man now is to the apes . The senselessness of our present human exist ence is justifiable only as a transition stage on the way to 1.11e Superman . Man , ' says Zara thus Ira , is it something that shall be surpassed . What have ye clone to surpass him ? ' But Nietzsche has no means of giving a scientific proof that the Superman must come . Nor as it skeptic is he able at all permanently to maintain the theoretical probability of any one outcome of the evolutionary process rather than another . The Superman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal , the vision of the individual that should be . That he will come to exist we know not . But our wills shall say , Let him . come to existence . By this ideal we give sense to our life . And because the Superman is an ideal and not a definitely expected product : - of a nature process , the sense that this ideal gives to our lives conies through an imi tation of this deliberately created concept of the perfect individual , but still more through a determination restlessly to labor upon the task of creating the concept . The follower of Zarathustra has , therefore , no one fixed gospel preached to him . He must learn the dream and the interpretation thereof . Or , rather , he must learn , as it were , the art of heroic dreaming , and the art of living beyond every dream to a still higher ideal . Discontent is thus the constant accompaniment of Zarathustra 's life and doctrine . But . it is not it dreary discontent . Although it involves much suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it self-conlichen t discontent . In the ( Ileraclitean world of the higher individuality , where all is in flow , there appears at first to be nothing permanent but the law of the search ) Yet beyond all the seeking Zarathustra desires in the end , indeed , to define the law of life in terms that shall not k , subject to the endless flow . IA ke Heraclitusi , ) Zarathustra hopes to find what is perinahent about this search for t he higher individuality in the form of an absolute law to which all t he apparently endless changes of the individual in the search for his ideal shall be subject . And the definition of this absolute law occurs to him in terms which had acquired a strange and decidedly fantastic significance in the mind of Nietzsche . There was an hypothesis with which Nietzsche evidently played for years and which also obviously had a somewhat pat hological tendency to beset his imagination . This was the hypothesis , well known to human imagination ever since Pythagorean days , of the fatal tendency of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , of all its conflicts , ideals , evolutionary processes , and individual occurrences . The notion that countless times this precise thing has happened before , oc- NIETZSCHE curred to the Pythagoreans in ancient . Greek thought , for reasons which probably had something to do with astronomical observations and astrological speculation . This notion became an important part of Nietzsche 's Own teaching , and of that of Zarathustra , because of its relat ions  --  relit ions not . by ' any means superficial or insignifiant to his conception of the ethical problem . Seldom has a purely fantastic freak of the imagination stood in a more interesting relation to a profound problem of the formulation of an ethical ideal . Zarathust ra has at once to follow and to define the ideal . The ideal is t hat of he perfect individual . The perfect individual is to be self-contained , a law unto himself , no follower of God ( ir of man , no recognizer of any rule t hat . is imposed upon him from without . Yet the perfect individual is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist ence is through and through strenuous . His every act is a transition , Be cares not whet her such act proves even to be a self-destruct ion , if only he may escape from lower ideals . The one thing that he can not tolerate is commonplaceness , vulgarity , or mere content with convention , with tradition , with circumstance . Yet Nietzsche is equally conscious , and Zarathustra wills him , that the higher life must be , not . only a striving , but an experience ; not only strenuousness , but an accomplishment ; not only an endless spiritual agility , but an enjoyment of perfection ; not only a heroism , but a self-possession . For were the higher life not all of these things , wherein would consist the meaning of the struggle , since neither heavenly joys nor the will of the gods , neither Nirvana nor the beatific vision , can be admitted into the doctrine to give purpose to life ? If this infinite flow has not its meaning beyond itself , in heaven , or in that slavish service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every stage of the process one finds not hing but a passing on to the next , what is t he signilicance of t he whole process ? The answer to t his question is given in terms of t he fantastic hypothesis of the eternal recurrence of every even ( in the world , and thus the hypothesis in detail assert s that life in its wholeness , with h all its struggles expressed , with all its fate completely worked out , with all its individuality finally embodied , is present , not only once , but endlessly numerous limes , in the course of infinite time . The idea thus suggested , mystical as it essentially is , is Nietzsche 's equivalent ( In his closing periodior wha t t he religiouS consciousness had formerly sought in the concept ion of a divine plan of die universe . The conception is mystical because Nietzsche can grasp it only by intuition , and can give only the most insufficient reason for his belief . It appeals to him partly because it is unconventional , is no article of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of things , and with the existence of a world of rigid law . It is comfort ing to him as well as terrible . On the one hand , it comes to hint with a pat hological insistence and forms part of his suspicious attitude toward life . It is conceived as a blind necessity inflicting itself upon the world-order . On the other hand , the same thought . long dwelt upon becomes at length pleasurable . One had feared it , because it seemed to make all endeavor vain . One accepts it in t he end because it somehow assures its that all t he problems of life are worked out and have been worked out endlessly oft en heretofore . In the ceaseless change to which hot experience and our self-crit icisni expose us , we look in vain for a final stale for I he sake of which life may exist and in the light of which it may be just ified . Nietzsche 's thought is that the justification of life must be the whole of life , for life is everywhere a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial solution , or from the outworn to the new . In the whole circle of the world-life , granted only that the circle is a closed one , every possible transition from a lower to a higher , every possible facing of a problem , every possible transition from old to new must have been accomplished . In the mysterious conversation with his own spirit which Zarathustra typifies as a meeting with a certain dwarf who personifies all his own weakness and temptation , Nietzsche 's ideal hero thus narrates his view of the meaning of the eternal recurrence . The dwarf of the story , Zarathustra 's baser self , scorning his aspiration , whispers , " fhou stone of wisdom , thou throwest thyself high up , but every stone thrown must fall . Condemned unto thyself and thine own stoning , 0 Zarathustra , far thou threwest the stone indeed , but it will fall back upon thyself. " f hat is , in substance , this restless idealism , this search for the absolute individuality , is self-defeating . The task has to begin always afresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zarathustra 's world there is no God in whom the self should find its goal . The Sisyphus task of seeking the perfect is essentially vain . And thus the tempter dwarf expresses what is indeed the obvious problem of every untrammeled individualism . ' But , ' Zarathustra tells us , ' a thing is within nw ? I call it courage . It bath hitherto slain every evil mood of mine . This courage bade me at last stand still and say , " Dwarf , thou or I " ; for courage is the best murderer , courage that attacked/ . For in every attack there is the stirring music of battle . ? " Halt , dwarf , " said I , " I ion the stronger of us two . ' thou knowest not mine abyss-like thought . Thou couldst not endure that . " Now there happened to be a gateway where we had to stop . " Look at this gateway , dwarf , " I said . " It hath two faces ; two roads meet here , the ends of which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it streteheth out for an eternity . And that long lane out there , it is another eternity . They contradict each other , these roads ( the past and the future ) , and here at . this gateway they meet . The name of the gateway standeth written above ? l'resent Moment . But whoever would go along either of them and ever further and ever more remote , believest thou , dwarf , that these roads contradict each other eternally ? ? From this gateway called Moment a long eternal lane runneth backward . Behind is lieth an eternity . Must not all that can run of things have run already through this lane ? Must not what can happen of things have happened , have been done , have run past here already ? And when everything has already existed , what ( lost thou , 0 dwarf , think of this moment ? Must not this gateway already have been there ? And arc not all things so fast linked together that this moment draws after itself all coining things , and so does not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this long way before us ? It must once more occur . And this slow-moving spider that creeps in yonder moonlight , and this moonlight itself , and thou and I in the gateway whispering together about eternal things , must we not all have already existed ? And must we not come again and run our course in that other lane , out there before us in that long-haunted lane ? ' The thought thus expressed is ambiguously stated so far as concerns its significance for the speaker . The vision of the conversation with the dwarf is at once one of terror and of courage . 1n characteristic tic fashion Zarathustra opposes to the thought of the tempter , that all is vanity because nothing can be accomplished , the other thought that all which is possible has already been numberless times accomplished . But this thought , too , suggests vanity . The striving soul demands novelty . The individual shudders before this abyss of fate which yawns at his feet . Yet , as Nietzsche frequently says , it is the business of man to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear them . The reaction from this terror at the haunted way of life comes when one remembers that the closed circle of eternal life is one of significant striving , and that therefore the very closing of the circle involves the completion of the striving . The wanderer in life 's wil- derness sees no shining light of an eternal city beyond him . his home is in wandering . He has not the romantic sent imentality , but he certainly has the deep restlessness of the hero of Schubert 's Wanderer ' a Song . Nietzsche will have him learn courage and absolute endurance in his wandering . And the courage is to result from the very facing of this most abysmal thought , that t he wandering as a whole is one completed expression of an endlessly restless , but still in each of its cycles perfect ly self-expressed , life . With this thought in mind Nietzsche t henceforth is able to speak of eternity as his delight and his goal . The deepest problem of life becomes the at tainment of sufficient courage to endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series of struggle the complete life has to be expressed . If this moment has its fixed place in the cycle that expresses the whole meaning of life , then one can return to a delight in t he present for its own sake , which will reconcile the strenuousness of Nietzsche 's ideal with the joyousness , with the nalvet.6 in accepting experience , which is also one of his essential natives . The joy of life returns when one has become convinced that the goal of life is not something utterly un- . determined , but absolutely predetermined . The lesson of the experience has also for Nietzsche its general aspect . Ills constant teaching is , if you have any insistent horror , conquer it by facing it and thinking it out . If fate besets you , make what seems fate also appear to you as your own deed . If you have any evil thought , make it a part of your free self by expressing once for all its whole meaning . Do not . suppress your weaknesses . Build your strength upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the so-called evil element of your nature . It is to be won over to the serv ice of perfection even by being fearlessly accepted , worked out , and thereby conquered . HI The two doctrines , that of the Superman and that . of the eternal recurrence , constitute the central contents of the creed of Zarathustra , You do not know what the concrete purpose in life of the Superman will be if ever he collies to exist , but you already begin to work his will in seeking for 111111 . In attempting to define his purpose you raise the whole , question , so fundamental in our actual life , of the meaning and purpose of individual existence . Nietzsche differs from traditionalism of all kinds , and agrees , 1 should say , with the loftiest idealism , when he declines to accept his ethical individual as something whose character is for us men now predetermined , or to be accepted ready made . Those who say that the ideal character has already been embodied , that what . I aol to be is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no support from Nietzsche . In this respect , I should say , Nietzsche is indeed at one with the very idealism whose philosophical expression , as it had been attempted in earlier German thought , he so vigorously rejected . Herein lies his highest value as a stimulating critic of life ; and that value , as I must repeat , allies him to Emerson , to Walt Whitman , and to other apostles of a higher fiber ( y and assailants of a stereotyped ideal . For Nietzsche there is no one way of salvation except the way of being different from every other individual and complete in yourself . There is no doubt . that , from the point . of view of a more systematic idealism , Nietzsche appears as entirely failing to see the organic character of the true life of coiiperating individuals . The great problem of reconciling the unique individual with the world-order is simply not . Nietzsche 's problem . One must not go to him for light upon that subject . Therein lies his perfectly obvious limitation . Yet there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper idealism , that this grave problem can be solved only upon the basis of the clearest knowledge , iweeisely that upon which Nietzsche insists  --  namely , the uniqueness of the life of every individual and the genuineness of the duty of every soul to seek it s own type of salvation . That its own type of salvation will as a fact involve a higher coiipera1 ion with all other individuality , is indeed true , and it is a truth that you can not learn from Niel zsche . But , I do not object to the musician because he is linable to carve for me statues or to build me cathedrals . Nietzsche understands that the tut of life is the struggle , the endeavor , t he courage , and incidentally the delight fulness of experience which enables the free soul in its best moments to take delight in the very tasks that its skepticism and its self-criticism seem to make so endless , and in one aspect so hopeless . 13e dissatisfied with yourself , and yet assert yourself . Believe nothing , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cultivate your intuitions even while suspecting them : these are some of Nietzsche 's precepts . And whoever comprehends their problem of individuality will thank him for them . In the light of this essentially fluent conception of the Superman much that , is paradoxical in Nietzsche 's expression becomes in general intelligible . He notoriously calls himself an immoralist . But by morality he means conventional morality . And his contention is in this respect not different in principle from the well-known contention of Kant , according to which what Kant calls het eronomy is ethically intolerable . What . will can I follow but my own ? The ethical problem is to find on t what my will is . Nietzsche , indeed , rejects every statical concept of the content of the ideal . Any finished creed as to what an individual ought to be at once arouses his spiritual repugnance He is up and away long before any such ideal can be sufficiently expressed to will Oven a fair hearing . What . we have called the spiritual agility of the self as Nietzsche conceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . : - 'try brother , when thou bast a virtue , and it is t. ly virtue , thou best it in common with nobody . To be sure , thou dcsirest to call it by name and to caress it and to amuse thyself with it . And lid I hereupon thou best its /lament common with the people . Thou bast become people and herd with thy virtue . Better were iL if thou shouldst say , Unspeakable and nameless is that which maketh my sours pain and sweetness , and that is mine inmost hunger .

And from this time forth nothing evil groweth out of thee unless it be the evil that groweth out of the struggle of thy virtues . ' in the Zarathustra , from which I quote these words , t here now follows a characteristic passage concerning the struggles and the mutual jealousies of precisely the virtues that have been thus characterized . And the picture of triumph and of inner selfhood that has just been suggested is at once clouded by the observation that every such relative state of inner perfection is in us transient , dialectical , self-destructive . The immediate conclusion is , ' Alan is something that must be surpassed . And therefore love thy virtues ; for thou shalt perish from them . ' The other and fantastic thought of the eternal recurrence ? that thought which we have just . expounded ? is , as one now sees , the almost inevitable counterpart and foil of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tting every form of absoluteness except such as seems to him consistent with . necessary laws of nature and with the endless flow of things , Nietzsche still needs the restful pole in the flight . of phenomena of which Schiller speaks . Ile quite as much needs something eternal and dividing , to give significance to his struggle for individuality , as he would need if he were a devout believer in traditional creeds . Nietzsche 's fantastic thought is , however , much deeper than its mere appearance would suggest . As a fact , a concept of ethical individuality must . be just to the endless pursuit of goals of which every strenuous life consists . I must also be just to our requirements that there shall he a finished ideal despite the fact that you can not find anywhere in the series of life 's facts the expression of this ideal in a stat ic form . It must also be just to the consideration which so many religions have neglected , namely that the true goal of life is the whole of life and not any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inclusion in a richer life , and not an excision of ills from life . The deepest question of an ethical idealism is the problem whether life in any sense constitutes a significant whole , and whether this wholeness has a determinate and individual character . Now Nietzsche is well aware of this problem . It . can be solved neither by the theory that there is , once for all , a substantial individual soul having its permanent static character which our ideal life merely portrays in successive deeds , nor yet by the doctrine that the moral law is something merely static or abstractly universal . The individualand significant wholeness of our life must depend upon something which is not now completely expressed , but which , on t he of her hand , is in no sense a static substance , but something now in the making . The whole meaning of life turns upon the question whether our life in its entirety constitutes one drama .

And how should the good be won through the mere nourishing of the weaklings ? The strong man may be , indeed , kindly and courteous and humane .

Nietzsche abounds in paradoxes when he discusses the faith that lies nearest to his own early training and that had obviously most deeply influenced much of his sensibility .

They have developed in the course of history the art of persuading the strong as well as themselves that weakness itself is a yin ! ue , and that all that the weak need ought to be given them by the strong . The result of such morality has been the glorification of the commonplace , the stupid , the spiritless , and the brokenhearted . The doctrine thus indicated in ( .11 , ? briefest way occupies in Nietzsche 's Own mind a place that can be understood only in the light of the central and positive character of his individualism .

But there is that in the original Christian ideal which is not at all foreign to the spirit of Nietzsche 's Zarathustra . Yet the value of this whole discussion , as well as of another work , the so-called Anti-Christ , which Nietzsche wrote just before his final collapse , lies not at all in its value as a fair historical estimate of anybody 's faith , but only in its significance as a series of paradoxical illustrations of Nietzsche 's central problem , the problem of the perfect individual selfhood .

It has been my effort in the foregoing to give some of the impressions of the sense in which these duties can exist for Nietzsche and of the reason why nevertheless he can appear as rebel against convention , as opponent of the faith , as immoralist , as teacher of paradoxes , as austere and self-asserting individualist . As a fact , it is not selfishness in its narrower sense ; it is certainly not sensualism . It is still less any sort of supposably scien ific outcome of Darwinism that characterizes Nietszche . Ile is not it part isan of mere self-will . Ills ideal is not merely that of brute force . Nor yet is it fair to say with Dr. Tine , his translator , that physiological perfection , or the power to survive , is in any sense for him the expression of the ideal . lie proclai us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of will that he is thinking of , much more than athletic skill or any externally visible character . I lis paradoxes constantly insist upon the virtue of power and upon the possession of power as the sum of virtue , but the power of which he is thinking is inner power . Ile despises the commonplace virtues , but that is a whimsical way of expressing his love of absolute perfect ion . Ile can not define what his absolute perfection is , but no one has better expressed in recent times than he the ideal of the search for a consciousness of perfection . He glorifies the aristocratic self ; but the self of which he speaks turns out to be an invisible and ideal self , as unseen as is the risen and ascended Lord of the ancient faith ; as much an object of service as was ever the God against whom Nietzsche revolted .
