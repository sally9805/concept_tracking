It is impossible to sever President Wilson 's appeal to the European belligerents from the pending movement for peace . This at least presented itself to him as the strategic moment . He disclaimed any connection with the " overtures of the Central Powers , " and his note bore evidence of having been written , in good part , some time ago ; but opinion in Europe , and opinion here , has inevitably related the step which he has now taken to the great events of the past week . Whether it would have been wiser for him to make earlier the suggestion which he declared he had " long had it in mind to t , ffer , " it is now vain to discuss . The thing has been done . The President of the United States has thrown all his weight on the side of peace . In his words of appeal , the peoples of Europe will see the desire of this country that a way be found to end the bloodshed and devastation . The President is not intervening . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture , visible across the oceans ; and it is a gesture of peace . Mr. Wilson spoke of his " great object . " This it is needful to hold clearly in mind . M. Gabriel Hanotaux , in his recent discussion in the Revue des Deux Mendes of the aims of the Allies , asserted that they were striving for a " bonne paix " and also for a " bonne Europe . " President Wilson would amend that by adding a " good world . " Beyond the settlement of the present war , he is looking forward to world-agreements which will be a bulwark to the weak , a very shield of justice , and a guarantee , the best that mortal men can frame , of enduring peace . Herein lies the greatest significance of the President 's approach to the warring Powers . He holds before them the hope of a world in which such a war as this can never again be kindled . It is a magnificent aspiration . That is not a militant criticism which the Berlin Vorwarts brings to bear upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seem to carry an extraordinary implication , as when Vorwarts says : " The real reason for his refusal of our offer is that Germany wants to negotiate rather than to surrender unconditionally . " Negotiate rather than surrender is quite a different alternative from negotiating or pressing on to complete victory as the German Government professes to view the situation . And again : " The British Premier has shown the falsity of the allegation that the only obstacles to peace are Germany 's refusal to negotiate and the abandonment of annexations . " Here the abandonment of annexations by Germany is taken for granted as part of the Chancellor 's proposals . If it be recalled that Forwiirts has recently passed from the control of the radical Socialist minority and is now edited under the official censorship of the parliamentary Socialist majority which has stood by the Government from the first , the plaintive tone of the protest is certainly remarkable , if not significant . Paraphrased the two quotations would run as follows : " We want no annexations , we are anxious to negotiate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lipten to us . " Is this the real state of the German mind behind the victor 's chant in tb4 German Government 's offer ? Is it possible to find in Germany 's peace utterances , official and non-official , some basis for conjecture as to the terms Berlin has in mind ? One might try . The note to the Entente Powers declares : " Our aim is neither to shatter nor to annihilate our adversaries . " Now among these adversaries is Servia , as well as Belgium ; taken together with Vorwarts 's disavowal , of plans for annexation , the Chancellor 's statement ought to imply that Servia is not to lose its existence , though it might be punished without being actually shattered or ' annihilated . Just how far that punishment could go , without amounting to annihilation , is probably one of the questions which Germany ; would debate in conference . Only it is obvious that whereas Russia might lose Poland and Lithuania without being shattered , Servia can not lose both Macedonia and Nish without being virtually annihilated . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belgium and Servia and the restoration of the French departments are implied . It is different with Poland . To erect an independent Poland is not to annihilate Russia , on the one hand , and is technically not annexation on the other . Upon such questions the problem of peace may yet centre . A corporal in uniform arising in the House of Commons to urge that the , belligerents be got together for a discussion of possible peace terms  --  this was the remarkable spectacle in the House last week . It was Hastings B. L. Smith , a Liberal member for Northampton , who spoke , clad in khaki , praising the new Prime Minister 's speechbecause he understood it to mean that the door was not closed upon the German proposal . This seemed to him the " best possible answer , " for , in his opinion , if the German proposals should disclose an aggressive purpose , then the German people would realize that they are not bleeding merely for defence . But the striking passage in the corporal 's speech was his deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men in the trenches as to whether or not there should be " a serious effort to get the parties together , then I am certain such a proposition would be carried with substantial unanimity . " Equally bold was his statement that he was " not prepared to face the prospects of a military decision unless there is no way out , " with his protest against the economic strangulation of Germany after the war . So far as the attitude of the soldiers is concerned , Corporal Smith 's position was anticipated by the Manchester Guardian , in these words : There is in this , as in all the countries at war , a great volume of opinion , too little vocal , unfortunately , in favor of a serious effort on the part of European statesmen to put an end to the carnage which is destroying a whole generation of young men who are not in a mood to fight on blindly , lulling and being killed for the sake of fighting . . . . If the armies themselves could speak , this volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is in the homes for which those armies , one and all , are longing . No one can read the account of the condition of the Belgian people , and especially the Belgian children , given in the New York Times by George Barr Baker , of the Commission for Relief in Belgium , without having his heart wrung over so pitiful , so appalling , a spectacle . But wringing of the heart is not , in itself , of any avail . What ought to be brought home to the American people  --  what is brought home to them in such a statement as that of Mr. Baker , if people will but stop to think  --  is that it is easily in our power to rescue these helpless and innocent victims from the worst of their distress , and that we are not doing it . From the Atlantic to the Pacific , from the Great Lakes to the Gulf , this nation has ' sympathized with Belgium , has admired her heroic sacrifice , has been filled with indignation at the cruel wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , except give her material help in a measure anywhere near what is required to meet her direst needs , or anywhere near what it is our plain duty to give . Whether it be $8,000,000 that has been subscribed in America , as Mr. Baker says , or $10,000,000 , as has been stated by others , the amount is paltry . It is unworthy of our position of preeminent wealth , our abounding prosperity , our high professions of humanity ; it makes a shabby showing when compared with that of other countries laboring under the tremendous stress of war . In the discussion of Lloyd George 's programme for speeding up the conduct of the war , the great failure of the Allies , also the principal cause which brought Lloyd George into power , has received very little attention . And that is the actual conduct of the war in the sense of military operations backed up by diplomacy . The fall of the Asquith Ministry was not brought about by a deficiency in men or in munitions or in shipping or the pressing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every one of these fields . It was Rumania that brought about the change in England , and the Rumanian disaster is not to be traced to the problem of men or munitions or ships in England , but to lack of coordination in Allied councils . Did Rumania come into the war too soon , did she send her armies in the wrong direction , was aid promised her and withheld ? The Asquith Cabinet was not the only " debating society " from which the Allied cause has suffered . The Allies have done too much debating among themselves . So far as a coordinated diplomacy of war is concerned , the factor of harmony is not so important now ; there is only Greece left for Allied diplomacy to busy itself about . But unity in the strategic councils of the , Allies is more important than ever . To that task presumably Lloyd George will give his personal and principal attention . It is the Rumanian fiasco which has brought to the fore the importance of men , munitions , food control , shipping . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry of Rumania have gone by the board , and it is now a question of settling down to a long test of endurance . Comprehensive though Lloyd George 's programme may be for the mobilization of England 's resources , it shows in some respects a hesitation to go over entirely to the German system of efficiency as embodied in the recent Civic Conscription bill . The conscription idea is still an exotic in England , and always there is the tendency to see if it can be dispensed with ; as in Lloyd George 's decision to try out the volunteer principle of national war service . More than specific in-novations , it is a speeding up which the new Premier should bring to England 's internal economy , singleness of policy and administration . In the matter of allocating men among army , munitions , and civil labor , for example , numberless local tribunals have followed their own judgment exclusively , with resultant waste ; but the principle itself is not new . The " starring " of men for civic service began early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligent application of accepted principles . Premier Briand made a clear issue between himself and his opponents in the course of the recent debate in the Senate . Charged with lack of energy in the conduct of the war , he replied that the Government had been hampered by the constant supervision to which it has been subjected by the parliamentary committees . The blame thrown by the parliamentary Opposition upon an unwieldy and spiritless Cabinet is thus flung back by the Premier into the face of his accusers . The obvious rejoinder  --  it was made by a critic of the Government  --  is that the previous record of the Ministry has not been such as to invite the delegation of still larger powers to the Cabinet . The situation is different in England , where concentration of power has been demanded by , and granted to , a new Government headed by a man who has been an opponent of his predecessor 's war policies . In France , as the opponents of the Government view the Premier 's argument , the cure for Briand is apparently more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : because of lack of confidence in the personnel of the Cabinet , and because of the deep-rooted tradition which goes back to the great Revolution , that the energies of France best manifest themselves in times of need through the summoning of democratic forces . With regard to the main point of contention in the proposed protocol with Mexico , namely , the withdrawal of Pershing 's forces not earlier than forty days after the signing of the protocol , Carranza 's views are simple . He would rather have Pershing stay forty weeks in Mexico while his Government is haggling for the elimination of the forty days . It is a point of honor which our own State Department may find it difficult to appreciate , and which the facts in Mexico hardly seem to justify ; but that is the Carranza of it . Yet if pride and obstinacy obtain in de-facto headquarters , there is also a sense of prudence ; and thatis manifested in the report that Carranza 's ablest general , Obregon , is about to lay down his duties as Secretary of War for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A smashing campaign against the revival of insurgency in northern Mexico would automatically solve the question at issue between the two Governments . Our own Government is not so concerned with delicate points of " honor " but that the restoration of order in Chihuahua would make an agreement simple by removing the sole reason for Pershing 's presence in Mexico . This is the choice which Carranza must make ; either he must accept the terms of the protocol , or he must lose no time in bringing all the strength he has to bear on the military situation in the North . " Neither Mr. Gross nor Mr. Harding was able to tell the committee how much the system proposed would cost . " Thus concludes the account of a hearing last week on universal compulsory service before the Senate Committee . Neither has anybody else been able to estimate in the remotest degree what the scheme would cost in dollars alone  --  to say nothing of its indirect costs . No one , so far as we are aware , has worked out a plan in detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for drill grounds to accommodate from 700,000 to 900,000 recruits , nor how many millions of dollars would have to go into barracks , supply depots , clothing , guns , sanitary conveniences , and the thousand and one details of permanent camps . Even if the period of drill should be restricted to six or eight months so that tent cities could be made to suffice , the costs would none the less be enormous . No one has even estimated how many officers such a force would require , and where they could be obtained from in the next twenty years no one knows . The peace establishment of the German army called in 1914 for 36,088 officers to 769,938 non-commissioned officers and men ; but the Germans never brought their army up to this strength prior to the war , which began before the last increases could take place . If , as some officers of the War Department say , we should need to train 900,000 a year , we should probably need between 40,000 and 50,000 officers alone , for we have more officers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals for the reorganization of the British Territorial and Yeomanry forces were laid before the House of Commons , every detail was worked out . To date nothing concrete has been laid . before Congress except the suggestion that we adopt the Prussian system of universal service . The bolting of Mann for Speaker by Representative Gardner makes the chances of ' the minority leader very slim . It is a ques-Lion. ' whether , with every Republican voting for him , he could be elevated to the chair ; Clark seems certain to be reelected . But it begins to look as if Mann would have no easy time in retaining his place as head of the minority . Gardner 's opposition is due to Mann 's scandalous support  --  as many others of his own party thought it  --  of the McMemore resolution warning Americans off ships owned in belligerent countries . Whether the action of the Republican leader was dictated by conviction or by " politics " does not greatly matter . It was not the sort of leadership which the Republicans in Congress need . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide still is the gap between the two wings of the party . What happened in the Senate the other day , when half a dozen Republicans refused to ' vote for Gallinger for President pro tern. , even going to the length of putting up a third candidate , may be repeated in the Mouse . Gardner has already started a boom ' for Lenroot , of Wisconsin , a progressive Republican . The contest over the Speakership next year may prove the first battle In the fight for the control of the party in 1920 . What happened in Ohio on November 7 ' may be put most strikingly by saying that Wilson broke Roosevelt 's record of being the only Presidential candidate to poll 600 , - 4100 votes . The President 's total was 604,000 , - which is 4,000 more than the Republican ' vote of 1904 . The figures become even more Impressive by comparison with previous Democratic totals . Wilson polled only 423 , - 1100 in 1912 , which was a drop of no less than 80,000 from the vote for Bryan in 1908 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Presidency , being 26,000 more than Bryan got in 1896 , 28,000 more than he received in 1900 , 99,000 more than Cleveland polled in 1892 , when be won an elector , and 158,000 more than fell to Parker . Hughes succeeded in polling the full Taft-Roosevelt vote and several thousand more , but his total of 515,000 was 57,000 ' below that cast for Taft in 1908 . Wilson , on the other hand , regained the 80,000 Bryanites of 1908 who " struck " in 1912 , bagged 27,000 of the 66,000 Republicans who also disappeared between those two campaigns , and picked up 44,000 voters who had not gone to the polls in 1908 ? many of them , no doubt , first voters , since the . total vote in that year was the largest polled prior to 1916 . Yet Ohio is bounded on the north by Michigan , on the east by Pennsylvania , on the south by West Virginia and Kentucky , and on the west by Indiana ! The one thing of which everybody was sure before the election last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be materially increased over that of a year ago . The only question was whether it would rise high enough to overcome the license vote . But despite the stirring campaign , Billy Sunday , and Foss , not only did the license forces win by an unusually large margin , but the anti-license vote fell off 2,000 . The vote for license rose from 46,000 to 53,000 . The explanation of the result ( lees not lie on the surface . License advocates suggest that the suburban districts , which have banished the saloon from their territory , but which were not so strong last week against license as had been expected , were actuated by fear that a dry city would mean a loss of revenue . But why should this idea have operated this year more effectively than one or two years ago ? It would be a tragedy if the animation which the no-license forces threw into the campaign gave this fear a new reality and so drove away thousands of their former supporters . It is significant , too , that all the stir brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago . Thirty thousand registered voters were content to stay at home . Were they indifferent or are they to be counted on the side of license ? If the latter , why were they willing to take the risk of seeing their cause defeated ? Whatever the explanation , the event is the biggest setback which the prohibition forces have encountered in a long time . Some Congressmen predicted when the Child Labor act was passed that the children would go from the factory " on to the streets . " The Survey predicts that they will largely go from one job to another . The States which the fourteen-year age limit most affects are those with the weakest school laws and the least comprehensive child labor laws . The child who leaves the factory next August will find it easy to obtain a place in a bakery or store . It is now estimated that there will be nearly 40,000 children to leave the mines and factories , most of them living below the Mason and Dixon line . Within the next ten months the Legislatures of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should strengthen their codes in such ways as may be necessary to assure the benefit which the Federal law was designed to bring about . Col. Goethals 's statement that " we are now operating the Panama Canal at less cost than the revenue received " is true ; but operation and maintenance are far from covering all items of expense connected with the Zone . There is the cost of sanitation and government , estimated at a million and a half , the annuity payable to Panama , the amortization fund of one per cent . upon the cost of the canal , and the interest on the $375,000,000 canal investment . Last year the tolls collected amounted to $4,340,000 , as compared with expenses for operating and maintenance of $4,065,000 . The total expense , bringing in commissariat , the Panama Railway and Panama Railway Steamship Line , the government , and so on , but excluding interest and amortization , was roughly $18,250,000 , and the total revenues were roughly $19,250,000 . But the amortization fund and interest together would come to $15,000,000 a year . How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the close of the war , towards making the two sides of the sheet balance when all legitimate items are included in the debit column , is a matter for speculation . It has been computed that by 1925 the tolls may amount to $17,000,000 per year , and this would not quite make up the sum required . Col. Goethals thinks that ocean-going ships would pay the Government nearly a third more if methods of computing tonnage were properly revised ; and certainly a standard method should be enforced for all nations . A moving story of distress from central Alabama , where through flood and boll-weevil the cotton and corn crops were practically failures this year , ought to awaken a response in the North  --  and a prompt response , , for the need is urgent . Even white landlords there are mortgaging their plantations to get food and clothing . Some of the negroes , writes a correspondent to the Montgomery Advertiser , are catching rabbits as a means of sustenance , some are beating the woods for wild nuts to barter for meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not the bedclothes to lie under . On the farms , states the Advertiser editorially , " human beings are experiencing the gnawing pangs of hunger , and men , women , and children are facing freezing weather in a few rags .

Switzerland is the first of the neutral nations officially to come to the support of President Wilson in his effort to bring about peace negotiations . The Swiss Federal Council adheres only in general terms , but makes its action positive and hearty . Other neutral countries are confidently expected to add their approval . There is evidently a stirring in Holland and Scandinavia ; Spain is considering her attitude ; the Vatican is friendly if not yet openly endorsing the President 's move ; it is reported that several of the South American republics will soon add their approval . A model for them all is set by the Swiss Government , which disclaims mediation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , and points to the single great aim , namely , a conferring together of " the peoples now engaged in the struggle , " in the hope of arriving at an agreement to end the war and to " reach a lasting peace . " All this must be gratifying to Mr. Wilson , as must also be the responses which have come to him from his own countrymen . Less pleasing is the mixed reception which his note has had in Germany and in England and France . The first and prevailing impulse of the Allies was to resent the President 's note . This was partly because of its phraseology and partly because of its following up the German offer so quickly . Englishmen and Frenchmen felt that Mr. Wilson was strengthening the hands of Germany . Germans felt so , too , at first . But time has brought a change of opinion . Early impressions in both England and France have been somewhat modified ; while in Germany the Pan-German.ist press and the military party have quite changed front and are now warning against Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really playing their game . How the balance of this foreign judgment will swing in the next few days it is Impossible to foresee . It will be instructive to watch it . The whole uncertainty as to just what the President 's position is does not , it must be confessed , constitute a striking tribute to the care with which his note was drafted . It was not so accurately expressed as it should have been . Proof of this is furnishneutrals jarred on many a reader . Moreover , so great was the doubt concerning the President 's direct object , and so marked the divergence of view as to precisely where he stood as between the belligerents , that the Secretary of State felt compelled to seek to explain the matter to a puzzled public . The net result was to leave it rather more puzzled than before . This is not a very happy fate for a document so important as the one given out by the President last Thursday . For the purposes of an appeal so momentous words were not given to conceal thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Allies but in this country , has arisen from the President 's unguarded language which seemed to Imply that he perceives no difference in the moral quality of the various belligerents . That Mr. Wilson did not intend this is certain . The author of the Lusitania notes could not have forgotten them completely . ' Already there have come from Washington semi-official intimations that the President 's thought has been misapprehended . He was confining himself to the statements of aims and hopes as now made by the responsible rulers of the several belligerent Powers . This had no reference to the past . Nor was it meant as a judgment upon the spirit and methods with which the war has been waged . On that subject the President , it is hinted , remains of the mind he has had all along ; and it is even reported that supplementary instructions will be sent to our Ambassadors and Ministers , giving them one more explanation , in this sense , of a note which should have carried its own clear meaning on its face . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be facing , nothing need be done by the Allies , certainly nothing should be done by the Government of the United States , to allow the German Government to deceive itself about the long road which it has to travel in order painfully to regain its moral standing in the eyes of the world . Germany may have to undergo punishment of various kinds , but.the severest , the long-continuing , penalty which her rulers have brought upon her , will be the abiding abhorrence of the civilized world at the way in which the German Government began the war , and the atrocities committed in the course of it . The Paris Matin recently had an imaginary conversation between Bethmann-Hollweg and the Emperor . " See , " said complished nothing . " " Perhaps you would . have done better , " replied the Kaiser , " if you had , at the beginning of the war , left out a half-dozen phrases . " For our part , we hope that no American will forget or too lightly pardon the act of perfidy with which Germany began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has stained her course In it .
