txt WAR UNTIL VICTORY . Against an Attempt to End the Struggle Now . In the very last days of July , 1914 , England , France , Italy , and Russia almost entreated Germany to enter into a conference with them , to prevent war , but Germany , being prepared for , and determined to have , war , obstinately refused every offer made to her to enter such conference , as is shown by the White Papers . In the last days of the year 191V , the same Germany hi entreating the ' powers upon whom she precipitated war to enter a conference of delegates to end war . What is it that is causing Germany to be so anxious to end the war ? She has an enemy at homey within her own borders , in all of her towns , villages , and cities , which will soon cause her downfall and destruction ? starvation , famine . The world knows that she has not foodstuffs sufficient to feed her people and armies until the harvest of 1917 comes . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany a tender of " good offices , " which was then instantly , and insolently , repelled by the Kaiser , who said , in substance , by wire , as I remember it , to tell the enemies of Germany to Sue for peace . Now , in 1916 , this same Kaiser  --  without having withdrawn his insolent answer to the President of ? the United States , or apologizing  --  makes the same President his medium to convey to the enemies of Germany proposals for a conference to discuss peace , and the President goes the Kaiser one better and writes a note to the belligerents which is not cleat ' , except in one feature , where he says " He would be happy himself to serve , or even td take initiative , in its accomplishment , " &c.,; which offer the Kaiser has adroitly ignored , and the Entente Powers declined ; and thus seemingly has been blighted the President 's ambition to be peacemaker in Europe . The President has many friends and admirers who believe it would he well for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the Entente Powers whip and starve Germany into submission , and force her to make reparation to humanity , and give " effectual guarantees " with " good and solvent security " for the future . Moreover , German-Prussian militarism must be taught to understand , once and for all , that the policy of Frederick the Great of subjugating and taking over weaker States , and encroachment on the territory and rights of smaller countries , will no longer be tolerated by the civilized Christian world , and , also , that their swollen , supercilious claim to racial superiority will never be recognized and submitted to by other peoples : When these things are accomplished the war ought to end , and not before . Mr. Wilson makes a great mistake in his endeavor to end the war until the ideals of the Entente , in the respects stated , are accomplished . JOHN ALLISON . Preparedness and Armaments . To the Editor of The New York Times : As an ardent believer in preparedness I see with pain the attempts made in different quarters to discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It seems to me that the abolition of European armies and navies , instead of preventing war , would enhance US likelihood , as it would only emphasize the superior chances of a well-organized State like Prussia . I believe that until the New Jerusalem we will always need preparedness , and I would greatly appreciate any aid in drawing the line between preparedness and armaments . AMADOR . New York , Dec. 29 , 1916 . The Postman 's Uniform . To the Editor of The New York Times : Some one with influence should write to the proper authorities in Washington , D. C. , and call their attention to the fact that the uniforms of our postmen are not sufficiently warm to protect them against Winter 's cold and storms . They ? are more ex. - posed at present than formerly because they have night trips added to their daily routine . They are so invaluable , faithful , and painstalcMg they should be eared for . New York , Dec. 2e , 1916 . F.M.C. Military Drill for Boys . You observe that General Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Universal Military Training League , in their recent , arguments at Washington ; " gave no consideration to the enormous , if not unmanageable , number of men " involved in the proposal of universal train hrs . I should like to recall the little experience I have had in this direction . During our civil war the late August Belmont organized a company of boys , wly , ? t * ' . s bo , nr. au I were drilled by a Colonel Hlasico . They were dressed as Zouaves , and gave two or three exhibitions at theatres . I belonged to this company , being then about 12 years ' old , and have never forgotten , to this day , the substance of the drill and company evolutions I then learned . There is no doubt that the minds of children at that ago learn , and retain what they have learned , better than at any other age . Tile difficulty of applying this systeni to tho children of the country lies in tile isolation of " the little red schoolhouse " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible , in the State of New York , for instance , to have a corps of military instructors . a sufficient number being assigned to each county , to make periodical visits to the schools , public and private , in rotation , and give the boys days of training ? As they got older , and went to the higher schools . where they nre assembled in larger numbers , the problem would be easier . During the Summer general ? assemblies of the boys in each township might be held . Tho result would be that , apart from any . further extension through later intensive training and rifle practice , all the men in the State at the age of 18 or 10. would have bad a wellgrounded military training , and one which , in - later years , and in times of emergency , they would never have forgotten . The application of such a system to the country at large would make us as secure as we are now helpiese , and the cost would be trifling in comparison'with the benefit . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war broke out , to see the boys at Rugby , big and little , drilling and learning how to defend themselves . JOHN R. STRONG . New York , Dec. 30 , 1916 . Turkey 's Right to Exist . Professor Albert Bushnell Hart in his article on " , Can the Allies Afford to Make Peace Now ? " in the magazine section of THE Now YORK TIMES , has sonic remarks to make about Turkey which should not he passed over without comment . It is interesting to read , but difficult to understand , what Professor Hart means when he says , " A really independent Turkey not supported by any European power would probably break in a twelvemonth , and would certainly fall the moment Russia broke loose upon it . " Professor Hart ought to know that his first contention is incompatible with the past events . Students of Turkish history agree that what misfortune has befallen Turkey has been due to constant European Intervention . The so-called capitulations prevented the Turks from assuming absolute control over their dominions . The powers had control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an implied power to veto any measure Turkey might take . which power Russia did not fail to avail herself of at every instance she thought any proposed measure of reform might prove to be successful . As for the second point , that Turkey would fall the moment Russia broke loose upon her , that the Turks do not deny . , So would a lamb be eaten the moment a bear broke loose upon it . Turkey was once in a position to , and did , fight Russia single-handed . But . she can not do it now . It is difficult to see , however , what connection this has with Turkey 's right to exist as an independent power . It is a matter of common knowledge that the whole European system rests on what is known as the - balance of power . In this system there are strong members as well as weak members , but this does not give the stronger powers any , right to prey on their weaker neighbors . Equality of nations , irrespective of their size and strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHUKRI . New York , Dec. 25 , 1916 . The Allies ' Reply . After all , does n't it come to this : Stop whistling through the keyhole and find the key ? BETHMAN GEORGE .
