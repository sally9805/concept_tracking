txt Some relief , but not a great deal , will result from the rainfall of the last two days , according to Water Commissioner Thompson and Forecaster Scarr of the local Weather Bureau . Commissioner Thompson is more optimistio than Mr. Soarr , but even he does not believe the rain will do much more than satisfy the " thirst " of the earth and its vegetation . The Water Commissioner is very hopeful of a much larger run-off for the watershed . if the rains continue , even if the precipitation is no greater than it has been and no more periodic , the latter being Considered next in impOrtaitee in effecting a run-off to the quantity CS rain . To this Mr. Scarr adds that abow. era are looked for again to-day . Mr. Scam says that up to noon yesterday the rainfall for forty-eight hours on I the Croton watershed , an area of 800 square miles , from which the series of Croton reservoirs are supplied , has been .78 of an inch , of which .52 has fallen since 8 o'cloolt.yesterday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany on the north and beyond Providence , L , on the east . The fact is , Mr. Scarr says , Albany has had more rain than either this city or the watershed , 1.10 inches having fallen there in the twenty-four hours ended at 8 o'olOck yesterday morning . Altogether , Mr. Soarr says , .76 of an inch has fallen on the watershed since June 1 . " If this period of precipitation , " observes the official forecaster " had been compressed to within an hour or so the water supply for this city would have been greatly improved , without a doubt , because the run-off would have been far larger than it has been . The land surface had become very dry when these light rains came on , and vegetation was almost parched . The rain came down gently , and was almost immediately abcombed by the dry earth , utilized by vegetation , or evaporated into the air again . In this manner the run-off was almost nothing , and certainly no water soaked further into the ground than a few feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in turn supply the brooks , received absolutely no influx . Consequently , the reservoirs received no more water than actually fell on their surfaces . " Both Mr. Scarr and Commissioner , Thompson agreed that the latter amount vas almost negligible . ? Mr. Scarr said that the chief hope this , city had of getting immediate benefit from rainfall was in what farmers call " gully . washers " and city men " cats and dogs . " During such rains the water runs off a-most as fast as it falls , he explained , the larger percentage going into the streams at once , rather than soaking in to reach the brooks months later by means of the underground sluices and hillside springs . If an inch of rain fel , ' in two hours It Is estimated that 6,257,281,600 gallons gross would be available for swelling the streams in the watershed and increasing the supply of the reservoirs . Perhaps halt or even more of this quantity would find its way into the streams feeding the reservoirs if it came in a downpour . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and almost the entire amount , or about r , 682,961,200 gallons , has been absorbed by the earth or vegetation . Mr. Scarr made it plain that the city has little to hope for from gentle rains , but on the other hand if all June 's normal ' rainfall of 3.26 inches came in one day the watershed streams would be swollen immediately and the threatening situation relieved at once . June , July , and August may help the situation somewhat , Mr. Scarr thinks , since last June had 5.10 inches of rainfall , or considerably more than the average . Commissioner Thompson thought better of yesterday 's rain than did Mr. Scarr . " I think there will be some run-off , " he said , " improving the outlook somewhat . " Commissioner Thompson denied that he had said at first that conditions were alarming , and then that they were not . He has maintained consistently all , along he said , that conditions were serious , and I that it was highly important that con- I sumers should conserve the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
