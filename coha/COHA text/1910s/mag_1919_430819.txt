 | IN the early nineteenth century the world of free institutions was in a death struggle with Napoleon , precisely as of late it has been in a death struggle with the Prussian . Then , as in our recent past , we were forced to choose between a profitable if precarious neutrality and a vigorous stand for the right . Jefferson , like Wilson , had won his high office as a representative of democracy ; and Jefferson , like Wilson had theories and ideals that prevented an active part in the defense of freedom . In order to gain our rights as a neutral , Jefferson attempted to play off England against Napoleon , and Napoleon against England , writing diplomatic notes and presidential pronouncements without number ; and , unfailingly , our interests suffered and our national honor was humbled . Meantime Jefferson hesitated to prepare for war , with the result that when it came the nation was plunged into a chaos of waste and inefficiency . In only one respect does the parallel fail . In 1812 our enemy was the champion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we gained not one of the rights for which we fought . In 1917 our enemy was the enemy of mankind , our allies the free nations ; and today the high courage of our soldiers has its reward . The broad outlines of this historic parallel are obvious to all ; but its underlying psychology has yet to be explored . If the " ideals " that guided us eleven decades ago are the ideals of today , they can scarcely fail to be a factor tomorrow , and a very serious factor . It was Jefferson 's mature opinion , deliberately expressed , that " those societies ( as the Indians ) which live without government , enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness " than was possible under the English system of government ; and he called it  | " a problem not clear in my mind " whether the " unrestraint " of Indian life were not preferable to the restraints imposed by our own newly established Constitution . The personal influence of the wise and the good , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stated the idea in many forms . " Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter . " And this was said of the newspapers of the eighteenth century , which could not be surpassed in ambushed treachery and exultant truculence if they had been written by red Indians . Historians have not considered sufficiently this ideal of government . Jefferson 's biographer , Morse , who in general is sympathetic and appreciative , dismisses it as " stuff " and " nonsense . " Henry Cabot Lodge , whose sympathy is less perfect , calls it " utter rubbish . " But Jefferson 's belief in individual freedom unrestrained was as passionate as his statement of it was picturesque . As our historians should have known , both the idea and the illustration were derived from Rousseau 's Discourse upon Inequality , which the " philosophers " who set on foot the French Revolution took for Bible truth . Jefferson was proud to be numbered among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be the American Embassy , the scene of their plottings against the monarch to whom he was accredited . Is this laissez faire ideal of government extinct today ? Hardly . In a campaign speech of 1912 , Woodrow Wilson declared it in a form only slightly more generalized : " The happiest nation is that which is governed least . " Theodore Roosevelt challenged the dictum . In one of the few passages of clear thinking with which our politics have been enlivened , he placed it historically among the distorted half truths which were thrown out in the eighteenthcentury struggle against monarchy . A nation which governs itself is very far from happy unless its government is thoroughly organized and efficient . If Mr. Wilson is to be judged by his deeds , and not by his words , he is least of all men an exponent of the no-government ideal . Jefferson 's instincts were equally autocratic ; but he had op wait many years before he became President , and so we have our earliest illustration of the difference between the ries of our philosopher-Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle for office . During the first two administrations under our Constitution , the most critically important in its history , Jefferson was Secretary of State , with an ambition to be President , and he made his theories the basis of bitter opposition to his two great colleagues . To Washington the National Administration seemed lacking in organized authority . " Influence is not government , " he said in one of his rare but stupendously vital phrases . With the inspiration and aid of Hamilton , he set about strengthening the Federal power , as far as it could be legally strengthened under the constitution ? mainly by means of rendering stable the national finances . If Jefferson 's theories of individual liberty were crude , his theories of finance were chaotic . He saw in the measures of Washington and Hamilton only an effort to fix upon our newly enfranchised people an Anglophile system of monarchy . He called the Federals " monocrats " and " Anglomen " ; and , though a member of Washington 's Cabinet , he fought the new measures by every means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admired red man . He imported from New York , and put on the salary list of his Department of State , a journalist , Freneau , with whom he wrote or caused to be written , a series of anonymous articles charging the Secretary of the Treasury with personal dishonesty and public treason . Hamilton defended himself in a reply that left Jefferson crushed and quivering . But the great soul of Washington was distressed unutterably by so scandalous a controversy between the two leaders of his Cabinet ; it probably shortened his life . The tragedy was not without its satiric afterpieces . When Jefferson became President he possessed an authority over Congress and over public opinion which has seldom been equaled ; and he used it with an assurance very strange in so bitter an opponent of monocracy . Yet he never ventured to alter in the slightest particular Hamilton 's financial system , which lived to be recognized throughout the world as among the few great monuments of creative statesmanship . With one Gargantuan gulp Jefferson swallowed it , and his philosophic face became grave again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the late war , which had so long been " not our war , " became over night our own exclusive property ; while our Administra-  | tion , re-elected because it had kept us out of it , became the world champion of belligerency . Jefferson 's hatred of Hamilton was not swallowed with that mouthful , nor yet his conviction that Washington was culpably callous toward the Rousseau-Indian ideal of liberty . He gave an eager ear to every bit of gossip tending to discredit them both , jotted it down in a compilation of Hamiltoniana and Washingtoniana , which he quaintly called " Anas , " and carefully revised it in his old age for publication after his death , not scrupling to add the most categorical and virulent calumnies . Hamilton 's measures , the Anas alleged , were grounded in financial corruption and intended to bring on a monarchy . Washington , if not actually Hamilton 's accomplice , feared the ultimate failure of popular government and was so far gone in a mental decay as to become his dupe . Jefferson 's literary executor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt equally bound in honor to disclaim personal responsibility for the act . So from his grave Jefferson delivered his final blow against the reputation of his old comrades , long dead . It is with no desire to tarnish his just fame that I recall these unlovely pages of our history . Jefferson amply deserved and will always retain his position as the last of the great fathers . He bore a revelation quite beyond the scope of the class-bound if brilliantly constructive Hamilton , beyond even the majestic vision of Washington ; for he first understood the people of the United States and trusted them . He is at once their prophet and their titular saint . His own explanation of the Anas was that he meant them as a corrective against the Federalist bias of Marshall 's Washington , and it was doubtless sincere . His conviction was undying that the " revolution " toward democracy which he brought off in 1800 " was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form . " In other men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh to be here set down . In him it is to be explained , and in a large measure to be pardoned , by a due realization of the two dominant traits in his character , a passionate devotion to ideals abstractly beautiful and a no less passionate devotion to theories concretely false . He was not always honest ; but the root of his dishonesty lay in his mind rather than in his heart . Jefferson 's two administrations as President , and the  | consequence of them as it developed in the War of 1812 , are covered in the nine volumes by Henry Adams . It is probably the most exhaustively documented , as it is one of the most ably written , contribution to our national history ; and its portrayal of Jefferson 's high idealism , of his devious astuteness as a politician , and of the ultimate futility of his diplomacy , lacks only the analogy of the Great War to point its irony . Among its many additions to our knowledge of the period , is the discovery that in Washington Irving 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kieft is a thinly veiled burlesque of the then President of the United States . From the point of view of the twentieth century , this light hearted caricature affords perhaps the most significant of all contemporary views of Jefferson . How has so striking a fact remained so long perdue ? When Walter Scott read the Knickerbocker History , he wrote to Henry Brevoort that his sides were " absolutely sore with laughing " ; and he expressed regret that , " as a stranger to American parties and politics , " he had lost " much of the concealed satire of the piece . " But neither of Irving 's biographers , Pierre M. Irving and Charles Dudley Warner , enlightens us on this point . In 1809 , Irving was a young man of twenty-six , unknown except as a dilletante in society and in letters . The truth seems to be that his political allusions were completely overshadowed by his satire on the ancestors of the local Dutch aristocracy ? which even today makes Irving 's name anathema among the children of Saint Nicholas . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs was keen . His brother , Peter , who collaborated with him on the opening chapters of the Knickerbocker History , was editor of an anti-Jeffersonian newspaper . In the War of 1812 he served as staff officer with the rank of Colonel . He was a close friend of Stephen Decatur and narrowly missed being with him on the Guerriere during the brilliant sea fight in which she captured the Algerian frigate Mazouda . In the Knickerbocker History , the prevailing spirit is of bubbling merriment ; but in so far as its references are political it is inspired by the firm patriotism and sense of national dignity which are so conspicuous in Irving 's later works . Adams quotes only two brief passages ; and these , from our modern point of view , are scarcely the most significant .  | If he could have known that Irving 's satire was a doublebarreled weapon , making a forward-and-back shot inerrantly , he would doubtless have been more liberal in quotation . Like Jefferson , Kieft was a " scientist . " His abode , which he had fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , abounded with proofs of his ingenuity : patent smoke-jacks that required a horse to work them ; carts that went before the horses ; weather cocks that worked against the wind ; and other wrong-headed contrivances that astonished and confounded all beholders . Of Jefferson 's " contrivances " the most famous today is a garden wall at the University of Virginia , which he managed to build with a single thickness of brick by making it meander in serpentine convolutions . As far as the satire is political , it strikes at the President 's two dominant traits , a passion for peace and a determination to enforce it upon the world with all the vigor of his personal authority . No more compendious means could be found of completing the message which Jefferson indites historically to Wilson . Here is Irving 's estimate of the statesmanship of the Sage of the Bowerie Monticello : It is in knowledge as it is in swimming : he who flounders and splashes on the surface makes more noise , and attracts more attention , than the pearl-diver who quietly dives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquirements of the new governor were the theme of marvel among the simple burghers of New Amsterdam . I have known in my time many a genius of this stamp ; but , to speak my mind freely , I never knew one who , for the ordinary purposes of life , was worth his weight in straw . In this respect , a little sound judgment and plain common sense is worth all the sparkling genius that ever invented theories . Jefferson 's first contact with the European turmoil came through the closing of the mouth of the Mississippi to our commerce . A war with Napoleon seemed inevitable , in which our natural allies were the English . Jefferson preferred peace at whatever price . He bought the territory of Louisiana , thus giving Napoleon sorely-needed financial aid in his assault upon the liberties of Europe . The purchase was absolutely illegal . As he himself expressed it , it " made blank paper of the Constitution . " The assumption of executive authority with which he accomplished it , filled Hamilton with satiric glee and might well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loosened still further our construction of the Constitution by placing over the territory a proconsular governor who ruled it in the best monarchic manner of France and Spain , without the consent of the inhabitants and , in fact , against their will . So the origin of our so-called " imperialism " is the work of a President inveterately pledged to strict construction in the interests of laissez faire individualism . In this respect at least our Constitution is an unwritten instrument . The irony of the situation is not lessened by the fact that the Louisiana purchase was the one undoubted political achievement of Jefferson 's two administrations . As such it was of course immune from burlesque . But Jefferson 's triumph was short lived , for it led him into an endeavor to which the longest national purse would have been unequal , namely , the endeavor to secure the rights of our commerce on the Atlantic by peaceful means . Here Irving 's satire becomes drastic . It was Wilhelmus Kieft who " invented " a wonderful " new and cheap mode " of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The character of Jefferson 's pacifism stands forth in salient outline to us who have lived through the Great War . As his successor of today was suspected of playing into the hands of the Hun , so Jefferson was roundly accused of being " wholly sold to " Napoleon . Many cities and towns published petitions in protest , among which none is more touching than that of the village of Alfred , in Maine . It charged the Administration with provoking war between the United States and England in order " to gratify the ambition and caprice , and to augment the power , of the Tyrant of France . " It continued : " We are the poor inhabitants of a small town , rendered poorer by the wayward and inconsistent policy of the general government ; but life and liberty are as dear to us as to our opulent brethren of the South . . . . We love liberty in principle , but better in practice . " The charge of subservience to Napoleon was of course unfounded . Jefferson 's true motives are expressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Cabinet : We see with great concern the position in which Great Britain is placed , and should be sincerely afflicted were any disaster to deprive mankind of such a bulwark against the torrent which has for some time been bearing down all before it . But peace is our passion . . . .  | We prefer trying every other just principle , right , and safety , before we would recur to war . " Peace is our passion ! " It was that , and more . As clearly as the intelligentsia of today , Jefferson held that war was obsolete , or would become so just as soon as a firm appeal was made to the enlightened self interest of nations . He meant to make that appeal , and so to inaugurate a new era of peace . Henry Adams sums up his theory as follows : He was convinced that governments , like human beings , were on the whole controlled by their interests , and that the interests of Europe required peace and free commerce with America . Believing a union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust their jealousy of each other to secure their good treatment of the United States . Knowing that Congress could , by a single act , divert a stream of wealth f con , one European country to another , he believed that foreign governments would not long resist their own interests . Jefferson stated the principle almost as clearly ; and he had besides a catch phrase for it . To Dr. Logan he wrote : " Our commerce is so valuable to them that they will be glad to purchase it , when the only price is to do us justice . I believe that we have in our hands the means of peaceable coercion . " To Chancellor Livingston he wrote that he considered our rights on the Atlantic " not worth a war . " He added : " Nor do I believe war the most certain means of enforcing them . " The most certain means were " those peaceable coercions . . . . " And so the Sage of Monticello undertook to put Napoleon Bonaparte in his place ? by peaceable coercion . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him turn to the bible of the modern pacifist ? The Great Illusion . In the twentieth century we have a vast fund of economic data which Jefferson did not command ; but Norman Angel 's argument is identical , in its general outlines as in its conclusion , with that of our first Great Pacificator . A numerous school of " philosophers " today believe that the peace of the future will be amply safeguarded by merely economic coercions . When the world once understands its true interests , it will rise above warfare , aloof and serene . It will be too proud to fight . What happened has a strangely familiar ring . We were caught between the Symplegades . England invented international law to the great prejudice of our commerce ,  | continuing as always to kidnap American sailors and impress them into the British navy ; and the only result of a series of emissaries , and of innumerable diplomatic notes , was the flippant sarcasm of George Canning , who used his great office for the exploitation of undergraduate wit . To Napoleon our " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized our ships and sold their cargoes to equip his soldiers . But our passion for peace was undaunted alike by insult and injury . Jefferson secured from Congress a non-intercourse act , and finally an embargo , which he enforced with an usurpation of Federal power as distinct as that of the Louisiana purchase . Along the borders , non-intercourse was defied by smugglers ; but the country as a whole which , since the devastation wrought by the Revolution , had been rapidly gaining in prosperity , was again verging toward ruin . And so we reach the date of Irving 's Knickerbocker . It is an era humiliating alike to our national honor and to our common sense ; but Irving 's account of the high adventures of Governor Wilhelmus Kieft will persuade us , if anything can , that " to laugh is better than to weep . " The first object of Kieft 's peacable coercions was the neighboring folk of Connecticut . Never was a more comprehensive , a more expeditious , or , what is still better , a more economical measure devised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expedient likewise so gentle and humane that there were ten chances to one in favor of its succeeding . But then there was one chance to ten that it would not succeed . As the ill-natured fates would have it , that single chance carried the day ! The proclamation was perfect in all its parts , well constructed , well written , well sealed and well published ; but , provoking to relate , the Yankees treated it with the most absolute contempt , applied it to an unseemly purpose ; and thus did the first warlike proclamation come to a shameful end , ? a fate which I am credibly informed has befallen but too many of its successors . When convinced that " his much vaunted war measure " was ineffectual , Kieft " attributed the failure to the quantity , not the quality of the medicine , and resolved to double the dose . " To peaceable coercion , by proclamation , he added a non-intercourse act . He forbade " all intercourse with these Yankee intruders , ordering the Dutch burghers on the frontiers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple sweetmeats , Weathersfield onions or wooden bowls , and to furnish them with no supplies of gin , ginger-  | bread or sauerkraut . " The failure of this measure was even more dire . " Non-intercourse was especially set at nought by the young folks of both sexes , if we can judge by the active bundling which took place along the borders . " The insolence of the Yankees increased so alarmingly that " everybody clamored around the governor , imploring him to put the city in a complete posture of defense . And he listened to their clamors . Nobody could accuse William the Testy of being idle in a time of danger . " He called all his well known inventive powers to his aid . " At length , after a world of consultation and contrivance , his plans of defense ended in rearing a great flagstaff in the center of the fort , and perching a wind mill on each bastion . " Nor was this windy contrivance the only substitute for government by proclamation . There lived in the Manhattoes a jolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long wind ; and who , as the story goes , could twang so potently upon his instrument that the effect upon all within hearing was like that ascribed to the Scotch bagpipe when it sings i ' the nose . Antony the Trumpeter was elevated to the post of commandant of windmills and champion of New Amsterdam . It is not clear precisely who was the Jeffersonian original of the windy Antony ; but in the twentieth century we know very well who was the presidential press agent . Then as later there were pigmy-minded doubters , " who sneered at the governor for thinking to defend his city by mere wind . " But William Kieft " twanged defiance at the whole Yankee race . Nay , he had almost the temerity to compare Antony 's trumpet with the ram 's horns celebrated in holy writ , at the very sound of which the walls of Jericho fell down . " Among the many exploits of Kieft and his robustious trumpeter , the most memorable is an expedition against Killian Van Rensellaer , who had usurped control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fortress of Rensellaerstein . Antony the Trumpeter was despatched on the yacht Goed Hoop as ambassador , and " mounting the poop , sounded a parley to the fortress . In a little time , the steeple-crowned hat of Nicholas Koorn , the wacht-meester , rose above the battlements , followed by his iron visage , and ultimately his whole person , armed to  | the very teeth ; while one by one a whole row of Helderbergers reared their round burly heads above the wall , and beside each pumpkin head peered the end of a rusty musket . Nothing daunted by this formidable array , Antony Van Corlear drew forth and read with audible voice a missive from William the Testy , ordering the garrison to quit the premises , bag and baggage , on pain of the vengeance of the potentate of the Manhattoes . " The reply of Nicholas Koorn sorely perplexed the trumpeter . The wacht-meester applied the thumb of his right hand to the end of his nose , and the thumb of his left hand to the little finger of the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish with his fingers . The best Antony Van Corlear could make of his reply was that it meant something mysterious and masonic . Not liking to betray his ignorance , he again read with a loud voice the missive of William the Testy , and again Nicholas Koorn applied the thumb of his right hand to the end of his nose , and the thumb of his left hand to the little finger of the right , and repeated this kind of nasal weathercock . Antony Van Corlear now persuaded himself that this was some short-hand sign or symbol , current in diplomacy , which , though unintelligible to a new diplomat like himself , would speak volumes to the experienced intellect of William the Testy ; and considering his embassy therefore at an end , he sounded his trumpet with great complacency , and set sail on his return down the river , every now and then practicing this mysterious sign of the wacht-meester to keep it accurately in mind . The governor was no less perplexed than his trumpeter . He knew every variety of windmill and weathercock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aerial sign in question . After fruitless pondering he called a meeting of his council . Anthony Van Corlear stood forth in the midst , and putting the thumb of his right hand to his nose , and the thumb of his left hand to the finger of the right , he gave a faithful facsimile of the portentous sign . Having a nose of unusual dimensions , it was as if the reply had been put in capitals ; but all in vain ; the worthy burgomasters were equally perplexed with the governor . Each one put his thumb to the end of his nose , spread his fingers like a fan , imitated the motion of Anthony Van Corlear and then smoked in dubious silence . Several times was Antony obliged to stand forth like a fugleman and repeat the sign , and each time a circle of nasal weather-cocks might be seen in the council chamber . In one respect Jefferson was less fortunate than Wilson . The stupidity and insolent injustice of the British government proceeded so far that a co-belligerency against Napo- leon was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No dramatic reversal of policy was possible . Long before his administration ended , it became obvious that his gigantic failure would have to be publicly confessed in the repeal of the embargo . Seldom has a statesman , full of the conviction of rectitude , been placed in a dilemma so embarrassing . Jefferson had the sensitiveness of a girl to praise , and the tremulousness of a child under rebuke . But he had an unconquerable tenacity of purpose . " Pliant and conciliatory in manner , " Henry Adams calls him , " but steady as the magnet itself in aim . " Like Wilhelmus Kieft he was convinced that an unkind fate had scored a ten-to-one shot against him . When the failure of his peaceable coercion became obvious , he wrote to Monroe : " There has never been a situation in the world before in which such endeavors as we have made would not have secured our peace . It is probable that there will never be such another . " This conviction that he was the victim of chance , and of the pigmy-mindedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months of his death , in 1826 , he wrote to Giles : " Persevered in a little longer , the embargo would have effected its object completely . " During the last months of his Presidency , he labored almost piteously with Congress that the repeal might be delayed until Madison , already elected , should assume office . But for once Congress rebelled . Jefferson himself signed the repeal as the last act of " his long reign . " He was able , however , to leave to his faithful henchman the disgraceful war which he had rendered inevitable . Even in his own party the hatred he had engendered was intense . " Never has there been an administration , " said the Democrat , John Randolph , " which went out of office and left the nation in a state so deplorable and calamitous . " The Democrat Dallas wrote to the Democrat Gallatin : " I verily believe that one more year of writing , speaking and appointing would have rendered Mr. Jefferson a more odious President , even to the Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federalist predecessor was a Democrat and a free-silverite ; but the verdict of Henry Adams is the most sweeping of all : Jefferson 's " sorest trial " was loss of popularity . . . . Not until the embargo faded from men 's minds did the mighty shadow  | of Jefferson 's Revolutionary name efface the ruin of his presidency . . Jefferson had undertaken to create a government which should interfere in no way with private action , and he had created one which interfered directly in the concerns of every private citizen in the land . . . . He had hoped to make his country pure and free ; to abolish war , with its train of debt , extravagance , corruption and tyranny ; to build up a government devoted only to useful and moral objects ; to bring upon earth a new era of peace and good will among men . Throughout the twistings and windings of his course as President , he clung to this main idea . . . . By repealing the embargo . Congress avowedly , and even maliciously , trampled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality and which in his own opinion entitled him to rank as a philosophic legislator . " Twistings and windings ! " Woodrow Wilson ( also a Democrat ) wrote in his History of the United States the following extraordinary sentence : " Jefferson deliberately practiced the arts of the politician , and exhibited oftentimes the sort of insincerity which subtle natures yield to without loss of essential integrity . " Whatever we may think of the morals implied in this sentence , they were undoubtedly the subtle morals of Jefferson . All that was left of his career as a creative statesman was his self-styled " revolution " of 1800 against those perilous monocrats , Hamilton and Washington . It was probably a conviction of this that inspired the otherwise inexplicable Anas . No subtler sacrifice of " essential integrity " was ever made ? and none more unnecessary . Muddle-headed and self-contradictory as was the genius that founded the Democratic party in one mood and bought Louisiana in another , asserting an autocratic power at all times in the name of a free people , it was still genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Federalists and latter-day Republicans , beginning with George Washington . Jefferson 's pride seems to have suffered quite as much as his integrity . In the epitaph which he wrote for his monument , he stated that he was author of the Declaration of Independence , and Father of the University of Virginia ; but he did not mention the fact that he was twice President of the United States . He could scarcely have forgotten it . That two men of this curious character , actuated by identically the same ideals and theories , and assuming autocratic authority in the name of democracy , should have been elected and re-elected to the Presidency of the United  | States , and at an interval of over a hundred years , affords a curious commentary on our national psychology . The fact seems to be that they appealed to our two dominant virtues , each of which nurtures in its heart a vice that at any moment may become dominant . We are at once the most practical of peoples and the most idealistic . We are quite capable of standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddle , oh no ! ? but to snatch a profit out of the holocaust . And , when the right call is sounded , we are equally capable of sublime heroism on the field of battle , of sublime renunciation of our economic interests . The man who would lead such a people to the full realization of its destiny must have , as Washington and Lincoln had , a consummate clarity of thought and realism in action ; the essence of his mind , as of his heart , must be sincerity and integrity . There can be no place in his policies for ideals that remain beautiful only by remaining vague or for theories that are knocked into a cocked hat by contact with the ultimate human fact ; for the only possible outcome , in the struggle of political life , is a series of weak shifts and evasions , of dangerous handsprings and somersaults . A statesman who thinks " philosophically , " and acts with no precise estimate of the result , can gain leadership among us ; and by subtly practicing " the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly long time . But dishonesty is none the less corroding because it is of the mind . Nor is it less dishonest . When the people at last finds such a leader out , its vengeance is terrible . To Woodrow Wilson , overtaken by his dilemma at the beginning of his second term , no sage-like retreat to Monticello was possible . With spectacular skill , he leaped upon the war horse . But his pacifism survived , unshaken . Once again he is endeavoring to insure the world a limitless future of government by proclamation and peaceable coercion . And once again he is endeavoring to enforce it upon a free people regardless of their judgment and of that of their chosen representatives . Meantime , in sixteen different parts of the world , the wacht-meester has his thumb to his nose .
