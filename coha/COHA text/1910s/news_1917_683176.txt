txt Announcement was made today in both houses of Congress that efforts would be made to strike out of the Espionage bill the objectionable censorship provisions . In the Senate the announcement was made by Mr. Johnson of California , a Progressive Republican . Several Senators said they expected the motion to prevail . At the conclusion of a strong argument against the censorship section of the Espionage bill , Representative George S. Graham of Pennsylvania , a minority member of the Judiciary Committee , told the House he would move to strike Section 4 from the bill . The censorship section was attacked on both sides of the chamber . Chairman Webb of the Judiciary Committee replied by saying the President could be trusted to promulgate reasonable regulations concerning what might be published in time of war . Representative Medill McCormick of Illinois , part owner of The Chicago Tribune , made an extended speech against conferring such broad powers upon any one individual , even the President , and predicted that no law passed would prevent the more influential newspapers from printing information which the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would hit hardest the individual and the small newspaper , as the large publication would challenge the right to curtail the freedom of the press . Newspapers , on the whole , he said , were willing to submit patriotically to any reasonable censorship without the enactment of a law . ' Representative Graham said there were arguments both for and against the pending legislation , and advanced the suggestion that the situation might better be met by no legislation at all than the approval of that proposed by the . Judiciary Committee . The committee , he said , had no unanimity of opinion on the subject and had drawn the section with much difficulty . Applause met Mr. Graham 's announcement that he would seek to eliminate the paragraph relating to censorship . Sees More Evil . Than Good In It . " The suggestions that have been made on this floor , " said Mr. Graham , " as to the treatment of soldiers , the policy under which the war is being conducted , and a hundred other subjects that would spring to our minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely he discussed for the welfare of the country , are subjects whose discussion ought not be felt to any one man or any set of men . " It is better to meet whatever evil may come from the discussion of them than to throttle discussion and prevent the airing of evils that exist and which will make against the welfare of the country and its success in var . I believe at this time more evil will ensue front the enactment of Section 4 than any possible good that may come by reason of its being written into law . " This bill is not tile work originally of a member of this House , but it came to us as an appeal practically from a. coordinate branch of the Government for legislation to enable them to meet evils that were shown to exist . That appeal ought to meet with generous response , and it was in an endeavor to meet every part of the difficulty that the bill in its entirety was framed . " It is suggested we attempt to enenierate the things forbidden , restricting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But any man who reflects must concede it would be impossible to enumerate all the subjects that should be set forth . Hence it is , facing those difficulties , those uncertainties , the question of possibly interfering with the right of free speech and a free press that I am going to urge that the members of this House join me in eliminatifig Section 4 . " " But if there is no law everybody will have a right to publish anything , will they not ? " asked Mr. Bathrick of Ohio . " They have that right today , " said Mr. Graham . " I think anybody who does it with a guilty purpose can be caught under the other sections of the bill , and anybody who does it in the discharge of a duty by way of criticism ought not to be caught by any portion of the bill . " The Voluntary Censorship . Mr. Graham said the voluntary censorship so far had worked satisfactorily . " I Yapper " to know , " he said , " that recently a ve : -y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of various newspapers . This information teas known to staff men and newspapers of New York . Philadelphia . and other cities . It has never appeared in print . " Again , when the St. Louis sailed she was saluted by boats in the harbor of New York . The newspapers knew the day of her departure , but no paper published the fact that the St. Louis had sailed . That is an example of the way the voluntary censorship has worked . " Asked by Mr. Borland of Missouri if he preferred a " blue pencil " censorship by some board or the enactment of ? some provision similar to the one carried in the bill , Mr. Graham said he believed censorship by Presidential proclamation was the more preferable . He adhered to his belief , however , that the entire section ought to go out of the bill , but expressed the opinion that a " blue pencil . ! censorship would be more onerous than any other . Mr. Lenroot of Wisconsin contended that Congress would be virtually delegating law-making powers to the Presi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President could prevent publication of matter which " in his judgment " might be useful to the enemy . Mr. Montague ' of Virginia . engaged in a colloquy with Mr. Webb and argued : " You can not authorize the President to determine a crime and also punish a crime . You can not do both . " Mr. Webb insisted that the only practicable way was to give the President authority by proclamation to determine ? what things must not be communicated or published : - ? " Is not this great power to give to one man ? " suggested Mr. Chandler of New York . " Yes , " said Mr. Webb . " but we have given him power to send thousands of our boys to death . Why should we hesitate about this bill ? " Representative La Guardia of New ? Yorkssailed the censorship proposal u as " un-American and vicious . " " This is a revolutionary measure , " said ? Mr. La Guardia . " It shocks me as much as would a bill to'change the color or formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do change all our flag stands for and has stood for . Our hearts are in this war , but there is no reason ? to lose our heads . " Mr. Smith of New York asked if It would be possible under the bill " to comment upon such things as the failure of an expedition similar to that which , ; the English attempted at the Dania --  ; nelles . " Nothing helped England . more , Ihe said , than sincere criticism of this expedition . " I do not think tlje President would try to prohibit things of that sort , " re- , sponded Mr. Webb . " Is there anything in this bill . " Speaker Clark asked , " that would make it an offense to reveal that some con --  ; tractor ? had furnished embalmed beef to ; the army ? In the Spanish war this occurred , and the agitation started bv ! Roosevelt and others was very helpful . " " I do not think that would be for-1 bidden , " said Mr. Webb . " Suppose a General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published ? " asked Speaker Clark . Mr. ! Webb said he thought so . Mr. Knutson of Minnesota contended ' the ? bill would make the President the ' sole arbiter of free speech in this coun- ! try , and said " the measure seeks to ; abrogate that section of the Constitution which guarantees free speech and a free press . ' " This hill is even more drastic than the , Senate bill , " said Mr. McCormick. ; who gave notice he would offer an amendment to make Section 4 more spe- ! cific . " We have already put many burdens on the President , and when we I say he shall use his judgment in his proclamation we merely put the power in the hands of the men who first draft-1 ed the drastic law originally proposed , 1 and we give them the poyer to write the regulations for the President . " Supplies , ammunition , and foodstuffs , for our army may be defective , but the publication of such facts would be . forbidden by this bill . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Departments may break down than that ! there will be publication of information useful to the enemy . " This bill will be law 3 , ( ' s ) miles and ; presujnably thirty days from the enemy 's country , while Great Britain is within forty-eight to sixty hours of the enemy . I The censor will control the cables and wireless stations , and material published in this country would not be transmitted directly to the enemy except by leave of the censor . " But newspapers will not he affected ! by an air-tight censorship law . They I will violate the law when they think I they are right and will hire big staffs . of attorneys to defend their action . It I is the individual and the small news- 1 papers that will he affected . They can- I not afford to fight . Lord Northcliffe violated the law , such as proposed here , I when he found that unsuitable munitions had caused horrible loss of life of English soldiers . He made public the ' facts and contributed to future victories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embalmed beef scandal . and such a law will be challenged . " Heated debate is expected in the House tomorrow , when various amendments will he offered . Representative Kahn will propose a permanent Board of Censors , and Representative McCormick and others have changes they want to urge . The bill may reach a final vote in the louse tomorrow provided it is not set aside in favor of the measure to permit the President to put the seized German ships into service . In the Senate the debate today centered upon the export embargo clause . Senator Hoke Smith offered a substitute for the committee draft to authorize embargoes only when foodstuffs reach an enemy country through a neutral . A general export embargo , the Georgia Senator said , Is not necessary now , and would permit unconstitutional discrimination between American ports . Citing how Congress gave former Presidents the authority to lay embargoes , Senator King of Utah urged that President Wilson flave.such power now , because he might need it later while Congress is in adjournment . Senator Smith said a general embargo was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators Overman , Walsh , and Thomas defended the committee proi ' , osal and denied that It would permit discrimination in application between any ports of the United States .
