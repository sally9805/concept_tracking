 | What the situation would be today in the South had that section been given a free hand in the solution of its problems and in adjusting itself to the new order created by the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth amendment , we can only surmise . We have , however , data which should enable us to form some idea of how the leading men of the South would have dealt with the perplexing situation created by the emancipation of four millions of slaves in their midst , if they had been left to their own devices . President Johnson , on taking up the work of reconstruction where Lincoln had left it , appointed provisional governors and encouraged the states to convene their legislatures for the purpose of adopting the thirteenth amendment and of revising their constitutions . It was during the sessions of these legislatures toward the end of 1865 and at the beginning of 1866 that the famous " black codes " were enacted . ' It will be impossible to understand the purpose and the temper of these much condemned black codes unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They belong to a transitional period . Men faced the dire necessity of bringing some sort of order out of the social and industrial chaos that was the natural and inevitable outcome of the war and emancipation . The legislators who framed the codes were merely seeking to establish some sort of modus vivendi that would insure food and clothing for both black and white . The freedmen who were the only supply of labor in many sections , were leaving the plantations by the thousands and trooping through the country in the wake of the Federal armies or besieging the Freedman 's Bureau for food and shelter . Sidney Andrews , correspondent for the Boston Advertiser and the Chicago Tribune , spent fourteen weeks of travel and observation in the Carolinas and Georgia , and has given us in his  | " South Since the War " ( published in 1865 ) a vivid picture of the actual conditions . " That many of the leading men desire to see the Negro have a fair chance is beyond all question , " he says but he met the complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 380 ) . Commenting on the situation in central Georgia , he writes " that thousands of Negroes in this section , where slavery was less a burden than in almost any other part of the South , have left homes wherein they had every needful care and comfort , for the uncertain chances of life by themselves , is a fact that I can not refuse to see . . Hundreds of conversations with Negroes of every class in at least a dozen towns of this section have convinced me that the race is , on a large scale , ignorantly sacrificing its material good for the husks of vagabondage. " 2 There was also a very general fear upon the part of the whites that vagabondage and idleness would lead to lawlessness. ; The situation was a most trying one for both whites and blacks . It was but natural that freedmen of all classes should be intoxicated with their new-found liberty . Sidney Andrews upon meeting an aged negress who had been a favored servant in a good home asked , " What did you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur ? ' Joy my freedom . ' " 4 But how was it to be expected that the ex-slave who had never enjoyed the moral training of self-imposed tasks in a free industrial community should have any true comprehension of the obligations resting upon him for the proper exercise of his freedom ? It was too much like the freedom of the boy who has received an unlooked for holiday from the unpleasant tasks of school . Undoubtedly many of the framers of the black codes felt the danger to both races in this situation , and they were actuated by a sincere feeling of responsibility and of guardianship towards the weaker race now facing new and untried conditions . This appears plainly in the message of Governor Humphreys , of Mississippi , to the state legislature in 1865 . Speaking of the attitude of the state towards the Negro , he says , " The sudden emancipation of her slaves has devolved upon her the highest responsibilities and duties .  | Several hundred thousands of the Negro race have been turned loose upon society ; and in the guardianship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and protect them in all their rights of person and property . The highest degree of elevation in the scale of civilization , to which they are capable morally and intellectually , must be secured to them by their education and religious training . This sense of responsibility as well as the desire to insure employment and industrial training for the Negroes of the rising generation , prompted the apprentice law of the Mississippi code . By this law " all freedmen , free Negroes and mulattoes , under the age of eighteen " who were orphans or whose parents could not or would not provide for them were to be apprenticed to some " competent and suitable person , " their former masters being preferred if they were suitable . In these cases the " master or mistress " was required to give bond that the minor would be properly clothed and fed , treated humanely , given medical attention when needed and taught to read and write if under fifteen years old . The master had power to inflict corporal punishment , " Provided that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and in the event of the minor leaving the employ of master or mistress , they were empowered to " pursue and recapture " him or even to jail him if he refused to return . If in the judgment of the court the apprentice had good cause for leaving his master , he is discharged from the indenture and the master must pay him a fine of not more than one hundred dollars . The terms " master " and " mistress " used in these laws were especially objectionable to many . Blaine says , " The fact will not escape attention that in these enactments the words " master , " " mistress . " and " servant " are constantly used , and that under the operation of the laws a form of servitude was re-established , more heartless and more cruel than the slavery which had been abolished . " It is interesting to know , however , that at the time when Blaine was making this point blank appeal to Northern anti-slavery sentiment , these very words occured in the revised statutes of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters , Apprentices , and Servants . " The simple truth is that these phrases are so imbedded in the terminology of the law that they probably occur in the statutes of every state in the Union . The laws against vagrancy arose from the imperative necessity of correcting the inclination of the Negroes to wander away from their homes and plantations , threatening those sections of the South entirely dependent upon negro labor with economic ruin . The black code of Mississippi classed as vagrants all freedmen , free Negroes and mulattoes over eighteen , who by the second Monday of 1866 had no lawful employment or were unlawfully assembling themselves together by day or night , and subjected them to fine and imprisonment . Upon failure to pay the fine it was made the duty of the sheriff " to hire out said freedman , free Negro or mulatto , to any person who will , for the shortest period of service , pay said fine and forfeiture and all costs . " s To meet the support of the indigent and pauper class among the Negroes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund for the maintenance of the Negro poor . For a Negro to refuse or fail to pay the tax was " prima facie evidence of vagrancy . " In the matter of civil rights the Negroes could make contracts , sue and be sued in the courts , acquire property and dispose of it the same as the whites ; their intermarriages were under the same regulations as those of the whites , except that all intermarriages of whites and blacks were made illegal with a penalty of life imprisonment ; the Negroes were now made competent witnesses in all cases in the courts with the right " to charge any white person by affidavit . . . with any criminal offense against his or her property . " 9 The civil status of the blacks was therefore essentially the same as that of the whites . There were other minor regulations against carrying arms , inciting " riots , routs , affrays , " etc. , " exercising the functions of a minister of the Gospel without a license , " or selling intoxicating liquors , which enactments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this analysis ,  | I have followed the black code of Mississippi , as it was one of the earliest formulated and together with that of South Carolina was among the most stringent . In Mississippi , South Carolina , and Louisiana , the enactments as to civil rights were least liberal and the penalties and restrictions the strongest , for the very natural reason that the blacks outnumbered the whites in all these states . These black codes were greeted with a storm of condemnation in the North , and no doubt played a very important part in the crystallization of Northern opinion under radical leadership . ' ? " If the Southern men had intended as their one special and desirable aim , " said Blaine , " to inflame the public opinion of the North against them , they would have proceeded precisely as they did . They treated the Negro according to a vicious phrase which had at one time wide currency , " as possessing no rights which a white man was bound to respect . " The Chicago Tribune for Dec. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the white men of Mississippi that the men of the North will convert the state of Mississippi into a frog pond before they will allow any such laws to disgrace one foot of soil in which the bones of our soldiers sleep and over which the flag of freedom waves . " To understand how passion and prejudice had warped the minds of men in these troublous times it is well to remind ourselves of the fact that , only one year before this Chicago editor penned these lines , a statute of his own state of Illinois had " prohibited absolutely the settling of negro or negro mulatto in the state , under penalty of S50 fine to be paid or defendant sold to work it out ; this process to be repeated at expiration of each sentence , till the negro died or left the state . " 12 The Mississippi black code was hardly as severe as these Illinois regulations regarding the Negro . A scholar of repute thus describes the part these codes have played in shaping opinion as to the conditions of this period : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending their enactment , without honest effort to grasp or appreciate the real spirit and temper and intent of the men who framed them , the dead literalness of these  | statutes has been made to do more than thirty years of scarecrow duty to blunders whose criminality has been accentuated by the maliciousness of their inspiration . " 13 This is strong language . Let us see if it has any basis of truth behind it . First , as to the motives of the men that framed the black codes . Now that we are able to analyze their language and study their actions free from the passions that played so fiercely around the issues of those days , we must grant that they were not maliciously bent , as many have supposed , upon the re-enslavement of the Negro but were honestly striving to adapt themselves to a new and trying situation . They sought to do justice to the freedman and at the same time to establish some sort of modus vivendi that would save them from the social and industrial chaos with which they were threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphreys of Mississippi , quoted above , they were men of ability and often prompted by a painful sense of responsibility towards their former slaves . Some idea of the nature of the problem the Southern statesman faced , and some insight , perhaps , into the ideal in his mind when he framed these laws , can be gained by comparing the situation at the South with those faced by other peoples under similar circumstances . To be sure , no exact parallel can be found in history . The Southern states had to adjust themselves to three and a half millions of slaves made free by the sword and turned loose upon a ruined and devastated country , while in Jamaica , for example , the emancipation took place peaceably by means of just such a system of apprenticeship as the South proposed and the number of slaves involved was little more than three hundred thousand , 14 In all instances , however , the transition from slavery to freedom has been accompanied by great strain upon the economic and social systems of the peoples concerned , largely due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vagrancy and shiftlessness . In those cases where the transition has been made with least injury to the industrial life of the community , we find that some such system of control over the freedmen as the South proposed , such as apprenticeships and control of  | labor on the part of previous owners , has been used . The Emancipation Bill of 1833 in Jamaica provided for a system of apprenticeships covering from five to seven years and an indemnity of some ? 20,000,000 to the slave-owners . When these terms expired the transition to freedom was made with " quiet and hearty rejoicings throughout the land , " and yet not without great industrial depression . Mr. Stone has shown from a comparative study of emancipation in the French colonies of Guadaloupe , Martinique , and Bourbon that immediate and absolute emancipation was always disastrous for both freedmen and owners , whereas the best results were attained by forcing the freedmen to enter into contracts for labor , extending in some cases to two years . ' When the Negroes of San Domingo became free they " took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce them to work failed until Toussaint L'Ouverture , the " Vainqueur des Anglais " and hero of Wendell Phillips 's oratory , by means of a black code of his own of the most arbitrary and despotic character , involving often the use of the cudgel and halter , finally brought things to the pass where it was said that " ten new citizens could do as much work as thirty slaves formerly . " There are , however , other facts which would lead us to surmise that the status of the freedmen outlined by the black codes of the South was fairly in harmony with the actual industrial and social conditions of the time . Major-General Banks , who had charge of President Lincoln 's attempts at reconstruction in Louisiana , in an address before a Boston audience , asserted plainly the great need of " steady labor " for the production of the crops of the South , adding , " It has never been demonstrated by actual experiment that the Negro would subject himself to continuous labor by any engagement or choice of his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method he had inaugurated in Louisiana and asserted that there was no difference between his system and that of Toussaint L'Ouverture except that the latter was " infinitely more severe upon the Negro . " " Can we demand , " he continues , " even if we had no other ground for  | our procedure , that a philosophy which has thus been discussed and practically tested in the colonies of England and France for half a century , should be discarded altogether , until somebody can suggest a plan more perfect and more certain to benefit the laborer ? " 18 General Grant , at the fall of Vicksburg , found it necessary to adopt similar regulations regarding the 50,000 and more of Negroes that flocked to his camp . He placed them upon the confiscated plantations along the Mississippi River and forced them to remain there , exacting a certain number of hours of work from them and turning over refractory cases to the provost marshal.10 Neither General Grant nor General Banks held a brief for the Southern attitude towards the freedman nor were they inclined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies close to hand that they were naturally forced to adopt these methods because of the actual facts of the social and industrial situation as they found it . It is interesting to find , after the Reconstruction policy was inaugurated , tacit acknowledgement on the part of its representatives of the correctness of the ideal aimed at in these black codes . The heads of the Freedmen 's Bureau repeatedly advised the freedmen to remain at home , to seek permanent employment , but this advice was seldom taken . The military commander at Columbus , Mississippi , referred in a proclamation to the idleness of the freedmen and stated that they must " retire to their homes and seek employment elsewhere . " Idle freedmen were ordered out of Vicksburg and Natchez by the commanders in those places . It was alleged that the freedmen in Mississippi in the summer of ' 65 were in destitute circumstances and 182,899 rations were furnished them , while at the same time there was a demand for 50,000 more laborers and it was stated that there was no good reason for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular was issued by Colonel Thomas warning the Negroes of the complaints being made against them by those seeking labor ; he even " told them that the vagrant laws were right in principle . " In 1868 , after several years of Reconstruction rule ,  | it was stated that in the countries along the Yazoo River in Mississippi , the most fertile lands in the world , " The freedmen were in a destitute condition , mainly because they will not hire out to farmers and planters ? a great number of the latter requiring their services . " 22 Measured in terms of actual facts and with due regard for the desperate economic conditions the status outlined for the freedmen in the black codes was far from being a wicked deceit to re-enslave the Negro . There is little doubt that the objectionable features in these codes , of which we shall speak in a moment , were far outweighed by the ultimate and permanent good that would have resulted both for the freedmen and the community at large had they been given an honest trial . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes were perfect . There can be little doubt that a serious mistake was made in ignoring the question of Negro suffrage . Both Lincoln and Johnson would have accepted in all essential points the status as outlined for the freedmen in these codes , but they felt that the question of Negro suffrage , owing to the ever increasing prominence it was receiving through the efforts of Sumner , ought not to be passed over . President Johnson 's letter of August 15th , 1865 , to Governor Sharkey of Mississippi , is exceedingly suggestive in this connection : " If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution of the United States in English , and write their names , and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at not less than two hundred and fifty dollars , and pay taxes thereon , you would completely disarm the adversary and set an example the other states will follow . This you can do with perfect safety , and you thus place the Southern States , in reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . I hope and trust your convention will do this , and as a consequence the radicals , who are wild upon Negro franchise , will be completely foiled in their attempt to keep the Southern States from renewing their relations to the Union by not accepting their senators and representatives . " Lincoln also , in a letter to Gov . Hahn , the first free state governor of Louisiana , suggests the giving of the franchise to the intelligent  | page deleted  | page deleted  | to eradicate . Furthermore , the aftermath of this era of misrule still lingers , for , when the social consciousness of the section seeks to regulate race relations through legislation , it is constantly in danger of opposing the radical Congressional legislation of Reconstruction days . The patriotic Southern legislator thus finds himself in the unenviable position of trying to pass laws that will give legal sanctions to the principles that have all along underlain the modus vivendi between him= self and the black , without at the same time doing violence to he constitution of the land . Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection of the black codes , the most tragic figure of all was the Negro himself . Entirely innocent as he was of any responsibility for the war , ignorant for the most part of the meaning of the maelstrom of passion and prejudice that broke over his devoted head during reconstruction , it still remains true , as a great Negro leader has said , " I hardly believe that any race of people with similar preparation and similar surroundings would have acted more wisely or very differently from the way the Negro acted during the period of reconstruction . " At the same time we must agree with this same writer when he asserts " it would have been better from any point of view , if the native Southern white man had taken the Negro at the beginning of his freedom , into his political confidence , and exercised an influence and control over him before his political affections were alienated . " Had the intelligent and property-owning class at the South been able to join counsels with the leaders of the North and had both taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done under the benignant genius of Lincoln , that free and enlightening interchange of ideas would have taken place which is always necessary to the solution of great national issues and the dragon 's teeth of reconstruction days would never have been sown and all the inevitable brood of sectionalism , race-antagonism , lawlessness and ignorance which we have not yet outlived would have been in large measure avoided .
