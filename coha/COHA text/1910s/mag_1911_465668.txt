THE righteousness of Puramitra was notorious , and it was evident to all that he had immense faith in his gods . Tie was as strict in the performance of his devotions as in the payment of his debts , nor was there any altar , whether of Brahma , or of Vishnu , or of Shiva , at which he failed to offer both prayers and gifts . He observed the rules of religion and of business with admirable regularity , and enjoyed the reputation of one whose conduct was above reproach . But , being a self-contained man , he had not the love of the little children of the village , to whom he often gave sweetmeats and toys ; and being a very prosperous man . he was not without rivals and detractors , who liked his prosperity the less the more they marveled at it . This was displeasing to Puramitra , though he thought it beneath him to show it . ' if all were known ! " said some people , wagging their heads sagely , as if they were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his luck , " said others , sighing . But when Pm-amitra heard of these things he said , " The fruits of earth ripen by the will of Heaven , and the harvest is on the lap of the gods . " So saying , lie made the sign of reverence , and went his way calmly to a certain place in his garden , where he was accustomed to practise the virtue of meditation and to review his inmost thoughts . Now the inmost thoughts of Puramitra were in the shape of wishes and strong desires- , for which reason , being a religious man , he often called them prayers . They were concerned chiefly with himself . And next to that , with two others : Indraint , his friend , and Vishnamorsu , his enemy . But the motions of friendship are quiet and slow , and much the same from day to day ; whereas the motions of hatred are quick and stirring , and changeful as the colors on a serpent . So Puramitra came to think less and less of his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he returned at sundown to the quiet place in the garden , where an orange-tree shaded his favorite seat with thick , glossy leaves , and surrendered himself to those meditations in which his desires were laid bare to his gods . At first he gave a thought to Indranu , who had helped him , and served him , and always spoken well of him ; and this thought he called love . Then he gave many thoughts to Vislinamorsu , who bad opposed him , and thwarted him , and mocked hint with bitter words and laughter ; and these thoughts he called just indignation . Re reflected upon the many misdeeds and offenses of his enemy with a grave and serious passion ; he considered curiously the various punishments which these misdemeanors must merit aL the hand of Heaven , such as poverty and pain and disgrace and death , and , after that , all the different degrees of damnation ; he turned them over in his mind Elm a hollow ball with a hundred rings carved within it , and they played one into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings a little black figure with the face of Vishnamorsu writhed and twisted . While Puramitra meditated thus upon the justice of the gods and the ill-deserts of his enemy , the tree grew and flourished above him from week to month and from month to year , spreading out its arms to hide and befriend his devotions . The white flowers bloomed and faded with heavy fragrance . The pale-green fruits formed and fell f ruM the tree before their time . But of all their many promises one persisted , clinging to the lowest hough , rounding and ripening among the dark leaves with strange flame and luster ? a fiery globe , intense and perfect as Puramitra 's thought of his enemy . You meditate much , my son , " said a Brahman who knew him well and sometimes visited his garden . " Holy one , " he answered , " I pray . " " For what ? " asked the Brahman . " That the divine will may be done in all ways and upon all things , " replied Puramitra . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked the Brahman . " I did not know , " said the man , " that I had done anything to the tree . " " Look , " said the 13ralunan , and he touched the fruit with the end of his staff . A drop oozed from the saffron globe , red as blood ; and where it fell the grass withered as if a flame had scorched it . Then the heart of Puramitra leaped up within him , for he knew that his inmost thoughts had passed into the course of nature and fructified upon the tree . " Most excellent Brahman , " said he , with great humility . " the fruits of earth ripen by the will of Heaven . " " For whom is this one intended ? " asked the Brahman . " Holiness , " said Puramitra , " it is on the lap of the gods . " So the Brahman pursued his way , and Puramitra his meditations . The next day he ordered an open path made through his gardens ? for the pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the path , ripe and ruddy . " It is on the lap of the gods , " thought Puramitra ; " if the evildoer. stretches fort leis is hand to it , the justice of Heaven will apE So he hid among the hushes at nightfall , and expecte ? rho the event . A man crept slowly along the path and stayed beneath the tree . His face was concealed by a cloak ; but the watcher said , " I shall know him hy hit actions , for my enemy will not respect that which is mine . " Now the man was thinking shame and scorn of the rich owner of the garden , and despising the prosperity of wiles and wickedness . So he hated and contemned the fruit , saying to ? himself , " God forbid that I should touch anything that belongs to the wretch Puramitra . ' And the path grew darker . Soon after came another man , walking with uncovered head . ? but his face could not be discerned because of the shadow . And the watcher said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The man went freely and easily , without care , and when he came to the fruit he put out his hand and took it , saying to himself , " The benevolent Puramitra will be glad that I should have this , for he is good to all his friends ! ' So he ate of the fruit , and fell at the foot of the tree . 04 Then Puramitra came running , and lifted up the dead man , anti looked upon his face . And it was the face , of his friend , the well-beloved Indrann . So Puramitra wept aloud , and tore his hair , and his heart went black within him . And Vishnamorsu , returning through the gar-den by another path , heard the lamentable noise , and came near , arid laughed . But the Brahman. passing homeward , looked upon the three , and said , " The ways of the gods are secret ; but the hap-piest of these is Indranu. " ride on , then , till we find a cousin to loan us a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " By my sore seat , " laughed Harcourt , " we 'll ride no farther to-night . Here we light , at the sign of the Magpie in the Moon . The rogues of Farborough Cross have trimmed us well ; the honest folk of Market Farborough shall feed us better ! " " For a crooked sixpence ! " grumbled Barton . " Will you beg our entertainment like a pair of lamilopers , or will you take it by force like our late friends on the road ? " " Neither , " said Harcourt , " but in the fashion that befits gentlemen ? with a bold face , a gay tongue , and a fine coat well carried . Remember , Dick , look up , and no sniveling ! Tell your ill-fortune and you bid for more . ' Tie Monsieur Debonair that owns the tavern . " Their lusty shouts brought the hostler on the trot to take their steaming horses , and the landlord stood in the open door , his broad face a welcome to such handsome guests . They entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best it contained as if it were just good enough . The whole house was awake and astir with their coming . The smiling maids ran to and fro ; the rustics in the long room stared and admired : the table was spread with a fair cloth and loaded with a smoking supper ; and afterward there were pots of ale for all the company , and a song with a chorus . The landlord , with his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat , patted himself to see his business go so merrily . But the landlady came to the door , now and then , and looked in with anxious eyes . " Mark the mistress , " whispered Barton ; " she has her suspicions . " " IIer troubles , " answered Harcourt , " and that I relish not . I will have all happy around me , else my spirit sinks and the game is lost . I 'll talk with her . " He beckoned her to his side with a courteous gesture . " A famous supper , Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too do , - neast for the maker of such a masterpiece . What is it that ails ; rou ? " " It is my child , " she answered ; " kind sir , my little Faith is ill of fever , and the physician has been called away . He has left her a draught , but she grows worse , and the fever holds her from sleep . It may be that you know something of the healing art . " " As much as any man , " said Harcourt , confidently . " You see in me , despite my youth , a practitioner of the oldest school in the world , a disciple of Galen 's grandfather . Let me go with you to look at the child . " The little girl lay in a close room . Her curls were tangled on the pillow and her thin , brown arms tossed on the hot counterpane . By her side was a glass of some dark medicine , and her black eyes held more of rebellion than of fever as she gazed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothing her wrists lightly , with slow , downward touches , and whispering in her ear . The sound of the singing below came through the door ajar , and the child listened to her visitor as if he were telling her a wonderful tale . " Open the window , " he said , after a while , to the mother , pulling the sheet softly over the child 's shoulders , " the air to-night is full of silver threads which draw away the fever . " Then he threw the black draught OM of the window . And the child , watching him , laughed a little . " It is the wrong medicine , " said he . " Bring me paper and pen . " He wrote by the light of the flickering candle , hiding the words with his other hand : Forilne favor Faith . Then he slipped the crooked sixpence into the paper , folded it carefully , tucking the ends one into the other , and marked it with a cross . " Hold it tight , " he said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the little packet . " It will let you into the Garden of Good Dreams . And now your carriage is ready , and now your horses are trotting , gently , gently , quickly , softly , along the white moon-road , to the Land of Nod . Will you go ? are you going ? are you gone ? " Her eyelids drooped and fell , and she turned on her right side with a sigh , thrusting her brown fist under the pillow . Harcourt drew the mother to the door . " Hush , " he whispered ; " leave the window wide . Your Faith holds an ancient potent charm , thousands of years old , better than all medicines . Do not speak of it to any one . if you open it , you will lose it . Let her sleep with it so , and bring it me on the morrow . " In the morning , when the landlord had served breakfast with his own hands , Harcourt called boldly for the bill ; and Barton stared at him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stammered ? " you must excuse her , gentler 211 , nothing will do but she must speak with you herself abou the reckoning . go call her . " She came with a wonder of gladness in her face , and the little girl clinging to a fold of her mother 's ? dress by the left hand and pressing the other brown fist close to her neck . " You see , " said the mother . " She is well ! Run , Faith , and kiss the gentleman 's hand . Oh , sir , there can be no talk of payment between us -- we are deep in your debt ; but if my child might keep this ancient potent charm ? " The question hung in her voice . Harcourt delayed a moment , as if in doubt , before he answered , smiling ; " I am loath to part from it , " he said , at last , " but since she has proved it . lei ; her keep it and believe in it for good ? never for evil . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the hand ! " her cure , saying that it was beyond her power . The doctor was bitter against her , as an unlawful person ; and the parson condemned her , though she came often to church ; " for , " said he , " the Scripture commands us , ' Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live . ' " The face of the Judge was troubled . " Tell me , " be said , leaning forward and speaking gravely , " are you a witch ? " " Not for evil , my Lord , " answered the woman , simply , " but I have a healing gift . " " How do you work your cures ? " he asked . " What do you to the children ? " " I open the windows of the room where they lie , " she answered . The face of the Judge relaxed , and his eyes twinkled kindly . " And then ? " said he . " I throw the medicine out of the window and tell the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that all ? " said the Judge , shading his face with his hand . " No , my Lord , " replied the woman . " When the childi:en are near to sleep , I put my charm in their hands . " " Whence had you this charm ? " he said . " And what is it ? " " I pray your Lordship , " cried the woman , " ask me not , for can never tell . " " Let me see it , " said the Judge , with a smile . So the woman , trembling and reluctant , drew a dark-red ribbon from her breast , and at the end of it a packet of fine linen bound closely with white silk . She laid it before the Judge . He broke the silken thread and unrolled the linen , fold after fold , until he came i.e a yellow piece of paper with writing on it , and in the paper a crooked sixpence of King James . The coin and the scrap of paper lay in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of Sir Richard . " Yes , " answered the Baron Harcourt in a low voice , " you have seen the coin before , and now you may read what is written on the paper . " " - Now I know , " said Sir Richard , shaking his head , " what charm you gave to the woman and her child forty years ago . Was I not right ? It was a deception . " " Who knows ? " said the Baron Harcourt , cheerfully . " It has worked well to-day . Fortune has favored Faith . " He turned to the clerk . " Make record that this case is dismissed for want of evidence against the accused . The woman has done no harm . The court is adjourned . " " And my charm , " said the woman , eagerly ? " oh , my Lord , you will give me back my charm ? " " That I must keep for you , " he said , with kindness , as to a child . " But you may still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell the children of the Garden of Good Dreams . Trust me , that will work wonders . "
