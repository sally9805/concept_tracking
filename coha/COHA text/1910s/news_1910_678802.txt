txt A Corporation Tax Perplexity . Officers of corporations attempting to make return of " annual net income " under Form No. 6S8 Issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue , will have their perplexities increased by a blunder in the make up of the form . The act permits a corporation to deduct " interest actually paid within the year on its bonded or other indebtedness . " In the form as printed lthe item for such deduction is : . " 6 . Total amount of interest Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 on bonded 1'I indebtedness , " omitting the words " Or other . " The effect , of course , of a return in this form I is to exclude interest on all indebtedness except on bonds , although the law clearly permits deduction of all interest . In reply to a letter to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue calling attention to this omission , he states that the words " or other " were omitted from the form through error . He further stated that as the regulations were explicit on this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two words would not cause any inconvenience . In this I think he is quite mistaken . I know that some officials have puzzled over the return , and I think It likely to cause considerable perplexity and inconvenience to many others . The proper thing to do in- the absence of a revised - and corrected form is to insert the words " or other " after the word " bonded , " so that it will read " interest on bonded or other indebtedness.
