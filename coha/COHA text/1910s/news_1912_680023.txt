No easier Is it to see how the Judge could help sentencing them to the punishment provided by law for the offense committed . Not only were the accusations proved by many witnesses who told what everybody knew , but the defendants themselves made no attempt to deny that they bad organized , armed , and incited to action the little army of feminine window-smashers . All that the defendants could do was to plead that , as their motives for destroy ing property were different from those that ordinarily lead to such conduct , so their treatment should be different from that which would have been accorded to , and been deserved by , other people , who had done the same thing . In other words , they asked to be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a request that Is reasonable or unreasonable , according to the point of view  --  and to the occupant of the point of view . ' Unquestionably , if the windowsmashing was but a preliminary episode in a eticeosful revolution , its lawlessness will be as soon forgotten as was that of the rioters who threw the tea into Boston Harbor , and the participants In It have a chance as good as was that of the counterfeit Indians to play a. heroic role in popular legend . But the women , less fortunate than the Tea Party mob , or less backed up by public opinion , were arrested and tried for their deeds , not their motives , and It looks as if they would have to go to jaiL The British authorities must regret this , for the imprisonment of these people will make them martyrs to opinion in the estimation of their followers , and even outside of that circle there will be a disturbing realization of the fact that they are not ordinary criminals  --  that they are in truth " politicals , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women who do much worse things than break windows . Imprisonment , hangings , beheadings  --  these are futile punishments when they inflict no disgrace and leave no taint . Our own Judges might attain both consistency and safety in such a case by passing sentence on the convicts and then suspending it . Presumably , ? t h e Policing Is members of the Fifth Done Avenue Association Best took thought as to by Policemen . what they were going to do before they began the organizing of their " Special Patrol " for the improvement of conditions in that ? thoroughfare .

For one thing , in spite of laborious denial that any reflection upon the regular policemen was intended , the implication is clear that they are not doing all that could be done , and therefore all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenue free from objectionable persons and of giving information and assistance to those whose presence is desirable . This may be  --  probably is  --  true , since even Fifth Avenue policemen sometimes ' miss perfection in conduct and judgment . But the way to remedy the faults of the Policemen is not to be found in the psi , vate hiring of other men to do police work . It Is in creating an effective demand for improvement in the force . If the need is for more rather than for better policemen , that , too , should be met by the city as a whole , not by the people hying or doing business on one street . There is a general and well-founded antagonism to the performance of distinctly public duties by others than officials responsible to the whole public .. Some good work that would otherwise have been neglected has been done in that manner , Indeed , but - its inevitable tendency is to make ' the municipality shirk its natural tasks , and it not infraquently leads to abuses of ill-defined and vaguely regulated powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalous and rather ridiculous status , and any exercise of authority by them is so nearly certain to be resented that It will be little less than incitement to break the peace . As mere Perambulating Bureaus of Information for visiting rustics they would not be Particularly objectionable , but if they are really needed , even for that , the city had better appoint , pay , and control them . When the . Columbia Outrageous , sophomores noisily inbut Let 's vaded at night the Be Cautious . halls of the dormitories occupied by the University 's feminine students , they were guilty of one of those blazing indiscretions , one of those outrageous stupidities , for which excuse , such as it is , can be found only in the biologist 's dictum that " ontogenY repeats phylogcny .

Hence Is It , probably , that when confronted with some keenly irritating episode like this , the charitably inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after conquering his first anger , remembers that on the way from primordial protoplasm our ancestors were for a while  --  and not so long ago  --  savages and barbarians , impulsive , unintelligent , and with no manners except bad ones . All these qualities the sophomores illustrated in their raid . Indignation can still be Just , however , and there is no need to exaggerate the gravity of their offense . Nobody charges them with any of the intrinsically serious improprieties of speech or act . They observed the common decencies of both , in their invasion , and It is reported that they are sincerely repentant of what they did  --  and sincerely frightened as they reflect upon its possible consequences . Of course , the university authorities must take vigorous action , and action that will be both punitive and deterrent , but , in the circumstances , not many , if any , actual expulsions would seem to be necessary . It might be interesting if the determination of the penalty were left to the victims of the affront . That would at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we have women Judges , a blessing the speedy approach of which so many are prophesying.
