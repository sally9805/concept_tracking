txt Mrs. Emilia K. Hess of 412 West One Hundred and Forty-eighth street can prove that shoe prices are going up . Mrs. Hess has trouble with her feet . Walking is painful and ordinary ready-to-wear shoes she ca n't use . Therefore she signed a contract with a shoe company to pay $900 for a pair of shoes in which she could locomote with ease . The company is suing her for an unpaid balance of $700 , and the contract is part of the evidence in the case . By it she gave $200 when the shoes were ordered and was to give $150 when they were completed and $50 on the tenth of every following month until the total amount was paid . Had she kept her contract she would have owned the shoes free and clear by the summer of 1920 , but she be ? came convinced that a $25 pair of shoes would serve her just as well and she stopped payment . And she wants her $200 back .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
