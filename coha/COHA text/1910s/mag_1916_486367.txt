Mr. Britling is an English author of international reputation and satisfactory royalties , occupying the centre of a rather diffuse but comfortable household at Matchings Easy in the county of Essex . His renown attracts the attention of the Massa , chusetts Society for the Study of Contemporary Thought , which " had decided , " like many similar organizations in America , " not to hunt out the best thought in its merely germinating stages , but to wait until it had emerged and flowered to some trustworthy recognition , and then , rather than toil through recondite and possibly already reconsidered books and writings generally , to offer an impressive fee to the emerged new thinker , and to invite him to come to them and to lecture to them and to have a conference with them , and to tell them simply , competently , and completely at first hand just all that he was about . " Mr. Direck , the secretary of the Society , a young man " after the fashion of that clean and pleasant-looking person one sees in the advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate with the English celebrity . Detained for some time at Matchings Easy by an accident , he sees the great man  --  now entangled in his eighth affair of the heart  --  informal , charming , voluble , pouring a cataract of bright talk over his visitor , his second wife , his children , his secretary , his Boswell ? Herr Heinrich , an East Indian , an aunt , Letty , and the infatuating Miss Corner with " merciful " Into this group , rather delightfully dling along in its pleasant corner of Britling thoroughly understands his position , and , theoretically , sympathizes with it ; and yet the Laodicean temperature of the man becomes , after the outbreak of the war , so damnably inappropriate in his house that , in a fit of uncontrollable irritation , he stalks from the room where they have been talking , and slams the door behind him . In redeeming himself for sentimental reasons unconnected with his principles , Mr. Direck is probably American enough . The most interesting role , in some ways , is played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctorate in philology , Herr Heinrich . His sketch is a little of a caricature , but just a little ; and he is fondly , he is affectionately , done . One loves the poor boy with all his stupid , humorless , wide-eyed literalness . One is made to feel that there is not a particle of harm in him . He is simply the helpless creature of a system which he did not create , and which he can not even conceive of resisting . He " does " his philology because he has to do it . He is interested in Esperanto as a world-language ; and he has his dreams of a world state . But when the summons comes , he joins his regiment , because he has to join it . His reluctance and bewilderment at dropping his scientific pursuits and his subsequent fate are treated with genuine pathos  --  with merited pathos . It refreshes one 's faith in humanity to see an Englishman in this hour handling a German like Herr Heinrich with such understanding tenderness . Though Mr. Britling has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author does not appear to us to have made any great strides in his acquaintance with the " feminine heart , " or rather in ' his ability to depict it . The women in this book are , however , though not of much consequence in the story , intermittently successful . The infatuating Miss Corner is a poor thing ; but those " merciful " eyes are fetching ; and she does give poor Mr. Direck one quite ecstatic kiss : " Oectly stood up to him as straight as a spear , with gifts an her clear eves . " Mr. Wells renders , as finely as any man going , the ecstatic moment or two in the first contact of fresh , clean young lovers ; and he has done it before . He renders here , also , with exact delineation of the business , the decay of passion in a couple of philandering old ones : " And , after the fashion of our still top adolescent world , Mr. Britling and Mrs. Harrowdean proceeded to negotiate these extremely unromantic matters in the phrases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the only language available , " etc . " Proceeded to negotiate " ? a wonderful phrase ! Old Aunt Wilshire , after she is blown to pieces by a Zeppelin bomb over her game of " patience " in the village of Filmington-on-Sea , is dreadfully effective . The widowed Letty is effective for the page in which she vents her intense personal hatred of the Kaiser and his kin ; she would have fear hound him till his coffin goes down into the grave  --  such things are felt and uttered . There are a good many capital little sketches of men and women whom we have not mentioned . The masterpiece is , of course , Mr. Britling . That interesting gentleman is a transparent portrait of Mr. Wells  --  an amazingly frank portrait . He has never before produced so engaging a likeness of himself . We are not speaking about his private life , of which we know nothing , but of his ideas , his imaginative sympathies , his character as a man of leters . We have frequently thought of him as rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelleyan in his emotional tendency ; as somewhat diffuse and commercial in his literary character . He has made a god of " becoming " ; his intellectual fluency and versatility have , in the past been his undoing , making him seem an instable , an unformed power , a nebulous nucleus of dissolving impulses . Mr. Chesterton once remarked that one can hear Mr. Wells growing overnight . The war has been a long and formative night . He has emerged with a book which impresses one as not moonstruck , but sunlit . The fact is , apparently , that he has at last , to borrow his own figure , " felt in his skin " what he has been only talking about for a quarter of a century . He has felt in his skin what is wrong with the world . The effect of futility in a great many of his novels is directly traceable to his endeavor  --  as one felt , a questionably sincere endeavor  --  to persuade us that something which is in fact of very little importance was a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fluent heroes  --  and his heroines . In order that some fluent hero or heroine might philander for a year or six months  --  till the impulse abated ? and philander in tranquillity , he has repeatedly tried to persuade us that ' uman nature should be altered and the world reconstituted . Now , the world needs reconstitution , and human nature needs alteration ; but not for that purpose ! And it was difficult to believe that a man with Mr. Wells 's abundant and wholesome comic sense , and with his free-playing intelligence , could sincerely weigh or consider that purpose ; or fail to see the absurdity of clamoring for order , measure , and - control in the external world while reserving a silly and sentimental little anarchy in the heart . Well , in this respect as in many others the great war , with its multitudinous public and private calamities pressing daily nearer and nearer to the heart of the household at Matchings Easy , brings Mr. W ? , brings Mr. Britling to his senses . Through the first selfish panic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinned sardines ; through the days when one watched with growing astonishment , yet with an aloof spectatorial air , the thunderous trampling and rush of theGermans towards Paris ; through the period of agitated unpreparedness , and apathetic and mismanaged recruiting and drilling without uniforms or rifles , and Churchill-excursions to Constantinople ; through the tedious wintry sieges ; throughthe months when all the villages of England began to fill with Belgian exiles , and with wounded sons , and with English widows and orphans , and to sleep and shudder under the peril of the skies  --  through all this commotion the distinguished speculative author , Mr. Britling , settles earthwards till his feet are planted firmly upon " the realities . " Incidentally , his eighth affair of the heart , which in the piping times of peace would have required to be elaborated into one of these " soulful " romances , sinks into exactly the place of contemptible insignificance which it deserves . We have quoted in these pages some of the popular follies of Mr. Wells on the " sex-question " ; let us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes of nature that had produced Mr. Britling had implanted in him an obstinate persuasion that somewhere in the world , from some human being , it was still possible to find the utmost satisfaction for every need and craving . He could imagine as existing , as waiting for him , he knew not where , a completeness of understanding , a perfection of response , that would reach all the gamut of his feelings and sensations from the most poetical to the most entirely physical , a beauty of relationship so transfiguring that not only would she  --  it went without saying that this completion was a woman  --  be perfectly beautiful in its light , but what was manifestly more incredible , that he too would be perfectly beautiful and quite at ease . Thus far , Mr. Britling describes what we have called the " unrealistic and Shelleyan emotional tendency " of Mr. Wells . Now listen to Mr. Britling 's comment upon this ten-dency : This persuasion is as foolish as though a camel hoped that some day it would drink from such a spring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brithng ignored its presence in his mind , and resisted the impulses it started . But at odd times , and more particularly in the afternoon and while travelling and in between books , Mr. Britling so far succumbed to this strange expectation of a wonder round the corner that he slipped the anchor of his humour and self-contempt and joined the great cruising brotherhood of the Pilgrims of Love . . . . For some years the suspicion had been growing up in Mr. Britling 's mind that in planting this persuasion in his being , the mysterious processes of Nature had been , perhaps for some purely biological purpose , pulling , as people say , his leg ; that there were not these perfect responses , that loving a woman is a thing one does thoroughly once for all  --  or so  --  and afterwards recalls regrettably in a series of vain repetitions , and that the career of the Pilgrim of Love , so soon as you strip off its credulous glamour , is either the most pitiful or the most vulgar and vile of perversions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these pages to Mr. Wells 's tendency to trust the instinctive self ; let us hear Mr. Britling quote the wisdom which his son learned in the trenches : " In a crisis , " he concluded , " there is no telling what will get hold of a man , his higher instincts or his lower . He may show courageof a very splendid sort  --  or a hasty discretion . A habit is much more trustworthy than an instinct . So discipline sets up a habit of steady and courageous bearing . If you keep your head you are at liberty to be splendid . If you lose it , the habit will carry you through . " ? We have referred to Mr. Wells 's rather material and external conceptions of felicity and of the " means of salvation " ; let us hear Mr. Britling theologizing : A finite God who struggles in his great comprehensive way as we struggle in our weak and silly way  --  who is with us  --  that is the essence of all real religion . . . God is within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  beyond good and ill , beyond space and time , a mystery everlastingly impenetrable . God is nearer than that . Necessity is the uttermost thing , but God is the innermost thing . Closer He is than breathing and nearer than hands and feet . He is the Other Thing than this world . Greater than Nature or Necessity , for he is a spirit and they are blind , but not controlling them . . Not yet . . . . The real " inwardness " of Mr. Britling 's reaction to the war may perhaps best be suggested by the words which come into his mind as he stands on the scene of a Zeppelin raid : Some train of subconscious suggestion brought a long-forgotten speech back into Mr. Brithng 's mind , a speech that is full of that light which still seeks so mysteriously and indefatigably to break through the darkness and thickness of the human mind our italics . He whispered the words . No unfamiliar words could have had the same effect of comfort and conviction . He whispered it of those men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the clear freezing air beneath the stars , those muffled sailors and engineers who had caused so much pain and agony in this little town . " Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . " Is this hypocrisy and an insufferable literary pose on the part of Mr. Britling ? Or is it just as sincere as his son 's " Damn the Kaiser  --  and all fools " ? One accepts its sincerity . For Mr. Britling has been taking medicine , bitter and purgative , to his soul 's great good . He has brought " the Zeppelin raids , with their slow crescendo of bloodstained futility , " into connection with " the same kind of experience that our ships have inflicted scores of times in the past upon innocent people in the villages of Africa and Polynesia . " These terrible incursions were a part of that mechanical " efficiency " which the Germans had and the English had not , but which Mr. Kipling and Mr. Wells and others had long been urging upon the British as the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the truth glimmering in Mr. Britling 's mind . It was the way to something  --  perhaps to more efficiency , but not to salvation . That lay by a route which the footsteps of the imperial dream have never trod . And so Mr. Britling was honestly " no longer thinking of the Germans as diabolical . They were - human ; they had a case . It was a stupid case , but our case , too , was a stupid case . How stupid were all our cases ! What was it we missed ? Something , he felt , very close to us , and very elusive . Something that would resolve a hundred tangled oppositions . " Mr. Wells and Mr. Britling have written in the course of the war a good many pamphlets on what should be done after it . Mr. Britling criticises his contributions thus : " Dissertations , " said Mr. Brithng . Never had it been so plain to Mr. Britling that he was a weak , silly , ill-informed , and hasty-minded writer , and never had he felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and that it fell to him to take some part in the establishment oS- a new order of living upon the earth ; it might be the most trivial part by the scale of the task , but for him it was to be now his supreme concern . Those who wish to share in the task may be recommended to try rewriting the letter Which Mr. Britling addressed to the parents of Herr Heinrich.
