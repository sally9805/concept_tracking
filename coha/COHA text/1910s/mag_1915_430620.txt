LOVING , helpful sympathy and intuition are the powers which place the mother high in educational ability . It is in the first three or four wears of life that she holds the key to the emotional and moral nature of her child . If we wish our children 's powers of soul , mind , and body to unfold naturally to the stimuli of their environment , we mustbegin the child 's education in the nursery . Early educational training , if not enforced at the expense of health and happiness , will bring great joy to the mother , who has the first opportunity to develop her child mentally , and who misses a great happiness if she gives her little ones over completely t o the care of others . It is at this time that she should enter into Froebel 's spirit of living with the child instead of for the child , as so many mistakenly do ; and she should make notes of the gradual unfolding of the little mind , in order that she may have this knowledge as a guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of training and development which will be used when her child passes on to the educational direction of other teachers . Professor Sully says , in his " Studies of Childhood , " that the mother 's patient , brooding watchfulness is needed quite as much as the father 's keen analytic vision . In the study of the individual child . the cooperation of the mother is indispensable , as the knowledge gained by others never equals that of the mother ; and as all teaching of the very young , to be effectual , must be a work of love , the ' mother is the natural teacher at first , for she has the instinctive love for the child which is the essential requirement . But we seem to expect that mothers should know through some divine instinct , without any study or preparation , just how to handle their children . This is our first mistake . This ignorance , however , is being cleared away through a work that is making itself felt . Facts are being learned at the cost of much suffering to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new knowledge the future looks brighter than the past . Our instincts can not be relied upon when it comes to understanding a child 's mind , the meaning of his activity , and how best to guide his normal development . Many misunderstandings and heart-breaks occur between parents and children as a result of mistakes that could have been avoided by a knowledge of the nature of the child 's mind . I remember an instance of a mother 's appealing to me for help in overcoming stubbornness in her boy of five . On investigation I found that he was not at all stubborn , but the mother was trying , in the old-fashioned way , to make the child obey without rhyme or reason A few words of counsel to the  | mother and of explanation to the son set both on a new and happier path . Some children must be handled gently , because , if handled otherwise , they will become stubborn . Such children are usually high-spirited and altogether worth while in every way , but they , of all children , need intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the nature of their children through sympathetic insight , quick observation , and the application of sound sense to the problems that arise . There is no universal formula for the bringing up of children , one that can be applied- to all children everywhere and always , any more than there is a universal formula for fertilizing soil , or curing disease , or feeding babies . Yet there are certain general laws of child development , and certain general principles of child training , which have been derived from scientific studies of children and which agree with the best thought and experience of those who have learned to know their children without the help of science . These general laws and principles may profitably be learned and used by parents in bringing up the rising generation . There is much to he done before school begins . It is not wise to wait . It is possible for any mother to save herself much care and worry , and to do much better for her child by shaping with a compelling hand the environment of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time that a correct habit of body and mind may be laid with very little effort . It is also the time when many a child 's life develops an impulse towarrd bad habits that may be difficult to overcome in later years . If during the first six months a regular regime has been established in regard to hours of feeding , sleeping , bathing , and-letting alone , the mother will , by this time , have leisure to consider the needs of the awakening mind . Regularity in nursery routine , with its result showing in the serenity of the child , will give opportunity for study as to_the how best to meet the new requirements from day to day , and also leave the mother time to make records of daily development to which she may refer in the questions which will arise in the future regarding her child 's guidance and studies . Compayre says , in his " Lectures on Pedagogy , " that the better the child 's health and the better he is fed , the more activity he has to dispense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , inasmuch as physical care favors intellectual growth from the very first , that mothers should provide intelligently for physical needs and beware of restraining this motor faculty , unless it is excessive . Compayre thus points out the necessity of free play for even the babe . How to provide intelligently for physical needs is a problem that is constantly before parents and physicians . The science of food and hygiene has entered so largely into the study of medicine that preventive medicine has become one of the great features of education . A physician 's intelligent effort , however , may be wasted through lack of knowledge upon the part of the mother . She herself needs to know why and how diet must be adapted to the powers and age of the constitution receiving it , in order that the blood may receive from that diet its new supply , and mind and ? body receive their nourishment and their fortification against inherited tendencies to various diseases . Many so-called children 's diseases , and many deplorably weak mental conditions would disappear under strict supervision of hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resultant throat , catarrhal , and nervous troubles . Nature resents carelessness , and is relentless in her punishments . What the doctor calls cholera infantum , rickets , marasmus , or slow mental development , and the mother is often inclined to consider a dispensation of providence , is only too frequently the direct result of violations of the most common laws of domestic science . Domestic knowledge must be supplied to mothers by scientists , by physicians , by educators , and by those among the general public and the press who are sufficiently interested in the subject to assist . Out of this condition has sprung the study of Mothercraft . But the science of household affairs and the making of homes should first be thoroughly understood , then simplified results should be given to the public in such a manner and through such means as to be readily comprehended and assimilable . All mothers and home-makers in the land , our indirect nation-makers , would then come to understand easily the underlying principles involved in their tasks and would be capable of applying them in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent efforts in this field . Herbert Spencer says : " Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and  | mind will both be adequately cared for as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation of health is a duty . Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality . Men 's habitual words and acts imply the idea that they are at liberty to treat their bodies as they please .... The fact is , that all breaches of the laws of health are physical sins . When this is generally seen , then , and perhaps not till then , will the physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves . " The Mother 's Task and Privilege Dr. Preyer , author of " Infant Mind , " whose work in child-study is known throughout the world , says the controlling supervision of the physical development in childhood is the most important task of the young mother . Let her guard and use this privilege well . Then when she sends her child away to begin his life-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power with which he can easily handle the problems that will confront him , and that she has not only given him this power , but that she has done it in , a way that has not hindered his physical growth , the soundness of which will determine largely his whole future intellectual and moral life . It is not enough to tell a child what to do ; we must show or let him learn how to do it , and see that it is done . It is not enough to enact laws if we do not take care that they are put into practise and adopted as habits . No matter what the plan for the home training of the child may be , it is unnecessary to institute any formal method of instruction , but a safe principle of nursery and home education is the bringing out and development of the natural qualifications of the child . It is of primary importance that he be surrounded by those who are habitually kind , gentle , and honest . Such persons are difficult to find in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon generally to care for children . No greater mistake can be made by the mother than to place her child in the daily care of a servant who is ill-tempered , perhaps dishonest , and often malicious . A caretaker of this class will teach a child to deceive very successfully . Children who are handled by careless and ignorant servants invariably show lack of self-control and little consideration for others . The regularity which must be practised in the nursery to keep an infant healthy has an educational influence as well . As it learns by experience that its wants are supplied at a regular time , it becomes accus- tomed to an element of regularity and reliability . If it is not indulged whenever it cries , it soon learns the value of self-control . Regularity and self-control are large factors in forming discipline , and thus , unconsciously , even the infant can receive it . All so-called discipline ? in the sense of breaking the will of the child ? is to be absolutely forbidden . It breeds obstinacy , deception , nervous conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their foundations laid in the first twelve months of . nursery life if great care be not exercised to have kind , sympathetic , yet perfectly just treatment for even this early period . Early Precautions Necessary Under the Pestalozzian principle of letting alone , with undetected supervision in a carefully guarded environment which supplies a great number of centers of interest full of indirect suggestion , a mother may work wonders with her children . But no formal teaching should be allowed for the first seven years at least . If all questions are carefully answered , and effort is made to see that the answers are clearly understood , the child will learn naturally all that it is good for him to acquire at this tender age . Servants should be instructed to refer the child to his parents for answers to all questions they do not themselves know enough to answer , and sufficient supervision should be given to see that this is done . Baby-talk should be forbidden . Care should be taken to enunciate distinctly . Surroundings should be carefully planned to meet growing needs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will develop spontaneously a self-activity as the result ( I ) of suggestion , based upon a carefully considered environment ; ( 2 ) of accurate and sympathetic explanation , given only when asked for ; and ( 3 ) of carefully graded steps that are taken one at a time . Restraint upon the part of the parent or teacher is necessary to prevent giving more information than can be absorbed . To satisfy the motor activity of the healthy child is a study in itself . Happy frolics with the baby will show the observant mother their value in baby 's development . Beneath simple nursery doings , antics , and merry capers , the student-mother will easily discern the germs of future growth . Play is one of the most important means of education for the infant and the child . The more we study the growth of the mind ,  | the more clearly we shall see how these seeming trifles minister to it . The mother 's play with the child , even as practised by the most ignorant mother , educates him , " leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest food mentally must correspond , in a way , to his first physical food , and should also be supplied by the mother . It must be simple , yet contain elements to nourish every part ; it must not have much variety , variety having its rightful place at a later stage . The quality of sameness which marks the early physical diet of the child indicates the corresponding characteristic , the repetition of the familiar , which should prevail in the mental diet . The mother 's play does this . The child who does not receive it suffers greatly in mental development . To prove this , you need only visit an infant asylum and watch the babies through the first weeks of their existence ? if they live that long . They have everything except that caressing , motherly play which they need and which charity can not give and , if they live , they show a dreary apathy and morbid condition . The mother usually sings while playing with her baby ; but even when she only talks to him , her voice gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reaches , besides , his emotional nature . Good-Intentioned Pests Emilie Poulsson , the famous kindergartner , says in " Love and Law in Child Training " : " Let the mother be very wary of allowing her child to be a plaything for every chance friend ; let her sedulously guard it . from being tickled and trotted and handled by affectionate , but inconsiderate , admirers . People often pet and caress babies out of selfish impulse rather than out of any thought for the baby 's pleasure or good . But let the mother not disobey those promptings of her heart which lead her , the baby 's heaven-appointed minister , to play often with her baby ; adding to the worth of what she does instinctively by doing it intelligently . Insight into what play can do will help her to defend her baby 's developing life from influences which would unduly hasten that development or thwart it on any side . " Froebel speaks usually of the mother 's playing with the baby . This does not mean that no one else is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does use them should be as intimate , wise , and loving a friend of the baby as the typical mother . It is entirely practicable for the mother to follow Froebel 's theory of inducing and guiding in the nursery a self-activity which will eventually develop power , cultivate observation and memory , produce accuracy , teach a child to think ; in short , develop every faculty a child may possess , and enable it to educate itself easily by giving it a technique , so to speak , and a desire for study , which will continue through a lifetime if it is not dulled by routine method during the period following nursery life , after which time only should instruction become formal . This method of training also affords the parent an opportunity for discovering inherent weaknesses and removing them by encouraging and sympathetic influences ; for , as Mrs. Felix Adler says : " Children are sure to distress and discourage us , but we must not make the mistake of overlooking the light parts that balance the dark shadows . . . . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good ones will enable us to eradicate the evil ones . " The Right and the Wrong Attitude It is in the constant supervision with wise and gentle guidance that the necessary work for the mother lies , not in the actual labor involved , which may be regulated according to circumstances . The usual attitude of the parent not versed in child-study is one of skepticism and antagonism to change . A very frequent excuse offered by such a parent for the careless training of children , and the consequent arrest of their physical , mental , and mora development , is that there are too man ) other duties pressing upon them to allow of sufficient attention to these things . Om of the greatest results to be hoped for iron child study is to show just such parent : how- much easier it is to develop good that evil in all children , and that letting well enough alone will never yield the greatest development of character , the true aim o education . The practical application o this study must begin in the nursery and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be in touch one with the other . Sympathy and suggestion must go hand in hand with trained method one is as necessary as the othe ? but the mother 's work must come first for she it is who has the first opportunity  |
