WE sorely need a clearer conception of the truth . We need it in the business of living ; especially as a means of avoiding misunderstandings . If we have an abstract idea of what the truth is , we are less likely to err in the belief that we are right before we know the truth . In adventuring upon a theory which for the past few years has seemed to me to hold , we shall hardly be charged with applying new meanings to old words if we say that facts and the truth are not the same . Facts are parts of the truth , just as wheels , rods , levers , and the like , are parts of a madiine . If we say ' the whole truth ' every time we refer to the truth , it might make the idea more clear , but let us agree to consider it so , without the need of saying two words where one will do . If you strike me , that becomes a fact as soon as you have done it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact and not a question of truth . The truth may be that you struck me to call my attention to impending danger , or you may have struck me in anger , or the blow may be an unimportant episode in a long fight between us . VOL. 116-NO. 4 The truth , as I conceive it , is all the facts in their right or correct relation ; the relation which they must bear to each other when the truth is attained . Thus the truth becomes an abstract thing , because we know what it is , although we may not know it . Rarely , indeed , are we able to gather all the facts in relation to a subject , on the one hand , or to correlate them , on the other ; nevertheless we must do this if we would know the truth . If this definition is unfamiliar , if we are not accustomed to consider the truth in this sense , I think it will do us no harm to bear it in mind . In courts of law , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are fortunately under no obligation to order our thinking according to processes of law . If we exalt the truth and reverence it , the glib and hysterical brothers and sisters who , grasping a single fact , proceed to preach that and that only as the truth , will cause us less annoyance . We may acknowledge their facts as facts , ? which is all they can ask of us . If we still remain unconvinced of the truth of their preachments we shall be contradicting no one . The truth is very great , very large , and when Lessing prayed that to him be given the priv- ilege to seek the truth rather than to know it , because to know it he was not worthy , he spoke as one of the wisest of men . To seek it , to get nearer to it , sometimes perhaps to get a glimpse of it , is all that we may hope for ; it is the best that we can do . Suppose you and I look at a tree on a hillside . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree is green . The tree is green ; that is a fact . Let us make a note of it . Then suppose we go a distance away and look at it again . The tree is blue . It is idle for us to say , It seems blue but it really is green , ' because our very organs which gave the reaction of green a while ago now give the reaction of blue . By the same token that the tree was green when we saw it near by , it is blue when we see it from afar . So let us make a second note : the tree is blue . Here we have two contradictory statements of fact , neither false , and yet neither the whole truth . The truth about the color of the tree involves a great range of subjects , including the physics of light , the anatomy and physiology of the human eye , photo-chemistry , ? in short , a vast store of learning and understanding . Many facts which seem irreconcilable become harmonious parts of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the truth should make us humble , and patient with one another . None of us has faculties of universal coordination , and our blind spots , instead of being little delinquencies of perception , are in reality vast areas . The most we can claim is that we have a few sighted spots . To see all the facts in their right relation is what we might call The Olympian Vision . THE GREEN TREE The first time I visited Charlotte , North Carolina , I had some business to transact with a charming , soft-spoken old gentleman who wore a broad-brimmed felt hat . When our business was completed for the day , we walked leisurely about the town . ' Charlotte , ' said the gentleman of the sombrero , is all to ' up over a dispute which is ragin ' amongst our people . ' What is the cause of it ? ' I asked . ' Free Grace and Fo ' - ordination , ' he answered . I was delighted , and wrote a long letter home about it that night . Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since then Charlotte has grown to be a great manufacturing town with a grand hotel and clubs and all the things that modern industry and wealth bring about . In those days there were the Presbyterians and Baptists on the one side and the Methodists and Lutherans on the other , and the adherents of the little Episcopal church , who were divided on the question . These included substantially the whole white population . Now , unless I am sorely mistaken , Charlotte has ceased to worry over ' Free Grace and Fo ' - ordination ' ; she is modern and up-to-date . But if surmise be correct , she has gone backward intellectually ; she only thinks herself modern ; she has become commercial and has ceased to participate in the intellectual life of the day . For the old question whereby Charlotte was ' all to ' up ' abides in philosophy . Turn whichever way we will , we meet that same old nagging problem , teasing us on the one hand with what seems to be proof that we have no free will at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason why we have free will is because we know we have it . Many of us have ceased to be Presbyterians or Baptists or Methodists or Episcopalians , but as soon as we venture into biology we find ourselves urged to join either the Mechanist or the Vitalist denomination , and there we find the same old dispute , raging again among our biological people . This is , indeed , the comedy domain of philosophy . The Greeks used to dispute over it . St. Paul appeared to have the problem solved , and so did St. Augustine . Pelagius differed from them and so did his followers , ? with some warmth . The harmony between Luther and John Calvin over the matter was not striking , Servetus had an opinion which went up in smoke , the savants of Charlotte , North Carolina , talked themselves out over it , ? and now behold the biologists in battle array ! If it were given to us to live to a prodigious number of years and to observe the earth from afar , we should see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never agreeing and never persuading each other . It is a very enduring subject . But is not this dispute over the question whether we have free will or not very like a dispute that we might engage in over the color of a tree : whether it he green or blue ? It hardly seems worth while to boast or to grow angry in protesting that we have absolute free will , when a little surgical operation of one sort or another , or a shock , or a blow upon the head , may change our nature entirely . Why not proceed along the mechanistic way , seeking the mechanical , physical , and chemical muses of every act , and thus gather as many facts as we can ? If every act seems to be a response to a stimulus , why deny it ? We shall not have achieved the truth when we have I. limed the exact process of every act , but we shall be much wiser than we are now . We shall advance toward the truth when we learn the relation to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant . And if from the study of the facts at hand , we reach the conclusion that we have no free will at all , but are mere automata , withno power of choice or selection throughout our lives , is it not time to pause and admit that we may not have all the facts , yet ? Also that such as we have may not be in their right order before our vision ? There are some verses by John Godfrey Saxe , called ' The Blind Men and the Elephant , ' which are very instructive . According to Saxe , six wise men of Indoostan , all of them very wise , but all of them blind , went to see the elephant . One examined its side and declared the elephant was very like a wall ; another , feeling its trunk , was sure the elephant was very like a snake ; another concluded from its leg that it was very like a tree ; another , examining one of its tusks , knew that the elephant was very like a spear ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan ; and the authority who grasped its tail was equally certain that the elephant was very like a rope . According to the legend they are still disputing over it . Now the truth is bigger than an elephant , and our vision of it is narrower than the observations of each of the blind men . And we should bear in mind that they were right , every one of them . Each had a fact ; none knew the truth . None had a theory of the truth ; each knew what he knew , and that was enough for him . We can well imagine one of them saying , ' If a thing is so , it 's so , and you ca n't get around it ; my senses bear me witness ; the elephant is very like a snake . ' If we have a good working method of dealing with facts , it is a good thing to hold to it , just as we do well to hold fast to the fact that the tree is green when we look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth . And the mechanistic theory , which will have nothing to do with spooks or ghosts , or with vital sparks with qualities that are not material , is helpful , wholesome , and illuminating . It makes for clean thinking . It will not countenance the Pickwickian point of view , which is very popular and current in this our day . It provides that facts be gathered by observation and the study of cause and effect . It also seems to lead to the conclusion that every act is the only one possible under conditions as they exist . Now , if this reasoning appears sound , let us , instead of frothing at the mouth and denouncing the sincere men who have reached these conclusions , admit it ? as a part of the truth . If through another chain of reasoning , or through consciousness , or by any other means , we come to a conclusion opposed to this , there is no occasion to boast that the first conclusion is disproved . If we reach both conclusions , we may know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aught we know both may be right . That we have free will and that we have not free will may be , both of them , parts of the truth , just as the opposed statements that the tree is green and that it is blue are parts of the truth . We may say that the whole organization of human conduct is based upon the free will of the individual ; but the organization of human conduct , like many another good thing , is based in large part upon fancy . When we consider acts from a-near we might as well admit that free will seems to play very little if any part in them . Here is the human machine with its equipment , the consciousness including a part of that group of records and nerve-centres which are connected up , ' the connecting up occurring automatically along the line of least resistance ; and then , given the stimulus , the one and only reaction which can occur , does occur . There would need to be a difference in the equipment or the stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe , is precisely the same as that reached by the late and occasionally lamented John Calvin , except that he maintained that every current through the colloidal content of every nerve was a special , volitional act of the Deity , for his own glory . ' This view , that every act is automatic if considered by itself , has great merit . If we consider it to be a part of the truth , we are likely to have far more abundant charity for one another . By it we enlarge our sympathy . For instance , we may say that everybody always does his best at the time he acts . If he does evil , there is a reason for it , a structural reason . His sympathetic equipment may be atrophied . Or he may be angry . In either case we are dealing with facts close at hand and our business is with his condition . The cause of it may be due to his grandfather , or to a false leading in his early childhood . We should diagnose his case and determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so congested that his way was the path of crime . And if he is angry we should regard him as a nervous invalid until his attack is over and the anger bodies are eliminated from his system , or until his injured brain-cells are restored . There is a wonderful book by Dr. Crile , lately published , on The Origin and Nature of the Emotions , ' that is very illuminating about anger . He postulates that by evolution we have developed what he calls nociceptors , ' which give the warning of pain in the presence of danger , and that these warnings are given according to the experience of the race . The equipment provides against such external injuries as the goring and tearing of an animal 's teeth in far greater measure than against the more modern devices of swift-moving bullets and very sharp instruments , because the experience of the race against teeth is so much greater than with bullets and swords . It is imaginable that if a sword were sharp enough and thin enough and swung with sufficient speed , the old Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this , it may be recalled , the executioner graciously gave a pinch of snuff to each of his victims , who remained comfortably unaware that his head had been severed from his body . By the sneezes which followed the perfect swordsmanship was revealed ; the heads rolled off , and the surprised offenders proceeded to ( lie with all haste and propriety . Another interesting warning is found in the fact that we are ticklish in our cars and nostrils and on the soles of our feet , where buzzing insects are likely to sting . Now in danger these warnings elicit the response either of flight or of turning and facing it , and so we become either afraid or angry . Dr. Crile notes two features in connection with these emotions which are interesting in regard to what we are discussing : he finds that during the processes of anger and fear we suffer inhibitions of all other faculties than those which are of value in fighting or running away . We are useless , inefficient , incompetent , in every other respect . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part is blocked off , and we are no more our complete selves than when , if ever , we are very drunk . The second observation is that under anger or fear there occurs a destruction of brain-cells that are but slowly repaired , and , under stress of severe and prolonged emotion , the brain is permanently injured . These notes have been vastly illuminating to me in regard to the dreadful war which now rages , and I think we may well pause to consider how difficult the recovery will be after it is over , when so many minds that are crippled by passion must attempt the work that calls for entire men . The Man of Wrath with a great lust to kill ceases to inspire us . We know that he is of value in hand-to-hand combats , but he is a nuisance , and even worse , in a fight where cool heads and steady hands are needed for machine guns . He is potential in instigating war but he is incompetent to end it . He is a drum-major of anarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high authority is evidence that he is unfit for his job , because under emotion his qualities of judgment are paralyzed and his sense of coordination is atrophied . While confining ourselves to the mechanistic point of view , we may describe judgment as the operation of selecting the best thing available to do at the time , ? just as the tree reaches out toward the light , ? and we may regard it as mechanical . As in a Jacquard loom the woof is run through those openings that are there , so the judgment , the determining bobbin as we might call it , passes through those channels of the mind that are open to it , and determines the act which we mechanically perform . We may regard impulse as something different from reason if we want to , but to me the difference seems to be in name rather than in fact . If judgment is automatic it may operate so rapidly that it skips consciousness , but that is no ground for calling it a thing apart . Under impulse we act rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually there is an emotional drive to it . An impulse seems to me to be a quick , emotional leading or drive to an act , and as much of an automatic response to stimulus as to eat when we are hungry or to drink when we are thirsty . In doing many things we skip consciousness after we are used to doing them , although at first , when we are learning how , they involve great effort . There are also automatic vanities which we have discussed elsewhere , of which a notable example is our disposition to justify ourselves , any time and all the time . We are apt to think that we thought , when we were acting so rapidly that the act skipped consciousness . And in explaining afterward , our sense of veracity is under the greatest strain . We fool ourselves into the belief that we deliberated over every possibility , when in fact we were following blindly the drive within us to do that which was the only possible thing that we could do under existing conditions . THE BLUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet we have a constructive faculty . Although often within a very narrow range , we have the ordering of our lives in our hands . This constructive faculty is in use when we are conjuring up our ideals . We can of our own volition say , I shall plan my life to do this thing . ' We can of our own will select a picture in our minds and hold it in our consciousness as a stimulus . More likely than not we get the idea from some one else ; but such ideas , as they are given to us , become our property , to do with as we will , to adopt as ideals or to reject . Many things influence us in this ; we are not as free as we think we are ; we generate our own energy , and some of us are equipped with very low-power dynamos ; but the process of selecting those purposes and ways of life which we project into our consciousness by our own will is the occasion of our greatest freedom . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more obedient to any stimulus ; what we have made of our lives becomes more fixed ; but at no time are we complete . We may change our whole nature at fifty as well as at thirty , or fifteen , ? but we are less likely to . This business of combining impressions and setting them up as ideals is the substance of our free will , We may fall short of our ideals , we may be entirely different from what we meant to be , and yet be following them as nearly as we can . The question of responsibility is : With what earnestness do we select our ideals , and with what effort do we project them into our consciousness ? The difference between achieving an ideal and performing an act is rather hazy , I 'll admit ; but I imagine the one to be the little push we give of our own desire and choice when a picture comes into consciousness that we want to have represent us . ' That is mine ! ' we say , and we proceed to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall it , to urge it upon ourselves until in the end we act that way , and this because we want to . The picture is the stimulus , but the process of selection seems super-mechanical . Although I can not imagine how we can think without our thinking machines , it seems that somewhere in the process freedom has entered in and we thus become , let us say , the navigating officers of our lives . On the other hand , the direct performance of an act seems an automatic response to the strongest stimulus in the mind at the time . This may seem like arguing in a circle , because the mechanism that we employ when we are selecting our ideals is substantially the same as that which we use when we perform an act . But the stimulus comes from within . Responsibility is a quality that we recognize , and to consider it a fiction seems premature ; as though we had not yet a clear vision of the truth of the matter . In the late Christian Herter 's re- markable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Human Problems ' he develops consciousness as awareness of self ' that arises in a certain complexity of organism under certain conditions . This awareness of self becomes more abundant as what we might call the harmonious complexity of the organism increases . Now , responsibility , or the capacity to choose of our own accord , like consciousness , is a quality that seems to be present in us . It would be futile to deny consciousness because we do not understand just how and where it begins . And it seems equally idle to deny responsibility . It seems to me to be a late accompaniment of this awareness of self which we know we have , and to my way of thinking it functions when we order our lives . So we may conceive these two statements as being parts of the truth : that whatever any one does , it is the best that he can do at the time , and also that whatever any one does , is qualified by the manner in which he has ordered his life . This idealizing ego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our fingers and toes . It is selective . Now , if it seems that we have no free will when we commit an act , but have free will when we order our lives , we surely have not the whole truth in hand , but the theory may lead us nearer to it . IV THE GOD IN THE MACHINE Ilere I respectfully ask your pardon . Despite my protestations I have already burdened you with a definition of the truth that is not in the dictionaries , and now I am about to ask you to consider religion from a point of view that does not seem to be current . I admit frankly that it is not only dis- tressing to the reader but also that it makes for confusion , to frame new definitions for old words as one proceeds ; but , Gott hilf mir , ich kann nicht anders I ' It seems to me that so far as our civilization is concerned , the concept of religion per se is modern . There is no Germanic word for it ; in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word has been imported and substituted for faith , belief , and even dogma and theology . In the sense in which I want to use the word there is no plural . Christianity , Buddhism , Brahmanism , Judaism , Mohammedanism are not so many religions ( although I must admit that the Latins , who gave us the word , would have used it in this sense ) : they are , let us say , faiths or beliefs or confessions . At all events , if we agree to call them such , it will leave us free to use the word religion without thinking of the minister , the Sunday-school , or the choir in which we used to sing . Of course , the minister and the Sunday-school and the church choir may have functioned as parts of religion , but to think of them as the substance of it might get them out of their right relation to the idea which I am trying to express . In the chapter called ' The Blue Tree ' we considered how we may , of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ideals of them drive them into consciousness so that they shall serve as both stimuli and inhibitions to our actions . We called this the ordering of life . In the process we are open to impressions , although we determine within ourselves , subject of course to our limitations , which of these impressions we shall select . Now , the function of providing ideals and offering them , teaching them , so that we may order our lives aright and thus approach the truth , seems to me to be the great province of religion . We may practice religion either with or without dogma . The man of faith may have great religious value , and again he may have no religious value at all . There are , for example , religious Christians , and , on the other hand , Christians of great piety who are not religious . The anchorite who whips and distresses himself to save his own soul is not practicing religion ; he is exercising his faith . The Samaritan , who picks up the fallen wanderer by the wayside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helps so that the stimulus of sympathy enters into him , is doing a religious act . Faith may be a stimulus to religious acts , and we know that it often is ; but since often it is not , we may as well address ourselves to that aspect of religion which we can understand , regarding it as having to do with the ordering of our lives , and not as related to dogma or faith save as dogma or faith may induce it . Then we find that everybody has the religious equipment , just as he has a sympathetic equipment , although both may be greatly atrophied . With this in mind , although we can not fail to recognize a conflict between science and the Bible and science and dogma , there is no conflict between science and religion . This view of religion takes the subject out of the domain of metaphysics and mysteries , and recognizes it as a specific department of human life . By it we reach the conclusion that it is a necessary function , in which we are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me to be of positive value to the world in which we live and , in one way or another , to approach the truth . Whether he be a Christian or a Jew or anything else , is his affair , ? his faith , his profession . His religion is in his ideals and his use of them . We must have ideals . We can do no- thing without them . And this essay is written in the sincere belief that as we approach the truth with understanding , one human problem after another will be solved . Only , we must order our lives aright or else we can not approach the truth . We can not , otherwise , get the facts into focus . So all the world needs religion , ? to-day , it would seem , more than ever before . Dogmas that we can not believe will not answer the purpose . Apologetics often offend more than they aid . Religion is bigger than any church or any creed or any faith , and its business is the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have discussed the problem of free will and found it not very free , and yet I have tried to develop the idea that we have the ordering of our lives in our own hands . Now let us adventure further , and this time into the unknown , with analogy as our guide . We have seen how facts are parts of the truth and that we reap confusion if we consider them as substitutes for it . We might postulate a law of arrangement , a law of order , that holds good in regard to the truth and applies also to animate and inanimate things . We see this ordering of the composite parts into their right relation in the formation of a crystal . We need not quest ion now why the molecules join according to a mathematical scale to form a symmetrical body ; suffice it for the present to observe that they do . The molecules are individual , but they group themselves into something that is not a molecule : into a crystal . We may compare a crystal to the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until the molecules are in their right order there is no crystal . Until the facts are in their right order there is no truth . We , as men and women , are composed of innumerable particles of many different kinds . Their good condition and orderly arrangement are necessary to our being . Let us consider , for example , our white blood corpuscles or leucocytes . They work with what almost appears to be intelligence in overcoming disease . They are not simple little things by any means ; they are marvelously complex . They respond to a stimulus and go to work , just as we do . Sometimes they are weak , ineIEcient , and sick ; and then we languish or die because they do not do their work . They are mechanical entities , and are subject to physical and chemical laws . Now , we are mechanical entities and we constitute something greater than ourselves . We group ourselves artificially into nations which a congress has power to change by moving a boundary line from one side of us to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of immediate consanguinity , and into races , based on what appears to be a remoter consanguinity . We divide ourselves again into long-headed and broad-headed classes . The facts upon which these groupings are based do not accord with each other , nor do they tell us much about what humanity means . They are desirable facts and , in a way , it is worth knowing that some of us are of one nation and some of another ; some long-headed and some broad ; some one thing and others something else ; but a new and greater meaning might be applied to us by a master mind , the greater anthropologist who could explain the human family as it has not been explained before . The news of battles does not tell us what is really happening to us all ; and there are problems ahead even graver and more important than who shall win . Is not victory itself a curse to the winner who lacks the character to meet his obligations ? Some day , let us hope , a wiser generation will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cherish , and will work diligently to repair the havoc of this war . Then perhaps the greater anthropologist will come . Collective humanity is , indeed , a strange phenomenon . Constantly destroying itself , it is at war with half of nature and cultivates as richly as it can the other half . It has a marvelous faculty for helping itself , and then , when a part of it has achieved a high order of living and gathered in those things of the earth which it desires , there is usually a great fall , and as the years roll on , the dull , stupid toiler guides his plough over the land that once was Carthage and Nineveh . What is it that makes collective humanity sick ? What was the disease of Babylon and of the forgotten city that underlies it ? After all the analyses , what was the sickness of Rome ? Why did Europe go to sleep for a thousand years , and what was it that killed the intellect of the Saracens ? Why did Persia die ? Collective humanity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and valiant and that becomes godlike , and then again sickens and becomes foolish , and the spirit of it fades away until slavery under a benign master would be an advantage . Collective humanity as we see it is a great jumble of parts , related , unrelated , and in dire confusion . What is it doing ? Not one of us can tell . Now let us imagine leucocytes to have consciousness and vision , and let us consider a single one of them . Its abode is in the blood of somebody , ? of you , let us say ; and its life is very exciting for it because it never knows what its path will be . Sometimes it is driven into one of your fingers , again into one of your toes ; it may be busy on a little scratch well covered up , or it may suddenly have to do battle with a tetanus bacillus . Ask a leucocyte what it knows of life and it might well answer that it is a continuous problem ; it would tell you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its whole world ? but it could not tell anything about you . Even so simple a detail as that , for instance , you do not like parsnips , could not occur to this leucocyte , ? because you do not eat them , and so it has no experience with parsnips . Really , the leucocytes with consciousness , which I am imagining , are very like us ; they are in their world and we are in ours . And we may be very like them : parts of a Great Intelligence as much beyond us as we are beyond the leucocytes which form parts of us . Humanity has always been speculating about this Greater Intelligence , and yet speculation has always been discouraged on the ground that the matter is all settled . This conservatism is what gives us such amazing dicta as the Westminster Shorter Catechism and the Thirty-nine Articles . The usual human concept of the Greater Intelligence is as of one apart from us and appearing in all manifestations of power . It has been proposed that we may come into sight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , described as the beginning of wisdom , has also been used to make us do strange things in accordance with traditions and myths , older than history . Even analogy will only help us occasionally here , and otherwise we have nothing to guide us in these vaster regions but the imagination . And yet , if we can imagine some relation between human beings and a possible Greater Intelligence , a relation which does not seem false or impossible , we may be taking steps in advance . If we imagine this and imagine that and then something else , it may be that some day somebody will imagine a working hypothesis which does not seem to offend against the truth . Now , suppose the working hypothesis should involve the conception of human beings as minute particles of the Greater Intelligence , citing the analogy of the leucocytes or any other swarm of microscopic units . We need not then restrict ourselves to their reactions in the human body . We are different , are differently constructed , and this remarkable quality of consciousness is at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , in a leucocyte . Without doubt it reaches further . Nor need we restrict the Greater Intelligence to our own limitations . We are not conscious of our blood corpuscles , but that is no reason why the Greater Intelligence may not be conscious of us . We know , as we have said , that if our white blood corpuscles are weak , inefficient , or sick , we languish , and that our welfare requires that they be in health . So , if we consider collee. tive humanity and observe that it ack vances in knowledge , in understanding , in order , and in righteousness , we may then feel that it is well with the Greater Intelligence of which we are a part . But if we live in idleness and waste and hatred and cruelty and malice , and cause misery and degradation , it would seem that we are offending and injuring the Greater Intelligence , the God of all of us . This makes the Greater Intelligence in a way dependent upon us , so that it loses health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of one another . Sometime when we know more than we do now , there may be available a working hypothesis along these lines and in accord with familiar facts . It is interesting to speculate upon what the results may be . Hebrew poetry has given us a tradition and a conception of a deity apart from ourselves and pregnant with the greatest conceivable measure of power . The Christian , Jewish , and Mohammedan peoples worship a kinetic divinity that rules the stars and the uttermost heavens , the nebulae as well as the sun and its planets , including the earth . The thought of any other Greater Intelligence is condemned . Beginning with a tribal deity inspired by selfishness , lust , and wrath , humanity has magnified its conception of its god until it has driven him from the earth and projected him through the ether into a million other worlds . It may be that we shall be guided back again to a god of all men and women , exercising vast powers of the spirit when in health and when its particles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead or guide if mankind is wayward and corrupt .
