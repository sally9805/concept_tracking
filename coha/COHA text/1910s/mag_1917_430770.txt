 | It was in January , 1903 , that I first saw William Garrott Brown , whom I had previously known as the author of a charming short life of Andrew Jackson and a remarkable essay on " The Lower South in American History . " It was then he paid his first visit to Trinity College , coming to make an address on Jackson to the students of the college and to read his essay , " The Foe of Compromise , " in the parlor of Mr. Benjamin N. Duke before an invited audience . For his visit we were much indebted to Professor W. P. Few , now president of the college , who became acquainted with Brown at Harvard and , like many another man , fell under his personal influence . It was Brown 's claim to distinction that he wrote the most graceful and informing historical style that came before me in the early years of this century . When a distinguished teacher of history heard one of Brown 's papers at a meeting of the American Historical Association , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure that I felt in hearing your paper at Washington the other day , except that it always exasperates me that another man should have such a power of language and statement ! Everywhere I hear the same story ? that W. G. Brown is one of the few men in the country who can actually write history . " If you would like to see what his style was like turn to the " Lower South " and read a page ; and the opening paragraph will do as well as any . Listen to its smooth and limpid words : " I wish to discuss very broadly a certain quarter of the Union and the part it played in a certain period of American history ; to describe a region commonly regarded as a sort of Nazareth , out of which only tasks and perplexities have come ; to examine a civilization which  | many have looked upon as foreign to American ideas ; to review a political enterprise which has often been condemned as contrary to American principles . My aim is neither to defend nor to arraign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political enterprise were a natural outcome of material conditions and of what went before , not whether they were right or wrong . I wish to inquire whether the men and women of that time and region had the ordinary qualities of human nature , not whether they were better or worse than the men and women of other lands and times . " A mere scholar would have begun his book in a more solemn , if not a stilted , manner . He might have said that the history of the Gulf States had been neglected or misunderstood and that it was worth while to set it straight . Brown never had the vernacular of the graduate school . He did not write about " forces , " " institutions , " or " social and political development . " From his pen ran the plain and human narrative , as from the pen of Herodotus , of a man who knew . and could talk . His the task to tell a simple tale . Another thing in " The Lower South " that made us love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilson Richard and Eugene Levert , " who stood aside to let me pass . " To any Southerner born just after the war , the words have a significant meaning . How often was it necessary to select one for college and place the others in business ! The sacrifice was justified in the results . William Garrott graduated when eighteen at Howard College , in his native town , Marion , Alabama , and in 1889 he entered the junior class at Harvard , graduating in 1891 with the highest honors in history . He took the master 's degree next year , but he seems to have had no desire to study for a doctorate . He was appointed to a position in the university library and held it until 1901 . It was late in this term of nine years that he began to write books , his first effort being " An Official Guide to Harvard University , " which appeared in 1899 . Then came several things in rapid succession , a " History of Alabama , " 1900 , a brief sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Douglas , 1902 , " Golf , " 1902 , " The Lower South , " 1902 , " The Foe of Compromise and Other Essays , " 1903 , and " A Gentleman of the South , " 1903 . This large output of first class work was all written , but not all published when he  | visited Durham in January , 1903 . As it turned out , these works constitute the cream of his literary achievement . Probably the most notable was the essay called " The Foe of Compromise , " a high-keyed and gripping discourse on that trait in a man which makes him unwilling to yield his will before adversity or opposition . It was very self-expressive and awakened a quick response in many of its readers . One of them , a sensitive Englishwoman , wrote : " The whole of it swayed me : I rose and fell with its thought and feeling . I understood from beginning to end . It is to me like a supreme vision of the tragedy and the greatness of the seeing soul 's passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her Brown confessed that the essay was " a deep and genuine experience " of his inner life . There is a passage in the essay in which the author seems to ' draw his own picture , probably unconsciously . He is speaking about that phase of the " Foe " that makes one endure want rather than cringe in comfort . For such an one , says he , the motto , " half a loaf is better than none " must be changed into " no bread is better than half a loaf . " And then he describes this man who will have " either riches or poverty , " calling him for lack of a better term , " a fine gentleman , " and these are his words : " I mean the sort of human being who never questions his right to the earth and its fulness , and whose right , for that reason , may go unchallenged by other men . Such a man will choke on common food . He is athirst if he drink not of the best vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if his raiment be not of the costliest stuffs . For all his senses he will demand always the best . ' That denied , he will rather bear an utter abstinence than stoop to any landlord 's , tailor 's , tapster 's makeshift for his comfort . Your true fine gentleman ' , if he be shut out from the palace and the king 's table , will oftener be found , like Lear , on the storm-swept moor than in an ale-house . " Professor Bliss Perry writes me : " I remember C. E. Norton 's comment on Brown 's Atlantic article , The Foe of Compromise , ' into which he put so much of his real self . Norton thought it admirably written , ? and his praise was hard to win . But he added , You know , Mr. Perry , there really is n't any Foe of Compromise ' " ! To which I am inclined to demur .  | There may not be , and again , there may be a real " Foe of Compromise . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in few men . Probably a man is no happier for having it in this land of equality , but some men will not forego the luxury . Thus introduced by his writings , Brown came to us at Trinity . The address on Jackson pleased the students by its grace and freshness , and the reading in the evening gave a select audience much food for reflection . And the effect of his words was heightened by his unusual personality . One of his Cambridge friends said that the word for him was " thoroughbred . " The appearance of distinction was one of his most marked characteristics . He was genial in a grave way and always dignified . His tall figure was trim and lithe , and he walked with something of a military manner . He had a regular face , somewhat long , with a fine high forehead , a good mouth set off with those full and long lips that one associates with the face of an orator . He was easy in his manner and would attract attention in any company . Rarely has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning to Cambridge he began to give a course of lectures at Harvard on reconstruction history . Two hundred and fifty students filled the class , and with preparing the lectures , reading papers , and assigning topics he was plunged into a mass of work that overwhelmed him . Nervous weakness developed and his deafness increased , the result being that he was forced at the end of the course to retire from the university and seek another field than teaching for his life work . He chose literature . Already he had a contract for a " History of the United States , " and several editors had opened their columns to him for magazine articles . At the end of the summer he left Cambridge . His physician advised him to go West and live on a ranch until health was completely restored . At this time he had received no certain warning of the disease that was to carry him off . Against the ranch he protested , and this " foe of compromise " decided for Durham , where there was a library . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , a delightful visit in which he threw himself into the life of the college with the  | fervor of a student . He lived with his friend , Dr. Few , but we all felt that we had a part of him . Brown was earnestly Southern , and , while he leant to the New South school that was showing itself at the time , he was not extremely " new . " He was of the planter type by instinct , but he was too intellectual to accept its ideas blindly . He had lived so long in the North , and had become so completely an intellectuel in abstract things , that he could not but see how much the concrete situation in his native section needed to be made over again . But he was never willing to carp at it , and if it was attacked he was its stout defender . He was ever thinking of the " situation " and in several magazine articles and many editorials in Harper 's Weekly dealt with one phase or another of the problem . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to take a vital interest in the work of Trinity College , which he saw from the inside . " I was able to speak with sincere enthusiasm to Mr. Perry , " he wrote in February , 1903 , to Dr. Few , " about the work you young fellows are ' doing at Trinity . It would command anybody 's respect and did command my admiration . I am going to Buffalo on the twenty-first to speak about Washington and the Southern question . I sha n't miss the opportunity to praise such work as yours for the only clearly safe and wise thing possible . Gradually my impressions of the Southern situation are taking form , and it menaces ? a very dark thing indeed ; but the opportunity for the hardest sort of heroism and sacrifice ? the blind sort ? is there . If I : if we , ? could only see plainly the goal , the duty ! But how seldom that is vouchsafed us in any concern ! " In September he wrote : " You fellows at Trinity are doing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up here would feel that any appearance of cooperation with you is a salve to our conscience . " To the men at Trinity it was very comforting to get such encouragement from Cambridge . In February , 1904 , Brown made a journey through the South preparing special articles for the Boston Transcript . It was his purpose to follow in the tracks of Frederick Law Olmsted , whose travels in the South before the war were described in two very informing and interesting works . Brown wanted  | to show in what respect the country had developed in the fifty years that had intervened ; but the practical needs were such that he took the advice of the editors of the Transcript and gave his attention chiefly to existing industrial conditions of the region visited . Nevertheless , his twenty letters , describing what he saw from Washington to Texas , and thence to St. Louis , contained many illuminating discussions of the social problems of the South . They were enlived with human touches , as when he described hunting experiences , or related ' droll incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor commended him , saying that it showed that he was familiar with his environment . Some writers , he added , carried " this personal touch to the point of offensive egotism . You are doing the thing just right . " On questions of taste , in writing as in other matters , Brown was apt to be " just right . " These letters were published over the name of " Stanton " and with the title , " The South at Work " : they have never been gathered into a volume , probably because no copyright was made as they appeared . One of them was concerned with Trinity College and another with the industries of Durham . Both were commended by the editor of the Transcript , but the latter was more highly esteemed because it stuck to the industrial phase of the subject . Speaking of the work of the college led Brown to take up the general educational condition of the State of North Carolina admitting that it was very bad , but pointing out the improvement that was being made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amendment eliminating the negro vote . He had an interview with Governor Aycock with whose personality he was much pleased , as who could fail to be pleased with that patriotic and frankly idealistic man ? The governor remarked that the effect of the amendment was to make the whites of North Carolina more independent but seemed to think that they had carried their independence too far , which led Brown to reflect : " What danger he fears from too much free thought and free speech I did not clearly understand , but it should be remembered that though ardent in other than party causes the governor has remained a pretty consistent party man . The remark was just , and just- est of all in the broad sense of weighing practical things . He was too practical an observer of things around him to fail to see that a political leader must stick to his task , and he was also too practical to fail to realize that the educational advance of the South must come through other persons , liberal business men , professional men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every city and town and country neighborhood . " Referring to the criticism that some of the advocates of new ideas made upon the Southern clergy for not assuming a more liberal attitude toward social matters , he said : " Such , in fact , it may for the most part be , but I am unable to sympathize with either the bitterness or the ridicule which has been displayed toward the Southern clergy . " He understood as well as any one that the ministers should lead the communuity with moral and ideal standards ; but he also saw that that it was too much to expect them to rise far above their surroundings . The fault was not so much with the clergy as with the isolation of country life , the wretched school system , and the long contentment of the people with provincialism . The clergy , he said , were doing all they humanly could to improve conditions . Any Southerner who has passed from South to North and back again several times will sympathize with the following written in Pinehurst : " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South into New England , but that is what one does coming from the State House at Raleigh to this resort . I myself must confess to an instant change of front . Yesterday looking eagerly for signs of Yankee thrift , today I listen in vain for leisurely Southern voices . Yesterday setting , perhaps , too high a value on common sense , spryness , and a quick perception of opportunities , today I am combatting some of the very ideals and standards I wished to exalt . " How many of us expatriated ones have not undergone something of this change of view ! When we live in the South the signs of conservatism seem to hem us in and we long for something new , the right to say and do what we like . It is a natural longing , and I am persuaded that intellectual people living in simple communities frequently experience it , whatever the communities . But let us slip away from the South ,  | and its spell holds us with a grip not to be shaken off , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the provincialism , we remember the gentle love of good nature , and we begin to fight for the things that once made us feel lonely . I do not think there is a wanderer , however well he is placed in the land of his adoption , who does not sometimes feel a quick heartbeat when he sees a newspaper from " ' down home , " however much he may have disliked it when he was forced to find in it his sole pabulum . Last week I received a spavined weekly which I knew in other days , filled with items from the various R. F. D 's . I read every one of them , seeking for a familiar name , and triumphing at last because I came across the brother of a man whom I know . Hardly a one of us but has a sneaking notion that some day his bones will be carried back to be laid in the good old soil , gray or red . Brown had the longing for " down home , " and , when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valiantly , as I could well show if such was a part of this story , dying at last in 1913 in far off Connecticut , it was a Southern nurse that cared for his last days and it was to a Southern grave that his body was taken . He was Southern to the core . " Is n't it funny , " he says to one of his correspondents , " that after so many years I should n't have any bosom friends among these people . But then , maybe it 's me , and in that case , as B ? says , it is n't so funny . " He had then resided in Cambridge sixteen years . But it was not funny in any sense ; for he was , probably without realizing it when he wrote , extremely well liked by a circle of intelligent men in Cambridge and Boston . It all came out when , in 1906 , he came down with the fatal disease . Letter after letter came to tell him something that would cheer his heart . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , but it is not safe to assume that he has none . No one is more ready to help in time of distress . On the other hand , no man could have carried his misfortune more courageously . Writing from Asheville to Dr. Few , Brown said , almost cheerily : " What do you think of this for a place to be in ? It 's a good place ; but I did n't mean to be here until a certain Dr. Janeway ordered me to  | come here or to one of two or three other places . I have a lung trouble and must devote months if not years to curing it , giving up everything else . I hope you will like the place and come and see me ? after a little while when I have got well into my difficult routine . " In 1904 Brown spent a part of the summer in Washington , following some research he was interested in . Being there myself , as was my summer custom when I lived in the South , I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally at the Library of Congress every day for a portion of the time . When he did the large amount of reading for information in writing his books I never knew . One day he came to dinner , and my wife offered him some chicken , " smothered " in the Southern style . He was loud in his praise , for it was really delicious . Then the conversation turned toward Northern cooking , for which he expressed aversion generally . I remember his special disdain for the so-called " cream " gravy so often seen in the North . He said it was only paste and he could not stand it . One day I went with him to Mount Vernon , which he had not visited before . It was a day when few tourists were on the spot , and we roamed through the old mansion at will . He was much impressed by the building and its decorations . As we entered the salons one after the other , he would exclaim , " It 's bully ! It 's bully ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that he found in the place a realization of that ideal home of the old South which he respected so highly . Leaving the house we roamed around the grounds , through the garden , and finally he would see the stable-yard . As we turned to it he said : " Let us look at the lot , " alluding to the custom of calling it the " lot " in the South . The place meant to him a chapter on life in other days . On one of his visits to Durham I went with him and others to visit the Bennett place , where Joe Johnston surrendered to Sherman in 1865 . The dilapidated condition of the place distressed him . Although it was not the scene of a Southern victory , he felt that it should be kept in better condition of repair . On another occasion we visited Hillsboro , to which place he was drawn to see if he could find living some of the relatives of his mother . Her grandfather had moved from  | Orange County to Alabama in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some industrious antiquary would trace out all the families of prominent people who have gone forth from this county , how large a company would there not be ! Brown found but one relative to whom he could claim kin , a merchant in the town , but he found in the cemetery the graves of many others , and he noted the family names of many persons who had settled in the old Alabama home . During the last years of his life Brown wrote editorials for Harper 's Weekly , then under the general direction of Colonel George Harvey . It was a congenial task for a man who was fighting disease and was not willing to give up the fight . No research in libraries was possible to him at the time , and to write comments on the transactions of the day was suited to his quick and pungent mind . He made the Weekly feel the effects of his thought and his friends believed that it took a new hold on the public as a consequence of his connection with it . He wrote many editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comment on happenings in Congress . While he was thus engaged he lived for a time in Lakewood , New Jersey , so that he might be near the editorial offices . It was at this time that I saw him last , at the meeting of the American Historical Association in New York in 1909 . I encountered him in the hotel and saw much of him during the meeting . He rarely referred to his disease but said much about his work on Harper 's . He had been ' deeply interested in the political campaign in North Carolina in 1908 and was especially desirous of seeing the Republican party in the State raised into a position for fairly disputing with the Democratic organization for leadership . This he desired in spite of the fact that he was a Democrat in most things . He felt , as many others have felt , that it would be better if there were two parties of nearly equal strength . His death at the early age of forty-five cut off the most promising writer of history in the Southern group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of real genius , who would have made history a new thing in our latter-day literature , could he only have lived to carry out his efforts , and it deprived  | Trinity College and every other centre of effort for the uplift of the nation of a genuine friend . His struggle for his literary standing , the experience through which he arrived in the fruition of what seemed an assured career , and his ideals of literature I hope to describe in another place . This discussion of his personal traits , as I saw them , but expresses appreciation of a rare soul whom all sincere men and women would have found admirable if they had known him . " Fine gentleman " he was , but better still he was a " fine man " ; and it is well for us to renew our impressions of such persons , now so rare in the field of literature . We can not afford to forget the type .                   @ @
