THE immigration from Italy laas shot up like Jonah 's gourd . During the last decade a fourth of our immigrants have been Italians , and from being a twentieth part of our foreign-born , they have risen to be a tenth . This freshet is not born of religious or political oppression , for Italy enjoys a government on modern lines , created by the efforts of patriots like Mazzini , Cavour , and Garibaldi . The impulse that every year prompts from a quarter to half a million of Italians to wander oversea is purely economic . Ignorance and the subjection of women cause blind multiplication , with the result that the Italians are wresting their food from narrower plots than any other European people . A population approximating that of all our Atlantic States is trying to live from a space little greater than the combined areas of New York and Georgia . Although South America seconds the United States in absorbing the overflow , still , Italy 's population continually swells , her birth-rate is not sinking so rapidly as her death-rate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time quench what of the Celto-Teutonic flush lingers in the cheek of the American . DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES OF our one and one-third millions of Italians , the Northeast down to Washington holds about three fourths , while south and southwest of the Capitol there are only three and a half per cent . The middle West has sixteen per cent. , and the quota of the far West is seven and a half per cent . For the most part , they are greatly concentrated in cities . Roughly speaking , five sixths of the Italians in Delaware are in Wilmington ; in Maryland , three sevenths are in Baltimore ; in Illinois , three eighths are in Chicago ; in Nebraska , two thirds are in Omaha ; in Missouri , three fifths are in St. Louis ; in Oregon , one half are in Portland ; in Pennsylvania , one half are in Philadelphia ; in Louisiana , two fifths are in New Orleans ; in Michigan , a third are in Detroit ; and in Ohio , a quarter are in Cleveland . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italians , one fourth of all in the country . Although a slow percolation into the rural districts is going on , this current distributes immigrants very differently from the older streams that debouched on the advancing frontier . SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS MIGRATORY job-hunters rather than homeseekers , the Italians are loath to encumber themselves with their women . The women are only a little more than one fifth of the whole , nor do they come here more freely as time goes on . A natural consequence of leaving families behind is a huge return current from America , amounting to a third of the arrivals from Italy . More than half of our British immigrants are skilled . Of the Italian arrivals , one out of eight is skilled , one out of four is a farm-laborer , one out of three is a common laborer , and one in two hundred and fifty has a profession . In a word , two thirds are of rural origin . The illiteracy of the Italian immigrants more than fourteen years of age is forty-seven per cent . ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899-1909 , nearly one half hailed from Italy . NORTHERN ITALIANS AND SOUTHERN ITALIANS THE fact that the emigrants from the north of Italy wander chiefly to South America , where industrially they dominate , while the emigrants from central and southern Italy come to this country , where they are dominated , makes it im- portant to remember that in race and advancement the Northern Italians differ from the rest of their fellow-countrymen . In the veins of the broad-head people of Piedmont , Lombardy , and Venetia runs much Northern blood ? Celtic , Gothic , Lombard , and German . The other Italians are of the long-head , dark , AMediterranean race , with no small infusion of Greek , Saracen , and African blood in the Calabrians and Sicilians . Rarely is there so wide a gulf between the geographical dents ; and while a clear third of the Southern students fail in their examinations , less than a quarter of the Northerners fail . Northern Italy is twice as well off in teachers and libraries , five times as productive in book publishing , has twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as many lottery-tickets as the South . The astonishing dearth of literary and artistic production in the South ought to confound those optimists who , identifying " Italian " with extremes of a nation as there is between Milan and Palermo . The Italians themselves have set forth these contrasts in the sharpest relief . In an elaborate treatise , Professor Niceforo shows that blue eyes and fair hair occur twice as often among the Northern Italians as among the people south of Rome ; that their understatured are eight per cent . of the whole as against twenty per cent . for the Southern Italians ; and that they show a greater frequency of high foreheads and a smaller frequency of low brows . They have a third of the illiteracy of the South , twice the school attendance , thrice the number of higher stu " Venetian " and " Tuscan , " anticipate . that the Italian infusion will one day make the American stock bloom with poets and painters . The figures of Niceforo show that the provinces that contribute most to our immigration have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two peoples so unlike as in their crimes . While northern Italy leads in fraud and chicane , southern Italy reveals a rank growth of the ferocious crimes that go with a primitive stage of civilization . The contrast is between force and fraud , violence and cunning . The South produces five times as much homicide as the North , four times as much  | brigandage , three times as many assaults , and five times as many seizures or destructions of property . On the whole , it has from three to four times the violence of the North , while its obscene crimes , which constitute an index of sensuality , are thrice as numerous . As for Sicilians , they are scourged by seven times the homicide , four times the brigandage , and four times the obscene crime suffered by an equal number of Northern Italians . Although less advanced , the Italians from the valley of the Po are racially akin to the Swiss and the Southern Germans . As immigrants , their superiority to other Italians is generally recognized . I have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian among us as more intelligent , reliable , and progressive than the Southern Italian . We know from statistics that he is less turbulent , less criminal , less transient ; he earns more , rises higher , and acquires citizenship sooner . Yet only a fifth of our Italians are from the North . It is the backward and benighted provinces from Naples to Sicily that send us the flood of " gross little aliens " who gave Henry James , on revisiting Boston , the melancholy vision " of a huge applied sponge ? a sponge saturated with the foreign mixture and passed over almost everything I remembered and might still have recovered . " VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS BEING new-corners , the Italians are doing the heavy , unskilled work which was once the prerogative of the Irish . The shovel is now as firmly associated in our minds with ' Tonio as formerly with Barney . The Northern Italians go much into mine and quarry and silk-mill , but the others stick close to railroad , street , and construction work . Of our railroads it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and Jews own them . " Nearer to the truth , perhaps , is the New York mot , " Houses nowadays are built by Italians , owned by Jews , and paid for by Irish tenants . " Being small and vegetarian , the Italians are not preferred in earthwork for their physical strength , but because of their endurance of heat , cold , wet , and muck . As one contractor puts it , " They can stand the gaff . " Although the Southern Italians are numerous in the manufacture of boots and shoes , cigars , glass , woolen goods , and clothing , some employers refuse the males for " inside work " because they have the reputation of being turbulent . Their noteworthy absence from the rolling-mills is attributed to the fact that they lack the nervous stability needed for seizing a white-hot piece of iron with a pair of tongs . The phlegmatic Slav stands up to such work . In the trades , the Italians crop up numerously as bakers , barbers , cobblers , confectioners , tailors , street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become hucksters and peddlers of such characteristic wares as fruits and plaster casts . It is the Italians from the North , especially the Genoese , who bring native commercial capacity and become wholesale or commission-merchants in fruits and vegetables , ' while the Neapolitan is still fussing with his banana-stand . Thanks to their race genius , the Italian musicians and teachers of music among us bid fair to break the musical monopoly of the German-Americans . In one province of southern Italy not a plow exists , and the women - wield the hand implements beside the men . It is not strange that immigrants with such experience do well here in truck-farming and market-gardening . Those who engage in real agriculture settle chiefly in colonies , for the voluble , gregarious Italians can not endure the chill loneliness of the American homestead . They follow their bent for intensive farming , and would hardly know how to handle more than fifteen or twenty acres . Few of them are up to ordinary extensive , farming . As one observer says , " They have n't the head for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-over pine-lands of northern Wisconsin , the rocky hills of New England , the sandy barrens of New Jersey , and the muck soil of western New York , their love of sunshine is not dead . The caner , cotton , and tobacco fields of the South attract them . More than half of the Italians in Louisiana are on the plantations . Half of the sixty thousand in California are in vineyard and orchard . The famed Italian-Swiss colony at Asti employs a thousand men to help it make wine under a cielo sereno like that of  | Italy . Many a fisherman who has cast his.net in the Gulf of Genoa now strains the waters of San Francisco Bay . There are twoscore rural colonies of Italians in the South , and the settlements at Bryan , Texas , and Sunnyside and Tontitown , Arkansas , are well known . Italians have been welcomed to the South by planters dissatisfied with negro labor or desirous of deriving a return from their raw land . As a cotton-raiser , the Italian has excelled the negro at every point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on buying land after his second crop as tenant , whereas the black tenant will go on forever letting his superintending white landlord draw an income from him , the enthusiasm of the planters cooled . Then , too , a fear has sprung up lest the Italians , being without the Southern white man 's strong race feeling , would mix with the negroes and create a hybrid . The South , therefore , is less eager for Italian immigrants than it was , and the legislatures of North Carolina , South Carolina , and Virginia have recorded their sense of the undesirableness of this element . CHARACTERISTIC VICES THE peoples from the Azores to Armenia are well-nigh immune to the seduction of alcohol ; so that if this be the test of desirableness , it will be easy to part the sheep from the goats . Certain American " glad-handers " go into raptures over the " sobriety " of the new , immigrants , and to such we may as well concede first as last that there would be no liquor problem here if abstemious Portuguese had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumanians had settled the colonies instead of thirsty Germans and Scotch-Irish ; and if sober , coffee-drinking Turks had peopled the West instead of bibulous Hibernians and Scandinavians . The proportion of Italian charity cases due to drink is only a sixth of that for foreign-born cases , and a seventh of that for cases among native Americans . Alcoholics occur among the Italians in the charity hospitals from a tenth to a twentieth as often as among Northern Europeans . Still , American example and American strain are telling on the habits of the Italians , and " in the Italian home the bottle of rock and rye ' is seen with increasing frequency by the side of the bottle of Chianti . " Bachelors in the pick-and-shovel brigade will have their diversions , so it is not surprising that the Italians , like the abstemious Chinese , are addicted to gambling . Games of chance flourish in their saloons , and many a knife-thrust has come out of a game of cards . At home the state lottery has whetted the taste for gambling . In the Neapolitan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxication in the Anglo-Saxon . When one learns that on an average the Neapohtan risks $3.15 a year in the lottery , six times as much as the average Italian , he does not wonder that the immigrant hankers to put his money on something . VIOLENCE IN CRIME FoR all the great majority of the Italian immigrants are peaceable and industrious , no other element matches them in propensity for personal violence . In homicide , rape , blackmail , and kidnapping they lead the foreign-born . Says.the Immigration Commission : " The Italian criminals are largest in numbers and create most alarm by the violent character of their offenses in this country . " Among moderns , gainful offenses occur from three to seven times as frequently as crimes of violence . The medievalism of the Southern Italians appears from the fact that they commit more deeds of personal violence than gainful offenses . Browning , who knew the Italians , expresses this cheerful alacrity in murder when , in " The Ring and the Book , " the Pope tells of the four " bright-eyed , blackhaired boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murder me some three people , old and young , Ye never heard the names of ? and be paid So much . And the whole four accede at once . Demur ? Do cattle bidden march or halt ? All is done purely for the pay ? which earned , And not forthcoming at the instant , makes Religion heresy , and the lord o ' the land Fit subject for a murder in his turn . The patron with cut throat and rifled purse , Deposited i ' the roadside ditch , his due , Naught hinders each good fellow trudging home The heavier by a piece or two in poke , And so with new zest to the common life , Mattock and spade , plow-tail and wagon-shaft Till some such other piece of luck betide . It was frequently stated to the members of the Immigration Commission in southern Italy that crime had greatly diminished in many communities because most of the criminals had gone to America . One Italian official at Messina stated that several years ago southern Italy was a hotbed of crime , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to their whereabouts , he replied , " Why , they are all in the United States . " From the Camorra , that vast spider-web of thieves and prostitutes by whom life and politics in Naples are controlled , have come thousands who find the hard-working Italian immigrants a richer field for exploitation than any field open at home . Still more harassing is the Mafia , by means of which Sicilians contrive to ignore police and courts and to secure justice in their own way . A legacy of Spanish domination and Spanish arrogance is the sense of omerth , or manliness , which holds it dastardly to betray to justice even one 's deadliest foe . To avenge one 's wrongs oneself , and never to appeal to law , is a part of Sicilian honor . In an Italian quarter are men who never work , yet who have plenty of money . " No , " they say , " we do not work . York does not agree with us . We have friends who work and give us money . Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . Their honest fellow-countrymen shrink from them , yet , if one of them is arrested , some make it a point of honor to swear him off , while all scrupulously forget anything against him . Thanks to this perverse idea of " honor , " an Italian murder may be committed in the street in broad daylight , with dozens looking on , yet a few minutes later every spectator will deny to the police that he has seen anything . This highbinder contempt for law is reinforced by sheer terrorism . It is said that often in our courts the sudden wilting of a promising Italian witness has been brought about by the secret giving of the " death-sign , " a quick passing of the hand across the throat as if cutting . The American , with his ready resort to the vigilance committee , is amazed that a whole community should let itself thus be bullied by a few miscreants known to all . Nothing of the sort has ever been tolerated by Northern European immigrants . The secret lies in the inaptness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lack the gift of pulling together , and have never achieved an efficient cooperating unit larger than the family . General Theodore E. Bingham , former Police Commissioner of New York , estimated that there are in that city not fewer than 3000 desperados from southern Italy , " among them as many ferocious and desperate men as ever gathered in a modern city in time of peace ? medieval criminals who must be dealt with under modern law . " In 1908 he stated : " Crimes of blackmailing , blowing up of shops and houses , and kidnapping of their countrymen have become prevalent among Italian residents of the city to an extent* that can not be much longer tolerated . " It is obvious that if our legal system is called upon to cope with a great volume of such crime for a long time , it will slough off certain Anglo-Saxon features and adopt the methods which alope avail in Italy , namely , state police , registry system , " special surveillance , " and " admonition . " ASSIMILATION WITH AMERICANS NoT being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Genoese , for example , come not to earn wages , but to engage in business . They shun the Italian " quarter , "  | mix with Americans , and Anglicize their names . Mariani becomes Merriam ; Abata turns to Abbey ; Garberino softens to Gilbert ; while Campana suffers a " sea change " into Bell . In the produce-markets they deal with Americans , and as high-class saloon-keepers they are forging past Michael and Gustaf . But the Southern Italians remain nearly as aloof as did the Cantonese who built the Central Pacific Railway . Navvies who leave for Naples when the ground freezes , and return in April , who huddle in a " camp " or a box-car , or herd on some " Dago flat , " are not really in America . In a memorial to the acting mayor of New York , the Italian-American Civic League speaks of the " great civically inert mass " of their countrymen in New York , and declares , " By far the largest part of the Italians of this city have lived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American environment . " " In one street , " writes Signor Pecorini , " will be found peasants from one Italian village ; in the next street the lace of origin is different , and distinct are manners , customs , and sympathies . Entire villages have been transplanted from Italy to one New York street , and with the others have come the doctor , the grocer , the priest , and the annual celebration of the local patron saint . " Among the foreign-born , the Italians rank lowest in adhesion to trade-unions , lowest in ability to speak English , lowest in proportion naturalized after ten years ' residence , lowest in proportion of children in school , and highest in proportion of children at work . Taking into account the innumerable " birds of passage " without family or future in this country , it would be safe to say that half , perhaps two thirds , of our Italian immigrants are under America , not of it . Far from being borne along with our onward life , they drift round and round in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some industrial pocket or crevice at the bottom of the national current . LACK OF MENTAL ABILITY STEERAGE passengers from a Naples boat show a distressing frequency of low foreheads , open mouths , weak chins , poor features , skew faces , small or knobby crania , and backless heads . Such people lack the power to take rational care of themselves ; hence their death-rate in New York is twice the general death-rate and thrice that of the Germans . No other immigrants from Europe , unless it be the Portuguese or the half-African bravas of the Azores , show so low an earning power as the Southern Italians . In our cities the head of the household earns on an average $390 a year , as against $449 for the Northern Italian , $552 for the Bohemian , and $630 for the German . In silk-mill and woolen-mill , in iron-ore mining and the clothing trade , no other nationality has so many low-pay workers ; nor does this industrial inferiority in the least fade out with the lapse of time . Their want of mechanical aptitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill manned solely by Southern Italians only one out of fifteen of the extra hands taken on during the " rush " season shows sufficient aptitude to be worth keeping . The operatives require closer supervision than Americans , and each is given only one thing to do , so as to put the least possible strain on his attention . If it be demurred that the ignorant , superstitious Neapolitan or Sicilian , heir to centuries of Bourbon misgovernment , can not be expected to prove us his race mettle , there are his children , born in America . What showing do they make ? Teachers agree that the children of the Southern Italians rank below the children of the Northern Italians . They hate study , make slow progress , and quit school at the first opportunity . While they take , to drawing and music , they are poor in spelling and language and very weak in abstract mathematics . In the words of one superintendent , " they lack the conveniences for thinking . " More than any other children , they fall behind their grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while , at the other extremity stand the children of the . Scandinavians and the Hebrews . The explanation of the difference is not irregularity of attendance , for among pupils attending three fourths of the time , or more , the percentage of Southern Italians retarded is fifty-six as against thirty-seven and a half per cent . for the Russian-Hebrew children and twenty-nine per cent . for the  | German . Nor is it due to the father 's lack of American experience , for of the children of Southern Italians who have been in this country ten or more years sixty per cent . are backward , as against about half that proportion among the Hebrews and the Germans . After allowing for every disturbing factor , it appears that these children , with the dusk of Saracenic or Berber ancestors showing in their cheeks , are twice as apt to drop behind other pupils of their age as are the children of the non-English-speaking immigrants from northern Europe . TRAITS OF ITALIAN CHARACTER THE Southern Italian is volatile , unstable , soon hot , soon cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke . Every candidate claims it because they were for ' him when he saw them . But the man who talks last to them gets their vote . " A charity worker declares that they change their minds " three steps after they have left you . " It is not surprising that such people are unreliable . Credit men pronounce them " very slippery , " and say that the Italian merchants themselves do not extend credit to them . It is generally agreed that the Southern Italians lie more easily than Northern Europeans , and utter untruth without that self-consciousness which makes us awkward liars . " Most of my countrymen , " - says an educated Italian in the consular service of his country , " disregard their promises unless it is to their advantage to keep them . " The man who " sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not " is likely to be a German with his ideal of Treue , an Englishman with his ideal of truth , or an American with his ideal of squareness . The Italians are sociable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As farmers they cluster , and seem to covet the intimacies of the tenement-house . The streets of an Italian quarter are lively with chatter and stir and folks sitting out in front and calling to one another . In their family life they are much less reserved than many other nationalities . With instinctive courtesy they make the visitor welcome , and their quick and demonstrative response to kindly advances makes them many friends . Visiting nurses comment on the warm expressions of gratitude they receive from the children of Italians whom they have helped . Before the boards of inquiry at Ellis Island their emotional instability stands out in the sharpest contrast to the selfcontrol of the Hebrew and the stolidity of the Slay . They gesticulate much , and usually tears stand in their eyes . When two witnesses are being examined , both talk at once , and their hands will be moving all the time . Their glances flit quickly from one questioner to another , and their eyes are the restless , uncomprehending eyes of the desert Bedouin between walls . Yet for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of a simple question , and often it must be repeated . Mindful of these darting eyes and hands , one does not wonder that the Sicilian will stab his best friend in a sudden quarrel over a game of cards . The Slays are ferocious in their cups , but none is so ready with his knife when sober as the Southern Italian . In railroad work other nationalities shun camps with many Italians . Contractors are afraid of them because the whole force will impulsively quit work , perhaps flare into riot , if they imagine one of their number has suffered a wrong . The principal of a school with four hundred Sicilian pupils observes that on the playground they are at once more passionate and more vindictive than other children . Elsewhere , once discipline has been established , " the school will run itself " ; but in this school the teacher " has to sit on the lid all the time . "  |
