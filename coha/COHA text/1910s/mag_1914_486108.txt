It appears to be beyond doubt that our Government has made pretty strong representations to Great Britain on the subject of vexatious interference with neutral commerce . So far as can be gathered from the Washington dispatches , the Administration is neither making a formal protest nor laying down hard-and-fast positions , but is reciting grievances and asking for a clearer understanding . Our shippers are entitled to know under precisely what risks of detention or seizure they may send forward goods . That there was some uncertainty in the British practice of the right of search , in the first weeks of the war , was perhaps hardly to be avoided . Conditions were intricate . We had a blockade which was not a blockade . We had open seas which were yet closed by mines . We had lists of contraband and conditional contraband which were continually being revised . But the time has certainly come when all these obscurities should be cleared up . Definite rules of procedure the United States may now rightly ask for . About them we wish to know , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with international law ; and , if they are , what steps our exporters must take to observe them . Here is no question of ruffling up to England , or putting this country in a hectoring position ; it is simply a question of a vigilant safeguarding of our neutral rights . We make no doubt that our attitude will be judged wholly reasonable and friendly by the British Government . Blusterers about King Cotton thought in 1861 that England should dispatch frigates to America to enforce shipment ; in 1914 , Gov Colquitt tells us , he would " have sent ironclads to England 's door " before he would have permitted our cotton to be held for want of transportation . The paltering Administration policy is exposed by a State Executive who would use the army and navy to compel Europe to pay 15 cents for cotton . By a series of half-way measures , the Administration is now trying to save its face , but it can not fool Gov . Colquitt . Two months ago it induced Great Britain to announce that cotton shipments were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but only after both nations had bought all they needed at 61/2 cents . It has even induced its commercial attaches to cable that " the greatest trouble about cotton movements is caused by contraband , especially copper , mixed with cotton cargoes . " To-dayit is pluming itself on the fact that cotton shipments the fortnight before Christmas reached 557,000 bales , as against 513,000 last year . Plainly , Gov . Colquitt has stepped forward just in time to show up the disgraceful record . Further revelations as to the lengths to which the British censorship has gone in suppressing news to which its public is surely entitlea can only intensify the profound disappointment that this sort of thing can go on in an Anglo-Saxon country . We do not , of course , refer to the military news ; if the English authorities wish to be as silly in regard to the loss of the Audacious as they are ? London weeklies are printing her picture , and everybody knows why  --  that is their own affair . They are certainly in this case deceiving no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the censorship to political news . Thus , our London correspondent reports that the powers that be there have not permitted the English public to know that Japan intervened at Great Britain 's request , that China protested against the violation of her neutrality by British and Japanese troops ; that the Japanese Diet has protested against England 's limiting the field of Japan 's war activity , etc. , etc . Surely , when the war is over and the facts become known , the Government which has permitted this sort of thing will have a pretty day of reckoning unless the Englishman by that time has fallen into a state of mind in which he prefers being humbugged . But if he retains his old jealous regard for his rights and privileges , he will surely do a vast amount of protesting , if only at the humiliating assumption of his mental instability and untrustworthiness from his Government 's point of view , which underlies this astonishing suppression of facts . The news that the Japanese Diet has rejected the great army budget proposed by the Government will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own , and to our newly formed Security League . Had it gone through , they would have shouted at once . " Now you see , Japan is arming , and so we must . " As it is , if we should take their advice , our arming would instantly be utilized in Japan as another reason for more ships and more men for them . This is precisely the stupid game which has brought Europe to its present low pass , and the Japanese Diet is entitled to the greatest credit for having called a halt , even if it should prove to be but a tempo-rary halt . This voting of greater credits for army and navy is one of the surest ways to work against peace the world knows , yet it is always represented as a necessary insurance . We sincerely trust that our own Congress will follow the example of the Japanese Diet and resolutely refuse to increase army or navy , at least until the war is over , when our legislators can really see where the world stands . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Japanese Diet may not prove so wise and , as some British newspapers have been saying , it will then be England 's duty to arm against us . Mr. Menken 's " Security League " was originally formed , according to its projector , not to join in a wild jingo demand for more guns , ships , and men , but merely to get the facts as to our military status before the public , perhaps , in order to quiet what is called the " prevailing unrest . " Last week it was all but stampeded into the usual wholesale demand for enormous outlays by a resolution calling for the expenditure of $100 , - 000,000 at once , to be met by an issue of 31/2 Per cent bonds . This was barely defeated by an appeal for inquiry and investigation first . Congress is , however , to hear from the Security League that it should accept at once all the recommendations of the most belligerent generals and of the Navy General Board . The latter 's proposals have been so extreme as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember rightly , by a single Secretary of the Navy . Why the League should stop at $100,000,000 , we can not see . Are they willing to take the awful responsibility of standing by that figure when by the expenditure of $102,500,000 they can really protect us against invasion ? Whether an inquiry is held or not , we venture to prophesy that the League will promptly be lined up with the Navy League in demanding practically unlimited military expenditure . Finances never weigh with those affected by this craze . They know we are spending 72 cents of every dollar on wars , past and present , but they are quite ready to add $3,500,000 more to our tax-burdens , to say nothing of the sinking fund , the upkeep of the armaments purchased , and all the rest ; and this in the middle of a war whose outcome ought to spell freedom from such burdens , and not increased pressure upon the laboring classes . To pass an amendment to the Constitution of the United States , it is necessary to obtain a two-thirds vote in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the approval ( by mere majority vote ) of the Legislatures of three-fourths of the States . Each part of this process of approval is a substantial act , involving the full responsibility of every person sharing in it . No idea could be more dangerous than that the part of Congress in the affair is of no importance . Upon Congress the most essential responsibility rests ; a fact which requires no enforcement upon any sober mind , but which , as it happens , is very strongly emphasized by several circumstances . In the first place , the population represented by a majority vote in each of three-fourths of the States may , on account of the extremely unequal size of the States , be not only a minority , but a highly unrepresentative minority , of the people of the country . Secondly , the absence of any assigned time-limit as to the approval by the Legislatures makes it possible for the approval of three-fourths of them to be obtained without there being at any one time any such number of States whose Legislatures favor the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the circumstance that Legislatures elected without the slightest reference to any such issue may be snapped up for the purpose at a favorable moment , their vote having no real significance as an indication of deliberate public sentiment . In rejecting the Prohibition amendment last week , the House of Representatives fulfilled a Constitutional duty of the first importance . If Congress is to enact any general legislation , the two remaining items . of Secretary Lane 's conservation programmthe general leasing bill and the Lane-Ferris public lands water-power bill  --  assuredly merit attention . Both have passed the House and are being pressed in the Senate by the Administration and the conservationists ; both are meeting with some opposition from power companies and Western State's-rights men . It is the intent of the opposition to postpone their passage till the next session , at least . Yet as Secretary Lane points out , " there can be no argument for these measures or against them which was not made before the House Committee or the House itself , and their passage commends them as expressive of a practical policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one makes more available the public minerals . The other repeals the old water-power revocable permit law , by which capital has no guarantee against arbitrary eviction , and makes feasible the development of our potential resources on a new scale  --  but 5,000,000 of our 150,000,000 kilowatts now being utilized . Committeehearings make it plain that most of the opposition comes from interests that would grab too much ; and the reporting of the bills will bring the fight out where public opinion can assist them . Those high-tariff Pennsylvania manufacturers who have again demanded of President Wilson that he abandon his " theory " and make them all prosperous and rich by means of their theory , are certainly among the most robust reasoners of our time . Nothing stops or changes them . Their logic flows on sublimely , disregarding all facts That conditions are radically different now from the middle of July , when they first called upon the President to quit his fooling and admit that there was no hope of salvation except in protection , does not make the slightest difference to them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what of that ? In July they were in mortal dread of terrible importations of goods from Europe , and these the war has cut low , but does that make them waver ? Not a hair 's breadth . With heroic tenacity they stick to their one infallible remedy . Raise the tariff , and we shall all instantly flourish like a green bay tree . And they are equally admirable in their pertinacity of gloom . Others are plucking up courage , welcoming signs of better times , pointing to opening mills and men employed again . But none of these things move the Schuylkill Valley philosophers . Let all the world be wrong , they know that they are right . There can be nothing but ruin until the tariff on their manufactures is raised three-tenths of one per cent . And if , meanwhile , Gabriel should blow his horn and the earth fall in a crash , we are sure that these consistent and persistent gentlemen would rise to say : " This would never have happened if the tariff had not been lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidency by helping to pass State laws which violate the nation 's solemn treaty pledges and impose needless , dangerous slights upon the people of a neighboring friendly power . This , from a long editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , has reference to Gov . Johnson 's aspirations . He can best promote his ambition for the Presidency , it says , " by serving public notice upon the new California Legislature that he will veto hay bills which may be passed at the next session proposing further to humiliate Japanese residents of California or to abbreviate their limited industrial opportunities in that State . " And it gathers together a number of expressions of opinion from California jourDais which evince a gratifying sense of responsibility - in the matter of our relations with the Japanese . How representative of the general tone of the California press these may be , it is difficult to judge , but the St. Louis newspaper regards them as clearly indicating the present unpopularity of anti-Japanese agitation in California . It is the one comforting consideration , when such ebullitions of senseless intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Coast , that these moral diseases are apt to run their course , like physical ones , and to disappear with as little reason as they emerged If this should prove to be the case in the present instance , it will be ground for national congratulation . Mr. Taft , in his speech a week or two ago on the danger of war for our country , put none too great emphasis on the importance of this matter of treaty-defying race antagonism as the chief source of peril . Can a Federal Board with such functions as those of the Board of Mediation and Conciliation be held to its original aims ? The report of Commissioner Chambers betrays a certain anxiety lest expansion into doubtful fields of peace-making be hard to check . The work of the Board is already extensive . In the past year it has mediated in twenty-eight railway disputes in which strikes were threatened , involving 125,000 employees . In all these cases the issues were of wages , hours of labor , or conditions of employment , and- in nearly all were serious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer trivial controversies also to the Board ; some implying " the interpretation of schedules and contracts which cover both rates of pay and conditions of service , and in some instances questions of discipline . There is pressure upon the Board from ern , ployees to enforce its awards . But its true work is to lead the opposed parties , by voluntary steps , to agreement . Since the great threatened strike of , Eastern trainmen in July , 1913 , it has undoubtedly saved the country a large sum ; and its dignity and reputation for impartiality are carefully to be safeguarded along the lines of the original . Newlands Act . Constitutional scruples should not be treated lightly , but the report of the General Education Board shows a salutary dissipation of those which long prevented the Government from engaging in the work of Southern farm demonstration . When the Board began its labors in 1906 , the Southern farmer was struggling under a handicap of ignorance which held his average annual earnings in some States below $150 . The Department of Agriculture , though combating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural education , on the ground that Federal funds could be used only for interstate purposes . The offer of the Board to finance such work under the direction of Federal officers made possible the gradual appropriation of Government money , until last year came the announcement that the Government would fully take over and extend purely educational farm demonstrations . The amounts Spent by the nation , the States , and the Board combined totalled $47,000 in 1907 ; in 1914 , $1,200,000 . An encouraging fact is the increase In State appropriations , amounting last year to about $500,000 . The Western State universities long ago proved the value of farm-demonstration work , and yearly use huge sums in it ; there is no reason why the Southern agricultural colleges and State Boards of Agriculture should not carry on a similar endeavor . The centre of the child-labor problem is not in the factory , but on the farm , at least in North Carolina , according to the professor of rural sociology in the State University . The proportion of children on the farms to those in factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of the former there are no laws regulating either the number of hours they may work or the age at which they may begin . On the side of educational and other opportunities , also , they are under a handicap as compared with the boys and girls of the factory towns . Even in the matter of the standard of living they are behind . Yet the term " child labor " esuggests long hours indoors , machinery , dust , tenement homes . These are the work of man , but do we not speak of God 's out-of-doors ? The factory is at least a more or less enterprising form of activity , and we have become accustomed to hearing of dwelling houses and school buildings put up by factory owners , especially in places where the factory is the only reason for the community about it . The farm , on the contrary , supposedly capable of supplying all its own wants , has found it easy to settle down into a rut and get along on as little as possible . Rural sociology will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seldom , if ever before , in our history have seventy-four men , ranging from Mayor to gunmen , and including judges , a sheriff , policemen , and other city employees , been indieted in a body . If this had happened in New York under Croker or in Philadelphia under Ashbridge , surprise would have been smothered in satisfaction , but who could have expected it in Terre Haute , Ind. , a couple of decades after the " blocks of five " scandal ? The charges against Mayor Roberts are many : levying assessments upon-proprietors of gambling houses , saloons , and dance halls ; hiring men to haul repeaters to the polls ; intimidating others in order to force them to enter the alleged conspiracy ; directing the making of cards of false registration , and so on . These acts , if they were committed , violated the Federal election law . While there is a certain comprehensiveness in the indictments , in that they include men who call themselves Republicans and Progressives as well as Democrats , yet , in the words of the Indianapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the **26;1253;TOOLONG machine , and most of them are habitu6s of the ' red light ' district . " That is , the News adds , maliciously , " they belong to the governing class in Terre Haute . " That newspaper rejoices at the arrests because they deal a blow at an old system : " Precisely such crimes have for years marked Terre Haute elections . The men guilty of them have never felt that there was the slightest danger that punishment would follow . They have gone about the business as though it were a legitimate industry . " No one can have read the obituary , notices of the life of John Muir , whose death occurred last Thursday , without being impressed with the feeling that here was one of those grand personalities seldom met with in any generation or in any country . The combination of high intellectual powers with a nobleness , simplicity , and purity of spirit far more rare is what gave his life and work its unique character . Such a life would be an inspiration for all , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific nature . But in Muir 's case , we have not only his scientific and literary output , but the invaluable and imperishable service he rendered to his country and to the world in giving the chief impulse to the preservation of the marvellous scenery of our national parks . One can not avoid a pang of keen regret that , in spite of his singular part in this achievement , the voice that he raised in his old age for the saving of one of the most precious bits of the Yosemite region from impairment was raised in vain . The late Alfred Henry Lewis falls into the category rather of Artemus Ward than of Bret Haute . Unlike the delineator of Poker Flat and Roaring Camp , the author of " Wolfville Days " had little genius for the short story ; his tales kept to the simple outlines of the sketch . Perhaps for this reason they bring into clearer relief the elements of humor and picturesqueness of character as the chief literary materials of the early West . This pictures of the personalities of the long-winded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the best eddicated , that ever dwells in Arizona " : Cherokee Hall , " predestined kyard-sharp " , and the rest of the camp which eats its daily flapjacks at the 0 . K. Restaurant , and adjourns to the Red Light bar  --  are rather caricatures than anything else ; but they are legitimate and amusing caricatures . The episodes , too , are of a sort harmonizing with the wonderful adequacy and impossible flavor of the Arizona language . The panoply of war may be ready prepar- ? ed , but its songs must be impromptu . If a . Randall or a Rouget de Lisle does not come forward , a camp-meeting hymn fits out the words of " John Brown 's Body " ; those who , are astonished at the vogue of " Tipperary , " as-Frenchmen were at " Il fera tfes chain " dans la ville ce soir " in 1898 , must remember that the recruit wants something new  --  the war-songs of yesteryear wo n't serve .

Go dress yourself in all your best , and come along with me , We 're going to the cruel wars in High Germany . Every regular British regiment knows the air of " The British Grenadier , " and the list of martial lyrics by great English poets in not short . It is the tendency of a nation 's war songs to grow better as the conflict lengthens ; but for initial use it would seem the military authorities might have a few approved but " new " tunes up their sleeves  --  to save the troops from taking just anything at hand .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
