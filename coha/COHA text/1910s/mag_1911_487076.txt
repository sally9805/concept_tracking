Following the Conquistadores : Along the Andes and down the Amazon . By H. J. Mozans , A.M. , Ph.D. , Author of " ! Up the Orinoco and Down the Magdalena . " With an Introduction by Col. Theodore Roosevelt . Illustrated . New York : D. Appleton &; Co. $3 net . The , increasing number of books that issue from the press relating to South America is both a tribute to the growth of the countries in that continent and a sign of the keener interest which the rest of the world begins to feel in them . As this interest , which used to be stimulated by the aspects of nature and the remains of primitive culture , is now chiefly roused by an appreciation of the material progress of these countries and of the promise of increased trade which that progress holds out , recent writers have occupied themselves more with Argentina , Brazil , and Chili than with the other less advanced republics , and have dealt chiefly with the agricultural and mineral resources which are being there developed . About such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the author is not indifferent to their importance . He describes in Peru and Bolivia a region in which much remains to be done to make its natural wealth available , and expresses hopes for the future rather than records advances already made . The journey here described begins at Panama , where the achievements of American engineers and the not less creditable work of American scientific physicians in banishing tropical diseases from one of their haunts are dwelt upon with well-deserved emphasis . Thence Dr. Mozans proceeds south to Guayaquil , a nest of fever and malaria which sadly needs American science and energy to deal with it ; and from Guayaquil he climbs the Ecuadorean Andes by the recently opened railway to Riobamba and Quito . Returning to the coast , he sails to Callao , visits Lima and the famous Oroya railroad , which after reaching a height of 15,665 feet above sea level , sends off a branch to the great mining centre of Cerro de Pasco Then he sails further down the coast to Mollendo , the terminus of the Peruvian Southern Railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western chain of the Andes , finds his way to Arequipa , Lake Titicaca , La Paz , and ultimately Cuzco , the ancient capital of the Incas . Finally , having gone back to Lima and thence to Truxillo , some way north of Lima , heenters on by far the most fatiguing part of his wanderings in a long journey across the Cordilleras from the Pacific into the valley of the Paranapura , and thence along the Huallaga into the great Amazon , which he follows down to Iquitos , the principal centre of trade in that region , and thence to Para in Brazil . The book is agreeably and intelligently written in a flowing style . We are told something about the scenes and the aspects of nature generally , something about the inhabitants , something about the author 's own personal experiences , yet not enough to make us tire of him . There is a good deal of moralizing , and a vast deal of quotation ( not always illuminative ) from poets , English , Italian , and above all Spanish , especially South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Mozans 's reading and bring to the reader 's notice many names of minor Spanish colonial poets , whose fame has never before reached him . Verse-making seems to be assiduously cultivated in Lima , and Arequipa , and even in plague-stricken Guayaquil . In the interesting Introduction , which Col. Roosevelt has written for the book , a deserved tribute is paid to the sympathy of Dr. Mozans with the people among whom he went and his appreciation of their good qualities . It is altogether desirable that a traveller should have this disposition to see the bright side of things and to look for merits rather than defects . Sum a disposition is one of the pleasing features of this book But it is carried too far when the weak points are ignored and a general tint of rose is thrown over the whole moral and intellectual landscape . Dr. Mozans is not merely a persistent optimist , but what one may call , if the expression be permissible , a confirmed " booster . " He sees little but what is elevated in the qualities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awaits the country , he is hopeful of the prospects of railways across the Andes which it must cost untold millions of dollars to construct and the profitable traffic possibilities of which appear to the unpoetical mind to be in a somewhat remote future . He has little but praise for the Roman Catholic Church in South America , differing therein from most of the competent judges on the spot who , while acknowledging the virtues and efforts of some of its noble figures , including many of the Jesuit missionaries , recognized how little it has done for the people And this determination to extenuate faults goes beyond all bounds when it makes attempt to palliate the hideous crimes of the Spanish conquerors . Pizarro and many of his captains were doubtless men of amazing energy and courage . Never in any age or country were there exploits more extraordinary . But to gloss over their rapacity and their cruelty and their treachery is to strike at all moral distinctions . These crimes have been crimes and sins in all nations and at all times . If , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , whom Spanish religion held to be outside the pale of moral obligation , or justified because they were part of an attempt to bring the natives to a knowledge of the true faith , then the individual men can be defended only at the expense of the sort of religion they held . There were happily other Spaniards in those days who had retained more of the real spirit of Christianity than the infamous friar Vicente de Valverde over whom Dr. Mozans tries to throw a cloak of indulgence . Regarded as a contribution to our knowledge of the regions which he has here described , the book of Dr. Mozans does not stand in the front rank . It is , for instance , far less thorough and exact than that of the late Edward G. Squier , the first American traveller , who , while he investigated Peruvian antiquities with care , was also exact in his descriptions of the life he saw around him . He was a practised archmologist , while our author does not claim to be . But apart from archeological details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions . He is loose , for instance , in his estimates of the heights he crosses , and is generally vague , although often picturesque , in his remarks on the character of Andean scenery . . And he often surprises us by the uncritical way in which he treats ridiculous fables or fantastic ethnological theories . The most interesting part of the book is the account it gives of the part of Peru least known to the outside world , viz. , the region which lies between the Pacific Coast and the Amazon at Iquitos . The pictures of the surroundings of the towns of Moyobamba and Balsapuerto and- the sort of life the people were leading in those far recesses of a mountain and forest land are well given . The story of the perils encountered on the journey across the great ranges is fresh and lively , and the description of the vast tropical forests of the upper Amazon and its tributaries quite impressive . Dr. Mozans observes with truth that one may travel through these wildernesses for days or weeks together without seeing any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Alfred Russell Wallace told us long ago in his remarks on the woods of the East Indian archipelago , that the notion we are apt to form of the brilliance of the flowers in the woods of the tropics is unfounded . He tells us also , and this we are more surprised to hear , that the trees of the Amazonian forests are not generally lofty , only one of them exceeding one hundred feet ; and he makes the just observation that the number of ? trees of different species which one finds on any given piece of ground is much greater than in the wooded- tracts of temperate countries . This fact very largely affects the cost of lumbering operations . In order to get a certain number of trees of the same species , it is necessary to cover a disproportionately large space of ground , and either to cut down many other trees which are not wanted or to drag out from among the others , perhaps with great difficulty , those which it is desired to have . The great industry now pursued along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting rubber . Dr. Mozans does not mention , and we assume had not heard of , the shocking cruelties recently perpetrated by some of the agents of rubber companies along the putumayo River , on the frontier of Peru , which have created so painful a sensation in Europe . His account of the various adventures connected with the exploration of the course of the great river by early Spanish discoverers will be new to most readers , and gives a touch of human interest to a stream which has so far figured less in history than any other water artery of the world . Our author 's eagerness to put upon men and things in Peru the best face they can be made to wear may be explained or defended by the argument that , as these have been often scornfully treated by European travellers , it is proper to redress the balance . But when his enthusiasm carries him in his " Foreword " to claim for " the Iberian race , " under which he includes the Portuguese of Brazil , that it is growing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that which he calls " the Anglo-Saxon " he destroys our confidence in his judgment . Those who know South America will be rather inclined to deplore the fate which gave these vast and naturally rich territories to nations which so neglected or threw away their opportunities as Spain and Portugal did . We may be indulgent to the defects of the present generation which is suffering from the crimes and blunders of the past , but we must recognize how slow will be the progress upward in communities only one of which has yet learned to respect both order and liberty , and several of which have by intermixture with Indian and ( in Brazil ) with negro blood lowered the quality of the European stock . There is no use in blinking these facts ; the best men in Spanish America recognize them , and are aware of the immense difficulties they have to confront . Political unrest is not the greatest of the evils that have to be overcome . CURRENT FICTION . Sixes and Sevens . By 0 . Henry . New York : Doubleday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hand of a writer whose premature death has been regarded as a loss to American letters offers an excellent opportunity both for tracing the development of a talent and for pointing out at least one notable trait which differentiates 0 . Henry 's work , more than that of any other American , from the short story as it is written abroad . Of the twenty-five tales included in the present volume , two at least were published after the writer 's death , while some go back as far as 1903 , if not further . The reader will find no difficulty in distinguishing between the earlier and the later work , between comparatively crude performances like " New York by Campfire Light " or " October and June , " and the accomplished cleverness of " Makes the Whole World Kin , " " The Day We Celebrate , " and " Ulysses and the Dog-man . " What is common to both . is only the characteristic flow of high spirits which gives to most of 0 . Henry 's work the ease and speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kin , " a burglar breaks into a New York residence one night when every one but the master of the house is away . The man wakes , sits up in bed , and in compliance with a curt request uttered behind a levelled revolver , holds up his right hand . He can not lift his left hand because , as he explains , his arm is crippled with rheumatism . But the intruder , too , is a victim of rheumatism , and one neuralgic twinge makes the two men kin . The burglar sits down on the bed , and for several pages they discuss the comparative merits of various anti-rheumatism remedies , a subject on which both men display an extraordinary amplitude of information . They decide that there is really one remedy known to science ? " little old sanitary , ameliorating , lest-we-forget booze . " And when our rheumatic citizen has got on his clothes with the other 's assistance , the two go out into the stillness of the night to test the validity of their conclusions . Now , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lighter moods , by the European writer to whom 0 . Henry has so frequently been compared . But whereas Maupassant , relying on the innate humor of the idea , would have told his story soberly , we have in 0 . Henry the " rapid-fire " manner of a newer day . Almost every line has its grip , and every sentence has its surprise . In other words , manner strives to be more extravagant even than matter . It is in this mingling of verity with extravagance , in this inability to resist the temptation to make a joke at the tragic moment , that our newer art , in the short story or the theatre , swerves so remarkably from the accepted standards . Pandora 's Box By John Ames Mitchell . New Yorke Frederick A. Stokes Co . All the graceful humor , the vivacity , and the charm which characterize Mr. Mitchell 's editorials are found in " Pandora 's Box . " But these are not in themselves sufficient for the making of a novel . A plot is needed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The venerable theme of the suitor of low degree who wins the high-born lady requires more skilful treatment than Mr. Mitchell can give to prove fresh and attractive in these sophisticated days . The characters are for the most part mere figure-heads . The villanous old Earl of Drumworth is weary from service in many Victorian shilling-shockers . Even the scene of the story , Drumworth Castle , seems an old acquaintance . The democracy of the book is so very enthusiastic that it fails to be convincing , and for the American hero , who has won the sympathy of the reader and the love of the aristocratic English heroine in the guise of a humble architect , to become suddenly a man of wealth , owner of Drumworth Castle . is much in the nature of an anti-climax . When a book proves pleasant reading in spite of such defects as these just noted , it is evident that its writer deserves congratulations on the score of style and craftsmanship . The dialogue is sprightly and entertaining and the atmosphere of the story is wholesome and agreeable . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , Baseborn . The book is worth reading if only for the sake of enjoying the acquaintance of this excellent beast . A Person of Some Importance . By Lloyd Osborne Indianapolis : The Bobbs-Merrill Co . A Stevenson romance with a slight flavor of E. Phillips Oppenheim , that is , a good " yarn " told for its own sake with exceptional skill  --  of such is this tale . The action hinges on the identity of the man called John Mort , who appears for only a short time at the beginning of the story . This mysterious person of uncertain nationality and apparently boundless wealth , lives in luxury with a beautiful woman on a South Sea island , and governs the peaceful natives , After six years spent in doing Mort 's errands round the coasts and islands of the Pacific , the hero , anxious to revisit his boyhood home , leaves his master 's service under the strictest pledge of secrecy as to their whole connection . This pledge is the cause of all his troubles The scenes range from the hero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of an old general , and where he is persecuted by powerful agencies determined to discover the whereabouts of John Mort , to Lotoalofa , the coral-girt island of the South Seas . The plot is handled with remarkable dexterity , so that it is seldom possible to guess even the next turn of its devious road . The book will be heartily enjoyed by readers who like plenty of variety and surprise , and have a proper contempt for probability . Find the Woman . By Gelett Burgess . Indianapolis : The Bobbs-Merrill Co . Mr. Burgess should have added the name of Robert Louis Stevenson to the list of five individuals beginning with Scheherazade , to whom he has dedicated his book . The method of " Find the WOnaan " is the method of the " New Arabian Nights , " but the manner is Mr. Burgess 's own . ' Upon a thread of mystery and adventure he has strung a dozen short stories , some of them more frankly impossible than others , but most of them funny and nearly all of them cleverly done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be built around a kernel of fact , is altogether delightful . Another chapter is evidently intended as a tribute to the memory of Richard Mansfield . There are two pages in the book on which the smile develops into a roar . They have to do with the sanctimonious Dr. Hop-bottom , with whom profane utterance takes the form of an orgy in technical and scientific terminology . Dr. Hopbottom addresses an Irish truck-driver as follows : What diacritical right has a binomial oxypendactile advoutrous holoblastic rhizopod like you , got with your trinoctial ustilaginous Westphalian holocaust blocking up the teleostean way for , anyway If you give me any more of your lunarian , snorto-maniac hyperbolic pylorectomy , I 'll skive you into a megalopteric diatomorif erous auxospore ! This is not very subtle humor , but the reviewer , while copying out the foregoing sentences , laughed anew . The Texican . By Dane Coolidge . Chicago : A. C.-McClurg &; Co . One is irresistibly tempted to classify this as nature study ( human nature , to be sure ) , so much more comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyotes , and wild mustangs from the pens of our zoological biographers , than to any accepted type of Wild West fiction . While the picturesque and mirth-enlivened Wyoming of " The Virginian " no longer exists  --  we have Mr. Wister 's own word for it , and still less accessible is the New Mexico of " Santa Fe 's Partner " ? did it ever exist outside the easily stimulated imagination of Mr. Janvier ? ? the Arizona of " The Texican " is still open to exploration . To be sure , times have changed in " Geronimo County " since the day when Pecos Dalhart came out of an oppressively civilized Texas to enlist as-free lance in the guerrilla cat-tle-war between John Upton of Tonto Basin and Isaac Crittenden of Verde Crossing . The authority of the law has superseded The good old rule , the simple plan That they shall take who have the might , And they shall keep who can , and the ingenious artistry of the " running iron " is less in requisition among its cowboys . But a very brief sojourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a physical type as " Old Crit , " " tall , gaunt , and stooping , his head canted back to make up for the crook in his back . " And in the eye of the plainsman to-day as he looks over the effeminate town product , there is to be recognized a curiosity devoid of all admiration , very closely akiff to the expressions , both facial and verbal , with which Pecos in jail warded off the ingratiating reporter who thought to make copy of his woes . " He turned on the reporter and scowled . Go take a run and jump at yourself , ' he said . " It is when he approaches the cowboy-in this attitude of amused and sympathetic observation that Mr. Coolidge is at his best . He has found nothing so hilarious or so rich in theatrical effect as the other two above-mentioned authors discovered in their happy hunting grounds ; and as for his wary of telling his story , he only speaks right on in unpretentious fashion with occasional boyish lapses into the vernacular Yet he seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others the real feelings that are at the bottom of the esoteric quality of Western humor . BROWNING 'S POPULARITY . The Early Literary Career of Robert Browning . Four Lectures , by Thomas R. Lounsbury . New York- Charles Scribner 's Sons . $1.20 net . Professor Lounsbury 's lectures at the University of Virginia on the Barbour-Page Foundation are justified by the biographies which contain a mass of mythical statement on a few events in the poet 's career . Contrary to prevailing opinion , and indeed to Browning 's statements , the reception at first accorded his poetry was cordial . " Pauline " ( 1833 ) does n't count . It was issued anonymously and for two decades was forgotten . " Paracelsus " ( 1835 ) , one of his finest studies in character and sensation , did not have a large sale . No poetry produced in the fourth decade of the last century did have a large sale . But it received no contemptuous notice and did evoke glowing predictions of his future achievements . Forster 's review in the Examiner , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taracelsus , ' " was in reality no more influential than William Johnson Fox 's in the Monthly Repository , or Leigh Hunt 's in his Journal Fraser 's Magamite somewhat aggressively proclaimed the poem superior to Taylor 's " Philip Van Artevelde , " the work which had attained highest critical repute in that decade . Browning 's biographers have simply not looked into the matter . No ork created a profounder impression than " Paracelsus " among the awakened spirits of the time . Contemporary notices of " Strafford " ( 1837 ) reveal how high was the anticipation of it raised by the previous publication , and how keen the disappointment . Of " Sordello " ( 1840 ) Professor Lounsbury says : " Perhaps there is no instance in literary history of an author who proceeded to destroy his own reputation with more systematic endeavor . . ? . Certainly never were efforts of that sort attended with more overwhelming success . " He recounts some of the familiar stories , such as that of Douglas Jerrold , who , after starting on the book , sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , God , I am an idiot ! " But more valid are the estimates in the leading authorities . Not a favorable word can be found for the poem , even in the obscurest quarters . Thus began the eclipse of Browning 's reputation . " Pippa Passes " ( 1841 ) , poetry of a high order , was ignored . " Dramatic Lyrics " ( 1842 ) and " Dramatic Romances and Lyrics " ( 1845 ) , containing his work of the most sustained excellence , were received with indifference The general public , even of the highly educated , Professor Lounsbury infers , had been turned against Browning by their disappointment over " Sordello . " As for the plays , the records prove that they were unsuccessful , maugre the poet 's prote=tations to the contrary " Strafford " was for five performances kept on the stage only by the combined drawing power of the greatest actor and actress of the time , Macready and Helen Faucit . More contested is the fortune of " A Blot i ' the ' Scutcheon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events , was prematurely cut short in a career of triumph In reality it was performed but three nights in all , and to dwindling houses , was then withdrawn for old plays , and was not again acted during the remaining sixteen weeks of the season . Moreover , on its revival by Samuel Phelps , it was presented only eight times during the entire season of 1848-9 . As a writer for the stage Browning certainly was not successful But Professor Lounsbury is not content with establishing this fact . He proceeds to argue that Browning was no dramatist at all . Part of his criticism is just . The poet was interested in pdignant situations , not in the succession of events , nor in the plot or action . He depicted individual states of soul , not the interplay of various characters . The dialogue is frequently hard to follow . But it is not a catholic criticism that applies to " A Blot i ' the ' Scutcheon " standards that properly apply to " As a Man Thinks " or " Mid-Channel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The common-sense attitude that finds " A Blot i ' the ' Scutcheon " ridiculous would look upon " Philaster " as a patchwork of silly romantic situations , and would characterize the tragic Othello as a drivelling idiot , because even an ordinary man could have seen on five minutes ' reflection that Desdemona 's unfaithfulness was a physical impossibility . In other words , Professor Louusbury 's judgments , suggestive as they are , leave out of account some elements necessary to a perfectly valid conclusion . Indeed , behind the whole investigation lurks an animus that for some may negative its truly valuable results . Professor Lounsbury has been so sorely annoyed by Browning 's obscurity that he has set out-to prove that this obscurity alone blighted for ' thirty years a promising reputation The present immense vogue of the poet be attributes largely to the artificial interest created by Browning societies , which are nevertheless hurting the poet by centring attention on the most unpoetic parts of his work . Yet there is a tonic quality in these eminently sensible views , couched as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor and irony . They should especially fall into the hands of devotees like the feminine enthusiast who exclaimed after listening to a reading from her adored poet : " If we did not know how splendid this whole thing is , what a horrible bore we should think it to be " Such enthusiasts will accept not one of Professor Lounsbury 's critical opinions , but they can not controvert the facts he has adduced . Ecce Deus . By William Benjamin Smith . Jena Diederichs . The distinguished mathematician and philosopher of Tulane University has been devoting many years to the study of the origins of Christianity , and has gathered together an immense amount of material more or less ready for publication in defence of the thesis , already promulgated in the first edition of his " Der vorchristliche Jesus " ( 1906 ) , to the effect that the Jesus of the New Testament was not a man like Buddha or Confucius , but God or a God ( it is not perfectly clear what dens means as applied to Jesus ) like Mithra , the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-Christian Jewish circles . The attack on Arthur Brews , the first part of whose " Christusmythe " was handled mercilessly by German radical critics , induced Professor Smith to waive for a while the intended logical order of the publication of the vast stores of accumulated material and to come without further ado into the debate , taking up the cudgels with the avowed purpose of showing the critics what the fundamental question at issue really is , and of indicating , by select examples , the kind of evidence he has completely at his command in unpublished manuscript in support of his somewhat surprising contention . Hence " Ecce Deus " now , and hence the German dress . The reader should bear in mind that Dr. Smith professes an interest not only in religion but in-the Christian religion , " our religion , " as he allows himself to say . To be sure , he is careful not only to distinguish sharply between religion and ethics ( a separation which is not conspicuous in the Jewish prophets or in the utterances commonly ascribed to Jesus ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Himalaya summits of ethics were not reached in the New Testament , and that no such dizzy heights of pure morals tower above us there as in the second book of Plato 's " Republic . " The reader should likewise bear in mind that the volume is avowedly an attack upon the historical method of such scholars as Wellhausen , Schmiedel , and Harnack , and that even in the learned appended discussions of such points as " the pillars of Schmiedel , " " the silence of Josephus and Tacitus , " " Nazareth , " and " Judas Iscariot , " the audience to whom he speaks is ever before him . The drift of the book , stated dryly in the reviewer 's own language , seems to be about this . Traditional theology accepts as credible the extraordinary events commonly called " miracles , " and believes that Jesus is both God and man , a credulity and belief which no unprejudiced modern man ( for whom alone the work is intended ) can share . Unitarian theology is intellectually as deficient as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus quasi dens , if Jesus were a Jewish teacher who said some beautiful things about God and man , waiving the fact that most of the sayings attributed to him are equalled in Jewish thought and surpassed in Greek . Now , as matter of fact , there is no thinkable tertium quid between Jesus as Man and Jesus as God . It follows that if he was a man , Christianity is inexplicable ; if he was a God , the hypothesis of an historical man Jesus is superfluous . Again , as matter of fact , Jesus was no more man than his early rival Mithra . So convinced is Dr. Smith of the truth of his thesis that he ventures to affirm that if there were no positive evidence for the existence of the pre-Christian Jesus cult , it would be necessary to postulate the fact in order adequately to account for Christianity . At the same time , he is aware of the possible rejoinder of his critics , that the positive evidence hitherto adduced for the Jesus cult is meagre , that the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Testament , apart from the Gospels , is special pleading , and that , above all , the Gospels themselves purport to narrate the sayings and doings of an historical person like Isaiah and Jeremiah . The last point is confessedly important , for the Gospels exist as literary documents . But existence is not interpretation . The critics have been unable to reach a consistent method of interpretation and have as a result of their failure lost themselves in the mazes of subjectivity . What do the Gospels intend ? To the Tulane professor it has been given to know the clue to the exegesis of the Gospels . To be sure , he has had some predecessors , but none so rigorous , thoroughgoing , and scientific as he . The clue is allegory . The Gospels are not the evident reminiscences about a man but the occult annals of a God . In the Gospel of Mark , for example , when rightly that is allegorically interpreted , there stands forth in its purity , unsullied by the human spots found in the Fourth Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Smith insists , it is a question of method . " Ecce Deus " is dedicated to the Manes of Origen . The most annoying thing in this amazingly clever book is the persistent aroma of finality which envelops the discussion in general and the exegesis in particular . This finality is to the older historical method the only heresy of which a scientific student is capable . - However , due allowance must be made for the polemic and popular trend of the argument . Kansas in the Sixties . By Samuel J. Crawford . Chicago : A. C. McClurg &; Co. $2 net . This is a plain , unvarnished frontiersman 's narrative of war and peace ; it is also an interesting contribution to a period in the history of his State , which is too little known . No one can put the book down without feeling that he has been close to a remarkable figure , a State-builder of , rugged personality , indomitable will , and no little power . To understand Kansas , either in its Sturm and Drang period of the fifties or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of its men . Gen. Crawford reached Kansas after the battle for Free Soil had been won , for he did not cross the boundary of Kansas Territory until March 1 , 1859 , just a month after John Brown had left Kansas soil forever . The Territory was then looking forward , after five years of trial by fire , to an era of peaceful development , only to become itself , in part , the battleground of a far greater and more terrible civil war than it had yet experienced . How rapidly things moved in this virgin territory appears from the fact that Crawford , the young immigrant , was deemed a perfectly qualified Kansan by December , 1859 , for he was then chosen to the first State Legislature . In May , 1861 , he got leave from the Legislature to raise a company for the defence of the Union , and from then until November 8 , 1864 , when not yet thirty he was elected Governor of Kansas , he was steadily in the field , retiring as Colonel of the Second Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been a resident , but little more than five years . That Gen Crawford was a gallant soldier , every one in Kansas knows , and the outsider can not fail to be convinced of it by this narrative . Not that there is anything of the swashbuckler about the author ; but the vigor of his personality and the number of his accomplishments sp6ak for themselves . Particularly stirring is the story of his colored regiment and the risks of cold-blooded massacre they took when they volunteered . Gen. Crawford writes with much of the intensity of feeling of the sixties . If there are still unreconstructed Rebels , here is an unreconstructed Northerner , and we confess to have found the acquaintance refreshing in these days when so many would have it appear , that there was nothing more at stake than a polite difference of opinion as to whether one 's servants should be paid or unpaid . But if the ex-Governor can still deliver ringing volleys at his quondam enemies in gray , it can not be overlooked that his feelings sometimes carry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been much strengthened by a more careful consultation of the records . Thus his account of his troops firing over Gen. Lyon 's body at Wilson 's Creek is incorrect . His account of the battle of Prairie Grove , for another instance , is open to far more serious criticisms . It is well , therefore , to read his battle accounts for their stirring stories of brave deeds rather than for historical truths . The latter part of Gen. Crawford 's book relates to his civilian experiences ; but even here the military intervenes , for one of his first acts as Governor was to visit Washington and the troops of the Army of the Potomac . Moreover , as he resigned from the army to become Governor , so he resigned as Governor in November , 1869 , to become colonel of the Nineteenth Kansas Cavalry , a six months ' regiment raised to make a winter campaign under Sheridan against the hostile Indians of Kansas . Though few know it , Kansas under Gov . Crawford was compelled to place troops in the field to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1865 , 1866 , 1867 , 1868-69 . Gen. Crawford writes as one familiar with Indian brutalities , with little or no sympathy for the red man ; - yet he was a leader in the effort to drive out traders who supplied them with whiskey and guns , and he helped to defeat the scandalous efforts to rob some tribes of their lands . This entire phase of his book makes sad reading , with its record of bloodshed and governmental blundering . But here , too , the historian of the future will find much of value . Problems in Railway Regulation . By Henry S. Haines . New York : The Macmillan Co. $1.75 net . This book is in a sense a continuation of the author 's previous volumes , for although it treats to some extent the same subject matter as is to be found in " Restrictive Railway Legislation " and " Railway Corporations as Public Servants , " this treatment serves merely as a summarized introduction to the discussion of the urgent problems of the present day . The six preliminary chapters of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway experience with a thorough study of transportation history , and that he is possessed of rare skill in presenting vividly and concisely the salient facts in the formation , extension , reconstruction , and regulation of our railway net . Doubtless because of the author 's service with the " Plant System " and his interest in the South , more attention is given to Southern railway development than is usual among transportation historians , and much new light is thrown upon this neglected section of the country . The problems treated are eight in number  --  incorporation , finance , construction , operation , traffic , discrimination , rate-making , and labor . Whether the reader agrees with the writer 's conclusions or not , he will be impressed by the calm handling of topics , by the total absence of cbias , and by the modesty with which personal opinions are ex-pi and he will be brought into familiar touch with all the questions that are the subject of present controversy . Problems of incorporation arise largely in connection with reorganization , merger , and consolidation . Separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are revealed in these gradual concentrations of corporate power , but the Federal Government may say how the franchises shall be exercised in interstate commerce The benefits of such unification of management are to be derived from suitable traffic arrangements authorized by Federal authority rather than by merger of the corporations themselves . Financial problems have to do largely with questions of capitalization and the limitation of earnings Here the author takes a sound position , but one which in the light of Supreme Court decision can only be regarded as heterodox , that any physical valuation of our entire railway system seems impracticable ; that in the event of inordinate profits to certain railways from what appear to be reasonable rates when levied by competitors , the excess over a reasonable return is to be taken by the treasury through a graduated tax ; that interference with existing capitalization would create injustices that would more than offset any advantages to be gained thereby , and that Federal supervision should intervene , if at all , only with respect to the issue of new securities and then reluctantly and tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to political influences . Discussion of the problems of traffic , discrimination , rate-making , and labor all leads in one direction , a plea for a certain degree of liberty for the railways in the making of rates , and permission to establish traffic associations under Federal jurisdiction . In the light of the recent sweeping rate decisions of the Commission , the issue is no longer between shippers and railways as to reasonable rates , but rather between railways and the Commission as to reasonable profits . Materials and supplies are controlled by the industrial Trusts Wages are fixed by the brotherhoods and the Federal board of arbitration . In the recent rate cases , labor for the first time aligned itself in a common cause with the managements and demanded that rates should be adjusted to the trade-union wages scale . As a result of the Commission 's present authority and its exercise , tariffs are becoming hardened on the existing rate basis . Capital is imperatively demanded for improvements . In the midst of these conflicting demands and requirements , the only relief is to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities of this policy as a source of future profits are still problematical . A few errors have crept into the book The date of the formation of the Massachusetts Railroad Commission is given as 1879 , which is an obvious misprint for 1869 . The " commodities clause " does not prohibit railway companies " from engaging in mining or producing any commodity entering into interstate traffic " ; it merely prohibits railways from transporting in interstate commerce commodities which they have mined or produced . It should have been stated that the figure of average capitalization per mile for the United States in 1908 , $71,819 , includes duplications due to the holdings of the securities of one railway by another The figute of net capitalization was $57,201 The English road engineer 's name should be Telford , not Telf air . The statement that cost of performance per traffic units " has been increasing since 1902 " is a little misleading because , according to the author 's own statistics , the expense per ton-mile Was higher in 1904 , and per passenger-mile in 1907 , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misconstruction of the statement that cost of railway plant to event , and because they give perhaps the most vivid picture of the man to be found in the present memoirs The Professor was at his best when he was illustrating and expounding the writers whom he loved As he " reeled off " long quotations with marvellous verbal accuracy , with perfect enunciation , and with a curious haunting undertone as of music , one could not but envy those students whose high privilege it was to hear him from week to week in the lecture-room at Birmingham His memory was prodigious One night the conversation turned on Swift . He asked me if I remembered the conclusion of Tame 's chapter on the Dean . He leaned farther back in his chair , took his pipe from his mouth , and with half-closed eyes turned to the ceiling , he repeated , without once stopping for a forgotten word , the whole of that magnificent passage He seemed to derive some acute pleasure , as of a physical kind , from the act of reciting the ringing periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pages of Taine 's " English Literature " The night before that upon which he met his death , Professor Collins spent with me . We were alone . And there opposite me as I write these memories is the basket chair in which he liked to sit huddled up , pipe alight , head leaning back , as he inveighed against the charlatans or gave shape to his appreciation of the great ones His attacks and his appreciations were alike remarkable for clearness of statement as for beauty of phrase ' The next night , contrary to his wont , he took a sleeping draught and slept out of doors Later , while wandering perhaps half unconscious in the dark , he fell into the water . The present memoir is a worthy portrait of a man who made many enemies by his outspoken criticism of slovenly work , but who had also the warmest friends . The book suffers less from the indiscriminate inclusion of uninteresiing letters than do most of the swollen biographies now written in England , ? ? but it might still be reduced somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar 's enormous activity as lecturer and writer , of his fight for recognition ending in the professorship in the University of Birmingham . Despite his inveterate bookishness , he kept also his interest in life , especially , it may be added , in the shady side of life . Those who read his article in the National Review of December , 1905 , on the " Mersham Tunnel Mystery " will not be surprised to know that , like some other good and great men , he was powerfully attracted by the mysteries of crime and imposture , and was , for instance , so far absorbed in the intricacies of the TiChborne case as to seek the acquaintance of the claimant . In 1903 , he helped to found a society commonly called the Murder Club , which is still in existence and the objects of which , though secret , are easily surmised He sketched the plot of a detective story which has since been written out by A C. Fox-Davies and is soon to be published as " Rastchuk 's Revenge . " Professor Collins got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pages of the present memoir are not lacking in entertaining stories and observations . Some of the latter are not free of causticity , as witness this entry in his diary : With Browning I was miserably disappointed , there was marked vulgarity about him , particularly in , his accent and in the tone of his voice , &; a certain indescribable savor of sycophancy of a man eager to be of a grade to which he did not belong ; but the poet was there  --  the poet 's keen eye  --  the poet 's heart  --  obvious in his remarks and descriptions
