txt rt is interesting to remark that the gentlemen who argued in support of " the " income tax at the hearing on Saturday all had a different sort of income tax in mind as the proper sort of income tax . Nobody so far as we know has urged that the Federal Government ought not to have power to levy any sort of tax in case of urgent necessity , even including an income tax . The argument against " the " income tax is that , under plea of a necessity which has no present existence . Federal powers are asked which ought not to be granted even if the necessity did exist , except under safeguards which the supporters of the taz themselves approve . Prof. SELIGMAN , for example , " ma.do an appeal on patriotic grounds for the adoption of a system of taxation the proceeds of which might be in the main distributed among the States in time of mace , and might prove the salvation of the Republic In the event of war . " But " the " Income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in the proposed amendment , and sad experience proves that nothing should be taken for granted regarding the wisdom of legislators . When would the professor have the States safeguard themselves along the lines he indicates ? Is it better to do this before the harm is done , or after it is too late ? What 's the hurry ? The Professor thinks that it makes little difference that the Federal Government should take toll from any of the State securities , provided that it took toll from all of them . All would remain on the same relative level , therefore none would be prejudiced . The Federal Government is now Issuing fifty millions of bonds , and reserves a discrimination in their favor which it is not willing to waive on the argument of relative equality . According to the Treasury circulars now being Issued the forthcoming bonds will be exempt " from taxation in any form by or under State , municipal , or local authority . " This gives - the Federal bonds an exemption which it is urged is a loss of no consequence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation . Nobody grudges the Federal bonds their primacy , which is sufficiently marked without artificial increase by an assumed right to tax bonds which enjoy a limited local primacy unless it is signed away . It is only right that the States should enjoy a discrimination in their favor such as the Federal Government exercises in favor of Federal bonds . It ' would then be exemption against exemption , and a comparison of one class against another class . " The " income tax proposes a Federal exemption of Federal bonds and the levy of a Federal tax on State bonds . The Professor differs from the decision of the Supreme Court and the feeling of investors in thinking that this is a consideration of no Importance . The credit of no State is better than New York 's , yet it has been compelled to advance the interest which it has to pay . It win have to advance it another shade in order to turn the scales with an investor who reckons that Federal bonds enjoy an exemption which does not extend to State bonds . Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asks whether the United States can afford not to collect it . The complementary question is whether those from whom the tax will be eollected can afford to pay it . An income tax is popular only in those countries which nave it not , and only among those citizens who pay it not . The popular way is to levy taxes on the rich , and disburse them on the poor . The right thing to do is to administer the Government with such efficiency that it will not he necessary to confer boons by levying additional taxes . And , if more taxes are necessary , - it is better to collect them in accustomed American method than by adoption of faulty imitations of that tax which foreign nations hate ' most . The Idea that faith is pledged to pass any particular income tax in this current year is too far fetched to persuade any who were not of that persuasion originally , and who would support any income tax whatever , and whatever its defects . The income tax amendment In Ito-present form ie jaaculari ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think-ing , and to displease all others .
