IT IS well nigh impossible by word or map to convey an adequate idea of the magnitude of the systems of canalization , delta , and other lowland reclamation work or of the extent of surface fitting of fields which have been effected in China , Korea , and Japan through the many centuries and which are still in progress . The lands so reclaimed and fitted constitute their most enduring asset and they support their densest populations . Forty canals across the United States from east to west and 6o from north to south would not equal in number of miles those in these three countries today . Indeed , it is probable that this estimate is not too large for China alone . In one of our journeys by house-boat on the delta canals between Shanghai and Hangchau , in China , over a distance of 117 miles , we made a careful record of the number and dimensions of lateral canals entering and leaving the main one along which our boat-train was traveling . This record shows that in 62 miles , beginning north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west 134 and there left on the coast side 190 canals . The average width of these canals , measured along the water line , we estimated at 22 and 19 feet , respectively , on the two sides . The height of the fields above the water level ranged from 4 to 12 feet during the April and May stage of water . The depth of water after we entered the Grand Canal often exceeded 6 feet , and our best judgment would place the average depth of all canals in this part of China at more than 8 feet below the level of the fields . On map No. i ( page 932 ) , representing the area of 718 square miles in the region traversed , all lines shown are canals , but scarcely more than one-third of those present are shown on the map . Between A , where we began our records before reaching Kia-hsing , and B , near the left margin of the map , there were 43 canals leading in from the up-country side instead of the eight shown , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delta plain toward the coast , whereas but 12 are shown . Again , on one of our trips by rail from Shanghai to Nanking , we made a similar record of the number of canals seen from the train close along the track , and the notes show an occurrence of 593 canals in a distance of 162 miles , an average of more than three canals per mile .  |p931  for this region and that between Shanghai and Hangchau . The extent , nature , and purpose of these vast systems of internal improvement may be better realized through a study of the next two sketch maps . The first ( map No. 2 , page 933 ) represents an area 175 by 16o miles , of which map No. 1 is the portion inclosed in the small rectangle . On this area there are shown 2,700 miles of main canals , but from our personal observations it is probable that there exists today in the area not less than 25,000 miles of canals . THE FAR-REACHING TIDES In the next illustration ( map No. 3 , page 934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented . The unshaded land area covers nearly 200,000 square miles of alluvial plain . This plain is so level that at Ichang , nearly I , 000 miles up the Yangtse , the elevation is only 130 feet above the sea . The tide is felt on the river to beyond Wuhu , 375 miles from the coast . Dur ing the summer the depth of water in the Yangtse is sufficient to permit ocean vessels drawing 25 feet of water to ascend 600 miles to Hankau , and for smaller steamers to go on to Ichang , 400 miles further . The location in this vast low delta and coastal plain of the sys tern of canals already described is indicated by the two rectangles in the southeast corner of the sketch map 3 , on page 934 ) . The heavy barred black line , extend ing from Hangchau in the south to Tientsin in the north , repre sents the Grand Canal . which has a length of more than 800 miles . The plain east of this canal , as far north as the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area shown in map No. 2 . So . too , is a large area both sides of the present mouth of the same river in Shan tung and Chi-li between the canal and the coast . Westward , up the Yangtse Valley , the provinces of Ngan-hwei , Kiangsi , Hunan , and Hupeh have very extensive canalized tracts , probably ex ceeding 28,000 square miles in area . Still further west , in Szechuan province , is the Chengtu plain , 30 by 70 miles , with what has been called " the most remark able irrigation system in China . " A conservative estimate would place  |p932  the miles of canals and leveed rivers in China , Korea , and Japan equal to eight times the number represented on map No. 2 ? fully 200,000 miles in all . THE GREAT LEVEES As adjuncts to these vast canalization works there have been enormous amounts of embankment , dike , and levee construction . More than 300 miles of sea wall alone exist in the area covered by the sketch map ( page 933 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great levee , holding back the waters to the west above the eastern plain , diverting them south into the Yangtse-kiang ; but it is also provided with spillways for use in times of excessive flood , permitting waters to discharge eastward . Such excess waters , however , are controlled by another dike , with canal along its west side , some 40 miles to the east , impounding the water in a series of large lakes until it may gradually drain away . This area is seen in map No. 3 , above , north of the Yangtse River . Along the banks of the Yangtse , and for many miles along the Hwang-ho , great levees have been built , sometimes in reinforcing series of two or three at different distances back from the chan/ nel , where the stream bed is above the adjacent country , in order to prevent widespread disaster and to limit the inundated areas in times of unusual flood . In the province of Hupeh , where the Han River flows through 200 miles of low country , this stream is diked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of its course the height of the levees reaches 30 feet or more . Again , in the Canton Delta region , there are other hundreds of miles of sea wall and dikes , so that the aggregate mileage of this type of construction works in the Empire can only be measured in thousands of miles . In addition to the canal and levee construction works , there are numerous impounding reservoirs which are brought into requisition to control overflow waters from the great streams . Some of the interior reservoirs have areas of 2,000 and 1,800 square miles , and during the heaviest rainy seasons each may rise through 20 to 30 feet . Then there are other large and small lakes in the coastal plain , giving an aggregate reservoir area exceeding 13,000 square ' miles , all of which are brought into service in controlling flood waters , all of which are steadily filling with the sediments brought from the far-away , uncultivable mountain slopes and which are ultimately destined to become rich alluvial plains , doubtless to be canalized in the manner we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of these vast construction works which has been of the greatest moment in increasing the maintenance capacity of the Empire ? the wresting from the flood waters of the enormous volumes of silt which they carry , depositing it over the flooded areas , in the canals , and along the shores in such manner as to add to the habitable and cultivable land . Reference may be made to the rapid growth of Chungming Island , in the mouth of the Yangtsekiang , and the million people now finding homes on the 270 square miles of newly made land which now has its canals , as may be seen in the upper margin of map No. 2.  |p935  The city of Shanghai , as its name signifies , stood originally on the seashore , which has now grown 20 miles to the northward and to the eastward . In 220 B. C. the town of Putai , in Shantung ( see map of China , supplement ) , stood one-third of a mile from the sea , but in 1730 it was 47 miles inland , and is 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the coast of the Gulf of Chihli on map No. 3 marks one historic shore line and indicates a general growth of land 18 miles to seaward . Besides these actual extensions of the shorelines , the centuries of flooding of lakes and low-lying lands has so filled many depressions as to convert large areas of swamp into cultivated fields . Not only this , but the spreading of canal mud broadcast over the encircled fields has had two very important effects , namely , raising the level of the low-lying fields , giving them better drainage and so better physical condition , and adding new plant food in the form of virgin soil of the richest type , thus contributing to the maintenance of soil fertility , high maintenance capacity , and permanent agriculture through all the centuries . AN ENGINEER-EMPEROR These operations of maintenance and improvement had a very early inception ; they appear to have persisted throughout the recorded history of the Empire and are in vogue today . Canals of the type illustrated on maps Nos. i and 2 have been built between 1886 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly formed mainland to the north , as is shown by comparison of Stieler 's atlas , revisedin 1886 , with the recent German survey . Earlier than 2255 B. C. , more than 4,100 years ago , Emperor Yao appointed " The Great " Yu " superintendent of works , " and intrusted him with the work of draining off the waters of disastrous floods and canalizing the rivers , and he devoted 13 years to this work . This great engineer is said to have written  |p936  several treatises on agriculture and drainage , . and was finally called , much against his wishes , to serve as Emperor during the last seven years of his life . The history of the Hwang-ho is one , of disastrous floods and shifting of its course , which have occurred many times in the years since before the time of the Great Yu , who perhaps began the works perpetuated today . Between 1300 A. D. and 1852 the Hwang-ho emptied into the Yellow Sea south of the highlands of Shantung , but in that year , when in unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took its present course , emptying again into the Gulf of Chi-li , some 300 miles further north . Some of these shiftings of course of the Hwang-ho and of the Yangtse-kiang are indicated in dotted lines on the sketch map No. 3 , where it may be seen that the Hwang-ho during 146 years poured its waters into the sea as far north as Tientsin , through the mouth of the Pei-ho , 400 miles to the northward of its mouth in 1852 . This mighty river is said to carry at low stage past the city of Tsinan , in Shantung , no less than 4,000 cubic yards of water per second and three times this volume when running at flood . This is water sufficient to inundate 33 square miles of level country to feet deep in 24 hours . CANAL , BUILDERS FOR CENTURIES What must be said of the mental status of a people who for 40 centuries have  |p939  measured their strength against such a Titan racing past their homes above the level of their fields , confined only between walls of their own construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , they have never failed to try again . In 1877 this river broke its banks , inundating a vast area , bringing death to a million people . Again , as late as 1898 , 1,500 villages to the northeast of Tsinan and a much larger area to the southwest of the same city were devastated by it , and it is such events as these which have won for the river the names " China 's Sorrow , " " The Ungovernable , " and " The Scourge of the Sons of Han . " The building of the Grand Canal appears to have been a comparatively recent event in Chinese history . The middle section is said to have been constructed about the sixth century B. C. ;  |p940  the southern section , between Chenkiang and Hangchau , during the years 605 to 617 A. D. ; but the northern section , from the channel of the Hwang-ho , deserted in 1852 , to Tientsin was not built until the years 1280-1283 . While this canal has been called by the Chinese Yu-ho ( Imperial River ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribute-bearing River ) , and while it has connected the great rivers coming down from the far interior into a great water-transport system , this feature of construction may have been but a byproduct of the great dominating purpose which led to the vast internal improvements in the form of canals , dikes , levees , and impounding reservoirs so widely scattered , so fully developed , and so effectively utilized . Rather the master purpose must have been maintenance for the increasing flood of humanity . And I am willing to grant to the Great Yu , with his finger on the pulse of the nation , the power to project his vision for 4,000 years into the future of his race and to formulate some of the measures which might be inaugurated to grow with the years and make certain perpetual maintenance for those to follow . THE KEYNOTE OP PERMANENT AGRICULTURE The exhaustion of cultivated fields must always have been the most fundamental , vital , and difficult problem of all civilized people , and it appears clear that such canalization as is illustrated on maps Nos. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reclamation of delta and overflow lands . At any rate , whether deliberately so planned or not , the canalization of the delta and overflow plains of China has been one of the most fundamental and fruitful measures for the conservation of her natural resources that they could have taken , for we are convinced that this oldest nation in the world has thus greatly augmented the extension of its coastal plains , conserving and building out of the waste of erosion wrested from the great streams hundreds of square miles of the richest and most enduring of soils . We have little doubt that were a full and accurate account given of human influence upon the changes in this remarkable region during the last 4,000 years , it would show that these gigantic systems of canalization have been matters of slow , gradual growth , often initiated and always profoundly influenced by the labors of the strong , patient , persevering , thoughtful , but ever-silent husbandmen in their efforts to acquire homes and to maintain the productive power of the fields . Nothing appears more clear than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China today is that of perfecting , extending , and perpetuating the means for controlling her flood waters , for better drainage of her vast areas of low land , and for utilizing the tremendous loads of silt borne by her streams more effectively in fertilizing existing fields and in building and reclaiming new land . With her millions of people needing homes and anxious for work , who have done so much in land building , in reclamation , and in the maintenance of soil fertility , the government should give serious thought to the possibility of putting large numbers of them at work , effectively directed by the best engineering skill . It must now be entirely practicable , with engineering skill and mechanical appliances , to put the Hwang-ho , and other rivers of China subject to overflow , completely under control . With the Hwangho confined to its channel , the adjacent lowlands can be better drained by canalization and freed from the accumulating saline deposits which are rendering them sterile . Warping may be resorted to during the flood season to raise the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fertile . Where the river is running above the adjacent plains there is no difficulty in drawing off the turbid water by gravity , under controlled conditions , into diked basins , and even in compelling the river to buttress its own levees . There is certainly great need and great opportunity for China to make still better and more efficient her already wonderful transportation canals and those devoted to drainage , irrigation , and fertilization . ANCIENT AND MODERN CANALIZATION In the United States , along the same lines , now that we are considering the development of inland waterways , the subject should be surveyed broadly , and much careful study may well be given to the works these old people have developed and found serviceable through so many centuries . The Mississippi is annually bearing to the sea nearly 225,000 acre-feet of the most fertile sediment and between levees along a raised bed through 200 miles of country subject to inundation . The time is here when there should be undertaken a systematic diversion of a large part of this fertile soil over the swamp areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with waterways to serve for drainage , irrigation , fertilization , and transportation . These great areas of swamp land may thus be converted into the most productive rice and sugar plantations to be found anywhere in the world , and the area made capable of maintaining many millions of people as long as the Mississippi endures , bearing its burden of fertile sediment . There ought , and it would seem there must some time be provided a way for sending to the sandy plains of Florida , and to the sandy lands between there and the Mississippi , large volumes of the rich silt and organic matter from this and other rivers , aside from that which should be applied systematically to building  |p943  above flood plain the lands of the delta which are subject to overflow or are too low to permit adequate drainage . But the conservation and utilization of the wastes of the soil erosion , as applied in the delta plain of China , stupendous as this work has been , is nevertheless small when measured by the savings which accrue from the careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both lessens soil erosion and permits a large amount of soluble and suspended matter in the run-off to be applied to and retained upon the fields through their extensive system of irrigation . Mountainous and hilly as are the lands of Japan , 11,000 square miles of her cultivated fields in the main islands of Honshu , Kyushu , and Shikoku have been carefully graded to water-level areas , bounded by narrow raised rims , upon which 16 or more inches of run-off water , with its suspended and soluble matter , may be applied , a large part of which is retained on the fields or utilized by the crop , while surface erosion is almost completely prevented . The total area thus surface-fitted in China must be 90,000 or 100,000 square miles . Such enormous field erosion as is tolerated at the present time in our Southern and South Atlantic States is permitted nowhere in the Far East , so far as we observed , not even where the topography is much steeper . CONSERVATION , AN ENDURING ASSET One of the most remarkable agricultural practices adopted by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utilization of all human waste in China , Korea , and Japan , turning it to marvelous account in the maintenance of soil fertility and in the production of food . To understand this evolution , it must be recognized that mineral fertilizers so extensively employed in modern western agriculture , like the extensive use of min/ eral coal , had been a physical impossibility to all people alike until within very recent years . With this fact must be associated the very long unbroken life of these nations and the vast numbers their farmers have been compelled to feed . When we reflect upon the depleted fertility of our own older farm lands , comparatively few of which have seen a century 's service , and upon the enormous quantity of mineral fertilizers which are being applied annually to them in order to secure paying yields , it becomes evident that the time is here when profound consideration should be given to the practices the Mongolian race has maintained through many centuries , which permit it to be said of China that one-sixth of an acre of good land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are feeding an average of three people per acre of farm land in the three southernmost of the four main islands of Japan . Dr. Kawaguchi , of the National Department of Agriculture and Commerce , taking his data from their records , informed us that the human manure saved and applied to the fields of Japan in 1908  |p945  amounted to 23,850,295 tons , which is an average of 1.75 tons per acre of their 21,321 square miles of cultivated land in their four main islands . In 1908 the International Concessions of the city of Shanghai sold to one Chinese contractor for $31,000 , gold , the privilege of collecting 78,000 tons of human waste , under stipulated regulations , and of removing it to the country for sale to farmers . A flotilla of boats is engaged daily in Shanghai throughout the year in this service . On the basis of the data of Wolff , Kellner , and Carpenter , or of Hall , the people of the United States and of Europe are pouring into the sea , lakes , or rivers , and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 1,881,900 to 4,151,000 pounds of potassium , and 777,200 to 3,057,600 pounds of phosphorus per million of adult population annually , and this waste we esteem one of the great achievements of our civilization . In the Far East , for more than 30 centuries , these enormous wastes have been religiously saved , and today the 400 million of adult population send back to their fields annually 150,000 tons of phosphorus ; 376,000 tons of potassium , and 1,158,000 tons of nitrogen comprised in a gross weight exceeding 182 million tons , gathered from every home , from the country villages , and from the great cities like Hankau-Wuchang-Hanyang , with its 1,770,000 people swarming on a land area delimited by a radius of four miles . Man is the most extravagant accelerator of waste the world has ever endured . His withering blight has fallen upon every living thing within his reach , himself not excepted , and his besom of destruction in the uncontrolled hands of  |p947  a generation has swept into the sea soil fertility which only centuries of life could accumulate , and yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIVERS OP PHOSPHORUS The rivers of North America are estimated to carry to the sea more than 500 tons of phosphorus with each cubic mile of water . To such loss modern civilization is adding that of hydraulic sewage disposal , through which the waste of 500 millions of people might be more than 194,300 tons of phosphorus annually , which could not be replaced by 1,295,000 tons of rock phosphate 75 per cent pure .  |p949  The Mongolian races , with a population now approaching the figure named , occupying an area little more than onehalf that of the United States , tilling less than 800,000 square miles of land , and much of this during 20 , 30 , or perhaps 40 centuries , unable to avail themselves of mineral fertilizers , could not survive and tolerate such waste . Not even in great cities like Canton , built in the meshes of tide-swept rivers and canals ; like Hankau , on the banks of one of the largest rivers in the world ; nor yet in modern Shanghai , Yokohama , or Tokyo , is such waste permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they have resisted the temptation so long that it has ceased to exist . Had the Mongolian races spread to and developed in North America instead of or as well as in eastern Asia , there might have been a Grand Canal , something as suggested on page 933 , from the Rio Grande to the mouth of the Ohio River and from the Mississippi to Chesapeake Bay , constituting more than 2,000 miles of inland waterway , serving commerce , holding up and redistributing both the run-off water and the wasting fertility of soil erosion , spreading them over 200,000 square miles of thoroughly canalized coastal plains , so many of which are now impoverished lands , made so by the intolerable waste of a vaunted civilization . And who shall venture to enumerate  |p950  the increase in the tonnage of sugar , bales of cotton , sacks of rice , boxes of oranges , baskets of peaches , and in the trainloads of cabbage , tomatoes , and celery such husbanding would make possible through all time ; or number the increased millions these could feed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exportation of our phosphorus , grind our limestone , and apply them to our fields , but this alone is only temporizing with the future . The more we produce , the more numerous our millions : the faster must present practices speed the waste to the sea , from whence neither money nor prayer can call them back . If the United States is to endure ; if we shall project our history even through 4,000 or 5,000 years , as the Mongolian nations have done , and if that history shall be written in continuous peace , free from periods of widespread famine or pestilence , this nation must orient itself ; it must square its practices with a conservation of resources which can make endurance possible . Sooner or later we must adopt a national policy which shall more completely conserve our water resources , utilizing them not only for power and transportation , but primarily for the maintenance of soil fertility and greater crop production through supplemental irrigation , and all these great national interests should be considered collectively , broadly , and with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Japan long ago struck the keynote of permanent agriculture , but the time has now come when they can and will make great improvements , and it remains for us and other nations to profit by their experience , to adopt and adapt what is good in their practice , and help in a world movement for the introduction of new and improved methods .  |p958
