txt The work of Draft Exemption Board 156 , board which has won the commendation of Deputy Attorney General Conkling because of its efficiency , was brought to a halt on Friday , scores of men who appeared for examination were kept waiting for hours , records were thrown into ? almost inextricable confusion ? some are now missing ? while the members of the board , subjected to a long and gruelling examination by Assistant District Attorney John T. Dooling in the office of District Attorney Swann , were asked , " Who gets the money to that district ? " This situation , denounced by one Federal official as " one of the most outrageous " ever brougnt to his attention , came about , according to the board members , because of two disgruntled men who had been certified ? for service . One of these men , however , is the son of a Tammany Hall worker . The facts in nee case have been called to the attention of the authorities in Washington , and also to that of ? overnor Whitman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . and the latter the Provost Marshal General , In the carrying out of the selective draft law pro-el/dons in this State . The action taken by the District Attorney of New York County was without the knowledge of MI ; Conkling , who got his first information of what was going on- when ? Alexander Fitiarniek , Chairman of the board , called him on the telephone and asked for instructions . Mr. Conkling 's answer was sharp and to the point When Mr. Conkling called up the District Attorney 's office a little later on and asked for Assistant District Attorney John T. Dooling , who represented the District Attorney in - the case , he was told , Mr. Dooling has left town and wo n't be back until Monday . " Alexander Plavnick , Chairman of Board 156 , Dr. Arthur S. Calman , its medical member , and Simon Levine , its clerk , were those summoned to the District Attorney 's office . The ? story of what happened as told to Deputy Attorney General Conkling by Dr. Cabman last night is as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the board headquarters . The members of the board thought he was a , man who had been summoned for examination . The subpoena server asked for the Chairman and Dr. Plavnick was indicated by one of the men in the room . Dr. Playnick received a ' John Doe ' subpoena , which bore the printed signature of District Attorney Swann . On the bottom of the subpoena and written in ink was a note which read . " ' Please bring list of men examined , and rejected . Also examination records of E. J. Brooks of ' 12 East 110th Street and Louis Spiegel of 18 East 105th Street . ' Taken by Surprise . " The members of the board announced to the waiting young men that examinations would have to be postponed for a few hours , and asked them all to come back in the early afternoon . The records of every man who had ben re- ' jected by the board were hurriedly got together with other data , and also everything pertaining to the cases of Brooks and Spiegel. the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dooling was waiting at the Criminal Courts Building , and the men were taken to his office immediately on their arrival . This was Mr. Dooling 's greeting : " ' Who gets the money up there ? ' " Mr. Plavnik and the others , taken completely by surprise , did not reply at once . " ' Why , no one . What do you mean ? ' Mr. Plavnik finally replied . Mr. Plavnick and then Mr. Levine was subjected to a long cross-examination , after which two men , - whose names Mr. Dooling did not disclose , were examined . Dr. Colman was not questioned- because before his turn came Mr. Conkling had interrupted the ' star chamber proceedings . It was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon when Mr. Plavnick called Mr. Conkling on the telephone . ' " This is Mr. Plavnick , Chairman of Board 156 , " he said . " We are at the District Attorney 's office . " What are you doing down- there ? Why are you not at your headquarters examining your men ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our papers wan us , " replied the board Chairman . What 's that ? Do you mean to tell me you have those records down there ? Now , you gee moss records without a minute 's delay and go . back to your hendquartera , ordered Mr. Conkling . When Plavnick told this to Dooling , the latter , according to Dr. Calman , became , very angry , " Who in hell told you to take those records ? " Dooling demanded , ' according to the story told to Mr. Conkling by Dr. Calman . ? I " Mr. Conkling , the representative of the Federal and State Governments in 2 this city , " replied Mr. Plavnick . " Oh , is that so , " Mr. Dooling answered , more impressed . The records went back , that is nearly all did , but a few of them did not , for , Dr. Calman said last night , that some of them were missing , while the others were so mixed up that it would take hours to get them in order again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the boaN members were going through them they found another " John Doe " subpoena . addressed to members of Local . Board 93 , the headquarters of which is at 229 East Broadway . This boars Is considered by the Federal authorities one of the most efficient and hard-working on the east side . In the hurry to get the records hack to the headquarters of Board 156 it appears that somebody in Mr. Dooling 's office made the mistake of putting the subpoena for Board 93 in the bundle . As a result of the action taken by Mr. Dooling the work of Board 156 had to be suspended from 11 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock in the afternoon . Scores of young men who were waiting to be examined had to wait hours before they could be taken before the doctors . After hearing what had happened Mr. Conkling sent for the members of Board 156 and told them to bring the records of the examinations and of the subsequent proceedings in the cases of Louis Spiegel and Elias Brooks . After carefully going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers in these , caaes are absolutely correct in every respect . They show that these men are physically fit and that the board went into each case thoroughly , as required by law , and that the men were properly certified to the District Board as eligible for service . " The papers show that the man Brooks claims exemption as the support of dependent parents in Russia , a claim the board properly denied , as the Government does not recognize parents or other relatives not living in the United States as dependents within the meaning of the selective draft law . " As for the papers in the Spiegel case they show that this man has claimed exemption because of employment as an artificer in the navy yard , and also as the sole support of aged and infirm parents , his father being 58 and his mother 53 years of age . The man Spigel also appeals for exemption on the additional ground that he is the sole support of a brother , under 16 years of age , and who has ' neither father or mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of this board , ant I am at a loss to understand why Mr. Dooling gave out the statements he did which appear in four of the New York on gedpte morning . Until callg telephone by a member of t board Friday afternoon I had no inkling that the members of this board had been subpoenaed to Mr. Swann 's office . In a Federal matter , and the Selective Draft is a Federal measure in every sense of the world , I should think county officials would notify the proper Federal authorities when action such as this Is contemplated . No such notice in any shape or form was given to the Adjutant General 's office , and the Adjutant General is the representative of the War Department in New York so far as the draft law Is concerned . " It is a serious matter in a time like this to call an entire board , which is workng day and night to get its quota for the national army , away from its duties , without notice , and because it would apear two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled because they are refused exemption . The United States authorities are in receipt of a great many complaints from all parts of the city . In a great number of cases the complaint is made by some slacker who wants somebody else to do his fighting for him . The Federal authorities- , act under the very proper system of making every investigation quietly and accurately , giving publicity only to such cases as are proved to be founded on fact . This method of calling board members away from the work , disorganizing the work of that board , and then giving out a statement charging the members of thcaboard with misconduct is absolutely improper . The Adjutant General 's office and the Federal authorities want all tho assistance they can . get , including that of Mr. Dooling , but wo want the proper and not the improper kind of assistance . " I am quite familiar with thdework of Board 156 , and ' know each member . I believe that the board is doing its duty honestly an e faithfully and I make this statement because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other districts . that the Adjutant General 's office is behind every board in the city , and until it is proved that the members of that board are not worthy of the trust imposed in then shall personally take this matter up with District Attorney Swann . " Alexander Plavnick , the Chairman , said last evening : " Of course there have been complaints of unfairness in our district . But we challenge any one to show that we have been unfair in any case . Our records speak for themselves . ' We have followed the regulations laid down by the Provost Marshal General . We now have 85 eligibles listed , with more to be added from the exemption claimants . So far we have called 600 men . Of these approximately 40 per cent . are aliens . These we have not yet examined . " We have given discharges to fiftynine examined . Most of these discharges have been on account of physical defects . We have exempted men who married prior to July 20 , where it was shown that the wife was solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of this board has accepted even as much as a cigar from any man who came before us since the beginning of the draft . " There has been no favoritism in any case . Even personal friends of members of the board have had to await their turn for examination and were given no advantage over any one else . " There was just one case that I krgee of where money was offered . That was when a Russian alien offered a dollar to a member of the board who had helped him to fill out an exemption blank . The man was told that no fee of any kind was required . We even broke up a little system of.graft on the part of certain notaries who were charging exorbitant fees for drawing up affidavits . We induced two notaries to do all this work for a nominal fee . " I did n't know what to make of it when Assistant District Attorney Dooling asked , ' Who is taking the money up there ? ' I told him we welcomed any kind of investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases of two men who had been examined by this board . One of these men claimed exemption on the ground of dependents living abroad . We decided that was a case for the District Board . The other claimed that his father was dependent upon him for support . We found that the father had recently . passed through bankruptcy proceedings , but was able to support himself . We denied the claim . The man then filed another claim on the ground of being an employe of the Brooklyn Navy Yard . This we left for the District Board to pass upon . " Dr. Calman said last night that after young Spiegel was certified for service and ' his claim for exemption on the ground ? of dependent relatives denied . William Spiegel , his father , visited the board and denounced the inembera for their action . The elder Spiegel told the board he was once wealthy , but that he is now entirely dependent upon his son for support . Dr. Calman described the elder Spiegel as " vigorous and healthy . " The board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who claim exemption are examined . The dependents named in the claims tiled for exemption are summoned before the boara at these sessions and examined under oath and complete recaras kept of the examination of all claimants and other witnesses . Efforts made last night to find District Attorney Swann were without results . He was not at any of the places here where he is to be found usually . It was admitted at his home that he was in the city , but information as to his whereabouts was denied . A reporter called upon Colonel Roosevelt in his home at Oyster Bay last night and told him of the activities of the District Attorney 's office in connection with Board 156 . The Colonel ex- , pressed deep interest , but declined to discuss the case . WAAHINGTON TO INVESTIGATE . Federal Authorities Will Look Into Summoning of Local Board . Special to The New York Times .

Attorney General Gregory is out of town . Assistant Attorney General Fitts , who is in charge of cases arising out of the draft law , said that he had not heard of it until the Washington Bureau of THE TIMES called his attention to it . Officials of the Department of Justice were emphatic in the statement that the Federal Government would make an investigation of the affair and take prompt action to support the authority of the Federal law . There is no question , it was said , of the power of the United States Government to deal with the matter effectively , and it was indicated that the Federal courts would be appealed to quickly if the facts just titled such a. course .
