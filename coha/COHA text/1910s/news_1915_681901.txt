txt Leo M. Frank , whose throat was cut by William Creen , a fellow-convict at the Georgia Prison Farm here , late last night , the jugular vein being partly severed . is believed to have a good chance for recovery . It was feared for a time that he would die from loss of blood , but the hemorrhage was checked in quick time , and now the attending physicians says the wounded man has something more than a fighting chance for his life . Frank was reported late tonight as resting well . He had regained his normal pulse . Two trained nurses have been employed to care for him . The attack on the famous life prisoner was sudden , savage and unprovoked . The assailant , a murderer who has killed two men , also is serving a life sentence . Frank was quartered at night in a dormitory with about one hundred other prisoners , and occupied a bunk about forty feet from one of the two doors to the large room . Creen 's bunk was the fourth from his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the two guards stationed at the dormitory at night . Seized Frank by the Hair . Shortly after 11 o'clock Creen called out for permission to get up , and it was granted . He started down the line of bunks toward the one occupied by Frank . As he reached it he seized Frank by the hair and delivered one blow with a butcher knife , which he had concealed . A guard rushed to the bunk and prevented Creen from striking again . Among the prisoners who rushed to Frank 's aid were two physicians , one of whom also was serving a life term for murder . They gave first aid and treated the wound until Dr. Guy Compton , the prison physician , was summoned from his home , half a mile away . The three men took twenty-five stitches in Frank 's neck . Dr. H. J. Rosenberg , the Frank family physician , arrived from Atlanta today with two nurses . He said that while the patient 's condition was serious , he had a good chance for life . Mrs. Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not tald of the attack until after the physicians had finished their work . She became hysterical , but later was calmed and was taken to the prison hospital . The cut extends from the front of the neck around the left side to almost the middle of the back of the neck . Neither the windpipe nor the spinal cord is hurt , but the jugular vein is partly severed . The physicians ' greatest fear tonight was that some of the stitches might slip . There is danger , also , of a new rupture from a coughing spell . In trying to fight off his assailant Frank got gashes in both hands from the knife , but these wounds are not serious . After his wounds had been dressed Frank turned to the physicians and asked : " I am I going to die ? " " We do n't know , " replied Dr. Compton . " You are in a serious condition and will have to be quiet . " Not Afraid to Ole . " If I am going to die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing stands between me and God . I hope that the man who attacked me will be forgiven . " Frank knew of the demonstrations against the action of Governor Slaton in commuting his sentence and also of threats to take him from the prison farm by force . Those who reached his side first after he was wounded believe he had all this in mind when he said : " I guess they have got me now . " Everybody who has been at erank 's bedside has commented on his calmness and fortitude . For some time he thought he iin.S going to die , but throughout he maintained marked courage , never uttering any complaint . Frank 's constitution , which stood him in such good stead throughout his fight for life in the courts , seems unimpaired . He was somewhat worn down when brought to the State Farm , being probably sixty pounds lighter than when arrested , accused of the murder of Mary Phagan , but he had taken on flesh since his arrival here and was getting strong and robust through working much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence the great loss of blood that he has suffered has not caused a complete collapse . He is weak , but L has nerve . Frank asked the Prison doctors again today if they thought he would live . " You have a good chance , " he was : old . Frank smiled . ' Do n't punish the man who attacked me , " he said . " I have nothing to fear . I will be able to prove to the world that I am innocent of the crime of which they accuse me if they give me a chance . " " Doctor , " he said later . " I am going to live . I must live . I must vindicate myself . " Life Saved by Murderer . Dr. Rosenberg , Frank 's Atlanta physician , complimented the prison doctors , saying their prompt action saved Frank 's life . Dr. J. M. , who is serving a life term for murder , is being congratulatea for the part he played . It was he who rendered the first aid , clamping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Frank surely would ' have pled to death in five minutes . He is much pleased over saving the life of his fellow prisoner . Creen , Frank assailant , appears composed as he lies on a cot in the big dormitory with his legs chained to a concrete post . The report that he had been planed in a dungeon is untrue : there are no cells in this prison . According to Creen 's own statement he has killed two men . One of these I was Tobe Reese , whom he killed eight ' years ago . Of that crime he was ' acquitted on a plea of self-defense . Ile killed 0 . S. Kitchens three years ago , and for that crime received a life sentence . Before that trial he was examIna by a lunacy commission , which pronounced him sane . The man is 45 years old . He was born in Memphis , Term. , but has lived in Georgia for twenty-five years . He was sentenced from olumbus , Ga. , and has a wife there . Green asserted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration to kill Frank , and plotted alone to kill him . He told of aiding in the butchering of hogs Saturday morning , of hiding in his clothing a butcher knife made out of a the , and of carrying it to bed with him . It was with this weapon that he attacked Frank . The assailant admitted that he had talked with other convicts about the Frank case , but said that they had not influenced him in any way . He took all the blame for the crime on his own shoulders and said that while he thought at the time that he was doing right he now regretted his act . Read Only the Bible . Supt. Smith said U at Green had not been permitted to read newspapers or Anti-Frank literature . He read only the Bible , said the Superintendent . " The Bible was furnished to him at the library , " said Mr. Smith . ? ? He studied it whenever he had an odd moment " He seemed to be getting religion . 1 know that Creen was a bad man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-convict . I had instructed the guards not to pick a quarrel with him , as it might result seriously . " Did Creen have any quarrel with Frank ? " he was asked . " No : absolutely not , ? said the Superintendent . " Tl ? ey appeared to be friends . That is why the attack is all the more shocking . " Superintendent Smith deeply regreta the attack . lie has been on a great strain since Frank was placed under his care . He says the attack emphasizes the need of a place for dangerous convicts at the prison farm . He has several such prisoners now , and ihrse Ia. has to keep chained to prevent them from commiting acts of violence . An investigation of the attack probably , will be conducted by the Georgia Prhmo Commission , the same body that . efused to recommend that Frank 's d'eatl , sentence be commuted to life imprisonment .
