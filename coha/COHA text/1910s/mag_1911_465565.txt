I SUPPOSE we all study theology more or less earnestly as long as we live ; I do not see how we can help it . That is to say , our thoughts about the great Reality above us and our relation to It , or IIim , fall into a definition and order to which we attach our sense of truth , feeling that , whatever any one else believes , we can feel sure of this and this . Our divinity-school teachers , indeed , can not go with us through life , but then perhaps we ought not to expect it . If we have open minds , our teachers need not to have had ordaining hands laid upon them ; they may be any one or any thing , and they teach as though they taught us not . I have a teacher who probably has no idea that he is giving me lessons . He does not belong to that class of characters who set themselves up to instruct or persuade or even to do good ; what he does he does by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am well satisfied , have been good . His heredity has not been twisted ; his education , though not topped off with ornamental accomplishments , has been such as to have given a naturally sweet disposition free course . His name is Caleb . The fact that he has no surname is not to be reckoned against him , for we do not ordinarily give surnames to dogs . Perhaps the way he came to give me lessons in theology may be explained by some words of Tennyson , in which the poet avers that " . . . Iove in which my hound has part Can hang no weight upon my heart In its assumptions up to heaven . " This would seem in a manner to shift the teaching to me ; and doubtless I am receiving through my reflections much more than he consciously gives ; but at any rate , there is a power of education in the little fellow , with his unfailing good-will and loyalty , which seems to deserve grateful acknowledgment . Some years ago one of our American bishops wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble animal . I have forgotten how the sonnet ran ; all I can recall is the first line : " I well believe he thinks that I am God , " When I read it and some of the good bishop 's personal traits came rather vividly to mind , my first mental response was that it was no wonder the dog thought so , if he had seen the bishop , as I had , in the dignity of full canonicals . Then I chided myself for being so impudently profane ; and , of course , that was not the reason at all . The church vestments had nothing to do with it . I have seen dogs look up with equal devotion to men in overalls . We read of dogs that licked the sores of beggars ; and we know what poor apologies for masters dogs will be faithful to , even though their worship goes wholly wasted . A very significant thing when you think of it ; it became one of my first lessons in theology . For it seems to reveal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the strata below us . There are creatures in actual existence in whom has been put the instinct to look upward from their station to beings higher in the scale , to choose these for friends and masters , to stand by them and reverence them , not for what they can gain by it ? for too often . abating no jot of fidelity , they get but kicks and hard words ? but purely as a spontaneous , intrinsic outflow of dog nature . I like to contemplate a creation that is rich enough to include such a thing as this ; to contain disinterested affection as a wide-spread elemental fact ; it gives me a better opinion of the universe . Some things , scholars tell us , are more fully evolved in the animals than in man ; the eye in the eagle , the swift foot in the stag . I should be sorry to think that , because the lord of creation gets things so tangled up with reason and selfishness , the dog should have got the start of us in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would spoil it al/ . Many times a day Caleb comes to my armchair , as I sit studying , with no apparent purpose except just to say , " How do you do ? " and , never without waiting for the word of permission , he jumps up on my knee , remains a minute , and then goes about his affairs . And many a time I have been half startled by a wondering yet wholly loving expression in the great brown eyes so inquiringly searching mine . Only asking me to drop the prosy book and go walking with him ? No ; that expression is quite different . Those eyes look as if they were searching for something that we two might hold in common and so have a silent understanding of each other . Is it something higher than can enter his dog consciousness ? I am often moved to respond : " It 's you and I , Caleb . We do know each other in some things , do n't we ? " And there comes a twinge of pathos in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me thinking of what an apostle once said about a whole creation groaning in pain and travail together , waiting for some adoption which should redeem the body . I am sometimes silly enough to ask him : " Do you too , Caleb , belong to that vast continuous line of upward-looking , onward-looking things ? Are you , too , dimly conscious of waiting for something which is destined to come somehow by the way of the higher orders ? Does the First-born of every creature make his relationship felt in some far-off way even to you ? " He never answers me except by that wistful look , which vanishes as soon as I begin to theologize ; but the look has on me the strange effect of worship , so that I am almost afraid to recall the bishop 's sonnet . Who am I , to be scrutinized so ? What is man 's office in the sum of things , when such great liquid eyes are gazing up at him from below ? He wants to assure himself , it would seem , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love and care is flowing as ever . That is enough . If I admit him to my knee he does not take it out in caresses , for he is no sentimentalist . If I grant him the supreme felicity of his life , to go walking with me , the sense of being with me is all he wants . He turns his head away or gives attention to other things , as if he were indifferent ; he is off on his own affairs , attending to his canine world ; from which , however , he comes with ready alacrity at my whistle . Let him keep connections clear with my focus of humanity , and the rest is perfect freedom and perfect content to be a dog . Sometimes he sports in my presence ; as an ancient sage was na ? ve enough to represent Our Lady Wisdom , who was for him symbol of the eager intellect of man , as sporting always in the presence of God . For pure joy of existence he will course round an open field , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy and perhaps jumping up in ecstasy . I can not break him of that , though I have to brush off much soilure on account of muddy paws . I ought to be sterner with him ; I own that . Sometimes , too , he playfully assumes hostility or gives his master a scolding , as if for once he and I had changed places ; growling and barking in ironical laughter . But with my hand once in his mouth he is infinitely gentle ; nay , he immediately releases it , and would rather die than bite . Yet how savagely he will bite a stick or a rope 's end , and how strenuously he will hang to it until his jowl is bloody , as if it were a foe to conquer . It makes me think of the way men sport with the laws of nature and of their own talents , cuffing them about and making audacious demands of them ; doughty vanquishers subduing the earth as if they were sole masters of it ; yet when this energy faces the calm Reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ! Sometimes a curious fit of the histrionic seizes him ; for he loves to astonish , and he is fond of exhibiting his paces before company . He has become aware of his special bent and aptitude : those strong bulldog jaws and that bulldog tenacity must needs render account of themselves . The " stunt " in his case is not hunting or swimming , for he is not trained to the practical services ; not carrying baskets or newspapers or slippers , for his ornamental training , too , has been neglected . But in the performance with a stick or rope 's end he knows his abilities and takes pride in them ; and to have an admiring and exclaiming audience is dear to his heart . Is it childish for us or is it natural and right , even at the risk of some vanity , to exhibit our arts before high Heaven , the things that we can most cleverly do , being thereby made a spectacle to the world and to angels and men ? Perhaps we may as well accept the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like men . The wrong is not in this , but in the hypocrisy of it , the counterfeit ; trying to seem what we are not . It foots back , after all , to truth of nature ; and with all his vanity of histrionism Caleb 's nature is true . Sometimes he sins . He gets into dirty and malodorous places ; he rolls and revels there . It is his nature , I suppose ; and he comes back to me resembling Achilles , who , according to the schoolboy 's composition , " was dipped into the Stynx and became intolerable . " Yet he comes up proud of his achievement ; as proud as we are when we have been eating Limburger cheese . His punishment , which can not possibly be dispensed with , is an immediate bath ; and he submits to it patiently , yet with keen disappointment , feeling in some dim way that he has wronged the standard of the sphere above him , yet in his heart clinging still to the bad odor and ready the next moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suspect , arbitrarily imported into his life from the sphere above him and encountering no moral principle to which it can appeal . I do not know that it is amenable even to education . He is a dog , after all , and his conversance with humanity does not obliterate the dog nature . Is there something here , mutatis mutandis , for the next being in the scale to ponder ? Is his nature as clean as the Reality above would have it be ? And may there he sinful tendencies and tastes in him for which the fitting punishment is not stripes and prison , not even blame , but ? washing ? Then at other times he sins through impulse ; will rush after a bird or a eat , perhaps , when warned not to do so . He does not mean to sin . But he is a bulldog . and when once embarked on an action , however impulsive , his bulldog momentum impels him to carry it to the finish . It is his nature to hang on ; and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is to say , the sense he gets from his master 's will . The sin seems to come from a certain lack of equilibrium ; a trait in itself good , or at least not bad , imperfectly balanced . He sins through disinclination , too , and this is rather more serious . He is tardy and keeps me waiting sometimes when I call him from a pursuit or investigation in which he is particularly interested . He knows that he ought to leave his unsavory occupation and come , for the master 's call is his chosen law ; but the dog nature is so strong , the affairs of his life are so sweet , it is hard to give up . Alas ! I find I am excusing all his sins , or what I have chosen to call such . As soon as I look behind them they become venial . Am I thereby misrepresenting that ideal which his dumb worship tacitly imputes to me and making the only deity he knows a weak and indulgent one ? Or , as we press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight of the truth that He who knows all forgives all ? It is a hard question to answer , because I have only my very imperfect self to answer by . Yet I , too , see that sin is sin , an ugly actuality which , however it may be explained , can not be explained away . And I hold , however pliable my disposition , by an old idea which has somehow come among men , of One who will by no means acquit or concede that a sin was not committed when it was , and yet in full view of all does forgive . It is not a bad ideal , on the whole , to live by , for it maintains the eternal standard and order of the universe ; it calls things by their right names and deals with them on that ground . There is no spirit of rebellion in Caleb . The master 's will , coming from the standards of a higher sphere which he has never entered , must needs be to him purely arbitrary . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can attribute spirit to a dog ) that he obeys at all . But he never questions or resents its arbitrariness . It belongs to the order of nature for him . Once in a great while he has deliberately taken matters into his own hands . One day in camp , for instance , nearly all of our party took an excursion to a place five miles away , where there was to be a large company and a dinner ; and I desired him to stay at home with me . But the attraction of the majority , the sweetness of going with the crowd , was too much for him . He remained with me a little while ; then , when my back was turned , quietly disappeared . When , however , he returned with them in the evening he brought back no apparent sense of guilt . Was this a nonchalant carrying off of disobedience with a high hand or was he presuming on my easy nature to say nothing more about it ? I had not leashed him ; had only told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he had let a keen desire override a mild restraint . The incident made me think of that large sphere of things morally indifferent and of our attitude toward them ; things not laid down in a code , but perhaps established by convention , or drifted into by the crowd , or deduced by interpretation of a higher will . We have the advantage of Caleb , because we can in some measure penetrate the sphere above us ; far enough , at least , to see that the Will up there is not arbitrary or capricious and to reduce it to sound reasons . We are the better able , therefore , to take things into our own hands and to revise or accommodate our conventions to suit the occasion . Perhaps , indeed , all our morality , which we trace to a source outside the world , may turn out to have come by the way of our own devising , or what seems such . It need not , therefore , deny the higher source if we have all along appreciated the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so passively with the crowd as to outrage our better judgment ; or when in deliberate perversity we transgress the law of being ; or even when we abjure the practicability of the best and take up with the second best . It is thus that we earl understand that whatsoever is not of faith is sin . Fortunately , Caleb drifted with a good crowd , so there was no harm done that time . With us it does not always turn out so . Once in a while Caleb gets lost , and has , on his primitive dog scale , to be sought and saved . It is not that I lose him ; rather he loses me . It amounts to the same in the end , losing or lost . Away from home somewhere with his master , suddenly he wakes to the sense that he has missed the presence of the higher will on whom he depends for bearing and diVoL . CXXII ? No. 732. - 105 rection . And the cause , I suspect , is much the same as when men get lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allurements ? in his case generally connected with back yards and scullery doors ? his superior being has passed on out of sight . He does not belong to that class of dogs who would use their nose to find the master again ; or else his education has suffered neglect . But one thing I can surely reckon on . As soon as he becomes aware of his plight he drops his scavenging interests and stays right where he last saw me . No other person , however friendly or well known , can entice him away from there . Hours may pass and home may be near , but there he stays , watching and hoping . Of course that imposes on his master the duty of remembering and returning to the place ? which is to say , of seeking and saving the lost ; but this to his canine theology is what masters are for . To find or to be found ( the sum is equal , active or passive ) is to be where the master is , and it is for the master to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shall I say cleverly ? ? reading me a lesson in my function as a deity . And if I in turn pass on the lesson to the Reality above , I can do it in no better spirit , surely , than by emulating the perfect faith by which Caleb knows not only that he is lost , but that he will full surely be found . Such faith looks like worship , the worship that avails , though its only outward expression is waiting . On the whole , Caleb 's nature , as toward me and the species I represent , is all compact of loyalty , patience , trust , and love . This last seems really to be the key to the whole . I confess I do not see that the soul of Shakespeare could love me more . He is below me in thought and power , inexorably below me in sphere and range of being ; but in this one respect of.love he seems to emulate me . A significant thing when we think of it , that there should be this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love seems to be a thing neither animal nor human by any exclusive claim ; a thing stretching away beyond both species , above and below ; and both species seem to be strung on it like beads on a string . His love is as self-forgetting as mine is , and all the more single-hearted for not being tangled up with reasons and expediency . It draws into itself his whole being as mine does not . " I can not understand , I love ; " that is what I have often caught his great brown eyes saying . And in that unstudied consciousness he has freedom for his own affairs and grants me freedom for mine . Having always lived in an atmosphere of good-will and love , he tacitly measures all humanity by it never dreaming but that his individual deity is a type of all that walks on two feet . He received a sharp cuff once from a two-legged brute who " wa' n't a-go'n ' to have no dogs a-suckun his fingers . " He had licked the man 's hand ( I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of man , he was a being of good-will , and he got his first experience of a malignant disposition . He could not understand it ; he yelped and fled to his master . I do not believe he laid it up against our race . His data were too few ' as yet to make so sweeping an induction . But some dogs have had to make it ; have had to learn that there are men and men , or even that men as a race are a poor lot . One can not but be sorry to see a snarling , suspicious , cowering cur ; to think how much reason he has for being so and how he has had to belie his nature , perhaps even before he was born , to have become so . And there are snarling , suspicious , treacherous men ; dreadful deities these for the species below them . They are made so , it would seem , partly by the sins of their own kind and partly by what they supposed the sins of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for to lay the wrong on that abstraction called the world is to lay it virtually on the Power that made the world what it is . All this , of course , is only their own ignorance of the gods and their own evil bent imputed to the powers above ; an ignorance curable not by knowledge wholly , if at all , but by love . The lack of love is the one darkness and blindness . As soon as they turn away from evil motions to love and loyalty and patience and trust ? the dog virtues ? men , too , find out their mistake and the true nature of the gods begins to come in sight . But because men are not gods yet . but only stumbling along through the sand andthorns of their own nature toward God , and because they are so easily drawn away toward the dirt and dark , they too often give their four-footed friend compelling reason for moroseness and suspicion . They need to school themselves better in the deity role , so that they may send on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are so loyally waiting for the adoption ? to wit , the redemption of the body . We may , perhaps , take a hint from Caleb not to lay up too much against our race or against any single specimen of it . The man who cuffed him ( God made him , let him pass for a man ) perhaps loves his wife and children ; perhaps has a dog or a horse on whom he bestows a surly good-will according to his light . There is a germ of love in him struggling to get beyond the tether of property exclusiveness and become intrinsic . If he can be kind to his own dog he is in the way , so he will commit himself to it , of being kind to all dogs , and to men and to the world in which he is unwittingly undergoing education . If he can get out of that mesh of self , out of that cramping prison-house of his own claims , and let good-will have free course and be its own reason for existing ? well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outrage its healthy instincts , and the world itself will become a different place . The problem is to get the channels and sluice-ways open for that elemental tide of love which is the deepest and realest thing in the world , so that in the far-off divine event there may be no clog or stricture . A big problem ? Yes ; there is no denying that . The Reality above took upon Himself no easy task when he endowed a multitudinous creation with such tremendous possibilities and then set it growing to make the possible real . We may well be thankful that so small a part of the task relatively falls on us of the human species . And perhaps if we will let ourselves learn from beings like my lowly teacher ( there are many of them as good as he ) , who are all the while teaching as though they taught not , to accept the role that they tacitly accord us , with due appreciation of their dumb virtues , a livable theology may not seem so very hard a problem after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
