txt With a lot of the . old-time party bosses looking on and expressing approval by loud applause , the Republican Assembly caucus to-night nominated Edwin A , Merritt , Jr. , of St. Lawrence as the majority candidate for Speaker . The progressive oppositiop to Mr. Merritt had gone to pieces hours before the caucus was called to order , partly hem the lack of proper leadership . His rival for Speakership honors , Charles A. Deija of the Twenty-seventh ( New York ) District , received only 10 votes to the 87 cast for Mr. Merritt . After the result had been announced Mr. Dana arose and moved that the vote be made unanimous . This was done amid great applause . It was an all-around victory for the Old Guard element in the Republican organization . Not only did this element have its way in naming the next Speaker of the Assembly , but Frederick W. Hammond of Syracuse . who has been closely allied with the Hendricks machine in Onondaga County , was made the Republican candidate for Clerk of the lower house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was made unanimous also . The Capitol had all the old-time appearance to-day . Republican Bosses who have not shown their faces here since the days of Odell and Higgins were on hand early and in all their old time glory . One of the first arrivals was Lou F. Payn , the Republican Leader In Columbia County and during the days of Platt and Odell one of the most powerful of the Republican Bosses in this State . He came with the full regalia of shining silk hat and white tie that distinguished him in the old days of Bossdom . ! , ' Iw.ent out ff ; ' , , , ! ities when Hughes - came , n , " said ' rayn . " Now I am back on the job again and , I am glad of it . Oh , yes , 1 am member of the Old Guard , and I am somewhat proud of it . Let me tell you  --  talking about the Old Guard  --  this is a fight of the Old Guard against the Black Guard . It is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all good -. epublicans should stand together . ' Among the other old-time leaders who were on hand were Collector of the Port of Plattsburg John F. O'Brien , who bosses a big territory in Northern New York ; Isaac V. Baker of Washington County , Charles H. Betts , who was the late John Raines 's chief lieutenant in Wayne County ; ex-Congressman George N. Southworth , one of the principal lieutenants of William Barnes , Jr. , and ex-Congressman William S. Bennet of New York , who is regarded as the spokesman of Abraham Gruber in party matters . Simultaneously with the Republican Assembly caucus to-night , the Democratic minority met and nominated Assemblyman Alfred E. Smith , who was the Tammany leader of the last Assembly , for the Post of Speaker . This will mean that Mr. Smith will be recognized as leader of the Democratic minority in the Assembly this year . In giving that place to Mr. Smith the Democrats set all precedents aside . The post , if the custom of former years had been followed , should have gone to Assemblyman Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly . In some quarters it was maintained that Tammany Leader Charles P. Murphy 's hand was in the selection of Mr. Smith . Assemblyman Frisbie , who had come to the Capitol full of fight and declaring that it would be bad politics to elect a Tammany man leader of the minority realized early in the day that the opposition to the plans of Tammany would be useless . At the caucus to-night it was the former Speaker who placed the name of Assemblyman Smith before the caucus . George R. Van Namee of Jefferson County , who was made Clerk of the last Assembly after Luke died , received the complimentary vote of the Democrats for that place . Following a time-honored Republican custom , the contending factions had in the main settled their differences before the caucus was called to order . For the last couple of days it has been a foregone conclusion that Mr. Merritt was to be the next Speaker . But there were several hopeful candidates for Clerk of the Assembly . The candidate who had gathered most strength was Ray B. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss in Onondaga County . Mr. Smith was Clerk of the Assembly for two sessions in the second term of Gov . Hughes . His record has been vigorously assailed , and not without reason , but he was very popular personally with a lot of the old-timers in the lower house , and most of the betting was on his election until State Chairman Barnes let the tip go out that he was against Smith and in favor of former Aqueduct Commissioner William H. Ten Eyck , one of the old Odell leaders in New York County . The Ten Eyck stock took a sudden boost and among those rooting for him was Congressman Bennett from " Abe " Gruber 's camp . It was only the vigorous objections entered by President Samuel S. Koenig of the New York County Republican Committee , who hurriedly succeeded in lining up the Republican members from New York , Kings , Erie , and Herkimer , in all 32 votes , for John T. Cartwright , Republican leader of the Eighteenth Assembly District in New York , This made the fight for Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammond was decided upon as a compromise candidate , Mr. Smith 's name not even going before the caucus . When Mr. Merritt wag ' put in nomination for Speaker by Assemblyman Young there was vigorous applause . Then when Mr. Dana arose and said that it was a matter of great regret to him that he would be compelled to oppose Mr. Merritt , there was silence . " From talks that I have had with Republicans throughout the State , " said Mr. Dana , " I am convinced , that if we elect Mr. Merritt Speaker , we will begin this session with the cloud of ' suspicion on what we a here . I will not state the reasons for my objection to Mr. Merritt ; you are all familiar with them . " He sat down amid silence . When the roll was called only these ten members voted for Mr. Dana ; Crane , Cole ' man , Fleck , Goodman , Kopp , Nelson , Shlivek , Stoddard , and Yule of New York and Robinson of Herkimer .
