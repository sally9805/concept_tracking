AS the interest in Charles Dickens at all diminished of late years ? Are the public still eagerto know some-thing about him from those who were in close touch with him ? To these questions I think there can be but one answer . A recent experience of my own would have been enough to convince me of this , even if I had not been satisfied of it already . A short time ago I was invited as the guest of the evening to a dinner of the Whitefriars Club , a well - known club in London composed largely of journal-ists and men of letters . It is customary on such occasions ( which are strictly private ) for the guest of the evening to speak upon some topic of general inter-est chosen by himself . Being a little in doubt as to the choice of a subject suit-able for the occasion , I consulted a prominent member of the club as to what kind of topic would he likely to prove most attractive to the audience I had to address . He did not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible language that there was only one subject upon which they would ex-pect me to speak , and that was the sub-ject of my father ; and he urged me to this course as being the one which would be most certain to give pleasure to the members of the club . I acted upon his advice ? with a result which was high-ly gratifying to me . My audience fol-lowed my remarks with a sympathetic attention and a cordial approval which showed how greatly they were inter-ested in the subject ; while in the general discussion which ensued it became ap-parent to me how true and how deep was the reverence in which they held his memory . It has now been suggested to me by one who was present that what I said on that occasion would be likely to prove of equal interest to the general public as it did to the members of the Whitefriars Club , and that I would do well to publish my remarks in the form of an article . Upon reflection , I am inclined to think that he may he right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Charles Dickens from one of his sons who was in very close and dear relations with him . What I purpose , then , in this article , is to put on record some of the impressions about him which left the most lasting effect upon my mind ; while I shall hope , at the same time , to discuss one aspect of his work which , up to a very short time ago , had received but very slight and inadequate treatment . I allude to his work as a journalist , the history of which contains much that is interesting and which is not , I think , familiar to the general public . Now if I were asked what it was that had struck me most about my father I think I should unhesitatingly say that it was his extraordinary modesty . His nature was of the simplest ; his absence of affectation or conceit surprising . When it is remembered how , at the age of twenty-four , he jumped to the very top of his profession and remained there to the end , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some slight symptoms of having had his head turned . I can emphatically assert , from my knowledge of him , that there was a total absence of anything of the kind . The next point about him which I should like to emphasize is his power of work . I do not suppose that there ever was a man who lived a more strenuous life than he did . This can he fairly gauged , to a certain extent , by his manuscripts alone ; but no one can thoroughly realize it except those who were constantly in his company and knew his habits well . He had not the faculty or gift ? call it what you will ? which Anthony Trollope prided himself upon , of being able to " reel off " his three thousand words before breakfast . On the contrary , Forster has told us of " the difficulties , physical as well as mental , on which he held the tenure of his imaginative life , which led to frequent strain and unconscious waste of what no man could less afford to spare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away from his desk during hours which , to others , might be regarded as hours of leisure . This is , I suppose , by no means uncommon with authors at times ; but with him it was uncommon in that it was so continuous . I have myself walked with him , over and over again , for two or three hours at a stretch , in company with the dogs , through the lanes and orchards of Kent ? in silence . I have accompanied him through the Great Expectations country ; I have stood by his side in the churchyard where Pip was turned upside down by the convict ; I have looked down with him upon the tombstone of " Pirrip , " also " Georgiana , wife of the Above ' ; we have wandered together over the marsh country down by the river ? that dark , flat wilderness , as he described it ? without a word being exchanged between us . And vet , absorbed though he was in his thoughts , I believe my companionship was a source of consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to he wondered at that his nature was mercurial . He had strange fits of depression from time to time , but his vitality was extraordinary , and , except in those rare intervals , his animal spirits and the brightness of his nature were delightful to see . He was haunted at times , as I suppose some people know , by a dread of failure , or of a sudden waning of his imaginative powers . There is another feature of his character which can not be too often or too seriously insisted upon ? and that is his intense earnestness and thoroughness in everything he did . He said to me more than once : " My dear boy , do everything at your best . If you do that , neither I nor any one else can find fault with you , even if you fail ; for myself , I can honestly say that I have taken as great pains with the smallest thing I ever did as with the biggest . " In giving advice to a young author , he said on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what you write you must believe in it yourself . When I am describing a scene I can as distinctly see what I am describing as I can see you now . So real are my characters to me that on one occasion I had fixed upon the course which one of them was to pursue . The character , however , got hold of me and made me do exactly the opposite to what I had intended ; but I was so sure that he was right and I was wrong that I let him have his own way ! ' Whatever he did , either in work or at play , he always gave of his very best . He hated slackness or half-heartedness in any shape or form . As a host he was inimitable . It was here that his animal spirits proved so infectious , and he carried every one with him . Christmastime at Gad 's Hill was a time of merriment and brightness ? a time sanctified by the presence of the great master of humor and the apostle of home and fireside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to others ; and I verily believe that no one enjoyed his own quaint conceits , at this time , more than he did himself . I remember , on one such occasion , Hans Christian Andersen coming on a visit to Gad 's Hill . I recall him well as a shy , somewhat awkward , ungainly , and yet lovable and interesting man , his time principally occupied in cutting out , in a most artistic manner , little paper figures of fairies and animals , or in surreptitiously crowning Wilkie Collins 's wide-awake hat with garlands of daisies , in which the all-unconscious author of The Woman in White used to present himself to the gaze of the admiring villagers , to the intense delight of the mischievous sons of the house who accompanied him . Another constant visitor to Gad 's Hill was Charles Fechter , the great actor , whose principal amusement , when there , was to have violent quarrels with my youngest brother ? then quite a small boy ? over their games of chess . Of course there were many American visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm-hearted party , invaded the establishment for a few days . Of him I have a delightful remembrance . A cheery , bright , strikingly intellectual personality ? as much unlike the conventional poet as was Robert Browning . At the same time I remember resenting , with the perverseness of a boy , his de-scription of me at that time as being " a student-looking youth . " Mr. and Mrs. Fields , Charles Eliot Norton , and Professor Lowell 's daughter , were some of the Americans who were the most welcome of guests . It would be impossible for me to attempt to make out a list of the visitors who came to Gad 's Hill . Suffice it to say that such a list would include the names , not only of those distinguished in literature , but in well-nigh every calling in life . He was generally acknowledged to he one of the best speakers of his day . He spoke without notes , but never impromptu in the strict sense of the word , because he generally thought out very carefully the substance of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me upon the art of public speaking was so true and so exhaustive that I fee ! I can not do better than reproduce it here . The occasion arose out of a speech which I made at the Cambridge University Union Debating Society ? which had received some notice from the press . He had seen the notice , and accordingly wrote me a letter dated the r7th of February , 1870 , which was to the following effect : I am extremely glad to hear that you have made such a good start at the Union . Take any amount of pains about it , open your mouth well and roundly , speak to the last person visible , and give yourself time . One great speech of his I well remember . It was the occasion of his delivering his inaugural address as President of the Midland and Birmingham Institute , The ball was packed with artisans , and he won their confidence at once . It was a stirring speech at times , though it was mainly devoted to giving the members of the Institute advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as almost commonplace had it not been couched in language intensely earnest and impressive . In the course of this speech he said : To the students of your industrial classes generally I have it in my mind first to commend the short motto in two words : Courage ? Persevere . This is a motto of a friend and worker . Not because the eyes of Europe are upon them , for I do n't in the least believe it ; nor because the eyes of England are upon them , for I do n't in the least believe it ; not because their doings will be proclaimed with blast of trumpets at street corners , for no such musical performances will take place ; nor because self-improvement is at all certain to lead to worldly success , but simply because it is good and right of itself , and because , being so , it does assuredly bring with it its own resources and its own rewards . And then , passing on to another subject , he said : To this I would superadcl a little truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of every eminent man I have ever known . The one serviceable , safe , certain , remunerative , attainable quality in every study and in every pursuit is the quality of attention . My own invention or imagination , such as it is , I can most truthfully assure you , would never have served me as it has but for the habit of commonplace , humble , patient , daily , toiling , drudging attention . Genius , vivacity , quickness of penetration , brilliancy in association of ideas ? such mental qualities , like the qualities of the apparition of the externally armed head in " Macbeth , " will not be commanded ; but attention , after due term of submissive service , always will . How well do I remember the visits I paid with him next day to some of the large and important factories in Birmingham , and how the grimy workmen , stained with heat and toil , kept on stopping me as we passed to say , " Is that Charles Dickens ? " This was not in the least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole career a true friend of the poor ; and that this was fully recognized by themselves the following little story will prove . The day after he died , a workman , walking into a tobacco-shop to buy his screw of tobacco , paid a tribute to his memory which should , in my judgment , rank as high as any one of the glowing tributes paid to him at the time , when , throwing his money on the counter , he said : " Charles Dickens is dead . We have lost our best friend . " There is one other striking scene in his life which stands out as clearly and distinctly to me now as though it happened only yesterday . This was his final appearance as a reader , which took place at St. James 's Hall in March , 1870 , shortly before he died . These readings had been a source of great delight as well as profit to him , though they entailed an enormous amount of labor and exhaustion , and materially tended to the shortening of his life . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Sikes and Nancy , " after reading which he was so overcome by the strain that he became practically speechless until he had restored his vitality by a light supper . Strong pressure was put upon him to induce him to abandon his intention of undertaking this overpowering effort , which was the cause of an ever-increasing drain upon his physical resources . But he was not to be deterred . He had given a trial reading to the members of the dramatic profession , which had , unfortunately , been received with such an extraordinary demonstration of enthusiasm as to make it quite impossible for him to resist the temptation of giving it for the benefit of the public at large . These series of public readings were four in number , namely : I858-6o , 1861-63 , 1866-67 , 1868-70 ( which covers his readings both in America and England ) . Some weeks before the time fixed for his final reading he had been very ill , his series of readings had been peremptorily stopped fur the time by his medical advisers , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eventually to overcome him . The result was that when the last night came he was greatly shaken , arid , though this was unknown to his audience , was in fact a doomed man . Not that he realized this himself , nor did his bodily weakness impair in the slightest degree the power or the effect of his reading . He chose the Christmas Carol and the trial scene from Pickwick , and I do not think he ever made a stronger impression upon the minds of his hearers than he did on that memorable occasion . At last the reading was over and the end came i which is so well described by Forster . In a few words of farewell he thanked VOL . CXXEX. ? No. 770. - 24the public , and then in a voice of deep emotion he said : " From these garish lights I vanish now for evermore with a heartfelt , grateful . respectful , affectionate farewell . " What followed almost baffles description . I can only say that I have never seen a large mass of people so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indeed he has said it to me ? that he believed that the man who had influenced him most was Thomas Carlyle . This somewhat surprised me . I could understand this in connection with his book , The Tale of Two Cities , but not when taken in its general sense . I gathered , however , that what he most admired in Carlyle was his sincerity and truth . I knew Carlyle . I had the privilege , when a young man , of seeing him once or twice , alone , at his house in Chelsea . On one occasion , after I had taken my degree in the mathematical tripos at Cambridge and he had been discussing my future career , he patted me on the back at parting and said , in his broad Scotch , " Waal , all I can wish you is just to do an honest man 's work . " It is interesting in this connection to recall to mind the well-known and familiar words in which Carlyle spoke of my father just after he died ? " the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; every inch of him an honest man . " This , I think , is a convenient place in which to give three or four out of a large number of instances of my father 's widespread popularity , as evidenced to myself at different times among all sorts and conditions of men . When I was an undergraduate at Cambridge I was asked by a friend of mine if I would like to meet Charles Kingsley . As I was a great admirer of his works , I said it would give me the greatest pleasure to do so . Accordingly , I was invited to a large luncheon - party at St. John 's College . When I arrived I was introduced to Kingsley , but he did not catch my name , and shook hands with me as a matter of ordinary politeness . In the course of the luncheon some one asked me a question about my father , on hearing which Kingsley ? who was seated at the other end of a long table ? putting down his knife and fork , said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my answering in the affirmative he came all the way round the table to shake me by the hand . The next incident took place at Toronto , in Canada . I had been staying there with two of my daughters and we were going by rail to Niagara . When we arrived at the station I found the " boots " of the hotel with a hold-all under each arm and a hag in each hand , and I said to him , " Please take the wraps to my parlor-car -- name , Dick-ens . " In any way related ? " he answered . " Oh yes ; I am a sun . " Down went the hold-ails and the hags , and , holding out his hand to me , he said , " God bless you , sir ! " The scene shifts to Jamaica . Some years ago I had to go out to that island to represent several insurance offices in some very heavy litigation which arose out of the fires which followed upon the great earthquake which laid Kingston in ruins . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the island from Kingston . The litigation caused immense excitement , and the papers were full of the trial and published portraits of the counsel engaged . One morning between six and seven , when I was having my early morning walk , I saw a buggy with two comfortable-looking little black people inside it coming toward me . As it came abreast of me the buggy stopped and a little black man , leaning out of , it said : " Mr. Dickens , soh ? " " Yes , " I replied . " Will you shake hands with us , sah ? " " Certainly ? by all means . " So I first shook hands with his smiling little wife and then with his smiling little self , and then they both proceeded to tell me how greatly they loved my father 's hooks , and , so far as I could judge , they had read them , every one . But the most signal proof to me of his enduring popularity is afforded by the world-wide discussion which has been maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mystery of Edwin Drood . Was Edwin Drood murdered ? Did Jasper kill him ? Who was Datchery ? Books have been written on these questions ; reams of paper have been covered ; every kindof theory possible or impossible has been boldly put forward in elucidation of the story . Why , only recently a mock trial was held in London of one John Jasper for the murder of Edwin Drood , at which men of letters , acting as counsel on the one side and the other , pleaded before a jury of distinguished writers , of which Mr. George Bernard Shaw was the foreman , the presiding judge being Mr. G. K. Chesterton . I believe this trial was , in its inception , started quite seriously . with a view to having the questions in dispute fairly argued out ; but it soon ? most unfortunately , as it appears to me ? took the form of a farcical joke , and ended in a verdict of manslaughter , after which the learned judge proceeded to commit to prison every one present ( except himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may say at once that I have no knowledge or information as to what my father 's intentions were beyond that which is shared by the general public , though I must confess I hold strong views upon the subject . That Edwin Drood was murdered and that he met with his death at the hands of Jasper is , to my mind , as clear as noonday . My eldest brother , Charles , personally vouched for the fact that my father told him so in the plainest and most unequivocal language ; John Forster tells us the same thing with equal clearness . It is quite idle to suggest that my father would have deceived these two , or that either Forster or my brother was trying to deceive the public . It seems to be equally clear that he never changed his mind , because when the book was well advanced he told Sir Luke Fildes , R.A. , his illustrator , the same thing . The reason for his doing so was this : Jasper had always appeared in a small black tie ; suddenly Fildes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy folds , and upon Fildes asking whether there was any reason for such a change he received this answer : " Can you keep a secret ? This scarf is necessary for Jasper to strangle Edwin Drood with . " In the face of these facts , apart altogether from the text , which ' I myself should have thought was pretty clear in itself , I am entirely at a loss to understand how any doubt can have arisen on the subject . Then who was Datchery ? Upon this question , again , the wildest suggestions have been made . Datchery was Edwin Drood himself ; Datchery was Tartar ; Datchery was Grewgious . Such suggestions as these savor so much of the comic that they may be put aside at once . But in addition to these , two other theories have been put forward , and so seriously maintained by reasoned arguments as to deserve somewhat closer consideration . The one is that Datchery was Helena Landless ; the other that he was impersonated by Hazzard , Grewgious 's clerk . I can not myself quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Datchery with one of the characters already introduced into the book . The work was not half finished . Why should not Datchery be a new character altogether ? one of that detective class , or of some one with detective instincts which my father loved to describe and whose methods he knew so well . But Helena Landless as Datchery ! Just think of it ! Helena , with her peculiarly passionate , impulsive nature , with her strong physical characteristics , is supposed to have played the part of the quiet old buffer disguised only by a wig and blackened eyebrows and buttoned up in a tightish blue surtout ; and her first action after assuming such a disguise was to have an interview with Jasper himself . The difficulties in the way of this theory appear to me to be insuperable , white the idea itself ( if it was the idea of the author ) has been characterized by Mr. Andrew Lang as being so singularly far-fetched and extravagant as to show a complete weakening and decay of his powers as a novelist . In Edwin Drood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , I have always thought that the book , though unequal in parts , contains some of his best work ; and so far as any personal knowledge can throw light upon the matter , I entirely agree with what my sister has said , that his brain was more than usually clear and bright during the writing of it . But probe the matter a little closer . Was it a woman such as Helena who could have played with the ass Sapsea in the clever way in which Datcherydid in the interview when Jasper was present ? Surely it required a man of the world , and a very shrewd one , to elicit so cleverly the information which Datchery required . It was not Helena who , when Datchery was asked by the Princess Puffer ( the opium woman ) for Jasper 's name , answered , in sententious language : " Surname , Jasper ; Christian name , John ? Mr. John Jasper . " It was not Helena who said to herself in the privacy of Datchery 's own room , " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . his means , I have had rather a busy afternoon . " But of course there is one fatal objection to the theory . When Datchery first appears at Cloister-ham , in chapter eighteen , Helena Landless herself was still living in that town , and it is not till chapter twenty-two that she first appears in London . An effort has been made to surmount this difficulty by the astounding suggestion that chapter eighteen ought in fact to have been introduced after chapter twenty-two , and it is attempted to give color to this theory by the statement my father is said to h ave made to his sister-in-law that he had introduced Datchery too early in the book . That is not at all a correct description of what he did in fact say . He never suggested to her that he had introduced Datchery out of his proper place in the book ; but that , having regard to the fact that he had still six more numbers to write , the whole story was advancing too rapidly . It was for this reason that he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his papers after his death . That Helena Landless was destined to play a very prominent part in Jasper 's ultimate downfall is clearly foreshadowed , but that she was to do it in this fantastic way 1 can not bring myself for one moment to believe . What is the real foundation upon which this theory is based ? It is in reality this : that Neville Landless tells us that Helena , when a child , had dressed up in Coy 's clothes . This in itself does not point to much . It may be only a trait in her character ; but assuming that it was intended to lay the foundation for some future action on her part , there is one highly significant detail of the illustrated cover which , in my opinion , has an important bearing on this and should not be ignored . It is the figure of Jasper with a lantern , in what looks like the vaults of the cathedral , suddenly finding himself confronted in the dim light with a figure apparently made up to represent Edwin Drood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have made such an impres-sion upon him as to lead to the discovery of his crime . Was this Helena Landless ? I do not pretend to answer . I only suggest this theory as being quite as plausible ? if not more plausible ? than the other , and as one which would account equally well for the fact of her having once dressed up in boy 's clothes being brought so prominently to our attention . As for the Hazzard theory , one has only to contrast Bazzard 's manner and character with the breezy sprightliness of Datchery to see at once how absurd such a suggestion is . Edwin Drood has always had a very melancholy interest for me , for after my father had written the last line of the sixth number , before he was seized with the stroke from which he never rallied , he wrote me a letter which was the last communication I was ever to receive from him . And now for a few words on the subject of the work which he did as a journalist . I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nature , extent , or value of this work ? It is known , of course , that he started and edited the Daily News for a few weeks . It is common knowledge that he conducted Household Words and All the Year Round , while the papers of The Uncommercial Traveler are familiar to most readers of Dickens ; but beyond this little is known of his journalistic work . The idea of embarking on journalism in a periodical of his own was always an active one with him . It first showed itself in concrete form in 1845 , when he had it in his mind to start a weekly paper to be called The Cricket , the main features of which were to be " sharp anatomization of humbug , jolly good temper , and a vein of generous reference to home and fireside . " Thereis a true Dickens ring about that , . anatomization of humbug , jolly good temper , home and fireside . " These were , indeed , the keynotes of most of his work . However , this idea came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January , 1846 , when he started the Daily News . But this , as is generally known , proved abortive so far as he himself was concerned . He found the work of editing a daily paper far too onerous , and his editorship came to an end at the expiration of a few weeks . But though it lay dormant for a while , this old and often-recurring fancy still possessed him until at last , in 1849 , it took tangible and lasting shape in the production of Household Words ; and it was from this date that his real work of journalism began , although he had in the early forties contributed some papers to the Examiner . A few of the articles he wrote in Household Words and All the Year Round he selected himself for reproduction under the heading of " Reprinted Pieces , " but as all the contributors to both these periodicals were anonymous , there was , beyond this , nothing which could give any indication of the extent or character of his own journalistic work . The veil was lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting article by Mr. B. W. Matz ( the editor of The Dickensian ) appeared in the Fortnightly Review , entitled " Dickens as a Journalist , " to which Mr. Matz has kindly permitted me to refer . By this time the articles written by my father were clearly identified by means of the business books of Household Words and .411 the Year Round ; and these , together with his articles for the Examiner , were collected and reproduced in the Na-tional Edition of his works issued in that same year in two volumes , entitled Miscellaneous Papers . Some of these , of course , are of merely passing interest ; but many of them are of great value , dealing , as they do , not merely with burning questions of social reform , but with . well-nigh every conceivable topic of general interest . It will not , I suppose , be denied that his books led to many social reforms . i How far this was the intention of his writing , or how far the reform naturally followed from what he wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable light is thrown by one of the articles of which I am speaking , in which he is pressing for the improvement of the towns and the amendment of the dwellings of the poor ; for in the course of that article he says : Long before this journal came into existence we systematically tried to turn fiction to the good account of showing the preventable wretchedness and misery in which the mass of the people dwell , and of expressing again and again the conviction , founded upon observation , that the reform of their habitations must precede all other reforms , and that without it all other reforms must fail . But whatever may have been the purpose of his novels , there can be no possible question as to the object with which he penned many of these articles . They are the work of an active and ardent social reformer of strong radical leaning , with a keen sense of the misery and wretchedness surrounding him and an earnest desire to force them upon the attention of an apathetic and heedless world . My father had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forster in language which has always struck me as being singularly pathetic and beautiful ; so much so , in fact , that 1 do not think 1 can conclude this slight sketch more fittingly than by recalling the incident which is thus described by Forster : When we met he was fresh from Venice , which had impressed him as the wonder and the new sensation of the world ; but well do I remember how high above it all arose the hope that filled his mind . " Ah ! " he said to me , " when I saw those places , howl thought that to leave one 's hand upon the time , lastingly upon the time , with one tender touch for the mass of toiling people which nothing could obliterate , would be to lift oneself above the dust of all the Doges in their graves , and stand upon a giant 's staircase that Samson could n't overthrow . " Most assuredly that workingman was right when he said of my father , " We have lost our best friend . "
