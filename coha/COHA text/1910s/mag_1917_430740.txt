The conditions under which the acted drama has been produced in different ages have come to be pretty well understood . The Greek theatres , however shattered and fragmental , have had their general dispositions made clear . Moliere 's data ? his four trestles and a passion , along with a court audience ? are fully comprehended . The Elizabethan stage , thanks to the studies of Mr. J. Brander Matthews and others , has issued from the dusk'of conjecture ? and from the deeper dusk of ignorance which did not even realize that there was anything in particular to conjecture about . It is now clearly understood that the details of playwriting and of play-producing have been greatly conditioned everywhere by the mere physical and mechanical means of publicity . Some similar effort might be made on behalf of fiction ought to be made , in fact , if the character and aspect of much of the light reading of to-day is properly to be apprehended and appraised . How , in fact , have the modern equivalents for the choral altar and the inn courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fiction of the daily newspaper , of some of the weekly periodicals , even that of the " movies , " will be seen in a different and juster light if the conditions governing publication are more clearly kept in view . The serial published in monthly instalments somehow still holds its place . It seems the lineal descendant of those novels by Dickens and Thackeray which , during the ' 40 's , first saw the light in monthly " parts . " In days when the stately quarterlies held the first place in the public attention and esteem , the month did not seem a large unit of time . But the weekly and the daily have made the month a small eternity . The monthly serial still lumbers along , but its goal seems all the time to be the bound volume or book publication . In one of these forms the magazine serial reconquers , in this day of short-breathed haste , its interrupted continuity , overcomes the disjointing of its consecutiveness . The most striking example of fiction con- ditioned by method of publication is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fiction concerns itself most with the hitches and drawbacks of married life . One distressful couple , with subordinate figures and occasional simple changes of scene , quite suffices . Marion and Wilbur appear daily , to the extent of a column or so . The wife may be flighty and extravagant , the husband grave and patient . Or Wilbur may be dogged , ungracious , inconsiderate , and Marion sensitive and plaintive . . Thus through every week-day of the year , with each section of the story more or less independent and self-sufficing . You go off for a week to New York , or for a month to San Francisco , or for a year to the Pole , and when you return Marion and Wilbur are having instalments of their familiar jars on the familiar scale . This might be called the angleworm type of fiction : short , choppy lengths , each one of them intelligible and available without exact regard for the other lengths . The worm so finely cut up seldom reassembles himself ? fails , in fact , to turn back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of fiction is that , in point of characterization , it is static . Anything like real development , like true evolution , is absent . Wilbur , if dour and selfish and inconsiderate in February , is found to be none the less so in August . Marion , however long-suffering when we left her in early summer , never reaches the point of open protest or rebellion by the end of December . The two creatures merely mark time , performing a shuffling dance that brings them no nearer a goal . Their manoeuvres lend some color to the claim that the journey itself , not the journey 's end , is the main consideration in humanity 's mundane experience . Another objection to this type of fiction is that it must be written ? or is written ? in a " style " to coalesce with that employed in adjacent columns ? an undistinguished style for undistinguishing people . Yet literature is like enough to fail when it addresses an ideal reader : that is as bad as to write for posterity , or to write ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One must write for the public that exists in one 's own day . If that public is long on heedlessness and short on taste . . . Another form of fiction that is largely conditioned on publication at short intervals , for one definite body of readers , is the intermittent serialfounded on the doings and adven- tures of a single individual : the biographical type . This individual is frequently a detective , more important or less important , whose doings ( or triumphs ; they are the same ) rest on a basis blandly ratiocinative or speciously scientific . Recently the central figure of such a series has come to be , with frequency , a woman ? a girl who moves through Western scenes as a kind of brash , self-confident special providence ; or an elderly woman ( English preferred ) who composedly circulates as a globe-trotter through the wild waste spaces of the earth and sets things right when the local authorities fail . The serious objection to this type of fiction is that it , too , is static . The protagonist has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , he always " comes through " ? must , indeed , come through , if the series is to continue . Thus an important element , that of uncertainty , is sacrificed . If the author , miscalculating the public 's interest , or failing to maintain his own , kills off his leading personage , there is but one thing to do : he must revive him , put him on his legs and start him again on his course . Another objection is that the real interest gets to be transferred to the subordinate figures which must constantly be fed into the series ; sometimes , even , to the new environments in which these figures function . So that the death of the protagonist , even if premature , is not always a calamity ; particularly in a certain kind of detective story , where the two necessary rules seem to be : first , write backwards ; second , avoid characterization . Yet the established type of character always has held , and always will hold , its own against new , fresh , authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographical sort , it holds its own and meets a real need . A plausible but exasperating form of fiction is one which is encountered in certain weeklies and runs through three or four consecutive issues . It is pseudo-autobiographical in character and may be called the telescope type . It purports to be the intimate , detailed experiences of a single individual , reported by himself . If such a fiction is represented as coming from the hand of a successful professional man , a man whose success has enabled him to penetrate to scenes which the less successful , however avid , have been unable to reach , and if it professes to handle with exactness and  | without reserves the financial details of the social advances of himself , wife , sons , and daughters , with what it all cost and how the cost was distributed , then it is pretty certain to gain acceptance and vogue . Yet can anyone doubt that a fiction of this sort is a mere compilation , drawn from a dozen " careers " real or imagined ? " Mere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry and such far-flung inquiry ? or invention ? as must enter into the composition of a social study of this type . The experienced practitioner , though he detects readily enough the essential humbuggery of the scheme , can not withhold admiration for the hand that cast the net so wide and composed its heterogeneous haul to such an effect of compactness and plausibility . " The Gold Bug , " such a fiction might be named . And what is to prevent others of like nature ? " The Bird of Paradise , " for example , might telescope the social experiences of a dozen brilliant daughters of the fortunate , behind whose reiterated " I 's " stands perhaps a robust , sardonic young man . " The Drudge , " written not on a kitchen table but in some scented boudoir , will epitomize for us , in a fashion not too open to the charge of faking , the concentrated domestic routine of a hundred weary wives and mothers in lowly circumstances . And weekly numbers will carry the second instalment over the land before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the third will follow the second . The tourist serial , an elastic , peripatetic affair which may be called the Pullman type , does not call for much attention , though it appears to be growing in favor . I presume it stems largely from the Williamsons . A small group of people , preferably incongruous , shift along past varied backgrounds , scenic or historical . If these people , men and women alike , have an easy command of slang , or even of the jargon of the sporting column , they will not make reading any harder for their creator 's clientele , nor his success any the less . All this presupposes , of course , a newspaper public , ? one reading quite in the newspaper spirit . The movies may profess to rest on a pictorial basis , just as the opera professes to rest on a musical basis . But scenario , no less than libretto , has a literary aspect that conditions fundamentally the whole work . The screen , indeed , by virtue of its many " leaders " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facsimiles of letters and telegrams , is constantly concerned with literary expression . One would wish for " The Adventures of Anabel , " for " Narrow-mindedness , " and for " A Daughter of Heaven " an initial quality of thought that might make the enormous expenditure of time , effort , and money seem better justified . One inclines also to wish that the multitudinous bits of text thrown on the screen might be less pitifully awkward and illiterate . One might even suggest a literary adviser for the great producing studios , were it not for the fact that , to the masses , the second-rate is often more acceptable than the first-rate , and the further fact that , with minds of a certain calibre , finish abashes rather than gratifies . About free verse as a new and practicable medium of fiction , I have already written in these pages . To the names of Masters , Frost , and Amy Lowell , in this field , may properly be added the name of Mary Aldis . Many of the pieces in her " Flashlights " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( however sharp-edged , bitter-tanged and disconcerting some of the themes may be ) fully justify her title . They have a contemporaneity and an actuality that should not fail with a public whose chief reading is in the daily press , and yet possess qualities that make them acceptable on a different and higher plane . To end with , these newer forms of fiction are conditioned not only by the vehicle of publication , but by the public state of mind and by the general average of public taste . If that improves , literature will improve in response . Yet why demand that it improve ? To many persons art in all its forms is but a mere casual diversion . If one can enjoy what is currently placed before him , why put oneself out by trying to qualify for the enjoyment of something that would be sure to be different yet would not be sure to be more amusing ?
