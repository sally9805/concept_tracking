txt Mr. WILSON 'S ideal , which he is Striving to make a reality , is " the " imperishable supremacy of right by " means of an association of peoples " who should liberate the world . " These are words spoken by the Vice Rector of the Unjaseraity of Paris in confers de , honorary degree of Doctor upon the President . As Mr. WILSON put it in his address acknowledging the honor , the League of Nations will " operate as the organized " moral force of men throughout the " world " ; when wrong and aggression are planned or contemplated 111 , % searching light of conscience " will be turned upon the plotters , they will be commanded . to say what they are up to . Just a little exposure will settle most questions . If the Central Powers had dared to discuss the purposes of this war for a single fortnight it never Would have happened ; and if , as should be , they were forced to ellsCuss it for a year , the war would have been inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore in 1914 , invited the European Powers to discuss Austria 's demands on Serbia ; he wanted the light turned on , tried to bring about the " little exposure . " France , Italy , Russia all assented . The Central Powers refused , because they wanted no peace ; be/ cause the time had come for the War they had planned long before . A League of Nations then existing , the embodied conscience of mankind , Would have prevented the war . It " would have been inconceivable , " as Mr. WILSON said at the University of Paris . It is equally inconceivable that men of right mind and good conscience are going to oppose a League of Nations . Differences as to the constitution of the League , as to its powers , the opportune time for its creation , there may be , but never in the history of the world were there so many men to whom conviction has been brought that the nations must league together to destroy the plague of war and make peace lasting . Where five years ago there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men of foresight and forethought , lovers of their fellow-men , who dreamed and prophesied , there are now millions , literally hundreds of millions , who in the black shadow and blight and sorrow of this great war deeply feel and are resolved that this agony shall not be gone through with again , and they look to the council of the nations at Paris to take measures to establish " the imperishable supremacy of right , " to mobilize the " moral force of men , " to organize the conscience of mankind , not merely on paper , but with a sword Of flame if need be , to hold the wicked In check . For the most part we have put down these bloody-minded plotters against peace by toppling of a lot of thrones In Central Europe ; that is a good beginning . But man is not yet regenerate , and there must be safeguards . The impulse to set them up is powerful , compelling , and it is not transitory . For that reason we think the project of a League of Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and free discussion . If we may judge from the Paris dispatches , some of the American representatives there are needlessly apprehensive about the speeches of Senator KNOX and Senator LODGE ; they fear the effect in European official circles of this appearance of a divided opinion In the United States . The statesmen of Europe know very well that public Opinion in this country gives the President united and powerful support in hip desire to bring a League of Nations into being . We take it that European opinion is equally unanimous ; , opposition there would be strange . Union tbr the principle is the main thing , for then the League can be had ; differences AS to method and details are to be expected , and it is better to let them develop now than later . In particular there is room for difference of opinion upon the point of priority , whether the peace treaty shall be put off until an agreement is reached about the League . We do not see why that is not proper matter of debate in the Senate . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like a censorship over the United States Senate . The people of this country want to see the war ended legally , as it is ended in fact , without a single day of unnecessary delay . This desire has been made more general and urgent by the purpose manifested at Washington to prolong unnecessarily Government control over many branches of private business , even to extend that control in time of actual peace . Commissioners were sent to Paris to conclude peace . The country wants peace . There are other reasons , grave ones . Postponement of peace puts off the attainment of stable conditions in a great part of Europe where confusion now reigns . Mr. HAROLD WrLLIAMS , in his cable dispatch from Geneva published In THE TIBIES of yesterday , paints the picture : The general sense of the purpose of life is lost in the chaos of petty warring impulses . People eagerly repeat the shibboleths of democracy and equality , hoping that this will dispel the terrible dread that lurks in their hearts . Little men , often well-meaning and sincere , devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Germany the soldiers make chaotic politics while the upper class looks on unrepentant , arrogant , resentful , and helpless ; and amateur governments of a day spend their little strength in torrents of speeches while they have no power to stay the inevitable course of events . Through all this seething chaos run evil currents of intrigue after intrigue , monarchical , Bolshevist , financial , imperialistic , particularist , clerical , atheist . These dangerous conditions are bred of the uncertainty that hangs like a smokepall over the world in the interval between the end of hostilities and the conclusion of peace . Nothing will calm men 's minds so quickly as the need to busy themselves at once and seriously with the actual terms of peace . Germany must have a Government before she can have peace . When Paris begins to present actualities instead of theories and speculations she will set about forming one . If the nations can come at once to a commitment upon the principle of a League of Nations , can be brought to pledge themselves to form one , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoicing . The conference should make sure of the League  --  that we all believe . But if months are to be spent in discussion of details and methods of organization , as well may prove to be the case , surely no one would insist that the signing of the peace treaty should await all those determinations . That would be a calamity and danger . It must not be incurred . The world wants the war ended for good and all .
