 | Mr. Clarence Poe , editor of the Progressive Farmer , has lately been advocating the enactment of a statute by the General Assembly of North Carolina providing that , wherever the greater part of the land acreage in any given district is owned by one race , a majority of the voters in such a district may say that in the future no land shall be sold to a person of a different race , provided such action is approved or allowed by a reviewing judge or board of county commissioners . The statute that Mr. Poe suggests would not impose segregation upon any district but , like the Virginia city segregation statute , would simply enable any given district so desiring to promote the segregation of the races . Nor would action by any district under this enabling statute necessarily mean actual segregation . Suppose , for instance , a given district should vote that no additional land should be sold to negroes . The negro land owners in that community would be permitted to hold on to their property during their life and leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so far as the law provided , remain indefinitely on the land , and the white land owners might still rent their land to colored tenants . There is no intimation as to the size of the district , whether it would be the size of a local school tax district or of a township or of a county or of a larger area . This , presumably , would be left entirely with the voters . Though the letter of the statute as suggested by Mr. Poe would apply equally to both races and would enable the colored people in any given district , if they so desired and if they had a majority of the votes and of the land acreage , to declare that no white person should buy any more land in that district ,  | still the avowed purpose of such a statute , according to Mr. Poe , would be to enable white farmers to keep negroes from buying land in a given district . Mr. Poe says , for instance , in a pamphlet which he has issued , " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unjust because , with the government of the South as it is , it could be utilized by white people to keep their communities white , but the negroes would rarely or never be able to use it to make a community wholly negro . All of which I admit , and yet I believe it is just . " Again , explaining his proposed statute in the columns of the News and Observer , Mr. Poe said , " I am simply saying that , where they desire it , our small white farmers of the South should have the right to live and build worthy homes for themselves and their children and children 's children , with the assurance that the community will remain predominantly white . * * * * And if this matter can be constitutionally settled by law by leaving its application to voters ( which means in white hands ) it will be better than if left to private agreement . " In the article from which the above quotation was taken , Mr. Poe advances seven reasons for segregation , in every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the white people and in only one of which does he consider the interests of the colored people at all , that one involving the moral conditions in the relations of the races . The legal and constitutional issues involved in segregation are not to be considered in this article . The constitutionality of the Winston-Salem and Greensboro ordinances will probably be determined by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in the case of State against Darnell by the time this article reaches the public . It must be said , however , that in leaving it to given districts to decide whether or not they will have segregation and in leaving it to a board of county commissioners to say whether or not segregation in a given district is advisable , the statute would give rise to constitutional questions that do not appear in the ordinances of Winston-Salem and Greensboro . If rural segregation after the plan suggested is right in principle , then it will be possible to frame a statute that will conform to constitutional limitations . If , on the other hand , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute can be drawn to satisfy the constitution  | would not justify its adoption . In other words , the more important question about a segregation statute is not whether it is constitutional but whether it is just . If in the matter of segregation one had only to consider the industrial and social welfare of the white farmers , then one set of issues would arise . But segregation has a moral aspect as well as an industrial and social aspect , and the welfare of the colored people as well as of the white has to be considered , which considerably modifies these issues . If segregation can not be justified as being morally right and for the best interests of both races , then it can not be justified as being sound , in the long run , either in its economic or in its social aspects . Bishop Kilgo , addressing a graduating class at Trinity , said , " The race question is a moral question , it is the question of the right of a human being to rise from the lower points of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race issue will test the moral quality of this nation , and , if it finds no settlement , the failure will be a moral failure , and show the point at which our civilization broke down for the lack of moral strength . " If the race question is a moral question , then the white people of North Carolina can not afford to adopt a policy of neglect or of laissez faire towards the negro . The distinctive teaching of Jesus in the parable of the Good Samaritan is that opportunity to help and need of help create an obligation to help even where different races are involved . There is no doubt that the negro of the South , with his lower economic and ethical standards , is in need of help from every source . Nor is there any more doubt that the white people of the South , with their higher standards and with their accumulated wealth of things , of ideas , and of ideals through the long ages of civilization , have an opportunity to help the negroes who live in their midst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help creates an obligation upon the white people of North Carolina towards the colored people which can not be ignored ? noblesse oblige . Governor Aycock once said , ' " Ve hold our title to power by tenure of service to God , and if we fail to administer equal and exact justice to the negro whom we deprive of suffrage , we shall in the fullness of time lose power ourselves , for we must The Life and Speeches of Charles B. Aycock , p. 243.  | know that the God who is Love trusts no people with authority for the purpose of enabling them to do injustice to the weak . " A policy of repression would make the negro a very dangerous element in the life of the South . On this point , Dr. Edgar Gardner Murphy said , " A thwarted and perverted capacity is a peril both to the individual and to the state . Repression is not a remedy for anything . The repression of the capacities of our greatest negro would have made him the most dangerous factor in Southern life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these capacities exist , there is neither joy nor safety nor right nor common sense in the belittling of a thing which God has given , or in the attempted destruction of a power which has entered into the experience of the world as one of the nobler assets of the nation and of humanity . " Roscoe Conkling Bruce , speaking to the Grand Army of the Republic in Sanders Theatre of Harvard University on Memorial Day , 1906 , said , " Remember , gentlemen , a rose can not bloom under a mill-stone , but a cactus can . " The finer qualities of the negro race ? sympathy , the spirit of co-operation , fidelity , loyalty ? can not thrive under a policy of repression adopted by the white people ; but the ignoble qualities ? envy , selfishness , treachery ? thrive best in just such an atmosphere . It is not intended here to imply that those who favor rural segregation would consciously adopt a policy either of neglect or of repression towards the negroes of the South . But if the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neglect or to repress the colored people , then the harmful results as indicated by Governor Aycock , Dr. Edgar Gardner Murphy , and Roscoe Conkling Bruce would inevitably follow . Inasmuch as rural segregation by legislation has never been undertaken in this country or in any other country whose race relations are parallel with ours , we can not be guided by precedents . And one arguing either for or against segregation can not cite the experience of other communities . If the next General Assembly were to enact an enabling statute and then some community in North Carolina were to take action under it , one of two things would happen as regards the negroes already on the land . As land owners or as tenants , they would either live on there as heretofore or else they would  | move into some other community . The latter course is what the advocates of segregation would expect the negroes to adopt . Mr. Poe , for instance , says , " What would happen very surely , however , would be this : once a neighborhood has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no more land here shall be sold to a negro , ' it would be easy to bring pressure to bear upon landlords , even absentee landlords , to get a better class of tenants . If the people took enough interest in the matter to say to a landlord , We are trying to make a white community , and here is a chance for you to put in a white tenant , ' he would be mighty likely to listen to them . Moreover , these communities would attract white settlers to them in increasing numbers . Would n't people from other sections begin to say , I want to get into a permanently white community , with its better white social life , better white schools and churches , and better chances for a co-operation ' ? and would n't white people soon be willing to offer so fair a price for the absentee landlord 's land that he could better afford to sell it rather than to continue renting it to shiftless , soil-destroying tenants ? In this way we should expect the white communities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negro renter . " If the removal of the negroes from the segregation district would mean the coming of desirable white settlers , then the industrial advantages claimed would , no doubt , follow . But it is very doubtful if even the removal of the negro altogether from the South would attract an appreciable number of desirable white settlers . The immigration statistics show that the majority of our immigrants now are not such as would be absorbed into the white life of the South . The immigrants actually coming are more illiterate and . in many cases , as superstitious as the negroes themselves . Would such immigrants , whom we do not need , or better ones , whom we do need , be willing to move into a community that had by legislation said that one element of its population could not buy or own land except under certain conditions ? Would they not reason thus : " If the white people of North Carolina thus prohibited negroes from owning land in given communities , how do we know but that , in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white stock , they will not undertake by legislation  | to segregate us , too ? " The opinion has been expressed by thoughtful men that race legislation in the South and the agitation incident thereto have done more to keep immigrants out than has the presence of the negro . If segregation should mean the withdrawal of all negroes from white communities and if this new departure in race legislation should still further dissuade immigrants from coming to the South , then industrial conditions would be all the more complicated by segregation . But suppose segregation did not result in the negro 's withdrawal from the white community . Suppose the negro land owner determined to live the balance of his days on his land and then hand it down to his children and the negro tenant gave up any idea he might have had of acquiring land of his own . Such an action on the part of the resident negroes in the white community would absolutely frustrate the efforts of the white people to obtain the benefits argued for segregation . The social life of the white people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be handicapped . Every harm that the presence of the negro in the community now causes would be augmented then because the negro tenant , with all incentive to accumulate property taken away from him , would become more thriftless and trifling than ever . The effect of segregation upon the moral life of the white people would be different according as the negro withdrew from the community or , accepting with resignation the conditions imposed upon him , remained in the community . If the negro left , then the white people would suffer from the weakening of moral fibre which always accompanies the shirking of a moral obligation . If the negro stayed on the land , then the same moral problems unchanged would be encountered . There would still be the bad colored man and the bad colored woman as an incubus to the moral welfare of the community . One may grant that segregation would be both to the industrial and to the moral advantage of the white farmer without admitting that segregation is wise or expedient . Unless the advantages to the white people equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation is a shortsighted policy . The colored tenant who remained in the segregation districts would probably become less trustworthy than ever because he would realize that he was a discredited ele- ment in the community and there would be no inducement to him to raise his station in life . If , on the other hand , the negroes did leave the white community and go off into a district by themselves , from an industrial standpoint they would suffer severely . The negro still sorely needs the example and advice of the white man . This fact is recognized by the negro leaders , one of whom has said that it will take a hundred years for the negro to stand alone . Two communities in the eastern part of North Carolina within thirty miles of each other show the need that the negro has of the advice and example of the white man . In one of these communities there are no large plantations . The negroes have bought small farms alongside the white people and have followed the example of their white neighbors . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are taking a pride in their farms . In the other community the land is owned by a few white men . The negroes have made practically no advancement from the condition in which they were during slavery . They live from hand to mouth the year round and are satisfied if they " come out " at the end of the year . A more shiftless and thriftless lot could hardly be found . This is what would probably follow if the negroes were urged at this time by legislation to settle in communities to themselves . They are not yet ready to stand alone . It must be remembered at all times that these black districts would be parts of the state the same as the white districts , and that the increased productiveness of the white community might be off-set by the diminished productiveness of the colored community and the state , as a whole , might be no better off . The moral life of the negro would suffer more from segregation than his industrial life . Booker T. Washington says , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any community is very much what the white man is . If you find in any community a class of intelligent , high-toned , law-abiding white people , there you will find the negro in some degree trying to follow the example of the white man . If , on the other hand , in any community you find the white man a drunkard , a gambler , carrying pistols , breaking the law , there you will find a larger element of the negroes trying to imitate the white  | race in these respects . " Mr. D. Hiden Ramsey , of this state , who has made a special study of criminality among the negroes , says , " It can not be denied that the increased criminality of the negro is due in a large measure to the increased estrangement of the two races . " Every one of the negro leaders is advising his race to remain on the land and to escape the demoralizing effect of herding in cities . The segregation of the races in the country would , in the first place , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination of segregation , to move to the city . In the second place , the creation of colored districts in the country would give rise to centers of negro vice similar to those which now exist in the city . The effect of segregation by legislation upon the relations between the races would probably be more portentous than that upon the industrial or moral life of either race . Race prejudice would certainly be aroused by the agitation that would be necessary to get an enabling act passed by our General Assembly . The larger landholders of the state , who deserve some consideration even if not as much as the more numerous class of small farmers , would oppose it on the ground that it would interfere with their labor supply . Other white people would oppose it because they would believe it morally wrong in that it would not be giving the negro a square deal . The whole country outside of the South would side with the negro and put the state in the light of having disfranchised the negro in order to perpetrate discriminations against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rural segregation agitation than by any previous legislation . Heretofore race legislation has been statewide . Witness the suffrage amendment , the separate school and Jim Crow laws . But in the case of segregation each community would have to take action for itself . The white farmers of a neighborhood would decide that they would not let any more colored farmers buy land in that neighborhood . Thus the white people and negroes who had been living side by side in amicable relations all their lives would find themselves arrayed in opposing camps . The most bitter feeling in the world is that of one individual against another individual . The next most bitter feeling is that of one family against another , as shown by the Kentucky feuds that last for generations . And the next in the order of intensity is  | a neighborhood hostility . So long as the white people as a race have their feelings aroused against the colored people as a race , this impersonal hostility is not apt to cause any combustion . But when the white people and the colored people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race issue , then a consuming flame of race feeling is apt to start . The truth of this is shown by every race riot and every instance of mob violence in the history of the country . It has started by some individual or some group of individuals doing something to displease the other race . Because segregation would , in the end , be a neighborhood affair , race feeling would be all the more bitter . If segregation meant that the negroes were to be taken bodily out of the community and carried to a place where they would never be heard of any more , the race feeling might be tolerable . But under the suggested plan , the negroes would simply be urged to congregate in a community to themselves lying alongside the white community where the passions of the criminal and vicious element of both races would be fed by the sight of each other . It is a very serious thing to arouse the spirit of hatred and revenge in any person . It is also serious to arouse it in a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst passions of both races by a segregation campaign , let us count the cost and make sure that the benefits of segregation will outweigh the harm that will result from arousing race prejudices . It must be clear to the impartial observer that this plan of segregation involves a policy of repression of the negro in that it is withholding from him an equal showing in the distribution of the land of the state . If the white people are to select the segregation districts , then they will naturally select for themselves the most desirable districts and leave the negro to take the balance . This is exactly what has been done in Roanoke , Va . That city was divided into five segregation districts . Four of those districts were definitely laid off and described by metes and bounds and set apart for the white people . The fifth district , which comprised all the balance of the city that the white people did not want for themselves , was set apart for the negroes . The segregation advocated also involves the policy of neglect .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are not going to give them the benefit of their example and advice . It is an attempt to create , as has been said , a nation within a nation . As the negroes accumulate property and show an inclinanation to develop a community life of their own , they ought to be encouraged . The experience of the negroes at Mound Bayou , Mississippi , shows that they may reach a stage in their development when they are sufficient unto themselves . Mr. W. D. Weatherford in his latest book , Present Forces in Negro Progress , says that two of the present forces in the progress of the negro are the development of race leadership and the creation of race pride . The white people must help to lift the negro from the lower levels of life to the higher levels , " not that he may go into the society of other races , but that he may be fit to associate with himself . " " The true and permanent way to lead the negro race to keep wisely to itself is to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever forced to go outside of itself to touch the broadest and richest life of its generation will never be consciously and finally anchored in the doctrine of race integrity . The true basis of race individuality is not in race segregation , not in race repression , but in race sufficiency . " A child ought to be taken out of the go-cart as soon as it is strong enough to stand alone . But it is heartless for the adult and dangerous for the child to take it out before then . The negro race ought to be encouraged to develop its own leadership and to increase in selfsufficiency ; and voluntary segregation is to be encouraged on this account . But it is dangerous for the race to be left to itself until it knows how to develop the right sort of leaders and appreciate the right sort of race pride . Because I do not believe that the race has yet reached the stage in its development where it can stand alone , I am opposed to the segregation of the races in the country by legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has arisen since Emancipation because it involves fundamental rights . Voting , for instance , is a privilege ; but the right to hold property is inherent in citizenship and should not be tampered with without great caution .  | I am heartily in favor of the next General Assembly 's creating a commission to investigate rural race problems . Such a commission would probably have been created by the last legislature if the bodies urging its creation had not already unanimously committed themselves to the policy of segregation . In other words , they announced their conclusion before they had waited for an investigation . An impartial investigation may show that the white people are not leaving their farms because of the presence of the negro or that segregation is not the best way of reducing race relations to a proper and permanent basis . Let us , therefore , have a complete and accurate diagnosis before we prescribe such a drastic remedy as rural segregation by legislation .
