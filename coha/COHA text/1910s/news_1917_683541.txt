txt The permanence and practical working of the agreement between Secretary LANSING and Viscount Is n't , respecting the relations of Japan and the United States and China , depend upon Vie equal and faithful observations of all its provisions . A misplacing of emphasis might make the agreement a cause for difference and discord instead of that bond of harmony , of friendship , and of mutual interest which we cordially hope it may become . " The Government of the United " States recognizes that Japan has " special interests in China , particu " tarty in the part to which her pos " sessions are contiguous " ? so runs the first structural and important clause of the agreement . Then , immediately following , we find these two self-denying ordinances , equally of the very structure and binding obligation of the covenant : The territorial sovereignty of China , nevertheless , remains unimpaired , and the Government of the United States has every confidence in the repeated assurances of the Imperial Japanese Government that while geographical position gives Japan such special interests they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to disregard the commercial rights heretofore granted by China in treaties with other Powers . The Governments of the United States and Japan deny that they have any purpose to infringe in any way the independence or territorial integrity of China , and they declare , furthermore . that they always adhere to the principle of the so-called " open door " or equal opportunity for commerce and Industry in China . The two provisions must be read together  --  that in which we recognize Japan 's special interest in China , and that in which both Governments pledge themselves to respect the territorial integrity and the independence of China and to adhere to the principle of the " open door , " of equal opportunity for commerce and industry in China . The one must not be put above the other . We may plainly see , and Japan can not fail to see , that this agreement might become a menace to the friendly relations of Japan and the United States if there were any failure on our part or on/ the part of Japan to observe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence of China or the principle of equal trade opportunity . Unquestionably , the agreement has its dangers as well as its advantages . We must remember that China is a sovereign nation . It is a very delicate matter for two nations to execute agreements recognizing the special interests of either in her affairs . Our Monroe Doctrine gives us no special interest in the internal affairs , no shadow of control over the foreign relations , of the other republics of the western world , save in the case of Cuba . The Government of Japan , of couIse , understands that our recognition of its special interests in China concedes no right or authority of that kind over the destinies of the Chinese people , and does not , can not , in any way impair the sovereignty of their Government . If through any misunderstanding of this fundamental fact China , feeling , herself aggrieved , should be forced to appeal to us ' for protection against Japan , or to Japan for protectient against us , the Lansing-Ishii agreement , as we have said , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two parties to it . For our part , we can have no intention of trenching upon the territory or upon . the sovereign rights of the Chinese Republic : We accept this agreement as tinder= engagement en the part of Japan to respect the territory and the sovereign rights of China as we shall respect them , and it is a reassuring pledge , opportunely given at a moment when Germany , the common enemy of the two countries , has been busy sowing the seeds of , suspicion and mischief , deliberately intended for embroilment . The spirit of the instrument is admirable , the spirit in which thliagreemerit was reached was most friendly , and these mutual covenants should remove all causes of difference between Japan ? and the United States , and any anxiety that may have existed on one part or the other concerning the interests of either in China or elsewhere . The agreement will be put to the test , not at once , but when the commerce of . the world resumes its flow in the usual volume and through natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Important . Japan enjoys the very great advantage of nearness to that market , and she will understand that she has no need , in addition to that , of ally policies or methods contrary to the principle of the " open door . " That principle means what it says , and any practice or the use of any influence intended to restrict the free and equal opportunities of any nation trading with China would be contrary to Old- principle and to the understanding . It is necessary that these considerations should be brought into view , and kept steadily in view on both sides , for it must be recognized that the Lansing-Ishii agreement is an exceedingly delicate matter , since it so manifestly involves the interests of a third nation not a party to it . So far as the interests and the relations of the United States and Japan are concerned , the agreement is a good one ; it nullifies hostile efforts to create dissension , it brings the two countries together in mutual and friendly understanding , which the people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
