txt zoo THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY time , the energy and the money of those agencies and individuals that arc at work on behalf of agriculture and country life . The adoption of a policy once more ought to insure a comprehensive program . One needs but to glance at even a superficial outline of the farmer 's problem to realize how little even our agricultural leaders have worked in terms of thorough-going , wellbalanced development . Will Men See the Needs ' Until very recently indeed , there has been almost no discussion in America about an agricultural policy . Indeed responsible officials have asserted very recently that we already have a policy , and evidently believe that there is no need for further discussion of the matter . But the war has raised the issue in a way that will not down . The experience of America 's participation in the war to date has brought home to the farmers and indeed to many of the public agricultural agencies the loss of effectiveness that has come because there has been no authoritative program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the government could rely for an expert and representative opinion concerning the best things to do in agriculture . The evidence that men are beginning to realize the need is found in the fact that a number of different groups are now at work quite independently of each other , endeavoring to formulate an agricultural policy . Unity Impossible . I t may be argued that jealousies both personal and institutional will prevent even the formulating of a policy ; somebody or some group will want the credit for it all . It is pitiably true that the itch for glory often overmasters the passion for service . It is a severe test of human nature when individuals or organizations jump into the arena , carry off the WANTED : A RURAL POLICY ioi prize and claim the credit although , as a matter of fact , most of the solid , substantial thinking and work has been ( lone by others . But just as some part of our education to do things comes by doing them , so the spirit of cooperation is often engendered simply by cooperating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the least of which is that the larger interest of the country and indeed the larger interest of mankind is paramount . There is no Policy Maker . This is true . No one seems to have any authority to make an agricultural policy . No branch of government , no farmers ' organization , no combination of the two , thus far is universally recognized as representative of the most expert knowledge combined with the most representative public opinion . This is precisely one of the problems in an agricultural policy itself . It is , indeed , a part of an agricultural policy to have a group that can make a policy and see it through . A Policy Impossible . It is often remarked that anybody can make a paper plan , and unfortunately we have been far too content with paper plans . Resolutions numerous as the sands of the sea have been passed for fifty years , relative to farmers ' rights and interests . Some of them have been as seed sown in good ground but most of them never come to fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big as agriculture , so widespread , involving so many people , subject to so many fluctuations , it is out of the question to make and enforce the kind of policy , for example that a big manufacturing firm can make and enforce , and we know that even such concerns are obliged to change their policies from time to time . Nevertheless , while we can not change the course of the Mississippi River , we are able // to direct the flow of its waters for good rather than for evil . The mere effort to work together for common ends of itself gathers people together for cooperating effort . The history of every well directed farmers ' organization or public agency proves the value of a policy . The next step is simply to gain the larger cooperation in place of the partial . A Policy Undesirable . There will he those who will go so far as to say that a real policy is undesirable , and they will point to autocratic Germany . They claim that a nation can not have a real policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thing not only impossible in America , but even if it were feasible , would be mischievous because it would make automatons of farmers . Here again we must reach the middle ground of common sense and practicability . ' When we leave the shores of the present chaos of unregarded effort , in agriculture , we do not necessarily seek the haven of enforced militaristic regulation of individual endeavor . We rather seek to enlist the intelligence , the self-interest and the patriotism of the farmers , and the agencies which they have created , in behalf of a well-planned , economic , cooperating , stimulating campaign for improved conditions . /I Policy Essential . We see no escape from the conclusion that the time is upon us when we must make some sort of policy for agriculture . The need of it was apparent in many minds even before the war , but the New Day makes an imperative demand that society shall plan for its future good and plan carefully and intelligently and immediately . It would be tragic were our American farmers and rural agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Whom to Consider . It is exceedingly important in // making a policy to remember the special interests that are to be taken into account . There is a remarkable tendency on the part of people to plan only with reference to themselves or the special interests with which they are concerned . In making the rural policy , we have to regard at least three elements . First of all , there is the individual farmer ; his interests , his tastes , his needs , his capacities , his prejudices are part of the material with which we deal . A whole chapter in this book will be devoted to an attempt to show that the individual farmer , however , can most effectively be reached if he is approached as a member of a small group ? the local rural community . Then we have the associations of farmers . Their names are legion . These more nearly represent the farmers than do any governmental agencies , because they are made up of farmers , who speak the farmer 's language and enforce the farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not always be wise or scientifically sound , but these associations constitute the big factor in agriculture . If there should arise in America any tendency on the part of publicly supported agencies to ignore the power of volunteer association in agriculture ( or to overlook ) its ultimate worth in keeping the farmers a body of sturdy , independent men and women , it would spell the decline of democracy . In the third place , we must remember that the government is constantly enlarging its functions and widening the range of its services . Governmental machinery , therefore , becomes a constantly increasing power ; so if the farmers ' associations ignore the departments of agriculture , national and state , the colleges and experiment stations , the farm bureaus and the schools , they cut off their right hands . Democracy needs ex104 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY perts ; to cast aside the skill , the knowledge , the foresight , the judgment of these specialists , fallible and imperfect as they are , would undermine immediately any attempt to operate a permanent agricultural policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy by itself . Neither the individual farmer nor the voluntary associations of farmers , nor the government itself is sufficient for the task . All must be taken into account and must be brought together . An Agricultural Program and the Food Supply . So far as we know , the first effort in America to outline in conference a program for agricultural activities that took as its starting point the food needs of the time , was made in St. Louis in April , 1917 , under the leadership of Secretary Houston of the Department of Agriculture . ( The major part of the St. Louis statement appears in the back of this book . See Appendix III . ) This statement is not an ideal outline of a rural program . It was not the result of a conference of all the agricultural agencies , but only of a part of them . It was made hastily . It was frankly a war measure . It did not compass the entire agricultural problem . But it was nevertheless extremely significant , so significant that it will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture . Before it was adopted , we had no comprehensive , consistent agricultural program worked out by a responsible group of men and fitted into the food needs of the people . The St. Louis statement was in itself a food supply program ; it was made in conference ; it called for central national committees of both farmers and experts ; it advocated complete machinery , national , state and local , for carrying out the program . It is interesting to note that the machinery urged was in the form of agriWANTED : // cultural councils ? national , state and community , a thing new to our American agriculture . Breadths and Bigness . Last of all , let us observe that a rural policy must be just as big and as broad and as far reaching as is the American rural problem . THE GREAT AMERICAN FARM Let us come back to our starting point . We must think of all the farms of American farmers as really one big farm , and we must endeavor to do just what the good farmer would do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made more efficient and how can the people who do the farming be made more prosperous and happy ? " Once we get firmly in our minds this very simple prescription for the improvement of American agriculture and country life , we will plan for the development of American farming and the welfare of the American farmer and his family , just as if we were dealing with one big farm and one big family . MAKING THE POLICY WORK There are two great forces on which we must rely for the development of an agricultural policy and the working out of a rural program . They are education and organization . Education , used in the broadest sense , must include technical knowledge , ample information as to conditions , grasp of principles and enlightenment as to ends and means , as well as appreciation of broad relationships and of obligations as well as rights . Organization is the cooperation of all the factors , all the institutions , all the individuals and groups that can assist in the forward movement of agriculture and country life . E Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocracy and of all predatory forces . If the people are to he trusted , they must be trustworthy . The recent declaration of the British Labor Party states that " the most important of all the measures of social reconstruction must be a genuine nationalization of education which shall get rid of all class distinctions and privileges and bring effectively within the reach not only of every boy and girl , but also of every adult citizen , all the training , physical , mental and moral , literary , technical and artistic , of which he is capable . " The instincts of the American farmer in this respect are sound to the core . A prominent leader of a great farmers ' organization was recently asked what were the big problems of American farming . Ile put first the securing of an adequate system of education . Repeatedly have the formal utterances of important farm groups and their leaders given the same rank to education ; they recognize the hopelessness of agricultural improvement apart from a widespread , effective educational scheme . The Grange for fifty years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings at every subordinate Grange meeting . It has always upheld the public schools and the agricultural colleges . It has reports of committees on education at io6 // every state and national meeting . It has assisted in developing parents ' and teachers ' associations . Perhaps the characteristic feature of the Grange as compared with other farm organizations is its insistence upon education . This attitude of the Grange is but an expression of the mind of the better farmers . When the farmers began to settle the ' West , they carried the school with them ; it was a part of their community luggage , indispensable at a time when luggage was a burden . The farmers ' own efforts to improve agriculture are based on an abundant faith in education as a prerequisite to all else ? upon the belief that if the farmer is educated all other things will follow ; but that if he is ignorant , there is little chance for real gains . The farmer knows that the mind is somewhat like one of his fields ? cultivation is half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most serious difficulties in adjusting the farmer to the New Day is the fact that rural schools are not keeping step with the needs of the time . Unfortunately , in spite of their belief in education , the farmers themselves block the progress of education all too often , through an unwillingness to make changes in antiquated equipment and systems , or through sheer parsimony in financial support . There is often lack of local enthusiasm and ideals . Farmers in many regions are all too content with what they have . Sometimes they are simply stubborn , desirous of doing as they please and resenting outside advice or suggestions . As one of our agricultural leaders has said , democracy and education oftentimes have been interpreted as being the right for any community to have as poor schools as they choose to have . There are farmYo$ THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY ers who do not realize that the school of yesterday will not answer as the school of to-morrow . Not all of the difficulties in developing the rural schools are to be laid at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supervision is not seldom poor . School officials are often obliged to pay too much attention to politics ; sometimes they endeavor to transplant bodily the city school system to the country . There is no national program of rural education based upon the fundamental relationships between education and rural democracy . We can progress rapidly only when we have a program that is vital and practicable , one that appeals to the farmers and has their support . We need the vision to organize a great national movement in behalf of the rural schools of America . SOME ITEMS OF RURAL SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT The rural schools should be as good as the city schools . They may not teach the same subjects or in the same way , but the country boy and girl in all justice should have opportunities equal to any offered anywhere . Some farmers do not realize how backward many rural schools are . And perhaps some educators do not realize what good results actually come from the better class of country schools . But we can hardly say with truth that the education given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cities . We must insure better teaching ? far , far better teaching . There is an astonishing amount of good teaching in the country schools , but it is really a marvel that it is as good as it is . The majority of rural teachers arc not properly trained . They get very small pay , they stay in the school a very short time . Reforms at these points are fundamental ? higher salaries for betEDUCATION // ter trained teachers , longer periods of employment and the securing of teachers who will become community leaders . The effort to establish the consolidated or centralized school has been going on quite strongly for fifteen or twenty years . The plan itself is making rather slow headway . But wherever " it has been tried , it has proved a success . It is amazing that in many parts of our country the farmers have been so slow to meet the educators half way on this subject . Of course , there are difficulties , bad roads are among them ; because there must be transportation of pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidated school is more costly in money than the old district school system , but it is far more efficient as an educational mill . It permits better supervision and gives a chance for the employment of better trained teachers at a better wage . It allows them to specialize in certain subjects or with certain grades of students . It secures a better course of study and it more easily provides " teacherages " or dwellings for the teachers , and consequently makes the school faculty a part of the community leadership . It makes possible a high school in many communities that otherwise would be deprived of it . Agriculture has been prescribed in some states as a required subject in the grades of the rural schools . It is a useless law and an unfortunate requirement unless it can be taught by teachers trained in agriculture . The reason for introducing agriculture and country life subjects into the average country school is not primarily to educate for agriculture , but to educate by means of agriculture . There comes a time , it is true , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a farmer , he ought to be definitely and thoroughly educated for agriculture . Ho THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY But it would be absolutely mischievous to plan the rural school system on such a basis as to direct all the boys and girls back to the farm and to make it difficult or impossible for them to compete with the city boy or girl in other professions and occupations of life . One reason for introducing agriculture into the grades of the country schools is the educational value of using the surroundings of the pupil as a means of education . Natural scenery , the business of the community , problems of the adults , are the real materials of education . The pupil is to be encouraged to ask questions about these things , to get the meaning of them , to see if he himself has any relation to such questions . It is frequently asserted that the course of study and the text hooks used in the country schools are of such a character that the pupils are becoming interested in the problems of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in the country schools are themselves looking toward the city . This is a sound criticism , but the remedy may be carried too far . An assumption that the schooling of the country boy and girl should merely train for life in the country is disastrous . If one were required to choose between a country school that gave a first class general education , but with no agriculture , and a technical or vocational course without the facilities of a general education , there would he no hesitation in the decision . Far more important than a specialized training for agriculture , is a real , thorough , vital education . Fortunately we need not be obliged to make such a choice , because a really good system of rural education will include an ample amount of training for the business of agriculture , and a good training for farming will not neglect to teach the pupils that man does not live by bread alone . EDUCATION OF RURAL PEOPLE a i i It is sometimes said that the high school is the " people 's college " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools to offer what is to-day regarded as normally the first two years of college work . In some of our smaller cities and larger villages , a very large proportion of the boys and particularly of the girls go on through the high school . It is here , in the high school advantages , that the discrepancy between our city school opportunities and our country school opportunities shows at its worst . The democratic movement everywhere to-day looks toward keeping the boy and the girl in school to the age of i6 rather than of 14 , and there are those who advocate compulsory part time schooling at least up to the age of 18 . The people themselves are beginning to be convinced that it is worth while for each boy and girl to get all the formal organized teaching that is possible as preparation for occupation . But that is not all of it . There is a growing belief among the masses of the people that one of the great advantages of keeping the boys and girls in school for a longer period is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , this calls for vast changes in our high school work . It means that not merely vocational training is to be given boys and girls of the ages of 14 to 18 , but also preparation to help meet the common problems of citizenship . Now if the farmers can not have the advantages that are rapidly coming to the sons and daughters of the so-called working people in the city , agriculture is destined to drop behind slowly but surely . It is an encouraging fact that in many of the larger agricultural sections of our country an unusual proportion of the farm boys and girls go on to high school and even to college . But over against that is the sad fact // that among four-fifths of our farming people , the majority of the boys and girls do not even finish the eighth grade . The New Day demands radical thinking and decisive action on the part of the farmers as well as on the part of educators , concerning the rural school system . Farmers doubtless will object to raising the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the children on the farm . But there are devices that will help to modify the immediate economic disadvantages of lengthened schooling . Among these devices are the part-time school and continuation schools . The extension of the present plan of winter short courses in agriculture offered by our agricultural schools and colleges ought to meet the situation . If we could have a system by which in practically every community in America there were winter schools of four months for farm boys and girls of the age of 16 to 18 ( assuming the school age will be raised to 16 ; otherwise from 14 to 18 ) we would at once take a long step in advance . These schools should be agricultural in character but not confined to agriculture . The farmer and his wife in a rural democracy need all the agriculture and home making education that they can get , likewise need all the possible stimulation to closer thinking about the big problems of work and life . The so-called " practical " farmer , the narrowly vocational education advocate , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most serious failures of our rural school system ? the neglect of education of our youth in the economic and social questions of the time . The New Day will bring these questions to the very front . Indeed , they are the main questions of the New Day . How shall the huEDUCATION // man race better learn to gain wealth , honestly and efficiently and distribute it fairly and at the same time live together in a more friendly way ? Unless these themes are put into the schools , democracy does not get its proper education . Much the same thing may be said in regard to literature , also to art , especially music . How the war has emphasized the value of music as a stimulus to the soldier and how the great movement for community singing that has swept over the country has developed patriotism and common purpose ! It is clear that all these reforms and redirections of our rural school system will cost money , a great deal of money . But we must regard schooling as not a luxury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as a poor schooling , but is worth ten times as much . There is no better scheme of national bargaining than to spend money needed for a good school system . Let us also recognize the fact that these improvements in our rural school system can not be made if the local farm communities are left to do it alone , or if they alone are obliged to pay the bills . The farmers must give up some of their cherished " rights " in respect to the management of the little local school , not because we want an educational autocracy , but because in this day of scientific efficiency all school systems must yield to the management of wise , trained , broadminded experts in education . We need a larger amount of state aid for local schools . The supervisors of our school systems , both county and state , should be taken out of politics at the first opportunity . These educational positions should no more be political in character than the pastorates of the church . It is one of the most mischievous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county 1 14 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY superintendent of schools is better than the other , according to one 's view of political things . It is one of the left-overs of an antiquated attitude toward the management of public affairs by the people . What the people now demand is educational efficiency and not political attachment . They want educational leaders who are not faddists but real experts , who are given both authority and money to carry out wise plans , unhampered by fear of political interferences . It is probable that our city school systems suffer more than do our rural schools from politics . But the evil is a national one in both city and country and ought to be abolished . Furthermore , the time has come for federal appropriations for aid to rural education . Some of our educational leaders are strongly opposed to such a policy . They believe that it looks toward undue centralization and autocracy . There is a widespread tradition that education is purely a local matter . But if this was ever true , it is so no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , desperately a national matter . Is it anything short of a national scandal that when our great army was mobilized , we found so large a percentage of illiterates ? Long since have we discovered that Asiatic cholera is not a concern of San Francisco alone , nor yellow fever of New Orleans alone , nor Spanish influenza of Boston alone , but that any plague spot , no matter how small , is a menace to the entire country . We must cease to think that the failure of any community , large or small , properly to educate its children is a local question . So long as boys and girls have the right to go from one community to another , just so long their education is a national affair . We need a national educational policy with respect to the education of the rural people . We need a strong , well supported national EDUCATION OF RURAL PEOPLE its Bureau of Education . We need a certain measure of federal support for the local rural school . To deprive this school of its initiative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would of course be fatal to its best efficiency . The great gain through federal direction and support of the development of a national policy lies in the opportunity to aid and stimulate the small farming community to give its boys and its girls as good an education as can be obtained in the largest city of the union . A FEW SUGGESTIONS ABOUT AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION During the past fifty years , America has organized a comprehensive system of agricultural education , perhaps in its extent and scope the greatest of any country in the world . There exists an agricultural college in each state , giving both college grade work and short courses for those not desiring to graduate ; schools of agriculture designed for boys and girls under 18 years of age ; a rapidly increasing number of agricultural departments of public high schools ; the teaching of agriculture as a subject in the high schools alongside of algebra and language , and hundreds of thousands of boys and girls working in the agricultural clubs of the various states . A great army is training for agriculture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smith-Lever Act of 1912 , there was established a national system of extension service which endeavors to reach practically every farmer in the land with the best the agricultural colleges can give . As a result of the act , the farm bureau system is emerging and will soon he found in nearly every agricultural county in the United States . The United States Department of // Agriculture is by far the greatest piece of government machinery in the world for gathering and distributing information about agricultural subjects . The Department , together with the experiment stations in each state , constitutes a remarkable group of investigational institutions . It is doubtful if farmers realize or appreciate the extent to which public money is now devoted to the three great methods of agricultural education ? scientific investigation , the training of leaders and specialists , and the widespread dissemination of information . But we have not yet solved the problem . A number of matters ought to be met at once if we are to adapt our system of agricultural education to the New Day . It is highly important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board , department or commissioner of agriculture , and the colleges and schools of agriculture , should be recognized and acted upon . The principle of division is perfectly clear . The real work of a board or department of agriculture is administrative ; that is to say , it enforces laws protecting the farmer or possibly laws regulating his business . It administers the police powers of the state insofar as they are directed toward agriculture . If there is a piece of land development to take place under the authority of the state , its administration should go to the department of agriculture . Whenever the state , through the legislature , attempts to assist the agricultural interests , the administration of those laws belongs to the department of agriculture . On the other hand , the work of the agricultural colleges and schools is educational . All effort to make thorough-going investigations in any field , whether concerned with the soil or with distribution of products or // with country life , belongs to the educational institution . The teaching of students of course is the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to boards of agriculture , but with the rise of the extension service of the colleges and the county farm bureaus , it is clear that their function is also to spread information among all the farmers . This division of labor has been agreed to by representatives of the colleges and the state departments of agriculture . It only remains to carry out the purpose in every state . Mlisunderstandings have arisen and there has been loss of energy and efficiency on account of this misunderstanding . It no longer should prevail . There needs to be wide extension of the system of schools of agriculture , intended to be finishing schools , not schools preparatory for college . Doubtless , the boy graduating at such a school of agriculture should be able to secure further education if he wants it . But we can not have an adequate system of agricultural education unless we have abundant opportunities for training for farming boys below the college age . Indeed , when our system of agriculture is thoroughly developed , by far the larger number of farmers who have studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of agricultural schools . It is to be hoped that agricultural colleges will send out an increasing number of men and women who will seek their living on the farm . But perhaps the most important development that can now take place in our agricultural education consists in increasing very rapidly the number of agricultural schools . If we are to develop a system of agricultural education that will meet the demands of the time , we must very soon secure greater unity in the management of // these various educational agricultural enterprises . A mere listing of these agencies of control suggests the problem . The United States Department of Agriculture is not only in itself a huge educational enterprise but it has oversight of the federal funds spent by the various experiment stations and for teaching in agricultural colleges ; it exercises a great deal of authority in the expenditure of federal money devoted to the extension service . The United States Bureau of Education , which will probably become a cabinet department of education , has by law a certain amount of oversight of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course as a Federal bureau , has a very intimate connection with the entire national system of public education . Our latest piece of educational legislation by Congress is the Smith-Hughes Act which provides for a greatly enlarged plan of secondary education in the industries , agriculture and home making . There is a Federal Board of Vocational Education which has complete charge of the enforcement of this law , supplemented in each state by a similar board . Each agricultural college is managed under a board of trustees , having definite powers granted by the legislature . State boards of education claim an interest in the methods and results of agricultural education simply because they are a part of the system of public support of education . County farm bureaus in at least one state are no longer mere organizations of farmers , but are legally public agencies , supported at public expense . In some states , they are separate schools of agriculture , usually administered under some central authority , either the college of agriculture or the state board of education . Sometimes , however , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // school communities and school boards managing the rural school and sometimes responsible for a rural high school . Now all these agencies deal with agricultural education to a greater or less extent . One of the great needs in our agricultural work to-day is to secure the definite cooperation of all these authorities , in order to make a complete system of agricultural education . This will have to be done by law and it probably will not be done unless the farmers themselves insist upon it in both state and nation . We are not suggesting merging all these agencies into one , but simply the unification of plan and effort for the sake of efficiency . We also need to make a much more extensive and thorough-going plan for the scientific investigation of our agricultural problem . A vast amount of work has been done and is being done to-day . The modern teaching of agriculture has been made possible by the men of science in the experiment stations and the United States Department of Agriculture . This need of enlarged research is particularly evident in the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers have been urging that the problem of distribution is much more important to them than the problems of production ; yet only a fraction of the amount of money spent for investigations concerned with the soil and the plant and the animal has been available for making studies concerning markets and other phases of the distribution question . Research must not stop even here . We need some of the best minds of the time at work on the basic problems of human life as they can be worked out in a farm community . What are the fundamental problems of a rural democracy the world over ? We must train leaders for this rural democ120 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY racy , but they can not be leaders unless they know the issues at stake . Instinctively , we all know that the great aid given by education to the farmer consists in helping him to work out his human problem ? how to take and keep his place in society ? and yet we are short-sighted enough to call the students of these subjects theorists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bigger crops . EDUCATION IN A RURAL DEMOCRACY All these suggestions do not after all reach the main issue . They have been made merely to indicate some of the most important steps that should he taken . But we must . go down to much more fundamental things . We must gain a new conception of the part education is to play in building up our rural democracy . Education is the very life blood of democracy . Democracy can not be efficient , indeed , it can hardly exist apart from education . A democratic education , however , is not achieved merely by compulsory attendance at school ; Germany did all that . Schools easily become mechanical . Our whole system of rural education now needs vitalizing . Education should become the main concern of our democracy . The statesmanship of education is vastly more important than that of any other one feature of democratic society except that of international relationships , and even the latter is founded on genuine and widespread education . The problems of education are little understood by our law-makers . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given too narrow a definition , confined to the idea of schooling for the youngsters . The New Day calls not only for the development of a comprehensive program based upon an adequate naEDUCATION OF RURAL PEOPLE I2I tional policy of rural education and thorough-going cooperation of the different parts of our educational system , but it means education for education . We need a widespread campaign among the people themselves on behalf of the significance and meaning of education in a rural democracy . The farmers are to be trained for their work in its broadest aspects ? production , distribution , conservation . They are to catch a vision of their obligations as well as their rights , ? all of their relations to the world 's food supply , their part in maintaining the fabric of the world . They must rise to the new demands upon the democratic system . They must sense the need of an organization of their forces , both for the sake of self-interest and in order that they may contribute their full share to the solution of our world problems . Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . " The democratic system must assume that its members want culture , want art , want music , want good literature and that they can not only appreciate it but can live and thrive on it . Education should compass the whole range of human interest for the farmer ? work , citizenship , life . Rural education is a matter that goes far beyond the maintenance of a good rural school system or the development of means of agricultural education . These are vital , but they are only parts of the problem . The main task in rural education is to keep the rural democracy forever studying , thinking , discussing , growing . The farmers therefore should back a great movement on behalf of the fullest possible education of our rural people . Our educational statesmen should press for a comprehensive program and take the farmers into their confidence . We have no time to lose . The new world order demands an adequate education of the rural people in every country in the world . r CHAPTER VIII THE ORGANIZATION OF ' AMERICAN AGRICULTURE AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have urged " organization " or " cooperation " as the second of the two essentials to rural progress , and many efforts have been made to organize farmers . The results have not been entirely satisfactory . In earlier days , the aim was to form great farmers ' organizations ? associations dealing with all aspects of agricultural improvement and designed to include the farmers generally , irrespective of the section of the country in which they lived or of the particular kind of agriculture in which they were engaged . The Grange was the earliest and is yet the most typical of these organizations . A secret society , it was frankly patterned after one of the great fraternal orders . It has its rituals , its passwords , its initiations . The Grange movement swept the country , then subsided , and again began a steady but substantial growth . For the past ten or fifteen years , it has more than held its own where at the beginning of the century it had any real foothold . The Farmers ' Alliance sprang up and for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed by the Knights of Labor and the Populist party . Its successor is the Farmers ' Union , patterned in many respects after the Grange but less avowedly pushing its educational and social aims , and frankly ambitious to secure business coopera-I22 // Lion on a large scale . It has a large membership , chiefly in the South and in the West . The American Society of Equity , organized in the Middle West , has for its main purpose the improvement of economic conditions among farmers . Especial emphasis is laid upon equitable returns to the farmer for his produce . Another group of societies , started even before the great farmers ' organizations , are of special interest . These were associations of stock breeders , fruit growers , dairymen , etc . At the beginning they were intended largely for educational or conference purposes and were only to a slight extent business organizations . Many of them are still of this character , but some of the most powerful are frankly engaged in the effort to improve facilities for collective bargaining and even to influence legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collective bargaining , or , as it has usually been called business cooperation , was one of the great objectives of the earlier farmers ' organizations ; but this phase of their work has never been a complete success . Indeed , in spite of many individual instances of successful Grange stores , Union warehouses , etc. , and in spite of the fact that efforts and discussion prepared the way for collective bargaining , there was a vital defect in the plans . Successful collective bargaining on the part of farmers is dependent chiefly upon the ability of a relatively small group of farmers who live near together and grow the same things , to pool their interests in the buying of supplies and in selling the particular products they grow . The Grange and other great farmers ' organizations took into membership farmers who were growing a variety of things and sometimes endeavored to lump all the products together for purposes of sale ; // but the plan never worked well . Moreover , none of these societies actually embraced all the farmers of the community or even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not producers . Identity of interests is the very foundation of collective bargaining ; diversity of interests is fatal to its success . So it has remained for specialized cooperative enterprises such as the California Fruit ( rowers ' Exchange , and more recently a large number of similar efforts , really to set in motion the beginning of a system of cooperative buying and selling among farmers . A New MEANING 70 ORGANIZATION We are beginning to use the word " organization " in a new sense , and this change of definition is exceedingly important . The idea may perhaps be expressed , first , by saying that " organization " is much broader than an organization . Just as we think of education as far more than school and college , so organization is far more than the cooperation of one thousand people or even a million people for some one end . In this book the word " association " is used to describe the various cooperating groups of farmers , and the word " organization " for a different , and we think a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may say that rural organization is the cooperation of all available agencies on behalf of a definite program to improve agriculture and country life and to adjust the interests of farmers to the common good of the nation and of the world . Organization brings to bear upon any problem all the forces that can help solve the problem . Organization is of universal application . An individual can organize his life ; so can a nation ; indeed the war has brought us face to face with the problem of world organization . // A farmer can organize his business so that he gets the maximum use of his capital and his labor , his time and his energy ; only so does the greatest efficiency result . The housewife may follow similar methods in the home . The large association is well organized or poorly organized , depending upon whether it uses the powers tied up in it by reason of people cooperating , or whether it fails to develop a big plan and to get everybody working to carry out the plan . Schools , colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well organized or poorly organized , according to the extent to which they succeed in gaining the intelligent cooperation of all the elements available for attaining their ends . It is organization in this newer meaning of the word , supplementing education , that holds the key to the success of the farmer in the New Day . Let us consider briefly some of the more important applications of the principle of organization to rural affairs . I. THE BETTER ORGANIZATION OF EXISTING AGENCIES Each institution or associated effort devoted to rural improvement should seek the highest possible efficiency . It needs to take an account of stock and to discover whether the New Day makes new demands upon it . The great established institutions like the school , the farmers ' organizations , the church , and government itself , must still be the main reliance of rural effort , now and for all time , but with a new sense of social responsibility that will call for vastly increased effort and possibly almost complete . reconstruction . Each institution therefore needs to seek the most efficient organization for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important institution settles down to a contentment with its methods and its results . It should be as ambitious as the most ambitious youth , for maximum efficiency and thorough-going organization . It should always be for progress , always anxious to be in the front line trenches . It should never stand still . No matter how glorious its past may have been , it should constantly look forward to new achievement . Not what it has done , but what is next for it to do , is the main concern . What are the steps by which each one of these various institutions can become better organized ? There are perhaps four of these steps which may be mentioned but not elaborated . i . All institutions tend to concern themselves disproportionately with their methods and working details and to overlook the real ends or purposes for which - they are supposed to exist . The most searching selfquestioning on the part of every rural institution is now in order . What is its task or function ? How can it most fully help the farmer ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each institution should clearly define its own task . This seems a simple enough matter . But very few agencies have tried to do it . They have general notions about what they are to do , but they tend to spread themselves widely and often to disregard the work of other agencies . Lack of aim results in loss of power . The fundamental need is for each institution to ask itself what is the main purpose of its establishment , what is its part in rural improvement , what are the real reasons for its existence . 2 . Each institution should develop an adequate policy . What are the fundamental principles upon which // its efforts should be based ? What sort of program is practicable at the present time for the purpose of carrying out these principles ? How can this institution best perform its task ? What are the methods , devices , plans that will be most effective ? Each institution should have a program composed of a series of definite objectives , together with lists of methods worth trying in order to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , will be different in its application to different parts of the country and even to different communities in the same state or county . It can not be a hard and fast outline of methods for the local community , but it ought to be suggestive and helpful ? devices that have been a success . A so-called program may be merely a piece of writing which anybody with a facile pen can evolve . A real program is hammered out of the thought and experience of the people who are doing the work , and has the advantage of keeping before them something clearcut and definite , something that they can come back to every little while and check up in order to discover whether they are making progress . 3 . How can each institution cooperate with other associations and institutions in order to avoid duplication of effort or misunderstanding of purpose ? How may this institution participate in the great getting together , the larger cooperation that is evidently essential to rural efficiency ? This is a hard test . Institutions as well as individuals are subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most conspicuous examples of this fact is in a community having four or five small struggling churches , when one good strong church would fully suffice . Some of the most unchristian things that // the angels have to witness occur under these conditions . The only solution is the spirit of community service overcoming the spirit of group pride . 4 . Each institution must in some measure train its own leaders . Relying upon schools and colleges to furnish formal instruction , the agency itself needs to determine the sort of men and women it will have in its personnel . Particularly will it seek to develop all latent leadership within its ranks . U. ' HIE ORGANIZA'T'ION of AGRICULTURE BY SUB-INDUSI'RIES Perhaps the most important single step in the organization of American agriculture is the organization of sub-industries or producing groups . By sub-industries is meant wheat growing , cotton growing , apple growing , dairying and so on . This feature of rural organization , so characteristic of agriculture in Europe , has not gone very far in the United States . In the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , were educational in character . Later there grew up quite highly developed associations of breeders of various kinds of pure bred live stock . Their purposes were not always clearly defined but among them that of pushing the sale of their particular breed of stock was prominent . In some parts of the country the dairymen are becoming organized . There are several associations of grain growers and producers of beef cattle that are doing vigorous work . But as a rule the field of effort of these organizations is limited . Perhaps the nearest approach to a complete organization of a sub-industry or a group of sub-industries is found in the work of the California Fruit Growers ' Exchange , through which the citrus fruit growers of Cal- // ifornia have developed an enormous cooperative business . All the other producing groups should get together in similar fashion ? the wheat growers , the cotton growers , the corn growers , the butter makers , the market milk producers , and all the rest . What are the main advantages of organizing sub-industries ? 1 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a premium put upon intensive study and experiment on the part of producers themselves . The principles worked out by scientific investigators and the experience of other producers gradually coalesce in skillful management . Good farmers will always make the best effort , but if each man depends upon himself alone , the chances are that he will never get the best results . 2 . Collective bargaining either in buying or in selling is practically impossible except by those who have identical industrial interests , that is , by those who have the same things to sell . They can pack them in the same way and give them a trade mark . 3 . Protection of farmers , whether through insurance or protective legislation , is best gained when the combined efforts of those who have similar needs are pooled for the same purpose . Groups of producers of similar products , as a rule , have similar problems . 4 . The educational possibilities in this type of organization are exceedingly important . Education is a public function , but unless the work of the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the public money devoted to education is only partly justified . A group of individuals interested in the same business can study all phases of the business much better than any one individual can do it . More130 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY over in large , well-organized industries , the farmers will employ their own experts , not to take the place of the government specialist but to supplement and enforce the teachings of the schools . s . To some extent an industry thus organized can control production , so that within certain limitations of climate and heat , a group of producers may be enabled to put upon the market the amount of product needed at prices that will give the majority of producers a reasonable return . Competition between regions in the same industry may be reduced , even if not eliminated . The orange growers of Florida and California ; the apple growers of Oregon and Maine ; the dairymen of Vermont and New York are competitors rather than cooperators . When each of these industries is fairly organized the country over , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNIT IS THE BASIS OF GOOD INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION This statement is the alphabet of cooperative business organization . It virtually means the establishment of a cooperating group of farmers living fairly near together ; in other words a community of farmers engaged in similar production . One farmer may grow half a dozen products ; so consequently he will belong to half a dozen groups . A farmers ' exchange may handle a variety of products , but it can do so profitably only as it is enabled to specialize in each product sufficiently to secure all the gains that come from concentration of effort . There is still an ambition on the part of those who seek the organization of farmers to do something big , to have a huge membership , to cover wide territory . // 1 tion or dealing with huge corporate interests , a large overhead organization of farmers is necessary . The New England Milk Producers ' Association is a widespread organization , with a large membership and an ample treasury , and has been a veritable godsend to the New England dairy farmers during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness of such an organization among milk producers anywhere can be assured only when there exists a multitude of local dairymen 's clubs or associations which , indeed , include practically all the individual dairymen in each community . The " local " is the strength of any associated effort . The local farmers ' exchange , the local egg circles , the local apple growers ' association , the local Grange , the local school , the local church ? these are the very bedrock of permanent and effective organization of rural agencies . The overhead organization should not be composed of individuals but should be a union of federation of locals . Local unions may be combined into district unions ( not on a county basis unless the county forms a natural marketing area ) , state unions and national unions . There may also be regional unions . III . ORGANIZATION FOR OBJECTIVES This is a very important phase of organization , although at first thought it may not interest the farmers . It means simply cooperative effort to reach some definite aim by bringing to bear upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the form of a " drive " for getting all the farmers in a certain apple growing region to spray fruit trees , or to increase production of a certain crop . Or it may be a little more ambitious , taking the form of what might be called a " development // campaign " ; as for clean milk or for rural health . It is in reality a program for a definite goal that has to be participated in by a good many agencies and many kinds of services performed . For example , in a dairy campaign , there should be plans for scientific research , bringing up the quality of dairy cattle , or better methods of dairy farm management , or a system of milk distribution that is valuable to the . farmer , or advertising the food value of milk . Proper laws should be passed and administered . No one agency could do all this work , for i t i s partly educational and partly administrative . I t means a combination , on some well defined plan , of the milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agricultural college and the farm bureaus , the state board of agriculture , and the United States Department of Agriculture . It may be desirable also to organize the main fields of agricultural effort , such as production , distribution , country life , political interests , because each one of these groups has special problems and cooperative interests . It is probably clear to all that in organizing for objectives there must be the leadership of some agency or group which will take the initiative in bringing together all the agencies that will play a part in the work . The whole program must be mapped out , an effort made to find out just what needs to he done , what each agency can do and how they will all work together for the common end . IV . ORGANiZATION BY REGIONS Prior to our entrance into the war , comparatively little attention had been paid to the thorough organization of the food production in any given region as a unit , , q // Neither in community , county , state or nation had there been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after war was declared , there came into being a multitude of food production committees . In nearly every state in the Union , probably in a very large proportion of the agricultural counties of the country and in thousands of local communities , these committees appeared . This organization by regions , illustrated in the war emergency plans , is perhaps the most important phase of rural organization and should be made permanent . The idea of regional organization has wide applications . 1 . The Individual Farmer . No one needs to argue with the good farmer about the importance of organizing his business . Skillful farm management is the acid test of good farming and is probably to-day the big outstanding need of our agriculture as it relates to the efficiency of the individual farmer . American agriculture will be fully efficient only when every one of our seven millions of farmers becomes a good manager . Organization is the secret of farm management ; it secures a union of forces in the most effective way to get the results the farmer wants . 2 . The Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm applies to the home . To those who have given the matter little thought , an argument for organizing the home may seem to be impracticable . It is not only practicable , but vitally important that each home shall do its share , serve its purpose , in the best way . This is not a mere private matter as some suppose , but one of the utmost consequence to the welfare of farmers and of the nation . The secret of a fine home is the right spirit and atmosphere ; without these organization is futile . But in the best sense , organiza134 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY tion , management , skillful handling are what make the home effective . Organization is not a cold-blooded piece of efficient machinery . Good organization takes into consideration the human factors , and in the home a large part of the management of organization consists in the tact and affection and vision of the home maker . 3 . The Neighborhood . The National Council of Defense recently issued a nation-wide appeal for the organization of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come from this effort . But it is a very grave question as to whether so small a group as live in a school district or farming neighborhood can be organized effectively , although there is no reason why such neighborhoods should not cooperate in every way possible for their common interests . 4 . The Local Community . Here we come to one of the most important matters connected with rural improvement . The organization of the local farming community is in some ways the biggest single enterprise for the farmer in the New Day . This is so significant that we shall devote considerable space to it . It means the effort to persuade all the people and all the local associations and agencies of the community to pull together for the common good . By " community " is meant that local area , not always clearly defined , which has or may have its own school and church and organizations , a region large enough to organize well and small enough so that everybody may become acquainted . 5 . The County or District . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts could be set apart for organization purposes , based on the presence of a central market town . But the advent of the // county farm bureau has probably fixed for all time the county unit of organized endeavor . The county has some advantages . There is a good deal of county patriotism throughout the United States . The county is the smallest effective political unit in most parts of our country . The movement to organize agriculture on a county basis is making rapid headway . 6 . The State . No state in America has ever developed a consistent and comprehensive agricultural policy or unified effort to get the maximum results for its agriculture . Yet that is merely the business-like thing to do . Each state ought to take stock of its resources in agriculture , of its possibilities and its needs , laying out a definite program for improvement , and then seeking to bring together all the different public and voluntary associations that will make the achievement of the program possible . It is strange that we have not done this before . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the statesmanlike method and that it must be done if we are to get full effectiveness in our agriculture . 7 . Groups of States . There are certain groups of states that have many things in common . The South , for example , both because of the likeness of its products and its historic unity , seems a natural region for cooperation . The New England states form a natural unit . The Rocky Mountain states have much more in common with each other than they have with any other part of the country , by reason of possibilities of irrigation and of dry farming . The so-called crop " belts " such as the corn belt , the wheat belt , sugar beet belt and the cotton belt , form less distinctive but nevertheless important regional interests . It would be a great gain to American agriculture if the whole country were di136 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY vided into six or eight of these natural regions or zones in which the economic problems of the farmers are similar . This process has already developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has unified her agricultural enterprises to a considerable degree . The South has probably made greater progress in agriculture in the last 15 or 20 years than has any other part of our country , and we believe it is due partly to the organized endeavors of the southern people as a group . 8 . The Na/ion . This is the culminating form of rural organization as applied to a region . It simply means , as has been said before , that we should regard the seven million farms of the country as one big farm , and the seven million farmers as one big family . The farmer can not play his part in the New Day unless American agriculture as a whole is thoroughly organized , with adequate policies and programs and with machinery for securing the cooperation of all concerned . This , too , will be the subject of a chapter by itself . 9 . Urban and Rural . We must find a method by which the industrial and commercial interests of the city may strike hands with the interests of the farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in the proper relation one to the other and secure their fullest cooperation . to . The World . The idea of a world organization of agriculture is not new . Its first prophet was David Lubin , who planned the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome . The war has made imperative what to many before the war seemed like a dream . We shall be obliged to recognize the world 's interest in the control and use of the land as a source of food supply . The land problem in Russia is the fundamental problem of Russian democracy . Russia is rural , of course ; but // the land problem in England which is urban is almost equally important . We can no longer think of agriculture in a purely national sense . The farmers of the world must meet the New Day in the spirit and effectiveness of world-wide organization . IS THERE A PLACE FOR THE GENERAL FARMERS ' ASSOCIATIONS ? This is a question that will interest many thousands of farmers belonging to these great organizations . The answer is in the affirmative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , high aims and aggressive programs should not have a most important place in rural welfare . But as the organization of sub-industries develop , it would seem as if the principles of these great organizations should be very clearly defined and every effort made to fit in to the activities of other associated groups . For example , if the wheat farmers and cotton farmers and stock farmers are thoroughly organized , just where will the Grange come in ? Does not its mission lie very largely in the fact that it is a sort of fraternity , a family of families , comprising men , women and children , and that its educational and social teachings are probably its greatest assets ? There is no reason , however , why the Grange should not play the part it has in the past ? a great part in securing better conditions for farmers . So also with the Farmers ' Union . And while the existence of the great farmers ' organizations is highly desirable , there is no doubt but it is difficult , if not impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so large , the intermingling of the masses of farmers in the different sections is so nearly impossible , the special needs of the different regions differ so // greatly , the presence of competing needs is so diverse , that an organization that would actually enlist in its active membership a large majority of our seven million farmers is practically out of the question . SHOULD WE HAVE AN AGRARIAN ORGANIZATION ? By agrarian organization is meant a farmers ' association designed to look after the special interests of farmers , possibly to resist the demand of other classes . In this sense , of course it is unfortunate that farmers have to organize . Such procedure incites class consciousness , develops a struggle for class interests . Nevertheless , if a great group of industrial workers like the farmers does not guard its own interests through organization , it is likely to suffer . It is possible , therefore , that there ought to be in America what might be called a fighting farmers ' organization . But we are inclined to believe that the most effective fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , for the reason that the producers will have very definite problems and difficulties . Each group , it is true , has its special interests to look after . Nearly all efforts on the part of farmers to influence legislation arise out of some economic need . Therefore , it would seem as if the organization which deals with the business of the great sub-industries would be the one best adapted to secure legislation . If questions arise that interest a large number of producing groups , the various producers ' associations can act together . CERTAIN PROPOSITIONS CONCERNING RURAL ORGAN-IZATION 1 . Organization is the only way to full efficiency . We have had a planless agriculture . We find serious // overlapping of activities on the part of different agencies . We find also serious overlooking of vital needs by these same agencies . Sometimes there is real friction , misunderstanding , and consequently a waste of time , money and effort in duplicated endeavor . Good organization would avoid these defects . 2 . Rural organization must be of the cooperative , not of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was purchased at the expense of the individual . Cooperative or voluntary organization is not so effective in detail as the military or compulsory form , because all the people will not voluntarily cooperate all the time for all purposes . The only way to do it is by making an army of them . But there are manifest advantages in voluntary organization . The genius of democracy is cooperation and not compulsion . 3 . Good organization does not submerge the individual ; it enlarges him . It may subordinate him to the common good , and it ought to do so . It says that no one individual and no small group of individuals shall fatten at the expense of the rest . Organization recognizes that the individual at his best is the most effective force for the common good ; that people are the vital factor rather than machinery or methods of organization . Organization seeks , therefore , to make each individual the most effective possible , but effective both for his own good and for the common good . Moreover , under ordinary conditions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of an effective organization , so that good organization is really and fully democratic . 4 . Organization eventually reduces rather than multiplies the number of associations , because it demands // the utmost efficiency of each agency and finds no place for useless effort . 5 . Organization of the voluntary type can never be exact or complete , in the sense of a machine-like order or thoroughness , but it can be better than that , for it can inspire each man and each group to do its best for the common good in cooperation with all the rest . 6 . All schemes of organization must leave place for new groupings , or soon we have a close corporation . Each new effort to organize must justify itself by its effectiveness , by demonstrating that it has a mission to perform . 7 . Collective bargaining is the most pressing single problem in rural organization at the present time . It has been often said that business cooperation in agriculture will come only as the result of dire necessity . This is true , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm instead of into cooperation ; farmers may give up in discouragement rather than go to the trouble of organizing for business ends . It is possible , although still difficult , to organize farmers who are making a fair profit , if they feel that they are not getting a square deal and could do better by organization . Collective bargaining requires intelligence , confidence in the idea of cooperation , and complete loyalty ? these must be added to mere necessity . One of our greatest difficulties in agricultural business cooperation has been that the abler farmers often hold aloof . Necessity is the mother of business cooperation . Is the new demand for an organization of the world 's food supply a sufficient necessity to spur the farmers of America to thorough-going organization for collective bargaining ? // 8 . The organization of country life interests is vital . Welfare is more than wealth . 9 . All efforts to organize American agriculture should relate themselves to an effort to organize world agriculture . 1o . Organization is supremely in need of leadership , both the expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , aggressive leadership of successful farmers and their wives . i CHAPTER IX THE MAKING OF . RURAL COMMUNITIES THE COMMUNITY IDEA " We propose meeting together , talking together , buying together , selling together , and , in general , acting together for our mutual protection and advancement . " Declaration of Purposes of the Grange . THE spirit of this quotation , extended to all the people of a farming locality , is the community spirit . Togetherness rather than aloneness is the community idea . A true community includes the interests of every one living in the community ? old and young , native and foreign , wise and foolish . The community idea assumes that every soul belongs to the democracy . It is based on the recognition of the rights of each individual , even the humblest , combined with the duty to neighbors that is the obligation of each , even of the strongest . But the community idea assumes more than that . It holds that the unit of interest is the common interest of all , not merely the combined individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to compromise the desires of a hundred individuals each seeking chiefly his personal welfare , and trying to bring the separate items of personal welfare into one program of common advancement ? much the same difference that exists between bringing separate rings of iron into a pile and welding separate links into a chain . One is accommodation ; the other is brotherhood . The 142 // core of the community idea , then , as applied to rural life , is that we must make the community ? as a unit , an entity , a thing ? the point of departure in all our thinking about the rural problem and in its local , practical application the direct aim of all organized efforts for improvement or redirection . The building of real local farm communities is perhaps the main task in erecting an adequate rural civilization . Here is the real goal of all rural effort , the inner kernel of a sane country-life movement , the moving slogan of the campaign for rural progress that must be waged by the present generation . BUT WHAT IS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamlet . A mere collection of people dwelling in houses somewhat near together or within easy reach of one another does not constitute a community . Neighborhood life is important and neighborhood spirit vital . But a " neighborhood , " as most American farmers understand the term , is not likely to be a true community . The New England states teach us some lessons in rural organization . The " town " ? or as it is better known in other parts of the country , the township ? forms a natural community . New England was settled by communities , or groups , or towns . When people decided to seek new homes they went as a community and formed a new town . Each town had its church ? and it is interesting to remember that the members of the church and the members of the political town had to be the same people . Each community had its school and its political or governmental life . Each New England town became a little democracy . It governed itself to a very large degree . It planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own affairs . Notice the use of the pronoun " it " not " they . " For this town was a real unit , a sort of social person ; it was not a mere collection of people , who happened to live near one another . Even to-day in the old-fashioned town meeting , the moderator ? the presiding officer ? announces that the town votes so and so or the town evidently wishes to do this or to do that . 1 le does not say " the people of the town , " rarely " the voters of the town , " but " the town . " The I ownship as a Community . The western township is an arbitrary affair , purely a matter of a survey , and has no relation whatever to natural groupings of farmers . In many cases the township has a substantial village near the center which if on a railroad forms the market and trade point for the people of the town . This village often becomes the real center of the township and makes it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such center and the people find that their church life , the schooling of their children , their business interests , go in diverse directions . In such a case the township is not at all a community and it is difficult to make it one . The Team Haul . It has been rather wisely suggested that the team haul might determine the area of a rural community , for the reason that the teams haul products to whatever center the farmers actually find most convenient ; consequently , this center becomes a natural gathering place around which cluster at least the business interests of a group of farmers . The social and educational and recreational interests of a group of farmers , however , often lie out in the country , while their trading interests lie in some neighboring village or " town . " // The Consolidated School District . The consolidated school district seems almost the ideal area for a true community , not mainly nor perhaps even chiefly because we are to think of the consolidated school as the one community center , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse will be so located as to serve the interests of that group of farmers who support the school and who therefore are rather accustomed or at least will soon become accustomed to thinking of themselves as having common interests . The location of the school is sometimes in the open country , but often in a small village ; in either case , it is not at all unlikely that it may be found near a prominent church , Grange hall , elevator or creamery . The consolidated school district , therefore , forms more nearly a natural community area than any other district except the New England town . The North Carolina Plan . A law has been passed in North Carolina which makes it possible for a group of people to organize afresh a legal community much like the New England town . The possibilities of this sort of legislation are extremely interesting , because such communities can be definitely planned and not left to chance . The Practical Step . But how shall we really determine the boundaries of the local community ? We have these various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a practical convenience , we would urge the use of the township wherever there is nothing immediately at hand that is better . When the Grange was organized fifty years ago , it had to face just this question ? what should be the " jurisdiction " of the local or subordinate Grange ? The plan adopted was generally to take the township as the unit . Departures have // been made from this principle , but as a rule it will be found that a subordinate Grange draws its members substantially from a single farming township . This plan has worked well and if it serves the Grange , it ought to be satisfactory in the larger cooperation which is to be found in the organization of a real rural community . Where a township can not well constitute the area of a community , it can be made by mutual agreement , acting through county farm bureaus or some other overhead organization . The main thing is to set apart a region or an area big enough so that the farmers having similar interests may maintain those interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own churches , their own schools , their own business agencies . Yet this community must be small enough so that the members of the community can all come together , not occasionally but frequently , to discuss their common interests and to enjoy themselves as one big family . A community can be in a measure self-supporting . It may stand on its own feet . It may learn to act as one man in common concerns . Therefore , it must not be so big as to destroy this common interest nor so small that it can not support the organizations and agencies through which society is accustomed to work . Community Methods IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT The individual farmer does not lose his identity through the application of the community idea , for it has nothing in common with " communism " or " collectivism " or " socialism " as those words are ordinarily understood . It is simply a more intensive and better developed form of rural cooperation than we have ever known . It takes the idea underlying the Grange , the cooperative idea that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and applies it to all the people of a natural group , not merely to a few selected members . Therefore the community idea can be applied to nearly every aspect of the work and life of farmers . THE COMMUNITY IDEA IN PRODUCTION Farmers are in the habit of talking of their plans , of exchanging experiences , of discussing new methods , of aiding one another in times of labor shortage . Now let us press this practice a little farther , organize it a little more completely , and we shall have the community idea applied to production . Thus we can " socialize " production . All students of the subject agree that we would make a great gain in our agricultural production if we could localize and standardize production . Can we persuade the farmers of a given natural community to grow just what they can grow best , and to grow nothing else , to grow the best of the kind that can be grown and of fairly uniform character and quality ? If this were done , the land of the community could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the more easily he adopted because all the farmers would seek exactly the same ends . This localizing of production takes advantage of the habits and tastes of the farmers of the community , the traditions of their farming skill and makes use of all their experience . Community production is not widely practiced , but it is by no means an entirely new or theoretical subject . For instance , a community in Wisconsin ships many thousands of dollars ' worth of Holstein cattle each year through an annual sale . The Holstein breeders ' association pays for the advertising . The purpose of the breeders ' association is to improve the native cattle by // the use of pure bred sires , all of the same breed , and also to put their business on a more substantial basis through cooperation . It has educational advantages as well as enabling breeders to cooperate in buying and selling . The development of many of the great breeds of pure bred live stock owe their origin and development to community breeding . This is true of Jersey , Guernsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apple growers of Hood River Valley , of the Rocky Ford melon growers , of the potato growers of Greeley , Colo. , are all illustrations of the advantages gained when an entire community devotes its energy to that definite line of production for which it is best adapted . This principle is recognized by manufacturers , and we have shoe cities and automobile cities and jewelry cities . It is difficult to exaggerate the advantages that accrue when a community of farmers sets out to bring production to this common basis , each farmer seeking to do his best and all working together along a common line . Community production does not mean that a given community will grow only one crop ? it will grow whatever crops can be best grown in that community , but whatever it does grow will be pushed to the limit . Standards will be set up . Quality will be sought . There is a common purpose and a common gain . Farm Management . Even in the matter of farm management ? apparently a very individual affair ? the most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve methods . Extension workers in farm management have already found that if they make a survey of all the farms in the community , they will find that certain farms are below the average in their labor and income . This is the significant point . // The farmer , like other people , is obliged to think in terms of his immediate surroundings and experiences , and if he finds that he is running behind the general average of neighboring farmers , he realizes that there is probably something wrong with him . This definite community of experience aids the less efficient to become more effective without in any way pulling down the more efficient . It helps to bring all the farmers to a higher level of effectiveness . Seed Selection . The individual farmer can , of course , select his own seed , but is more likely to do it carefully if there is a sentiment in his community which demands of each farmer the selection of the best seed and its careful testing . Indeed , a community of farmers may well select one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and test seed corn for the entire community . If this principle were generally applied , we would soon find a great group of farm experts living right on the land and serving their local communities in a most practical fashion . Use of Power . One of the greatest handicaps of the average American farmer , has been the absolute necessity of his making an increasing use of machinery and the relatively enormous expenses of getting it . Farm machinery has become indispensable and yet every business farmer as well as every authority on agricultural economics deprecates the large expenditures which farmers have to make for expensive machinery , most of which is idle for eleven months in the year . The theory that farm machinery can be owned cooperatively and used cooperatively often breaks down in practice . There are many difficulties , but there is not the slightest doubt that greater efficiency r5o THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY could be gained if communities of farmers would plan together for the most effective use of machinery . It is very likely true that one farm tractor will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly one threshing machine will do the work for many farms . It is not necessary that the community as a business corporation should own and control this machinery , although even that is not merely a dream . But it can at the very least decide as a community that it will economize in farm machinery , and the community , as a unit , can make a contract with an individual to do the threshing of the community , or with several owners of tractors to do the plowing for the community . These things are actually being done here and there . They simply need to be organized , systematized , to get the greatest efficiency . Power . Farmers were using power generated by gasolene to an extent unbelievable a few years ago . In the future , the use of electricity upon the farm will prove one of the great gains that the years will bring . But it is doubtful whether the farmers can get electric power as cheaply or as generally as they ought to have it if they treat the matter purely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he developed by communities ; at the least the community as a unit can make far better contracts for power than any individual can make . Labor . The labor problem in the United States , serious before the war , has become acute . It will be one of the farmer 's greatest difficulties for many years to come . The individual farmer will employ his own labor and manage it . Yet the labor supply for agriculture will be more and more a matter of organization , THE COMMUNITY IDEA of successful competition with other industries , and therefore it will have to be treated more and more as a community affair . There is no other way out . Accounts . It may appear rather chimerical to some , but we may find the community idea extremely successful in a field that at first seems to be purely a question for the individual farmer , namely , that of keeping accounts . Theoretically , every intelligent farmer believes in the value of a good system of bookkeeping and accounting , but nine out of ten of these same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time , the labor , the annoyance involved in any thorough system are almost prohibitive . Why not put accounts on a community basis ? The community accountant might be an employee of a local bank or the business agent of the local cooperative system , or a farmer 's daughter who has the training and the time . Rules safeguarding the privacy of accounts could easily be made . The farmer would turn in his slips of record and results would be tabulated and returned to him . When divided among a community of reasonably prosperous farmers , this would not be at all an expensive affair . What is referred to here is not so much the routine business connected with buying and selling and paying bills ? the private accounts ? as it is that form of accounting which determines the profits or losses of the farm business as a whole or of any part of it . True accounting , as applied to farming , means a method by which the farmer can account for or understand what is actually happening to him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of farm business . // THE COMMUNITY IDEA IN DISTRIBUTION It is not necessary to take so much space to discuss the community idea in distribution as it was in the case of production , because most farmers have the feeling that it is impossible to cooperate effectively in production , whereas they are fast learning not only that collective bargaining is essential to agricultural profit but that the local farmers ' exchange or cooperative society is the very core and center of successful business cooperation . ' his local group of farmers constituting the farmers ' exchange is practically a community from the standpoint of business . Selling the Product . Efficiency in selling farm products requires first of all a standardizing of goods . This is gained through some common high standard of quality , through the use of best varieties , proper grading , and scientific , honest packing . Successful fruit growers often have individual trade marks , but the device has been adopted by very few individual farmers . Each community that specializes in its products can have a trade mark , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any other single item in the sale of any commodity ; but the great need is for collective bargaining in making sales . The old Kansas farmer who , as the story goes , held back his wheat in order to corner the market and bring a rise in price was just as successful as any other farmer who allows himself to become , as an individual , a bargainer with a great organized market . It is not necessary to put the middlemen behind prison bars in order to get justice at this point ; it is purely a matter of better business . A farmer with Soo bushels of potatoes to sell certainly is at a disadvantage as compared with a community // with 5,000 bushels . The buyer who can afford to disregard the individual with his small crop can not ignore an entire community . He is willing to make terms with a community when he would browbeat the individual . The Core of Cooperation . At the risk of repetition , let it be said once more that the local community is absolutely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the wisest and most successful leaders in business cooperation in this country says on this point : " It is fundamental that the unit of each agricultural industrial organization formed to distribute and sell farm crops or for other business purposes must lie in a comparatively small area . The members must be well acquainted with each other , their aims must be similar , and they must grow products of similar quality and character if they are to succeed when associated with one another . It is equally important that the membership be a stable one and that the farm lands are not frequently changing hands , a condition which often operates against the success of the cooperative movement in the newer sections of the country . If the products vary widely on account of differences in the soil , in climate , or other environmental conditions , the grades are not uniform and the producers can not easily be held in a common organization . The efforts that are frequently made to have a single organization cover a wide territory are , therefore , not likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each rural community and each individual should retain its individuality to the greatest possible extent , that it should not have local pride and ambition stifled by too general a mixture with other sections , and that it should be encouraged to build up a local reputation for its products that distinguishes it from other communities . " 1 // All the European experiences in a dozen countries for nearly half a century of successful business cooperation are a demonstration of the same fundamental practices . That is the rock on which the early efforts at business cooperation in America foundered , and unfortunately many enthusiastic and right-minded friends of the farmer and even farmers themselves , still have the vision of a great comprehensive scheme of business cooperation by which thousands of farmers , acting as a unit , can by the very pressure of numbers and power , make successful bargains . Every such effort breaks down of its own weight unless it is founded upon a multitude of little pillars , each pillar a solid block consisting of a well managed local unit . Some Well-known Illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of many institutions . Probably there is not a leader of the Grange or Farmers ' Union leader in America who does not admit that the local is the strength of the organization . All overhead machinery in the form of county or state or national organizations is an attempt to conserve and strengthen local effort . All cooperative power springs from the local organization and flows back to it . The same is true of the country church , of the country school . The strength of these institutions is to he found in the local church or in the local school . We may have a great church organization or a great rural school system , but it is a rope of sand , in either case , except it be composed of successful local efforts . We need the federation or union of locals for the sake of large policies and unity of endeavor , but the actual work is always done by the local . Community Industries . This idea may be also applied to local industries . There are many farming // communities , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farming region , and which would be greatly advantaged through the development of certain local industries . It is not unthinkable that the labor supply in some regions may be secured through the development of such industries as electric power , employing labor which will be available for the farmers during the summer . Certain small manufactories use up the surplus or otherwise waste products of the neighboring farmers and thus are an advantage to everybody . But these things have to be planned for and , as a rule , this will be done only when the community as a whole takes action . Rural Credit . Credit may be made largely a community affair instead of merely an individual matter . Probably the one outstanding fact gathered by the American Commission which went to Europe in 1913 to study agricultural credit and cooperation , was expressed by the former Premier of Italy , Luzzatti , when he said : " We have capitalized character . " That is , a community of farmers of very moderate means , if they know one another and are willing to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on far better terms if they act together , than the different individuals in that community can do if each acts alone . There is an irrigated valley in the West in which the farmers own property probably worth ten million dollars . Yet each individual is obliged to borrow money on the best terms he can get as an individual . The farmers of this valley are really or may become practically a unit , a corporation . As such , they should be able to borrow strictly in accordance with good business terms all the money they need for improvements or for making the crops . They can do it only as they // I form a real community . They must act together to the last man . They must be willing to pool their business interests , to take some business risks together . Probably American farmers will be rather slow in applying this principle but it is fundamental , nevertheless , and lies at the foundation of a permanent system of rural credit , which in turn is almost essential to a permanent agriculture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may produce its own supplies to a considerable degree . It may partially feed itself . It may build its own houses , make its own furniture , have its own laundry , can or preserve its own surplus fruit , produce its own butter , meat , eggs and poultry , bake its own bread ; it may even do its own sewing ! Now the question whether the community will do these things or not is purely one of economy . If it is cheaper to buy outside of the community that should be done , if it is cheaper to manufacture and buy within the community , that should be done . The whole idea is what is best for the community , and whether a group of five hundred or a thousand people will choose to do its own business . A community can determine whether it is properly served by its merchants and its blacksmiths . Why should not a community decide on service of this sort as well as on its school teacher or its preacher or its political agents ? Some industrial communities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The household activities may sometimes yield'themselves to the cooperative idea . A community kitchen has been maintained in Montclair , N. J. , for some years . Would it be practicable in a farm village ? Three or four cooperative // laundries have been in operation in Minnesota and Wisconsin long enough to prove the feasibility of the plan . COMMUNITY PROTECTION Nor have we yet exhausted the possibilities of the community idea . We still , to a considerable extent , leave the individual farmer to protect himself against unfavorable conditions . He fights his own potato bugs and tries to defend himself against the blight . But effective protection is almost wholly a community affair . Not many years ago , a law was passed in some western states compelling farmers to spray against certain diseases , and why ? Simply because the failure of a single farmer to combat a pestiferous insect or a contagious disease of his trees made him a menace to all his neighbors . The whole thing becomes a community affair . The spread of weeds is very serious in some regions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern of the individual firmer . But the injury falls upon the entire community of farmers . A noxious weed law in Wisconsin requires that every property owner destrcy certain weeds if found on his land . THE COMMUNITY IDEA APPLIED TO COUNTRY LIFE The Education of the Rural People . The school is perhaps more completely a community institution than any other agency of rural endeavor . For decades , and in some parts of the country for generations , its maintenance has been a community charge . Every family has participated in the cost and every family has felt free to participate in the advantages of the school . But the rural school has failed thus far to measure up to its full capacity as an educational institution , both // in its point of view in the teaching of pupils and in the narrow range of its influence upon adults . John and Mary have been treated as individuals ; the instruction has had comparatively little regard to the relationship of John and Mary to other folks , and yet it is the relations of life that constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to think about what ? Himself ? His own interests alone ? Or his obligations to other people , the common good and interest ? It is well for the school to give knowledge , but what sort of knowledge ? The knowledge that has to do only with profit and loss ? Shall the school not seek to impart a love of the beautiful in literature and art ? Shall it not also give the knowledge of what races and nations and communities have done and are doing and want to do ? Moreover the average citizen has never thought of the school as intended for any one except children . It took a long while to persuade our people that the high school should be maintained at public expense . In some parts of our country to-day , there is no public opinion in favor of the publicly supported college or university . So when we begin to talk about the relation of the school to the adult people of a rural community , we are not understood , and it is doubtful if the old-fashioned district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its poorly paid teacher , can do very much for the adults of the community . But a consolidated school , with several teachers , a properly trained principal interested in rural affairs and remaining in the community until his leadership is proved , a school house with an audience room that will seat the people of the community ? give us these and then we begin to see what the school may do for the adults . And what may it not do ? Our idea of the education // of the rural people ( and this is just as true of people in the city ) is that they shall be perpetually at school . Our aim should be nothing less than a scheme of education , centering in the rural school , utilizing all of the organizations and agencies of education whose aid can be secured , even after school days , to keep on studying and reading and thinking about the problems of their community and of the world . This vital application of the community idea to the education of the rural people is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea best be applied to the home ? In spite of the fact that the home is so personal an affair and must retain its privacy , no home is a true home until it has developed a proper relation to the community . No family can live unto itself . The ideal community is a group of families that form one big family . In the ideal home we have the divers interests and capacities and tastes of each member of a family of two or a dozen , as the case may be , all merging into a common interest . So in the ideal community , we have the tastes and ambitions and interests and capacities of all the members of the community merged into a common interest and ambition . In the home perhaps better than anywhere else can be taught just these ideals . Indeed if they are not taught and practiced in the home , they will make slow headway in the community . So that the application of the community idea to the home becomes one of the great ideals of our rural life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful history and has done a wonderful work . In the pioneer days it saved our American country life from sordidness and materialism . The preacher and the pioneer farmer went west together and together 16o THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY they endured the hardships of that early life . Nevertheless , the local country church to-day usually regards itself as an end in itself . If you belong to the church , well and good ; if you do n't , well and worse ? from the church point of view . Those in the church are saints ; those without are sinners . The success of the church is measured quite largely by the number of its members and the hum of its machinery . But every now and then we find a country pastor or a country congregation that has torn itself away from any such restricted notion as this , and has come to understand what Jesus meant when he remarked : " He that loseth his life , shall find it , " and that he referred to groups of Christians as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church thinks chiefly of itself , it grows weak and ineffective . When it thinks chiefly of becoming a pathway to glory to all within its fold , it shrivels . But when it becomes a ministering agency of friendliness and neighborliness and good will to the entire community , then it lives and grows and vitalizes the spirits of men . It is not putting the matter too strongly to say that the country church will regain its leadership in rural affairs only when it applies the community idea to its motives and methods . The health of the Community . Health should be regarded as decidedly a community asset . It is always the individual who is ill , and so the knowledge of home care , food and home nursing should be more widespread . But disease really affects the whole community . It reduces the working power of the community through loss of time and money . The untimely removal by death of a strong member of the community produces a loss that the community may never get over . So the teaching of personal hygiene as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention , the futility of most patent medicines , are all matters of importance . But they are best taught on a community basis , so that they become a part of the common knowledge of the community . In the preventing of the spread of communicable diseases , the community idea is absolutely essential , because public opinion must be brought to a point where it will acquiesce in health regulations and indeed insist that individuals comply with them . There ought to be in every rural community health study clubs or rural health leagues . There should be a health program for the community . Unhealthful places should be cleaned up , a public nurse should be provided . Wherever possible there should be a health center and a public clinic . The time is not far distant when communities may be expected to employ their own physician who will be a preventer rather than a curer of disease . In more populous rural communities , especially with the village at the center , community baths are not without the possibilities . The community hospital , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon become an essential in country life . The Community at Play . Farmers desire recreation just as much as other people and enjoy it just as much , and in the better farming communities there is a vast deal of wholesome recreation for both the old and the young . But every investigation that has ever been made on this subject has revealed the fact that as a whole , farmers actually do not play enough . Recreation is a social affair . It is impossible to play alone . It is difficult to get very much recreation any great distance away from home . Thus the play of the children and the social life of the older people become very distinctively a community affair . How can play better be // developed in the rural community ? For the youngsters the school is the natural center of play life , partly because that is where children are and partly because the right sort of play is good education . Some boys and girls learn as much through games as they do in school . The Y. M. C. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Boy Scouts and the Camp Fire Girls all have possibilities in developing play that is organized and yet not artificial . In the small or scattered rural communities , it is difficult to maintain an adequate play life for the youth who have perhaps left school and have not yet joined their elders ' socials . Perhaps the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. , working in the country districts as they do , are more likely to work out this problem successfully than any other institution . But these agencies work on a community basis ; they bring together the young people of the larger neighborhoods . They do not deal very much with the individual alone , on the one hand , nor with big scattered groups on the other . For the older people , the church and the Grange or similar organizations make an outlet . The chief difficulties are not so much in agencies as in difficulties of getting together . It is here , of course , that good roads have a part in the right sort of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its program ? community picnics and sociables ; the keeping of holidays and celebrations by the entire community ; the community paper ; the community drama , developing the theatrical talent of the community ; community musicals , the natural inheritor of the traditions of the old singing schools ; community excursions to the state agricultural college of the nearby city or the state fair ; the community motion pictures or at least community oversight of the motion pictures ; // the entertainment course , adapted to all the people of the community ; community sport or play days for old and young ; inter-community contests of various sorts , athletic and intellectual ; how much richer life will be wherever a community decides to have such a program of recreation . The Community Beautiful . Nature has done her part for the country . Unfortunately man has often done his part to spoil it all . Straight highways , square corners , the absence of shade trees , unsightly weeds , unkempt door yards , box-like houses are altogether too common in our American country life . It is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country side . We need a rural architecture , simple but charming . We may locate farm buildings so as to render the plant both convenient and attractive . The use of fruit trees as well as of shade trees in the highways ; the development of parklets or squares in the country villages after the fashion of the old New England village common ; the proper location , architecture and landscape surroundings of such buildings as the school , the church , the Grange hall , the town hall , the library and the community house are possibilities within the reach of multitudes of farmers , once public opinion of the community insists upon it . If these things cost a great deal of money , perhaps they might not be so strongly urged , but it is largely a matter of community enterprise and education and insistence . There are plenty of farmers and farmers ' wives who want these things , but they have to treat them as individual matters . They must now set the community to work to get them . The Socializing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can no longer consider the // wrong doing of an individual as merely his own affair . A bad man is a plague spot in a community . Thousands of men would almost give their right arms if they could have avoided in youth certain contacts with men who were not clean . We have been too tolerant of sin and too intolerant of the sinner . We must reverse our scales and contend the evil by extending a friendly hand to the repentant . But what can be done in the rural community ? Well , if every wrong were to become a community affair , it would he easier to enforce the law . At present , it is difficult to enforce law in the rural community because enforcement is such a personal affair between people who know one another . But once public opinion demands right doing and the officer of the law knows that he is representative not of his own authority , but of the community , he will be obeyed . Then too rightness can be made a fundamental article in community program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , the Sunday school and the rural Y. M. C. A. into a combination of high ideals and practices . Lay the foundations for good morals by clean sport for the young and healthy recreation for the older ones . Make morality redblooded . Banish the long-faced preacher and elect no man a church deacon unless the boys in the church nominate hirn . I kid aloft the ideal of a righteous community . The life of the rural people is the most important part of the rural problem . Therefore it ought to he the concern of every rural community to see that in education , in home life , in church life , in health and recreation , in beauty and convenience and morality , high ideals are maintained and practiced and continuous steps taken to build up the sort of life that the best people at all times and all people in their best moments acknowledge as half of the great end of living . CHAPTER X ORGANIZING THE RURAL COMMUNITY THE OBJECT THE main object of organizing the rural community is to try to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of a generally accepted plan or program for improving the community at all points . By reason of such cooperative endeavor , should emerge at last a group of people with one mind as to the desirability of working together for one large purpose and in the finest spirit of cooperation . Remember again that organization is merely the cooperation of all the people . It is an assembling of all factors that make for better working and living together . It implies a group of people working as one . The ideal is the most complete possible cooperation of all individuals and all groups in a small natural area , making their best efforts in the common task of securing the greatest possible improvement in all things that make for the common good . THE FIRST STEPS There must be some new " machinery " for the purpose of this organization , otherwise it is difficult to draw out leadership in community enterprises . But few communities need a new organization . Indeed , what is wanted is not an organization at all in the usual meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i66 THE FARMER AND THE NEW DAY existing associated effort , a " round table " on the best ways of developing the best interests of the community and how each agency and each individual can best help . The start may be made by any person or any group of persons that is so minded ? the Grange or master of the Grange , the school superintendent , the church or the pastor of the church , the farm bureau or the farmers ' club . It makes little difference what particular form of organization shall be developed . It is , of course , necessary that at the outset there should be meetings of citizens to discuss the question of community organization . The whole matter should be carefully explained by some one who really knows about it , so that the community idea may be perfectly clear at the outset . Beyond that , no hard and fast method of organization need be urged . Experience has shown , however , that there are some plans worth adopting if best results are expected . They comprise the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council . 2 . Gaining the Facts . 3 . The Community Program . 4 . The Community Meeting . 5 . The Community Center . 6 . The Community Goal . THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL - THE ONE ESSENTIAL It is practically impossible to build a true community and develop its activities fully without some sort of central group which in some way represents the entire community and all its interests . The name applied to this group does not matter ; it may be called a community committee , a community group , a community federation , or what not . " Community council " is a // term that seems best to convey the complete purpose and task of this central group . No one club or association or institution can do all the work that needs doing in a community , nor can it possibly represent the entire community . Whether there are two agencies or twenty in a community , there is the same need that they shall cooperate for the common interests of the community . The Make-Up of the Council . There are two principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is desirable that each agency in the community shall be officially represented , the Grange or Farmers ' Union , the farmers ' club , each church , the school , the woman 's club , even the fraternal organizations may be admitted . It must be understood that what we are seeking is to " speed up " or increase the efficiency of the work of each existing agency , not to deprive it of its work . Consequently each should play a part in the general plan . That is just what community organization means ? to bring together existing forces , not to make a new machine . If there are not very many agencies in the community , a council having half a dozen to fifteen members will represent them all very well ; if there happens to be a larger number , then the council may be larger . The other principle is to make sure to have in the council the natural leaders in the community . These leaders may not always be officials in the different agencies nor the chosen representatives of those agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council from three to five members at large . It is well to have a constitution and by-laws , models for which can be obtained as a rule from the extension service of the state agricultural college . // Committees of the Council . There are four committees that seem to be necessary in order to cover the main interests of a community , as follows : I. On production . 2 . On marketing and other businecs interests . 3 . On conservation . 4 . On community life . But there may he as many sub-committees as there are problems , covering such interests as good roads , farmers ' exchanges , recreation , education , community planning , health and sanitation , local government and so on . The Activities of the Council . The task of the council is to confer , not to direct or manage . It should consider such questions as these : 1 . A community study . 2 . A community program . 3 . The work of each agency in carrying out the program . 4 . Community meetings and conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need of new association . 6 . Bringing the community into touch with other communities and with county , state and national activities . The Community Secretary . It is desirable to have a community secretary . The ideal , possibly , would be the employment of a person who could give full time to the interests of the community . But this is hardly possible in most rural communities , and there are , no doubt , certain advantages in having not a professional community manager but a voluntary worker who gives freely of his time and energy and thought . This official would probably be the secretary of the council , chosen by it to serve as its executive agent . Choice // may fall upon the master or the lecturer of the Grange , upon the pastor of the church , upon the superintendent of schools or the principal of the consolidated school , or upon the person who teaches agriculture in the school . The community secretary becomes a sort of community engineer . He studies the needs of the community and what other communities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council . He endeavors to see that the different agencies are carrying out their program , tries to discover whether the program is working . He puts fuel under the boilers . He would naturally represent the council at county and state conferences . Here is literally a new profession opening up in country communities . But let us not be alarmed at the extent of his duties . There is not a farming area in America which has not some one in it who already does many of these things . We need to systematize and organize more fully and to he more definite in our purposes and plans . This community secretary will be a tower of strength in accomplishing results . Community " Pace Makers . " We are indebted to Minnesota for suggesting a unique phase of local community leadership . Not only do we want a community secretary , but we want some one in the community , chosen by the community , who is the recognized leader in some one field and who will take the responsibility for endeavoring to push that interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another an apple expert , another a stock breeder , another especially interested in schools and education . There will be , of course , women pace makers for household management , child training , home decoration and so on . There should be as many pace makers as there are // problems . Each one will make a study of the question , keep abreast the times , confer with specialists , read and study and lead discussion clubs on his particular subject and in all possible ways endeavor to lead the community to maximum improvement . The Community Council a Planning , not an Achieving , Body . There is always a temptation when we get a new type of organization to judge the results wholly by the activities and achievements of the organization . So the community council will be tempted " to do something " in order to justify its existence . But to do something is not the job of the council . Its task is to get others to do the right thing in the best way for the interests of the whole community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secures team work . In some cases , it may be necessary for the council or one of its committee to supervise a definite piece of work , but it ought never to do this as long as there is some other agency that can do it .
