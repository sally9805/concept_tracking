Two recent events in the national galleries here are worthy of note . One is the loan exhibition of Alfred Stevens 's work at the Tate Gallery in connection with the presentation to the trustees , on behalf of the Alfred Stevens Memorial Committee , of a bust of the artist Lanteri and a cast of the great chimney piece at Dorchester House . The other is the opening of the Tudor and Stuart Rooms , which have been redecorated and rearranged , at the National Portrait Gallery . Alfred Stevens is still comparatively little known in England , and hardly known at all anywhere else It is a common mistake of the critic to confuse his name with that of the Belgian Alfred Stevens . It can scarcely be said that he received no recognition in his lifetime . There are many successful sculptors and decorators who might have envied him his chance at St. Paul 's and Dorchester House But , on the other hand , it is true that he never received what is regarded as official recognition in England . His neglect by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it , and e lived and worked in an age  --  he was born in 1817 and died in 1875 ? when the Academical hall-mark was all essential in the eyes of the average British patron of art . Besides , Stevens has left a very small amount of completed work ? that is , work known to be his His poverty in the beginning forced him to do many things for which an artist rarely receives due credit himself . When he was young , during'his student years abroad , part spent as assistant to Thorwaldsen in Rome , part in wandering from one Italian town to another , he copied old masters for the dealers . Later , on his return to England , he designed stoves and fire irons for a firm to whom they brought more fame than to him . Fate seemed against him in other ways . His delightful little lions that used to perch on the railings in front of the British Museum were long since removed with the railings . His Wellington monument was first erected and stood for years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not designed but where it was immensely impressive ; then , largely through the clamor of his admirers , it was set up in the place for which it was designed under an arch between the nave and the transept . Most of his other important decorations were for private houses where they have been seen only by the few . Even many people who knew and admired the Wellington monument and the British Museum lions had never heard of him as a painter , and I remember the astonishment and excitement of the critics one press day several years ago , when a fine portrait by him was included in the Winter Exhibition of Old Masters at Burlington House To-day , there is less excuse for not knowing his work . It has been much written about , examples have appeared now and then in exhibitions , and , better still , a characteristic series has been got together for the permanent collet tion of modern British art at the Tate Gallery . There be is represented by one or two portraits and cartoons , and by numerous drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many being notes and studies for the great monuments he either executed or planned . To the present exhibition owners of his works have lent more paintings and studies and several models . Nobody who sees this collection can doubt that Stevens deserves the wider recognition that is at last coming round to him . His work , in no matter what medium , has the distinction , the style , which the modern artist so rarely seeks , and so seldom achieves when he does seek it . It is too late in the day to describe the Wellington Monument , with the grave simplicity , the dignity that recalls Italian monuments of the Renaissance . There is likewise a feeling of the old masters in his portraits , in their gravity , their quiet color , their serenity , the ugliest Victorian fashions borrowing dignity from his treatment of them . And he is the old master again in his studies , the greater number in red chalk , which are really working drawings for his own use , and not done in the manner of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imitation . The truth is that Stevens never got very far away from the Renaissance , thoUgh I believe the decorations in one or two private houses which I have never seen show the influence also of Pompeii . Many of the now most famous artists of the last century began by an equally close study and perhaps closer copying of the old masters ; - as it was said of them in Paris , their work smelt of the Louvre ; but those who had anything in them developed from this stage of their art a distinct style of their own , their own manner of expressing what they had to say . Stevens , distinguished as he was , did not ever succeed in quite emancipating himself , though he was fifty-seven or eight when he died . The reason was probably because for so many years he could not devote his time to his own development , carrying the old tradition on still further , but was in the employment of others as designer or teacher . However , if his originality was less marked than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . He was a giant compared to the popular Victorians who are to-day forgotten , towering head and shoulders above the Academicians who could find no room for him within their ranks . At the National Portrait Gallery , it is not so much the Tudor and Stuart portraits that call for special attention as their rearrangement . The portraits are as they were , as they have been described  --  except that some look unexpectedly cleaned up , or it may be the effect of the new decorations . As is well known by this time , they are as a rule of more value historically than artistically , though here and there are a few fine originals . They have been very well hung , the careful chronological sequence adding to their interest , and the different periods have been divided witb some feeling for dramatic grouping . I believe the idea has been to make this arrangement as permanent as possible . But if the much-needed additions to the gallery , for which the pulling down of the old St. George 's Barracks should give the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will be some re-hanging ; for , as it is , the walls in places are far too crowded for comfort to the student , whether of history or of art . But more striking than the new hanging is the new decoration . The director , who is young at his post , has evidently determined - to do something that has not been done before , at least in London . He has had the intelligence to see the mistake of clinging to custom , as in that biggest of the Turner rooms at the Tate Gallery  --  which time so far has only made the more distressing  --  and also to avoid the commonplace of the new wall decorations in the new rooms at the National Gallery . But he has not had quite the independence toadapt boldly the better examples given of late years in some private galleries and big exhibitions both at home and abroad . He has escaped the official mistakes and commonplaces on the one band , and , on the other , the risk of being accused of too close adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now black is far from being a bad background for the very early paintings ; it seems rather but an extension of the black frames of so many pictures of their date . When it comes to the Lelys and Kn.ellers , it is less in harmony . But , in any case , much depends on the quality of the black , and in this respect I can hardly make my compliments to the director . No matter how many coats of paint , or how deep a stain , he may have used to cover the panelling of the walls , the result strikes me as thin , not rich , while the mere fact that the panelling is so plainly revealed distracts the attention of the nervous , who see in it but an unpleasant reminder of increased danger in case of fire . Then , below the black is a wide line of white , which is repeated in the frieze and ceiling , and the violent contrast hurts the eye . It is all very well to rely upon time , with its power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse this reliance in London . The big Turner room at the Tate shows that time , even in a town of dirt and fog , unless it has a good foundation to work upon , is not always kind . Experiment , I admit , is healthier than blind obedience to custom , but I am not so sure that the healthiest place for experiment is a national gallery where there is no money to spare when experiment leads to failure . How time will treat these new rooms remains to he seen . N. N. Dana Estes &; Co. announce " A History of Painting , " in eight volumes , by Haldane Macfall , with a Preface by Frank Brangwyn . The work is designed for the amateur rather than the technical student , and carries the subject from the beginning of the Italian Renaissance to modern times It is to have two hundred full-page mounted plates in color , which , to judge from the samples we have seen , will furnish a notable example of the new style of illustration . Royal Cortissoz writes an introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Scribner ) The eighty-five full-page illustrations , reproduced for the most part in two printings , with a tint block background , are arranged alphabetically under the artist 's name , beginning with Fdwin A.

The plan gives promise of some historical value in the study of American illustration In the Master Painters series Doran issues three volumes , " Titian , " " Reynolds . " and " Van Dyck , " The texts are put together from the writings of Ruskin , and there are the usual reproductions in color of several of the artists ' paintings . A miniature edition of Turner 's " Liber Studiorum " ( Stokes ) contains fascimiles of the seventy-three published plates and twenty-six additional cuts of unfinished plates or of drawings intended for that famous series . Since the small scale of the repro &lotions; reduces these prints to tone , effacing the etched skeleton , the book will better serve as a pictorial index for those who know their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( London : Horace Cox ) is a translation of a : brief sketch by a ? French archologist , Pere Vincent , of the work of the expedition of 1909-12 on the hill of Ophel . By means of its excavations the history of ancient Jebus can be traced back for 3,000 years before the birth of Christ . Burial caves have been discovered in which were tombs containing bodies , and , among other things , fragments of early Canaanitish pottery and some bullets for slinging . But the most interesting result was the bringing to light of the admirable work of Hezekiah , at the time of the war with the Assyrians , in supplying the city with water by means of a tunnel from the Virgin 's Well to the Pool of Siloam When the explorations are completed a full account of them will be published by Constable &; Co. , in which the names of the members of the expedition , now kept secret , will be given .

Besides the three ilublic galleries , the Liechtenstein . Czernin , Schonborn-Bucheim , and Harrach collections ? are treated The Lanckorowski , which contains interesting pictures , is omitted .

" Important excavations on the Palatine were begun by Dr. Giacomo Boni early in October in the Palace of Domitian . E ) fcavating was carried on here as long ago as the sixteenth century by Farnesi , nothing important has been done since the eighteenth century From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century excavating meant principally stealing marbles with which to enrich museums ; Dr Boni 's work is directed to discovering the whole plan of the palace , which was that of a typical Roman domus , enlarged to meet the requirements of the chief of the state .

The bottom of the basin had been broken through by the excavators of earlier centuries in their search for marbles , and a mass of pottery from the priscan-archmological strata had been brought up and then thrown back as rubbish with which to fill in the whole . Dr. Boni has now taken it out , and will later carry on deeper excavations in this stratum . In the triclinium everything had been long ago levelled to the earth , but a beautiful marble pavement covering two hundred yards had been left undiscovered beneath a few inches of earth Although the northern nympheum was already known , the pipes through which it was supplied with water have just come to light .
