SCENE : The AMERICAN HOUSE barber shop in Johnsburg ; a small town shop with three chairs and the usual bits of furniture , including a round Center table on which are copies of the " Police Gazette , " etc . The shop is supposed to be in the basement of the American House , with a stairway running up Left to the hotel office . At rise of Curtain , JOE CURTIS and JED CUSICK are discovered at Center table playing a game of checkers . SAM STALLINGS is over Right shaving CHIEF CRANDALL . PETE , the hat boy , is sweeping the floor . PETE ( Whistles " Tipperary " while sweeping . As he gets near the checker players he starts singing the words of the song . ) JED CUSICK ( Looks up from game . ) Say , shut up that singing , will you please , Pete ? A man ca n't play checkers and listen to singing at the same time . PETE ( Stops singing and sweeping . ) Well , I ai n't askin ' you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm askin ' you to shut up . JOE CURTIS Do n't lose your temper , Jed . JED CUSICK Well , I 'd rather lose my temper than lose the game . p. 3 SAM STALLINGS ( Finishes the CHIEF 'S shave and turns him around in chair , facing the audience . ) Want some bay rum on your hair , Chief ? CHIEF CRANDALL No , sir ! Cologne belongs on women ; that 's my idea of it . Just plain water and plenty of vaseline . SAM STALLINGS All right , Chief . ( Gets vaseline and rubs it on CHIEF 'S hair . ) CHIEF CRANDALL How are you coming out , Joe ? JOE CURTIS Rotten ! He 's got four kings to my two . JED CUSICK You wo n't have them in a minute . There goes one of ' em right now . ( Jumps and takes JOE 'S king . ) JOE CURTIS ( Turns R. toward CHIEF . ) You see ?

It 's your move . JOE CURTIS Well , keep your shirt on , will you ? A man ca n't think and argue at the same time . ( PETE whistles . ) Shut up whistling , will you ! PETE ( Stops whistling . ) Oh , all right ! JED CUSICK Yes , and if you must whistle , for God 's sake , learn a new tune . JOE CURTIS That 's what I say . Tipperary must be ten thousand miles from here , the way they keep harping on it . CHIEF CRANDALL ( Laughs . ) That 's a pretty good one . Did you hear that , Sam ? SAM STALLINGS Yes , he gets them off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) JED CUSICK ( Jumps JOE 'S last king . ) There you go . You owe me a quarter . ( Rises . ) JOE CURTIS Well , do n't brag about it . ( Rises . ) I 'll pay you Saturday night . p. 5 JED CUSICK Well , I 'll take fifteen cents ' worth of it right now . Give me a shave , and then you 'll only owe me a dime .

JOE starts upstage L. ) CHIEF CRANDALL Did you beat him , Jed ? JED CUSICK Yep . ( Goes to barber chair L. and sits . ) JOE CURTIS Sure , he beat me . With the aid of a lot of conversation and this musical sweeper we have here , how could he help but beat me ? SAM STALLINGS Do n't lose your temper , Joe . ( CHIEF rises and pays SAM . ) JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S chair . ) Say , you have n't paid for a shave in six months , have you ? JED CUSICK Not since you learned how to play checkers . CHIEF CRANDALL Come on , Pete , give us a shine . ( Gets up on bootblack stand R. ) PETE ( To JOE , as he comes downstage and over to CHIEF . ) Anybody would think you owned the shop , to hear your talk . ( Starts blacking the CHIEF 'S shoes. ) p. 6 JOE CURTIS Well , if I did own the shop , I would n't have you around whistling in everybody 's ear . And anyway , I would n't own the darn old shop anyway . It 's losing anywhere from fifteen to twenty dollars a week . The boss told me so himself . CHIEF CRANDALL Is that right , Sam ? SAM STALLINGS ( Folding up linen , etc . ) Yes , I guess the whole hotel 's been losin ' a lot of money right along . The old man seems pretty much discouraged . CHIEF CRANDALL That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller . Darned if I ai n't sorry for him . SAM STALLINGS So am I. He 's a temperance crank and all that sort of thing , but just the same he 's as square as they make ' em , and that 's why I hate to leave . CHIEF CRANDALL Are you leaving ? SAM STALLINGS Sure ! Going over to the new hotel when it opens week after next . CHIEF CRANDALL You do n't mean it ! SAM STALLINGS Well , you ca n't blame me , can you ? Five dollars more a week and an up-to-date shop .

SAM STALLINGS Yes , and Beasley , the head clerk , and Barnes , the bus driver . I guess young Granger hired everybody he could from here , did n't he , Joe ? JOE CURTIS Sure he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force except the table girls . They 're going to have men waiters over there , I understand  --  Frenchmen from New York . It 's a regular big city hotel  --  got a bowling alley and everything . Have you been through it , Chief ? CHIEF CRANDALL No , I 've been too busy . I ai n't been near the place . JOE CURTIS Well , believe me , it 's a regular ripper ! Sixty rooms  --  and a bath in most of em ; two dining-rooms and a billiard room . And as for the barber shop ! Well , wait till it opens . It 'll knock your eye out , wo n't it , Sam ? ( Back to JED . ) SAM STALLINGS It sure will . And they 're going to have the finest bar-room I ever seen  --  big chandeliers all over the place . JOE CURTIS ( Over to C. ) Yes , and they 're going to have an automobile bus to take the borders to the depot , and  --   --  p. 8 JED CUSICK ( Sits up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to let this stuff dry on my face , or are you going to shave me ? ( SAM and CHIEF laugh . ) JOE CURTIS ( Crosses to below JED . ) Well , what are you kicking about ? You 're getting it for nothing , ai n't you . JED CUSICK No , I ai n't . I beat you , and had three kings to spare . JOE CURTIS ( Goes to above JED 'S chair . ) I suppose you 'll go all over town blowin ' about it . JED CUSICK Well , I do n't intend sittin ' here all day like a blame fool with this stuff on my face . ( SAM sits R. of C. table . ) JOE CURTIS Well , stop talking and I 'll shave you . JED CUSICK Well , shave me and stop talking . PETE ( Finishing the CHIEF 'S shine . ) How 's that , Chief ? CHIEF CRANDALL ( Rises . ) Just right . All I wanted was the dirt off of ' em . ( PETE gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes belongs on dudes , that 's my idea of it . ( Hands PETE some change . ) Here you are . There 's seven cents  --  two for yourself . p. 9 PETE Thanks , Chief . ( Straightens things on bootblack stand , then sits on stand reading paper . ) CHIEF CRANDALL ( To SAM as he goes upstage R. to get his hat . ) What 's old man Jayson going to do when the new hotel opens ? SAM STALLINGS What do you mean ? CHIEF CRANDALL ( As he comes downstage R. ) Well , is he going to go along here , or close up shop ? SAM STALLINGS I do n't think he knows himself what he 's going to do , Chief . He certainly wo n't stand much chance against the Johnsburg House , with all the modern improvements . JOE CURTIS ( Goes to C. ) No ; if he 's got any sense he 'll close up and quit , and that 's about what he 'll do . JED CUSICK ( Impatiently . ) Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to JED . ) All right , all right ; you need n't cry about it . CHIEF CRANDALL ( As he starts up R. ) Well , see you sooner . p. 10 SAM STALLINGS All right , Chief . CHIEF CRANDALL ( Turns L. ) Good-bye , boys . JOE CURTIS So long . JED CUSICK Good-bye , Chief .

( To SAM . ) May I come in for a moment , Mr. Stallings ? SAM STALLINGS ( Goes to below C. table . ) Sure , come right ahead . MRS . TEMPLE ( Comes down R. below C. table . ) I did n't know whether it was altogether proper for a lady to enter a barber shop , but I thought I 'd chance it , anyway . CHIEF CRANDALL ( As he comes down R. ) That 's all right , Mrs. Temple ; I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Some of ' em come in and wait for their husbands while they get their hair cut . p. 11 JOE CURTIS Yes , and some of ' em tell us how they want it cut , too . MRS .

It 's just a little advertisement for the temperance meeting to-night at Johnsburg Hall . SAM STALLINGS Sure , leave as many as you like . Here , give ' em to me . ( She hands him a stack of the bills . ) I 'll put ' em right here on the table where they can see ' em and pick ' em up . ( Goes above table and places them on same . ) MRS .

JOE CURTIS No , that 's Scott 's Emulsion . ( All laugh . ) MRS . TEMPLE ( Laughs ) Why , the idea of such a thing ! ( To JED . ) My brother Charlie tells me you won a hat from him playing checkers the other day . p. 13 JED CUSICK That 's right ; I beat him out of a hat . MRS . TEMPLE ( As she starts up L. ) He tells me you play a splendid game . ( Turns to SAM . ) Would it be all right if I go to the hotel office this way ? I want Edith Holden to do some typewriting for me . SAM STALLINGS Sure , go right ahead , Mrs. Temple . MRS . TEMPLE Thank you so much .

There 's only two or three of the local boys that 's very fussy about their finger-nails . BILLY HOLLIDAY So I 've noticed . JED CUSICK ( Aside to JOE while combing his own hair . ) Say , who is that feller over there ? ( Indicating HOLLIDAY . ) JOE CURTIS I do n't know . JED CUSICK A salesman of some kind , I bet .

DEAN GRANGER Well , it 's his own fault . Father offered to take this property off his hands and give him the lease of the new place providing he 'd put in a bar . But , no sir ! The darned old fool stuck to his Prohibition principles , as he calls them , and robbed himself of a chance to have a real hotel and make some money . Then father got sore and put the new hotel up , anyway . The way we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but we figure it 'll be a good ad. for the brewery , and it 'll help put the town on the map .

( Paces up and down R. ) p. 33 EDITH HOLDEN I told you I was very thankful for the offer , but that I 'd prefer to stay here as long as Mr. Jayson would keep me . DEAN GRANGER Oh , piffle ! that 's not the reason at all . ( Crosses to R. of EDITH . ) Why do n't you tell the truth ? Your father would n't let you take the job because he knew we were going to sell liquor  --  that 's the reason .

Who are you ? EDITH HOLDEN ( To HOLLIDAY , as he starts toward DEAN . ) Please do n't mind him . We do n't pay any attention to anything he says . We 're all used to him .

REX GRANGER ( Savagely . ) Never mind the hello business . I came over here to see you to find out why you misrepresented this affair at Johnsburg Hall to-night . BURR JAYSON Misrepresented it ? How do you mean ? REX GRANGER When you made arrangements with me you did n't tell me anything about it being a temperance meeting ; that 's what I mean . BURR JAYSON Why , I thought you understood . REX GRANGER Well , I did n't understand , and I 'm not going to have it . You can send word to Mrs. Temple and the rest of those lunatics that there ai n't going to be any such affair held in any building that I control or have an interest in . BURR JAYSON You 'd better send word yourself , Rex . They asked me to make the arrangements and you agreed to it and took the check , and now if you want to back out you 'll have to tell them yourself ; I ai n't going to have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn well you 're at the head of this Prohibition movement  --  what are you talking about ! p. 39 BURR JAYSON Who says I am ? REX GRANGER I say you are . DEAN GRANGER Certainly you are . REX GRANGER ( To DEAN . ) Keep quiet ! ( To JAYSON . ) And I 'll put another flea in your ear . I think you 're an out and out hypocrite . ( JOE sits on bootblack stand R. ) BURR JAYSON What do you mean , Rex ? REX GRANGER I mean I believe you 're just using that crowd to advertise that rotten temperance drink of yours . ( To DEAN . ) What 's he call it ? DEAN GRANGER Nearly Beer . REX GRANGER ( Sneeringly , as he drawls the word out . ) Nearly Beer ! That 's a hell of a name for a temperance drink ! BILLY HOLLIDAY Say , wait a minute , there 's a lady here . ( JAYSON turns R. ) REX GRANGER ( As he comes down to L. of C. table . ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . ( JED enters from L. ) ( GRANGER sits L. of table , looks over at HOLLIDAY , then turns to DEAN , who has gone to above C. table . ) Who 's that fellow ? ( JAYSON comes to R. of table. ) p. 40 DEAN GRANGER I do n't know . He 's been butting in on me too . ( Looks over at HOLLIDAY . ) Gee ! he gets on my nerves ! ( Goes upstage R. C. ) REX GRANGER ( Turns to JAYSON after a slight pause . ) You can tell these reformers for me that I 'll drive them out of town if they go too far with me  --  I 'm getting desperate ! ( Smashes table with his fist . ) ( JED runs up L. stairs and exits . ) BURR JAYSON Now wait a minute , Rex . I ai n't at the head of any Prohibition Organization , or even actively connected with it . I 'm too old a man for that sort of thing ; but when you say you do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you do n't mean it . You 've known me for forty years , and you know I 've never tasted a drop of liquor in all that time . DEAN GRANGER Oh , we do n't want to hear the story of your life ! REX GRANGER ( To DEAN . ) Keep quiet ! ( DEAN goes upstage C. ) BURR JAYSON ( To GRANGER , as he sits R. of table . ) You know I 've always been against it ; voted against it , and never allowed any in my house or on my premises . You 've made a fortune out of it and you 're welcome to it . I 'd rather be a poor man all my life than have anything to do with the stuff . p. 41 REX GRANGER Do you mean that the money I 've made I 've  --   --  ( JED enters on L. stairs and stands listening . ) BURR JAYSON Now wait a minute , please , and let me finish what I 've got to say . You 've always frightened me so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the courage to talk to you this way before . I realize that the new hotel you 're opening will ruin my chances of staying here , and that 's why I never said a word about your stealing all my help away and doing everything you possibly could to disorganize me and put me out of business . But when you accuse me of using my friends to make a few dollars out of a measly little temperance drink  --   --  ( JED comes down to foot of stairs )  --   --  you hurt my feelings , because I 've never been that kind of a man . I got up that drink and called it Nearly Beer because it was the nearest thing to beer that I kept . Now that you 've gone so far as to insinuate that it 's no good  --   --  ( Rises. )  --   --  I 'll give you a little information that will probably surprise you . ( DEAN comes down to above table . ) I was offered twenty-five hundred dollars for the recipe of Nearly Beer less than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn . ( Turns R. ) p. 42 DEAN GRANGER ( Sneeringly . ) Yes , you were . BURR JAYSON ( Turns on DEAN . ) Yes , I was ! REX GRANGER That has n't got anything to do with it . ( Rises and goes to L. of JAYSON ; DEAN goes R. ) ( JED comes down to L. barber chair and sits . ) I came here to tell you that there ai n't going to be any temperance cranks use Johnsburg Hall as a meeting place , and you 'd better inform that gang of fanatics that if they come there to-night they 're going to get into trouble , and you tell them I said so . DEAN GRANGER ( Comes down to R. of JAYSON . ) Yes , and tell them I said so too . ( PETE enters from R. and sits upstage C. ) BURR JAYSON But it 's too late to make other arrangements now . REX GRANGER What do you think I care about that ? DEAN GRANGER Yes , what do you think we care ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside to EDITH . ) I 'll have to do something to him I 'm afraid . p. 43 BURR JAYSON Well , it places me in a peculiar position . I do n't see how I can explain to them at this hour . REX GRANGER That 's not my affair . DEAN GRANGER No ; we should worry about that , I suppose . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To GRANGER . ) Why do n't you let them use the hall ? They wo n't hurt it any , will they ? REX GRANGER ( After a slight pause , as he stands looking at HOLLIDAY . ) Who are you ? DEAN GRANGER ( Comes downstage L. , looking at HOLLIDAY . ) Yes , I 'd like to find that out myself . Gee ! but you get on my nerves . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To EDITH , as he rises . ) Pardon me just a moment . ( Crosses to L. of DEAN . ) My name is Holliday  --  Billy Holliday . DEAN GRANGER What ! Not the bartender from the Knickerbocker ! BILLY HOLLIDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the hundred-dollar man that Regan sent us . ( Turns to HOLLIDAY . ) I did n't expect you till to-morrow . How long have you been in town ? p. 44 BILLY HOLLIDAY I 've been here just about an hour ; just long enough to find out that I do n't want to work for you . DEAN GRANGER What do you mean by that ? ( SAM enters and stands on L. stairs . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , I 'll tell you . You 're the most annoying , contemptible , despicable man I ever came in contact with , and if it was n't for the fact that I do n't want to make your father ashamed of himself , I 'd give you a slap in the face . ( DEAN stares at HOLLIDAY a moment , then turns and smiles at GRANGER , then turns back to HOLLIDAY . ) REX GRANGER Are you going to stand there and take that , Dean ? DEAN GRANGER ( To HOLLIDAY , after a pause . ) Say , what are you doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rat like you . REX GRANGER ( To DEAN , who stands looking at HOLLIDAY without replying . ) What are you standing there like a dummy for ! DEAN GRANGER Just let him keep on ; he 'll go too far in a minute . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To DEAN . ) Pardon me . ( Crosses above DEAN to R. of him ; DEAN taking cross with him , moving slightly L. ) ( To GRANGER . ) Mr. Granger , you should be proud of that son of yours . He 's more like his father than any boy I ever saw . p. 45 DEAN GRANGER What do you mean by that ? BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To DEAN . ) Your father heard what I said . ( Turns to GRANGER . ) You get me , do n't you , Mr. Granger ? ( After a slight pause . ) Excuse me . ( To JAYSON , as he crosses above GRANGER to R. of him . ) Mr. Jayson , if I understood you rightly , you mentioned the fact a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rented , your check for a certain amount of money was cheerfully accepted by  --   --  ( Turns toward GRANGER , snapping his fingers as if trying to recall his name. )  --   --  Mr. Granger . ( To JAYSON . ) Is that right ? BURR JAYSON Yes ; he took the check . REX GRANGER ( Furiously . ) I 'll send the check back in the morning . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To GRANGER . ) Ah , but he does n't want the check . He wants what the check calls for . ( Turns to JAYSON . ) Is n't that the idea , Mr. Jayson ? ( To GRANGER , as JAYSON nods . ) You see ? ( To JAYSON . ) Now , by all that 's fair in law and business , the hall is yours . Might I ask if it would be agreeable to you to turn the hall over to me for this evening ? p. 46 BURR JAYSON Why , no ; I hired the hall for Mrs. Temple . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , turn it over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; do you understand ? ( JAYSON looks puzzled , but makes no reply . ) Good ! Then it 's all settled ! BURR JAYSON But I do n't understand . BILLY HOLLIDAY Now it 's all settled  --  that 's all there is to it . ( Turns to GRANGER ; JAYSON turns slightly R. ) Now , Mr. Granger , if you 're still looking for trouble , I 'll hand it out to you in large or small packages . The hall has been turned over to me , so if you want to know a way to spend a nice , pleasant evening , you start something . REX GRANGER ( Looks at DEAN , then turns to HOLLIDAY . ) We 've got a police force in this town . BILLY HOLLIDAY Oh , I wo n't need the police force ; I 'll stake you to him . DEAN GRANGER ( Laughs , as GRANGER turns to him . ) Make a good story for the Chronicle , Governor . " Bartender leads the Prohibition party to victory . " ( He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell them how many people your cocktails have killed ? p. 47 BILLY HOLLIDAY I might . ( Pause . ) That 's not a bad idea . ( Crosses C. below GRANGER , who goes R. C. ) Or perhaps a better subject would be , " How beer is brewed and what it 's made of . Being a bartender , they would actually give me credit for knowing what I was talking about , do n't you see ? REX GRANGER ( Sneeringly . ) You do n't think you 're going to get away with this , do you ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , I do n't know . I came 300 miles to be disappointed , and , by golly , I 'm not going to leave here without having a little fun . REX GRANGER Well , we 'll give you all the fun you 're looking for if you try any of your monkey business in this town . ( Laughs contemptuously . ) Come on , Dean . ( To JAYSON , as he turns up R. ) Remember what I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DEAN GRANGER ( Starts R. , crossing below HOLLIDAY and laughing in his face . ) You 're a hot one ! REX GRANGER ( Impatiently . ) Come on ! p. 48 DEAN GRANGER ( R. of HOLLIDAY , grinning at him . ) Bartender , eh ? Well , that 's pretty good ! ( HOLLIDAY grabs DEAN 'S nose and twists it . ) Hey , there , what are you doing ! ( GRANGER comes down R. , SAM crosses to barber chair R. ) Let go my nose , do you hear ! ( Breaks away from HOLLIDAY and stands holding his nose . ) Say , what are you trying to do , break my nose ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Now I 'm satisfied . I 've been wanting to do that ever since I first laid eyes on you . ( Goes to L. of manicure table and sits . ) DEAN GRANGER ( Stands glaring at HOLLIDAY . ) You 're discharged ! REX GRANGER ( To DEAN , after a pause . ) Well , why do n't you fight him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAN GRANGER ( Goes to above manicure table ; HOLLIDAY rises . DEAN backs away to above C. table . ) Do you think I 'd lower myself fighting with a bartender ? ( HOLLIDAY smiles contemptuously and sits . ) I 'll get one of the men in the brewery to take care of him , do n't worry . p. 49 REX GRANGER ( As he goes up to R. door . ) Go on , you big coward , you 're a disgrace to the name of Granger . ( Exits up R. stairs . ) DEAN GRANGER ( After GRANGER exits . ) Do n't you talk to me like that . ( To HOLLIDAY . ) I 'll have you in jail inside of an hour . BILLY HOLLIDAY Now , listen ; if you do n't get out of here I 'll twist your wrist and break your watch . DEAN GRANGER I 'll get you before you leave town , you mark my words ! ( Goes up to R. door . ) You dirty loafer ! ( Exits L. ) ( JED , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits , then all shake hands with each other . ) PETE I 'm going to watch where he 's going . ( Exits upstage R. ) SAM STALLINGS Well , I guess it was coming to him . JOE CURTIS I knew he 'd get it sooner or later . Gosh , I hate him ! JED CUSICK I 'll play you another game on that , Joe , to see who hates him most . p. 50 JOE CURTIS Come on . ( JED and JOE sit in former positions at table and start another game , SAM standing above table watching them . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To EDITH . ) The boys all feel sorry for him . EDITH HOLDEN Do you suppose he will have you put in jail , Mr. Holliday ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I do n't know ; but no matter what he does , it was worth it . I could n't have kept my hands off his nose if my life had depended on it . ( To JAYSON , who has come to above table . ) I 'm sorry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what to say to you , young man ; I 'm sort of flabbergasted . Do you think they 'll let us use the hall ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Oh , I imagine so . I think they were just bluffing ; trying to frighten you . BURR JAYSON Well , they succeeded , all right ; I 'm shaking all over . BILLY HOLLIDAY That 's too bad . EDITH HOLDEN Sit down , Mr. Jayson . BURR JAYSON I believe I will . SAM STALLINGS Here you are , Boss . ( Takes chair from above C. table and hands it to JAYSON. ) p. 51 BURR JAYSON Thank you . ( Places chair above manicure table and sits . ) JOE CURTIS ( Aside to JED and SAM , as he indicates HOLLIDAY . ) That 's the new bartender at the Johnsburg . JED CUSICK That 's who he is . SAM STALLINGS You do n't say so ! BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To JAYSON . ) What time is this meeting supposed to start to-night ? BURR JAYSON They were to form at the depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw the crowd . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , we may not get in the hall , but we 'll form at the depot , anyway . We 've started this thing ; now , by golly , we 've got to go through with it . If the Prohibitionists will promise to follow a bartender , I 'll lead the way  --  I 'll go through with it . EDITH HOLDEN It 's awfully kind of you to interest yourself in other people 's troubles , Mr. Holliday . BURR JAYSON I should say so . BILLY HOLLIDAY I 've made up my mind to get even with that fellow , if I have to stay here a week to do it . What is it , local option here ? p. 52 BURR JAYSON Yes ; but Granger controls the votes on account of the brewery . That 's why the town is wet . We still keep up the fight , though we live in hopes . EDITH HOLDEN Do you believe in Prohibition , Mr. Holliday ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , hardly ; that 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , that 's so , I forgot . ( Pats his hands . ) There you are , all finished . BILLY HOLLIDAY Thank you .

All rise at sound of his voice . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY Here it comes ; I 'm pinched . ( Crosses to Chief over R. ) I guess I 'm the man you 're after . CHIEF CRANDALL Did you pull his nose ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes ; what of it ? CHIEF CRANDALL ( Extends his hand . ) Put it there ! ( They shake hands . All laugh . ) The town ought to chip in and give you a loving cup .

( Shakes hands with the CHIEF , then goes upstage C. , gets his hat and cane and comes downstage L. of manicure table . ) CHIEF CRANDALL I 'm going down to the drugstore and tell Dave Whitely about it . He hates him worse than I do . ( To HOLLIDAY , over L. ) I 'm much obliged , young fellow . ( Starts up R. ) BILLY HOLLIDAY Do n't mention it ; it was a pleasure . ( All laugh . ) REV . T. B.

No , really .

BILLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked for yet , and I do n't know whether I can or not ; but I 'm going to try to get you a square deal to-night if I lose an arm . BURR JAYSON You do n't think there 'll be any trouble , do you ? p. 57 BILLY HOLLIDAY I do n't think so . They 'll probably run me out of town , but that wo n't matter ; I 've got to go back to New York , anyway . ( Goes downstage L. and gets his hat and cane . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN Oh , Burr !

TEMPLE And just imagine  --  his first appearance as a public speaker . Why , the man was uncanny . Granger had a hundred or more hoodlums there for the purpose of breaking up the meeting . Not one of the speakers uttered a syllable that could be heard above the hissing and hooting . We said and did everything we could possibly think of to quiet them , but it seemed hopeless until Holliday jumped up on the platform with the American flag . REV . T. B. HOLDEN That was rather a happy thought . MRS . TEMPLE He kept waving the flag until the entire audience began to cheer  --  hoodlums and all  --  and then he requested them all to stand up and sing the " Star Spangled Banner . " REV . T. B. HOLDEN Yes , Edith was telling me that they tried to sing it . p. 61 MRS . TEMPLE They tried , but , my dear , they did n't know it  --   --  ( Laughs . ) Not one of them . They started to hum the tune and mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He offered a prize of five dollars in gold to any man in the hall who would come forward and sing the national anthem . REV . T. B. HOLDEN And no one responded ? MRS . TEMPLE No , not one . And that 's when he said : " You 're a fine bunch of Americans . " ( Both laugh . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN And so he went over to the piano and taught them the song , eh ? MRS . TEMPLE Yes ; made them repeat line after line until they knew every word of it . They must have applauded him two minutes after that . I never heard such a demonstration in all my life . And then he started to talk . ( Rises . ) I tell you , he had that audience absolutely spellbound for over half an hour . He had them shrieking with laughter one minute and sitting on edge the next . Have you read his speech ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN I was just finishing it when you came . He has rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of his remarks are quite beyond my comprehension . p. 62 MRS . TEMPLE ( Takes stage C. ) Oh , I do wish you could have heard him . It was n't particularly what he said  --  the man 's personality stood out like a house afire . ( Imitates HOLLIDAY 'S delivery . ) " Why allow yourselves to be ruled by a man who has not seen the inside of a church in over twenty years ? " ( Both laugh . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN Referring to Granger , I suppose ? MRS . TEMPLE Of course he was . ( Starts for R. table . ) He did n't mention any names  --  he called him the Czar . ( Both laugh , as she sits L. of table . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( As he picks up paper from table . ) This is not a bad line of his here . ( Reads . ) " There is a pathway of happiness  --  it leads to church . Hit the trail , young man ; hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about the baseball game caught the crowd . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Perhaps this is what you mean . ( Reads . ) " The score stands 2 to 1 in favor of the saloon keeper , but the game is young . Stand up to the plate , young man , and make ' em be good . Never swing at the first one . Look out for the high balls . Let them go by and you 'll get on , and once you 're on , you 've got them in the hole . Get to second , slide to third , and you 'll come home with the run that ties the score and gives us a chance to beat the Boozers . " ( Looks up , perplexed . ) I do n't quite follow him , do you ? p. 63 MRS . TEMPLE Why , yes ; he 's speaking in baseball vernacular . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Oh , I see ! MRS . TEMPLE Tell me , Parson . What do you think of it all ? REV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chronicle telephoned me a while ago asking for my views on the matter , but , as I told them , I ca n't very well endorse the man , and knowing no reason why I should condemn him , I 'd rather not be quoted at all . However , I will say that I sincerely trust Mr. Holliday 's advice to the young men of this town , " to desert the saloon and go to church , " will have its effect . MRS . TEMPLE You know , I really believe it will . I tell you , he fairly hypnotized the people . ( Telephone on table rings . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN Pardon me just a moment . ( Picks up Phone . ) MRS . TEMPLE ( As she rises . ) Oh , do n't bother about me ; I must go , really . ( Starts up L. ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( In Phone . ) Hello ! . YesOh , hello , Rex ! MRS .

Why , surely , I 'll be here All right , come over Very well , I 'll be looking for you . ( Hangs up , rises , and goes up C. to MRS . TEMPLE . ) He 's coming over here to see me . Something of importance , he says . MRS . TEMPLE ( Laughs as she extends her hand . ) Well , I 'll hurry along before he gets here . I can imagine his frame of mind to-day after all that happened last night . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Edith will be home shortly . Wo n't you stay and lunch with us ? MRS . TEMPLE No , I must go ; thanks awfully , just the same . ( Four cheers off-stage left . ) ( MRS . TEMPLE goes to window L. and looks out . ) ( ANNA enters from R. at sound of cheers . ) REV .

Yes , that 's who it is , Billy Holliday . See , he 's bowing to them . ( One cheer offstage . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN What in the world are they doing out there ? MRS . TEMPLE They 're coming in . ( HOLDEN crosses to R. C. ) Just look at that crowd , will you ! ( Offstage : HOLLIDAY ! ( 4 ) ; Speech ! ( 2 ) ; Cheer ! ( 1 ) . ANNA ( Ushers JAYSON and HOLLIDAY in , then exits L. ) ( MRS .

( After shaking hands with HOLDEN , JAYSON crosses to R. bookcase , places his hat on it , then comes to R. of HOLDEN. ) p. 66 BILLY HOLLIDAY ( As he shakes hands with HOLDEN . ) Thanks , but I deserve to be pitied . I have n't been able to move without that mob at my heels all day . MRS . TEMPLE ( Comes down to L. of HOLLIDAY . ) Well , you 're quite a popular young man . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Turns to her . ) Oh , how do you do , Mrs. Temple . Yes ; I do n't know yet what it 's all about . ( Offstage : HOLLIDAY ! ( 2 ) Speech !

HOLDEN Perhaps they will disperse if you say a few words . BURR JAYSON Yes ; they wo n't be satisfied unless you do . BILLY HOLLIDAY No , thanks ; I said all I could say last night . I do n't know how I ever thought of that , to tell you the truth . ( Cheering Offstage. ) p. 67 MRS . TEMPLE ( As she opens L. window . ) Just come to the window and show yourself . Thank them , that 's all that 's necessary . ( JAYSON and HOLDEN are urging HOLLIDAY toward the window , all talking ad. lib . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( After repeated urgings from JAYSON and HOLDEN , he finally braces himself and goes to the window . As he jumps up on window seat and raises his hand , the crowd offstage applauds . HOLLIDAY turns and grins at people on stage . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thank you . What more can I say than that which I have already said . ( One cheer .

( Laugh , cheer and applause . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Turns to people on stage . ) How was that ? ALL Fine ! Splendid ! Go on , etc . BILLY HOLLIDAY The water wagon rolls over the Avenue of Prosperity and carries its passengers by the prisons and madhouses safely to the doors of the church . It 's a free ride , boys , so hop on and let 's all make the trip together . I thank you . ( Offstage : Three cheers for Billy Holliday ! Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! HOLLIDAY closes the window , picks up his hat from couch , where he he has thrown it on going to window , and goes C. ) p. 68 MRS . TEMPLE Splendid ! REV . T. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You should have heard him last night . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Laughs . ) You know , if you keep on telling me that I 'll begin to believe it . MRS . TEMPLE ( As she comes down to R. of HOLLIDAY . ) You 're far too modest , Mr. Holliday . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Wo n't you be seated ? ( Crosses downstage to R. of R. table . ) BURR JAYSON ( As he starts R. ) I 've got to sit down and rest for a minute . Gosh , they did jostle us , did n't they ? ( Sits above R. table . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Starts R. ) If they 'd kept on accumulating for a few more blocks we 'd have had the whole town with us , that 's all . MRS .

HOLDEN Stringing ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I mean , are you serious ? ( Sits L. of table . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN Indeed I am ; I 'm very much interested . It 's all very strange to me . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Laughs . ) Well , believe me , it is n't half as strange to you as it is to me . I never made a speech in my life before until last night . I did n't realize what I was doing until I got started , and even then I did n't know what I was saying . I lost my temper , and was up on that platform before I knew where I was at . They would n't listen to the others , so I did n't suppose they 'd listen to me , but when they quieted down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do but talk  --  and so I talked . I thought I was gone fifty times , but I kept right on talking . Every time I 'd stick I 'd think of that fellow Granger , and I 'd get so mad that the words just naturally came to me , that 's all . p. 70 REV . T. B. HOLDEN I never heard of such a thing ! MRS . TEMPLE ( As she rises and goes to C. ) It certainly was a wonderful night ! BURR JAYSON They want him to speak over in Weymouth . The Y. M. C. A. people called me up from there this morning  --   --  ( MRS . TEMPLE goes to L. of JAYSON. )  --   --  and asked me to make arrangements for him to speak under their auspices tomorrow evening , but Mr. Holliday says he wo n't do it . MRS . TEMPLE Why not ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Do n't make me laugh . REV . T. B. HOLDEN The Y. M. C. A ! Well , you must have made an imprsssion . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was telling him . MRS . TEMPLE ( As she comes down to L. of HOLLIDAY . ) Oh , you should go , by all means , Mr. Holliday . BILLY HOLLIDAY Go ? What for ? Why , I could n't get away with a thing like that again in a thousand years . ( MRS . TEMPLE turns L. ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN You mean you have n't confidence in yourself ? p. 71 BILLY HOLLIDAY That 's exactly what I mean . I went through with the thing last night simply because they tried to give Mr. Jayson the worst of it and refused to give him the hall , but so far as the speech-making was concerned , the whole thing was a joke with me . I got even with the Granger people , that 's all I care about . MRS . TEMPLE ( Over to L. of HOLLIDAY . ) Do n't be silly ! If you could win over a hostile crowd as you did last night , what could you do with a friendly audience ? BURR JAYSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. B. HOLDEN Of course , most lecturers and preachers carry a certain air of dignity which possibly you lack , but nevertheless , your speech as I read it just now , contains many flashes of brilliancy . And what makes it doubly interesting is the very original way you have of saying things . ( HOLLIDAY looks enquiringly at MRS . TEMPLE . She nods . ) ( He repeats same business with JAYSON , then turns to HOLDEN . ) Of course , you intend to continue in this field ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Hey ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN I say , you intend continuing in this field BILLY HOLLIDAY What field ? p. 72 REV . T. B. HOLDEN As a speaker , I mean . BILLY HOLLIDAY No , Mr. Holden , I 'm taking the three o'clock train back this afternoon to the field where I belong . Bartending is my trade . ( As MRS .

( Hands HOLLIDAY a paper . ) Big headlines , see ? ( Crosses and gives HOLDEN and JAYSON a paper . ) A full account of the whole thing , and every word of your speech in every one of them . You 've caused a sensation . ( Crosses to MRS . TEMPLE and hands her a paper . ) Just look at this , Mrs. Temple  --  New York paper ! I tell you , Johnsburg is some pumpkins to-day !

BILLY HOLLIDAY If everyone knows it , what 's the use of proving it ? REX GRANGER You better be careful who you talk to .

BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Turns to GRANGER . ) I may be an upstart , but I 'm a self-starter , and that 's more than that funny son of yours can say . EDITH HOLDEN Come , Mr. Holliday .

HOLDEN Made a speech , I understand . p. 80 REX GRANGER Yes , and started a near riot . Johnsburg wo n't be safe to live in forty-eight hours from now unless we all get together and run him out of town . He worked the people up to such a pitch last night that the Mayor shot out an order to close all the saloons at ten o'clock for fear of violence ; that 's how serious it is . And now to-day , with all that truck in the New York and Boston papers , why they 're ready to burn down the brewery or dynamite the new hotel , or do some fool thing that will bring disgrace on the citizens and probably cause bloodshed . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Oh , I hardly think it is as bad as that , Rex . REX GRANGER You do n't , eh ?

They 're looking for trouble , and this man Holliday is to blame for it all . ( Goes up R. ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( As he rises . ) Well , what can I do ? REX GRANGER ( Comes down to above table . ) I 'll tell you what you can do . You can advise the Y. M. C. A. people in Weymouth not to bring him over there . I got a tip that he 's to speak there tomorrow night . p. 81 REV . T. B. HOLDEN Then why not let him go to Weymouth if you want him out of town ? REX GRANGER Because I 've got money invested there . I own a half interest in the East Weymouth Brewery . Do you think I want that town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask a favor yourself some day . REV . T. B. HOLDEN I never ask favors . I do the best I can on my own . I 've had quite a struggle in the past few years holding the church together . I 've even had to call upon my little girl to assist in the support of our home . That 's why she went to work . But through all my worries I 've never asked favors . ( GRANGER goes L. , HOLDEN following . ) The only favor I could possibly ask of you , Rex , is to set an example to the young men of the town by coming to prayer meeting once in a while . REX GRANGER I 'm a business man . What right have you to criticise me for not going to church ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN No more right than you have to criticise me for entertaining Mr. Holliday .

But you can afford to bring him into your home and entertain him  --  is that the way you feel about it ? What kind of a citizen do you call yourself ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN You 'll find me a pretty tough citizen if you force me to take off my coat . REX GRANGER What do you mean ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN I 'm in splendid condition ; I go to gymnasium every day . You 've said quite enough  --  now get out . REX GRANGER Wait a minute  --  I did n't mean to hurt your feelings .

( Goes upstage C. ) DEAN GRANGER ( Follows GRANGER up C. ) That 's what I came here to tell you . They walked out twenty minutes ago . ( Both come downstage C. ) The West Johnsburg men have joined them , and I understand they 've struck in Weymouth , too . p. 84 REX GRANGER What do they demand ? DEAN GRANGER More pay . They heard about Holliday getting a hundred dollars a week , and they held an indignation meeting in front of the Court House this morning . REX GRANGER ( Turns R. to GRANGER . ) See ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked Mulligan 's place . REX GRANGER They did ? DEAN GRANGER Yes  --  three arrests made . You could hear them hollering a block away .

TEMPLE . ) ( As he comes down L. C. ) Did somebody call me ? ( As DEAN turns to him . ) Hello , Chesty , how 's your little wrist watch ? ( Laughs . ) Gee , I bet I get on your nerves , do n't I ? REX GRANGER ( To DEAN , after a slight pause . ) Well , go on ! Why do n't you do what you said you were going to do ? You promised me that the first time you laid eyes on him you 'd thrash him within an inch of his life .

REX GRANGER I 'll do worse than that to you when I get you alone . ( Crosses to HOLLIDAY , who is sitting on L. couch , laughing . ) I 'll give you just one hour to get out of this town . REV . T. B.

That 's the check I got from the moving picture people yesterday , and I made up my mind last night that I had n't any more right to it than I 'd have to break into Johnsburg and rob the town treasury . I finally concluded to put it to good use , and while I was in church this morning  --   --  BURR JAYSON Eh ! p. 110 BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes , I was in church this morning  --  the first time in six years .

EDITH HOLDEN It seems almost too good to be true , does n't it ? BILLY HOLLIDAY You know , I still expect a colored porter to come and tell me that we 'll be in in ten or fifteen minutes , and I 'll roll right out of this lower berth . EDITH HOLDEN Oh , it 's no dream , Mr. Holliday ; it 's all real . And after you 've delivered this speech in Weymouth to-night you 'll wake up to the fact that you 're a pretty big man . Why , this is the greatest thing I ever read in my life . BILLY HOLLIDAY How can you say that ? You know , it 's just the dope that you helped me dig up from that big book . EDITH HOLDEN Yes , but it 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've mixed in with the facts . And then , of course , I have in mind that wonderful delivery of yours . BILLY HOLLIDAY Listen ; whether you mean it or not , keep talking like that , will you ? It makes me feel great . ( Looks at copy of speech . ) Is it all finished ? p. 117 EDITH HOLDEN It 's all there . ( Lays it on desk . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'll never learn half of it . EDITH HOLDEN You do n't have to learn it . Keep it in front of you . ( Goes L. to her desk . ) Read it , if necessary ; all the big speakers do that . BILLY HOLLIDAY Every time you talk you make it easier for me . ( Rises and goes down to above her chair . ) You know , if I thought it would n't sound mushy , I 'd say something awfully nice to you . EDITH HOLDEN I wish I could think of something awfully nice to say to you for all your kindness to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , poring over speech . ) EDITH HOLDEN ( Following him . ) It was so fine of you  --  so unselfish . No one but a great big man could ever have thought of such a thing . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Reading from speech . ) " The only other time I ever spoke before the Y. M. C. A. was to complain about the shower bath in the gymnasium . " ( To EDITH . ) I wonder if I 'll get a laugh on that ? p. 118 EDITH HOLDEN Wo n't you please listen to what I 'm saying ? BILLY HOLLIDAY ( As telephone rings . ) Pardon me just a moment . ( Goes to below desk and picks up phone . ) Hello ! Yes , who is it ? Oh , I see ! Hold the wire a second and I 'll put the manager on . ( To EDITH , as he muffles the phone . ) Talk about quick action ! EDITH HOLDEN What is it ? BURR JAYSON ( Enters from R. and comes down to R. of HOLLIDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the barber shop , and send a chef out to the kitchen , and tell another fellow to take charge of the dining room ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Oh , yes , I forgot to tell you . They came to work at the new hotel , but I met them at the depot and arranged with them to come here under your management . BURR JAYSON Why , I do n't understand . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , Granger tried to disorganize your staff  --  now we 're going to get even and disorganize his . BURR JAYSON But I ca n't afford such a thing . Why  --   --  ! p. 119 BILLY HOLLIDAY Here , you 're wanted on the phone . ( Hands JAYSON the phone and goes to above desk and sits . ) BURR JAYSON Eh ? ( Takes phone and sits R. of desk . ) Hello ! Yes What ? Who ? Yes , I understand . How many ? Two hundred and fifty ! Are you serious ? Why , yes , but I ca n't fill such an order You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can Very well , good-bye . ( Puts phone on table . ) Cobb , Bates and Yerkser , of Boston , want 250 cases of Nearly Beer as quick as they can get it . EDITH HOLDEN What ! BILLY HOLLIDAY Oh , yes , I forgot to tell you . I ran a little ad. in the Boston papers this morning . Here it is ; see how you like it . ( Picks up paper from desk and hands it to JAYSON . ) BURR JAYSON ( Takes paper , rises , and goes down R. reading ad. , followed by EDITH . ) " Nearly Beer , cool and refreshing . Billy Holliday 's favorite drink . " EDITH HOLDEN Is n't that perfectly great ! ( Takes the paper and goes L. ) p. 120 BILLY HOLLIDAY I just wanted to see how it would work . That 's a pretty good order , is n't it ? BURR JAYSON 250 cases ? Why , it will take me a week to fill the order . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , you 'd better work fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York papers tomorrow ; and if this Boston demand is any criterion , you 'll be a busy little fellow for the next few days . ( Rises and goes down to L. of JAYSON . ) By the way , where do you make the stuff ? BURR JAYSON Nearly Beer ? Down in the cellar . BILLY HOLLIDAY That 'll never do . If the people start buying you 've got to have more room . Is n't there some old shop  --  some old factory near by that 's big enough to convert into a temporary plant ? BURR JAYSON Not that I know of . EDITH HOLDEN ( As she comes C. ) There 's the old bottling works on West Hoover Street . BILLY HOLLIDAY Bottling works ? Who owns it ? BURR JAYSON Burnham , the coal dealer . He 's right here in town . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , go and find him ; give him a talk . Try to grab it . ( Turns C. ) Bottling works ! Just the thing ! p. 121 BURR JAYSON But that 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Picks up check , goes above desk and endorses it . ) Here 's a check for five thousand dollars . It 's payable to me ; I 'll make it payable to you ; you make it payable to him .

( Holds check out to JAYSON . ) BURR JAYSON ( Refusing the check . ) Why , I could n't do anything like that . BILLY HOLLIDAY Certainly you can . You can pay me back . BURR JAYSON No , I could n't . BILLY HOLLIDAY You want me to make this speech in Weymouth tonight , do n't you ? BURR JAYSON Why , of course . BILLY HOLLIDAY Then go on and do as I tell you or I 'll pack up and take the first train back to New York . ( Forces check into JAYSON 'S hand and sits above desk . ) BURR JAYSON ( As he goes upstage R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to answer . p. 122 BILLY HOLLIDAY Look what I 've got to answer  --  a million letters . Go on , get that bottling works . BURR JAYSON Yes , sir . ( Gets his hat up R. , then comes down to R. of desk . ) And shall I keep these people you 've put to work ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Certainly . The only way to fight Granger is with his own weapons . PETE ( Enters from R. ) A telegram for you , Mr. Jayson . ( Hands it to JAYSON . ) BURR JAYSON ( Hands telegram to HOLLIDAY . ) Open it , will you ? I 'm so nervous I 'm shivering like a leaf . ( HOLLIDAY opens wire . ) PETE Those are certainly two swell manicure girls down in the barber shop . There 's over twenty fellows in there waiting to get shaved . ( Exits R. ) BILLY HOLLIDAY See ? Business is booming already . ( Reads telegram . ) " Express immediately 200 cases Billy Holliday 's favorite drink . Wheeling and Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLDEN 200  --  that 's 450 cases . p. 123 BURR JAYSON That 's the first order I ever got from Providence BILLY HOLLIDAY It 's the first time Providence ever ordered anything . EDITH HOLDEN ( Starts R. , passing above desk . ) I 'm going to see what those manicure girls look like . ( Exits R. ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To JAYSON , as he rises . ) You 'll have to put on high speed to supply this demand . Go on get that bottling works . ( Starts L. ) ( Goes to L. table , opens box and puts on his frock coat . ) BURR JAYSON Lord , I 'm so excited I do n't know what I 'm doing . ( Starts R. and meets GRANGER entering . ) REX GRANGER I want to see you , Jayson . BURR JAYSON Not now . I ca n't wait . You 'll have to make it later . I 'm in an awful hurry . ( Exits R. ) ( GRANGER comes to R. of desk and watches HOLLIDAY . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. of desk , props speech in front of him , strikes a pose and declaims . ) " And that which is supposedly the most harmless of all the alcoholic concoctions is the deadliest poison a man can possibly put to his lips . I refer to that filthy intoxicating beverage commonly known as beer . p. 124 REX GRANGER Are you going to make that speech in Weymouth tonight ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Sure ; are you coming over to hear me ? REX GRANGER I do n't think you 're realizing the harm you 're doing , Holliday . You 've talked these fool people into taking a stand against the industry that supports the town , and the town of Weymouth , too . Over 900 men are employed in the two plants and they all have families to support . Now it 's in my power to close the doors of both these breweries and throw these men out of work . If this happens there 'll be the damndest , free-for-all fight ever known in the history of New England . I 'm putting it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do ? Preach them out of their jobs , or go about your business and leave the town the way you found it ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , I could n't leave it much worse than I found it ; a community scared to death and shaking in its boots at a big , blustering , bull-dozing , tin-horn millionaire that makes the rules and regulations by which the people all live and breathe , and talks loud and pounds the table and frightens children , and runs things in general to suit his own whims and conveniences ; and allows his nasty-tempered , irritating , cowardly offspring to go about insulting everyone who does n't happen to bow down and make way and sing , " Here comes the King " everytime he approaches . That 's the way I found this town , Mr. Granger . People turning pale and trembling at sight of you and your son . That 's why I took the stand for Mr. Jayson the other day ; because a kind , timid old gentleman , was getting a raw deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you get away with it . That 's why I went to the front for those poor devils at Johnsburg Hall the same night ; because you tried to give them the worst of it , and I just naturally made up my mind that you would n't . You forced me to lead that parade . You forced me up on that platform , and the result is that a well known New York bartender making a speech in favor of temperance under the auspices of the Prohibition party was novelty enough for the Associated Press to shoot the story from one end of the country to the other and put me in a class with Bryan , Roosevelt and the Kaiser  --  so you see you brought the whole thing on yourself . It 's your fault that this speech is written . It 's your fault that I 'm going to make it . It 's your fault that this town is in the condition it is today , so do n't blame me because it 's all your own fault . ( Walks toward L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you something else . Now that I 've been able to get that off my chest , I 'm satisfied that I 'm a regular speech-maker and I just made up my mind that I 'm never going to tend bar again as long as I live . ( Walks up and down L. studying speech. ) p. 125 DEAN GRANGER ( Enters from R. and comes to above GRANGER . ) Say , Governor , do you know what this fellow 's done . He 's stolen all our help that we brought on from New York . He 's got them all working here in this hotel . REX GRANGER How do you know ? DEAN GRANGER I just found out . The manicures , the chef , and the head waiter all started in here an hour ago . REX GRANGER Are you sure ? DEAN GRANGER Certainly . I just gave those two women down in the barber shop a piece of my mind . It told them what I thought of them , all right . BILLY HOLLIDAY If I catch you in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strop . ( Walks up and down L. ) REX GRANGER ( Crosses downstage to R. of HOLLIDAY . ) Say , what are you trying to do ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'm trying to learn this speech . I 'm very busy . If I was n't , I 'd take Dare Devil Dick there and manicure one of his eyes . REX GRANGER ( As he goes up L. of desk to DEAN over R. ) If you 're a son of mine go and smash him . p. 126 BILLY HOLLIDAY ( As he goes to L. of desk and lays copy of speech on it . ) If he was a son of mine I 'd smash him , all right . ( Starts muttering inaudibly and making extravagant gestures as if delivering a speech . ) DEAN GRANGER ( As he watches HOLLIDAY . ) Do you think I want any trouble with a crazy man ? Look at him ! ( GRANGER turns and looks at HOLLIDAY . ) He 's a lunatic , I tell you . REX GRANGER ( Turns to HOLLIDAY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that I mean business . I 'll close the doors of those breweries unless you agree to cut out this crusade . ( HOLLIDAY sits above desk . ) If those people are thrown out of work on your account your life wo n't be worth a nickel , because I 'm going to tell them point blank that they ca n't come back to work until they drive you out of town . Well , have you got anything to say ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Sure ; over 3,000 words , if you 'll give me a chance to learn them . ( Pores over speech . ) ( DEAN turns toward R. lower door . ) REX GRANGER Remember , you 're taking your life in your hands . You do n't know what brewery people are . ( Turns R. toward upper door. ) p. 127 DEAN GRANGER You do n't know what breweries mean . BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes , I do ; twenty-eight million , five hundred and fifty thousand , six hundred and sixty-two .

TEMPLE enters from R. and stands in doorway . ) The Connecticut agency ? Yes , I think so . What 's your proposition , and I 'll put it up to Mr. Jayson Guarantee 3,000 cases a month ? Well , some people in New Haven are after it . I think if you make it 5,000 cases you 'll get it Well , we 'll hold it open till six o'clock . ( MRS . TEMPLE , comes down to R. of desk . ) All right , wire usGood-bye . ( Rises and makes notes on pad . ) Mrs. Temple ! p. 128 MRS . TEMPLE Mr. Holliday . I heard you were in here . Am I intruding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders over the phone for Nearly Beer ; it 's selling like wildfire . MRS . TEMPLE It 's impossible to get near a soda fountain in town . The striking bartenders have caused a great how-do-you-do . BILLY HOLLIDAY So I understand . MRS . TEMPLE ( As she crosses above desk to L. of it . ) I just came from the Holdens . I met the committee of church men from Philadelphia  --  delightful men . ( Sits L. of desk . ) Their idea is to build a temporary tabernacle that will seat about ten thousand people and bring you over there for a series of lectures . ( HOLLIDAY drops into seat above desk . ) They all agree that the very simplicity of your speech the other night was what made it so impressive , and that it was , without doubt , one of the greatest sermons ever preached .

( Rises . ) EDITH HOLDEN ( As she hands HOLLIDAY a telegram . ) Another telegram just came for you . ( As she comes down R. to below desk . ) You ought to see the crowd in the barber shop ? BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Opens wire as he comes downstage R. C. ) Were you down there when young Granger was in ? EDITH HOLDEN Yes . BILLY HOLLIDAY What did he say to those manicure girls ? EDITH HOLDEN Nothing ; he just walked in and walked out . He did n't say a word . Why ? BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Laughs as he turns up R. ) Nothing ; I just wanted to know . ( EDITH turns L. to MRS . TEMPLE. ) p. 130 MRS . TEMPLE ( To EDITH . ) New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just met them . MRS . TEMPLE Your father told me of the Church Fund Mr. Holliday has started .

BILLY HOLLIDAY Listen to this . ( Goes to women with open wire and reads . ) " Have sold over 200,000 copies of Star Spangled Banner during the last forty-eight hours . Will be glad to pay you two cents a copy providing you boost Yankee Doodle Dandy and My Country ' T is of Thee . M. Witmark and Sons , Music Publishers . " Can you beat that ! ( All laugh . ) JED CUSICK ( Enters from R. and comes down R. ) Where 's Mr. Jayson ? BILLY HOLLIDAY What do you want ? JED CUSICK Six cases of Nearly Beer for Whitely 's drugstore. p. 131 BILLY HOLLIDAY Go down in the cellar and get it . JED CUSICK Right ! ( Turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS .

EDITH HOLDEN He knows better than that ; he 's half sensible . BILLY HOLLIDAY Then tell him I 'm half dead . EDITH HOLDEN ( In phone . ) Mr. Holliday 's busy just now . Call later , please . Goodbye . ( As she puts phone down on desk . ) What do you suppose he wants ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Probably wants to enquire how to get out of Paterson . EDITH HOLDEN ( As she goes up R. of desk . ) Turn around , Mr. Holliday .

BILLY HOLLIDAY No , thanks , Mr. Jayson , I 've got all I can do to attend to my own business without going into any other . BURR JAYSON Bartending ? BILLY HOLLIDAY No , sir , preaching ! I 'm through with saloons . They 're building tabernacles for me . ( Turns upstage L. ) CHIEF CRANDALL ( Enters hurriedly from R. and comes down R. C. ) Where 's Mr. Holliday ? ( EDITH rises . ) BURR JAYSON What 's the trouble , Chief ? CHIEF CRANDALL All kinds of trouble . ( To HOLLIDAY , who comes down to L. of CHIEF . ) You better take it on the run , young fellow . They 're all coming this way and they 're madder than blue blazes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRANDALL The brewery crowd  --  the whole works . They shut down five minutes ago . The men were all told that they 're out of work till you 're run out of town . They 're on their way here now , about 300 strong , with fire in their eyes . You better scoot ; I 'm afraid you 're in for it if you do n't . They 're a desperate lot , and they 're meaner right now than I 've ever seen them before . I ran around Dover Street and headed them off so 's to warn you . EDITH HOLDEN ( Comes down L. of desk to L. of HOLLIDAY , who is C. ) Please hide , Mr. Holliday , please ! BURR JAYSON ( To CHIEF . ) How about the cellar ? Do you think they 'll find him there ? CHIEF CRANDALL I 'm afraid so . My advice is to sneak out the back way , hop in an automobile , and get out of town as quick as you can .

SECOND MAN We mean you 've got to get out of town . LEADER Yes , our jobs depend on it . If it was n't for that we would n't interfere one way or the other .

BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Throws his cane and gloves L. and goes to L. of desk . ) I mean a dollar a day more for every man than Granger is paying you , and you 're going to have a regular real , honest-to-God gentleman for a Boss . Boys , one of the biggest industries in New England is about to open up , and the plant is located right here in Johnsburg .

Gosh , those two towns went crazy ! REV . T. B. HOLDEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ? BILLY HOLLIDAY New York ? Oh , not till around Christmas time . I 've got two weeks in Philadelphia and then I go to Paterson for three nights , and then I jump out West until December . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Well , you have quite a trip booked . BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes , I 'm booked solid till 1917 . BURR JAYSON Gosh ! I 'd like to travel around like that and see the country . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Well , with the money you 're making , Burr , you can soon retire and see the whole world . How is business  --  big as ever ? BURR JAYSON Bigger  --  grows every twenty-four hours . How many cases was it to-day , Billy ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Seventeen thousand , nine hundred . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Just imagine ! BURR JAYSON Over 50,000 cases last week ; it 'll go seventy-five this . ( To HOLLIDAY . ) What was that concern that made the big offer by telegraph this afternoon ? p. 144 BILLY HOLLIDAY The Coca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( To HOLDEN . ) They offer a quarter of a million for a half interest . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Fancy such a thing ! Of course you 'll accept BURR JAYSON Billy wo n't let me . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , I should say not ! If it 's worth that much in two weeks ' time what 'll it be worth a month from now ? Why , you 'll get a million easy any time you want to go out of business . ( To HOLDEN . ) You know , he did n't think he could use 350 men at first . ( To JAYSON . ) Tell him what you had to do today ? BURR JAYSON Put thirty extra to work . BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes , and he 'll need a thousand before he knows it . I tell you , Nearly Beer is one of the greatest propositions that 's ever been put on the market . BURR JAYSON But only since you endorsed it , Billy . BILLY HOLLIDAY Do n't you believe it . ( Rises . ) My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , but i they had n't liked the drink they would n't have repeated the orders  --  that 's the real answer . ( Takes stage C. ) You know , endorsements , recommendations and trade-marks are all right as far as they go , but you take it from me , you 've got to have the stuff behind the advertising . You can spend ten fortunes in magazines , newspapers , painted signs and billboards , but if you do n't deliver the goods you have n't got a Chinaman 's chance on earth . All this stuff about the American public believing everything they read  --   --  ( Goes to L. of table. )  --   --  and following the leader like a lot of sheep , is bunk  --  if you know what that means  --  genuine , downright bunk . You 've got to satisfy the man that pays his money for the article you put on sale . If you do , he 'll say so . If you do n't he 'll say so . And word of mouth advertising is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I know what I 'm talking about . ( Sits L. of table. ) l tended bar for six or seven years , and believe me , the whiskey that really sells is n't advertised at all . Do they advertise Wurtzburger beer ? Do they advertise Corona-Corona cigars ? No . Why ? Because they do n't have to . They 've got the goods and it advertises itself . Now I 'll tell you something that I know to be a fact . The only theatre that packed them in and turned people away all last season was the only place of amusement in New York City that was n't advertised . For fifty weeks you could n't buy a seat at the Globe Theatre , and there was n't as much as a picture poster of Montgomery &amp; Stone in any part of the town . You know what Abraham Lincoln said about fooling the people . Well , he was right . Advertising 's a great thing  --  but you 've got to tell the truth . p. 145 BURR JAYSON Does n't he talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could listen for hours . And the strange part of it is I do n't know what in the world you 're talking about . ( HOLLIDAY laughs . ) You know the night I went to Weymouth to hear you speak , I really did n't understand half you said , but I 'm free to confess that I enjoyed every moment of the lecture . And I do n't think I 've ever seen an audience quite so enthusiastic . This remarkable success must be very gratifying . BILLY HOLLIDAY It is , Doctor . I think I 've done pretty well in two short weeks . I 've closed up two breweries , a couple of hundred saloons ; got the whole country quenching its thirst with a temperance drink ; made myself famous  --  and I 've got a little money in the bank besides . REV . T. B. HOLDEN And you forget  --  the Building Fund you started for my new church . It 's twenty-two thousand already . BURR JAYSON And look what you 've done for me . BILLY HOLLIDAY And look what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLDEN Yes , poor Granger ! BURR JAYSON You know , I honestly feel sorry for Rex . p. 146 REV . T. B. HOLDEN So do I. He was at prayer meeting last evening . BILLY HOLLIDAY Who , Granger ? BURR JAYSON ( In unison with HOLLIDAY 'S above line . ) Eh ? REV . T. B. HOLDEN Yes . BURR JAYSON You do n't say so ! REV . T. B. HOLDEN Yes , he came here to see me . HOLLIDAY AND JAYSON Oh ! REV . T. B. HOLDEN He waited for me afterward and we had quite a chat . ( To HOLLIDAY . ) He 's very anxious to have a talk with you before you leave town . BILLY HOLLIDAY Well , I 'm anxious to have a talk with him , too . I want to make him a proposition . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Good ! Then I did n't make any mistake in inviting him here this evening . BURR JAYSON Granger coming here ! REV . T. B. HOLDEN Yes . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Rises . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to see you and shake hands with you before you go . p. 147 BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Laughs , as he takes stage C. ) I wish I could believe that one . BURR JAYSON ( As he rises and goes down R. ) That does n't sound like Granger . REV . T. B. HOLDEN He 's a changed man , Burr . BURR JAYSON ( Crosses to HOLLIDAY L. C. ) What do you suppose he wants , Billy ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I do n't know , but you can take it from me , there 's a colored person in the woodpile , sure . ( At this point EDITH and MRS . TEMPLE enter from R. ) ( The latter comes down R. C. ) ( HOLDEN rises as he hears EDITH 'S voice . ) EDITH HOLDEN ( As she enters . ) Hello ! ( Comes downstage L.

BILLY HOLLIDAY Beautiful ? EDITH HOLDEN I can thank Mrs. Temple for this . MRS . TEMPLE ( Comes downstage C. ) Do n't you believe her , Billy ; she made it herself . ( Goes to R. of R. table and sits . ) ( JAYSON sits above R. table . ) EDITH HOLDEN But if she had n't furnished the material there would n't have been any dress . BILLY HOLLIDAY And if you had n't furnished the material I would n't have had any lectures . EDITH HOLDEN If you keep on talking like that I 'll believe it . BILLY HOLLIDAY If I 'm to keep on talking you 'll have to believe it . I could n't put 5,000 words together in 5,000 years without you .

JED CUSICK I want to excuse myself for coming in here , Parson , but the girl told me Mr. Holliday was here , and I 've got something to give him before he goes away . BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Rises and goes to L. of JED . ) Something for me ? JED CUSICK Yes , something that belongs to you  --  it ai n't mine any longer . Before I give it you , I want to thank you for not going around bragging . I know you have n't said a word ; if you had , everybody in town would be codding me . There 's half a dozen men in Johnsburg that will gloat over it when they find out , but it wo n't be half so bad if I tell them myself as it would be if you 'd gone around talking . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medal . ) Solid gold  --  cost fourteen dollars and a half . I never thought I 'd have to part with it , but you won it fair and square . EDITH HOLDEN ( Rises and goes to L. of HOLLIDAY . ) What is it ? p. 150 BILLY HOLLIDAY A medal ? ALL A medal ? BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Reads inscription on medal . ) " Undefeated champion checker player of Johnsburg . " ( ALL laugh . ) EDITH HOLDEN What do you think of that ? MRS .

The championship belongs to you . I 'm through with checkers  --  I 'm going to stick to the delivery business .

BILLY HOLLIDAY I do n't know . p. 153 EDITH HOLDEN ( Starts up C. ) Well , I certainly do n't want to see him . MRS . TEMPLE Neither do I. BURR JAYSON I 'm not particular about it myself .

BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Effusively . ) Well , upon my word , if it is n't Mr. Granger ! Well , well , this is a surprise ! Awfully glad to see you again , awfully glad ! ( Takes GRANGER 'S hand and shakes it , then turns to DEAN . ) And Dean ! ( Crosses to him . ) Well , well , Dean , I did n't expect to see you here ! This is a surprise . ( Takes DEAN 'S hand and shakes it . ) I 'm awfully glad to see you , awfully glad ! Here , give me your hat .

( ANNA puts hats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLIDAY brings chair downstage C. ) Sit , down . Mr. Granger . Sit down , Dean . ( Both men stand glaring at him . ) Well , here we are all together , like Brown 's cows . ( Sits C. ) You 're looking fine , Mr. Granger  --  never saw you looking better . ( Turns to DEAN . ) Well , Dean , old boy , how have you been ? I have n't seen you in a long time . Sit down , old pal . ( As both men still stand . ) What 's the matter ? Something wrong ? p. 155 REX GRANGER ( To HOLDEN , as he turns R. , smiling cynically . ) How are you , T. B. ? ( Sits L. of table . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN Very well , Rex , thank you . ( Sits R. of table . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To DEAN , who is still standing . ) Coming down to the station to see me off tomorrow , old pal ? DEAN GRANGER Say , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think we are , a couple of fools ? REX GRANGER ( Sternly . ) Shut up and sit down ! ( DEAN sits on L. couch . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Smilingly , to DEAN . ) There you go , you see ! I 'm trying to be nice to you , and you want to start the thing all over again . REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( To GRANGER . ) I 'm sure Dean misunderstands Mr. Holliday , Rex . I asked him as a favor to receive you cordially . REX GRANGER I understand . DEAN GRANGER ( Sullenly . ) Well , he need n't try to be funny . p. 156 REX GRANGER ( Furiously . ) That 's enough ! DEAN GRANGER Well  --   --   --  ! REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( As he rises . ) I 'll leave you gentlemen alone . I know there something you want to talk over privately . BILLY HOLLIDAY Do n't run away on my account , Doctor . REX GRANGER Nor mine , either . Anything I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. HOLDEN ( As he goes upstage R. ) I really must see that dinner is properly prepared ; and if I do say it myself , it 's going to be a splendid dinner . ( Exists R. ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To DEAN , in pretended seriousness . ) What do you think of that ! We 're going to have ice cream and everything . DEAN GRANGER Aw , what do you think I care about ice cream ; I do n't eat it . BILLY HOLLIDAY Oh , you 're just saying that to show off . DEAN GRANGER Aw  --   --   --  ! BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'll bet you 've got a bag of candy in your pocket right now . ( DEAN glares at HOLLIDAY , then turns away , enraged . ) ( HOLLIDAY laughs at him , then turns to GRANGER . ) Mr. Holden tells me there 's something you want to see me about , Mr. Granger. p. 157 REX GRANGER Yes , that 's the reason I said I 'd come here tonight when he invited me . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance I 'd have . I 've got a proposition I want to make . Now , you 're a business man and Jayson is n't . That 's why I thought I 'd better talk to you . BILLY HOLLIDAY Go right ahead . What 's on your mind . REX GRANGER The new hotel , that 's what 's on my mind . I 've got over two hundred thousand dollars invested there , and it should have opened a week ago . I 'll tell you the truth , Holliday ; I built that hotel to spite Jayson when he refused to put a bar in the American House . I 'm no fool , and I realize it 's worth a man 's life to try to sell liquor in this town right now , and I also know that at the next election it 'll go as dry as a desert . That 's why I have n't tried to renew operations at the brewery . Jayson intends building a big plant for the manufacture of Nearly Beer , does n't he ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I heard . Well , I 'm no hotel man  --  Jayson is . I 'll turn over the Johnsburg House to him just as it stands  --  ( Rises and faces HOLLIDAY. )  --  and I 'll turn over the brewery to him , too . It can easily be equipped for any manufacturing purpose  --  and it 's worth a half a million dollars . p. 158 BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Rises . ) Let me understand you . ( As he picks up chair and goes up C. ) Let me get this clear . ( As he comes downstage he looks over and smiles at DEAN , who has been watching him . The latter turns sulkily away . ) ( To GRANGER , as he comes down C. ) You 'll turn over the new hotel ? REX GRANGER Yes . BILLY HOLLIDAY And you 'll turn over the plant ? REX GRANGER Yes , and I 'll make him an equal partner . I 'll give him a clear fifty per cent . ownership . BILLY HOLLIDAY What 's the consideration for all this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLIDAY looks over and smiles tantalizingly at DEAN . ) That 's what I want , and with my knowledge of a business of this kind I 'll guarantee to show one of the biggest outputs in the United States in no time at all . BILLY HOLLIDAY We can show that now , and we 're only two weeks old . REX GRANGER I know but you have n't the practical experience that 's necessary to make it a great big concern . I 've got all the facilities for the bottling , packing , shipping , and general handling of the goods . Why , it would take you a year to shoot up a plant like mine . I think I 'm making you a pretty handsome offer . p. 159 BILLY HOLLIDAY We 've had other offers , Mr. Granger . REX GRANGER I know you have . But just stop to think , young man ; I 've got a fortune tied up in this town . And do n't forget that I 've been driven out of business . Do n't you think I deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you do . But I do n't know whether Mr. Jayson will feel the same way about it or not . REX GRANGER You 're his partner , ai n't you ? BILLY HOLLIDAY No , I 'm not interested at all , Mr. Granger . DEAN GRANGER ( Sarcastically , as he rises . ) No , I guess not ! BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To GRANGER . ) Make him sit down , will you ? REX GRANGER ( To DEAN . ) Down ! DEAN GRANGER Aw  --   --  ! ( Sits on L. couch . ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To GRANGER . ) What you 're trying to buy and pay a big price for , I refused as a present less than two weeks ago . I 've picked out my line of business and I 'm going to stick to it . I 'm going to preach temperance from one end of this country to the other  --  and I 'm on the level with it , too . p. 160 REX GRANGER ( In a confidential tone , smiling cynically . ) There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? BILLY HOLLIDAY Yes , a whole lot of it . The vice-president of the Amalgamated Brewers and Distillers of America came to Johnsburg forty-eight hours ago and offered me a hundred thousand dollars for the next five years to keep my mouth closed , but you see I 'm still talking . That 's how much I care about the money , Mr. Granger . REX GRANGER Well , will you talk to Jayson and explain to him what I 'm willing to do ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'll do all I can to help you , Mr. Granger . And if you 'll guarantee not to interfere with the management of the concern , I think I can arrange things along the lines you 've mapped out . REX GRANGER You need n't be afraid of that . All I want to do is to protect the money I 've got invested here , and this is my only chance . ( As he turns down R. ) I 'm going to move to New York , anyway . DEAN GRANGER ( As he rises . ) Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down ! DEAN GRANGER ( Starts to comply ; then , as he realizes it is HOLLIDAY speaking , he rises and goes angrily up L. He comes downstage L. again as ANNA enters ) p. 161 ANNA ( Enters from R. ) The Parson says dinner is served whenever you-all gentlemen is ready . BILLY HOLLIDAY Very well , Anna , we 'll be right there . ANNA Yaas , sir . ( Exits R. ) BILLY HOLLIDAY ( To GRANGER . ) We 'll get together after dinner and talk the matter over with Mr. Jayson . They 're waiting for us ; we 'd better go in . ( Starts up C. ) REX GRANGER Wait a minute , please . ( Crosses to Dean . HOLLIDAY drops down R. ) Dean , I want you to shake hands with Mr. Holliday and apologize for the way you 've acted toward him ever since he 's been in town . DEAN GRANGER What ! REX GRANGER That 's what I brought you here for . I heard all about your actions in the barber shop the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Now , I want you to shake hands with him and ask his pardon . ( After a slight pause . ) Go on . DEAN GRANGER Well , I guess not ! What do you think I am ! p. 162 REX GRANGER Dean Granger , if you do n't do as I tell you I 'll cut you off without a nickel . Not one dollar of my money will you ever get as long as you live unless you apologize to this gentleman right now . Do you understand ? DEAN GRANGER Well , I 'm not going to apologize ; not if I have to starve for the rest of my life . REX GRANGER Do you mean that ? DEAN GRANGER You bet I mean it ! REX GRANGER Give me your hand , son . ( Shakes DEAN 'S hand . ) I just wanted to try you . I 'd made up my mind to kick you out if you had n't taken the stand you did . ( Looks over at HOLLIDAY , smiling proudly , as he pats DEAN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to you , after all . ( Crosses to HOLLIDAY , laughing . ) He is n't as big a coward as you thought he was , is he ? BILLY HOLLIDAY No , not half as big . DEAN GRANGER What do you mean by that ! BILLY HOLLIDAY ( Crosses to DEAN . GRANGER drops down R. ) I 'd like to shake hands with you on that myself , Dean . I did n't think you were game enough to go through like that . ( Extends his hand to DEAN. ) p. 163 REX GRANGER ( As DEAN looks over at him . ) Go on , shake hands with him . DEAN GRANGER ( As he puts his hands in his pockets . ) I 'll never shake hands with you until you apologize for pulling my nose . BILLY HOLLIDAY I would n't apologize to you for a million dollars . DEAN GRANGER Do you mean that ? BILLY HOLLIDAY You can bet I mean it ! DEAN GRANGER Then you 're twice the man I thought you were . Shake !

( Shakes his hand. ) p. 164 DEAN GRANGER We 're going to New York to live . EDITH HOLDEN That 's good . DEAN GRANGER What do you mean by that ? ( EDITH comes down to R. of HOLLIDAY . ) REV . T. B. HOLDEN ( Enters from R. ) Come along , Rex , dinner is served . REX GRANGER Right with you , T. B. ( As he goes up R. of table . ) Come on , Dean . DEAN GRANGER ( Sulkily , as he drops down R. C. ) I do n't want any dinner ; I 'm not hungry . REX GRANGER Come on , I tell you . ( HOLDEN exits R. ) DEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLIDAY , as they laugh . ) What are you laughing at ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'm just wondering what you 'll do to Broadway . DEAN GRANGER ( As he goes up C. ) Oh , I 've been to New York before . What do you think I am , a Rube ? REX GRANGER ( Impatiently . ) Come on , Dean . ( Exits R. ) p. 165 DEAN GRANGER ( As he goes R. ) Oh , that fellow makes me sick ! ( Exits R. ) ( EDITH and HOLLIDAY laugh . ) EDITH HOLDEN ( To HOLLIDAY . ) Tell me , what did Mr. Granger want to see you about ? BILLY HOLLIDAY He made me exactly the same proposition I was going to make to him . Mr. Jayson and I figured it out this afternoon . EDITH HOLDEN What was it ? BILLY HOLLIDAY I 'll tell you later . Are your things all packed ? EDITH HOLDEN Yes : but I 'm terribly nervous . BILLY HOLLIDAY Do you love me ? EDITH HOLDEN Crazy about you ! ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from R. , followed by JAYSON and MRS . TEMPLE . ) Listen , children I 've a great idea . We 'll surprise the Grangers . I 'll perform the ceremony before we sit down to dinner . What do you say ? ( JAYSON comes down R. ) ( MRS . TEMPLE comes down to L. of HOLLIDAY. ) p. 166 BILLY HOLLIDAY I say yes . EDITH HOLDEN Oh yes , let 's . MRS . TEMPLE Are you surprised , Mr. Jayson ? ( ALL laugh at JAYSON 'S look of amazement . ) BURR JAYSON I should say so ! Why , it 's like a story in the Saturday Evening Post . BILLY HOLLIDAY That 's just what it is . REV . T. B. HOLDEN Join hands , my children .
