txt It is believed that the Interborough Rapid Transit Company will make an attempt to re-enter the Subway situation before long . Pressure is being brought to bear upon it by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company , and an extension of the present plans so as to provide for a subway line down Seventh Avenue is likely to be proposed . Samuel Rea , Vice President of the Pennsylvania ; Mayor Gaynor , Borough President MeAneny , Controller Prendergast , Chairman Willcox of the Public Service Commission , and ex-Mayor Seth Low got together a few days ago and talked over the whole situation . As it did not appear that the Interborough was likely to recede to any considerable extent from the stand It took up in last Sum'nlet 's negotiations , insisting on a guaranteed dividend , little progress was made , Mayor Gaynor was in favor of giving the Interborough another opportunity of making an offer to the city , but Chairman Willcox and President MeAneny were not inclined to reopen the entire Subway situation unless there was some chance of an arrangement more favorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood , the support of President Mitchel of the Aldermen , the entire situation seems once more to be indeterminate . As things are , the assent of Mayor Gaynor is needed to the execution of an important part of the agreement reached by the Board of Estimate last July . He has now before him the resolution of the board approving the Queensboro Bridge route to Corona and Woodside which had been adopted by the Public Service Commission . This route , as it extends to Fifty-ninth Street and Seventh Avenue , would only be of use if the Broadway line , which was assigned by the agreement to the B. R. T. , were construeed . The Interborough has never favored the building of this and , consequently , the assent of the Mayor to It would range him on the side of those who approve of last Summer 's settlement . This he has always declared in his public utterances to be wasteful of the city 's money . The interest of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the matter lies in the fact . that its expensive station at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , at serious disadvantage In competing with the Grand Central , Consequently it has favored the construction of a subway down Seventh Avenue , which will bring passengers to its doors . With regard to this route the Public Service Commission has taken the stand that it can not proceed economically with the construction till the city has condemned the property necessary for the extension of the avenue and the widening of Varich Street , which is not likely to be accomplished till Jan. 1 , 1913 . If the subway was begun before , all the cost of changes in the thoroughfare might be charged up against the amount available for subways . When the matter of a new arrangement between the city and the Interborough was brought before Col. Williams , President of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , last night , he said : " We expect to carry out in good faith our part of the arrangement with the city , and we have every reason to believe that the city officials and the Public Service Commission will carry out their part with equal sincerity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the operating contract for the new subway system , which has been drawn up by the Public Service Commission in consultation with the B. R. T. , will come up shortly for consideration . Chairman Willcox , however , has always expressed the opinion that this contract should be so drawn that it should be possible for any company to bid under it . NEW LEXINGTON AVE . BIDS . Plans for Section South of 14th St. Have Been Redrawn to ' Save Money . The Public Service Commission wilt hold on Friday a public hearing to consider the proposed terms and conditions for the construction of Sections 1 to 4 of the Lexington Avenue Subway ; that is , for the section of the route which runs from the Battery and under Church and Greenwich Streets to Vesey Street , and thence under Broadway to Fourteenth Street . In doing so the commission is throwing aside the bids which were opened on Oct. 27 , 1910 . As originally advertised , the plan for this portion of the route called for a Subway with two tracks between the Battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , however , consider any connection with a tunnel to Brooklyn , as the bids were only invited on the original Lexington Avenue route without reference to any through line to Brooklyn . The amount of the lowest bids for the Subway from the Battery to Fourteenth Street was $23,119,820.45 , the lowest bidders being : Section . Contractor . Amount . 1 . O'Rourke Engineering Co $5.863,194.00 2 . IVIcArthur Brothers 7.677,404.20 2a . Bradley Contracting Co 2,323,342.75 3 . Bradley Contracting Co a , 619,315.00 4 . Bradley Contracting Co 3,716,304.50 Total V3,119,820.45 When Chairman Willcox was asked last night as to the reason for readvertising this particular stretch he , explained that it had been decided upon because certain economies could be effected by redrawing the plans and inviting new bids . ' As soon as the bids had been received for , the Lexington Avenue subway , " he said , " we went over them and saw what we could leave out and what must be proceeded with immediately .. Then the Interborough proposal came in and the entire situation with regard to subways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had adopted its resolution last July we sent over to the board for its consideration as many of the contracts as we felt that we could go ahead with at once . " Then it was found that certain modifications in several sections might ? be made ' In the interests of economy . Thus , on some of the sections uptown it was thought that it would be better to redraw them , and this involved readvertising and a public hearing on the modified contracts . Meanwhile our Chief Engineer had been going over the plans for the lower part of Manhattan , and decided that it would be better to redraw them . He does this now , and , - cense ' auentiy , before we advertise for bids ' on the new specifications , we are obliged by law to hold a public hearing . Thaths all there is to it . " It was pointed out to the Chairman that the report of last Summer'sugh gested that the new rapid traneitelina under Broadway h ' , should be : either a -4 ( 1114 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new system should determine . " Mr. Willcox said , however , that there lad been no decision as to whether the original , plans for a two and four track line should be abandoned in favor of a six-track line . That is , he declared , a matter to be taken up later . heeanwhile the Public Service Commission is also advertising for bids on Section 9 of the Lexington Avenue line , which extends from Sixty-seventh to Seventy-ninth Streeja . This section was put up for bidding In September , 1010 , but the . only offer re " eived was from the Bradley Contracting Company . The plans now advertised are in accordance with the revision of the original plans drawn so as to allow for a smaller bore to the tunnels . The appeal of the Admiral Realty Company , which applied last Summer before Justice Ford fur a preliminary injunction against the building of the Lexington Avenue subway , was set for hearing yesterday afternoon before the Appellate Division . The case was not reached , however . and it will be argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Way to Have One Named in McCarroll 's Place . The Brooklyn Engineers ' Club has started a movement ' to have an engineer appointed to the Publio Service Commisaion of the First District Upon the expiration of the term of Commissioner Carroll on Feb. 1 , 1912 . Resolutions pointing out that the work of the commission consists largely of the supervision of matters which require engineering selection and judgment , which were adopted at a recent meeting of the club , have been sent to Gov . Dix , and every engineering association in the State has been asked . to lend its aid . The - next step will be to bring the matter to the attention of all civic organizations . W. IL Roberts , President of the Brooklyn Engineers ' Club , who is engineer in Controller Prendergast 's office , said yesterday that the club was trying to bring about the appointment of an engineer by influencing public opinion , because that seemed about the only effective way . " Among the five original appointees on the Public Service Commission for the First District there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' essayist , ' " he said , " and the work of the commission consists largely of the building of subways and the regulation of railroad traffic . It seems the duty of the Engineers ' Club , therefore , to point out to the Governor and to the public the fact that , owing to the nature of the work of the Public Service Commission of the First District , it should have on its membership some representative of the engineering profession . " Referring to the construction of the , present subways as an example of the need of an engineer on the commission , Secretary Joseph Strachan of the club said : " Had the plans of the subways passed before the eyes of an engineer Commissioner Instead of a civilian Commissioner , the subway stations would have been located at points where the track is straight instead of at curves , and the cry of the train guards , ' Watch your step ! ' would not be heard .

" NEW METROPOLITAN PLAN . Unexpected Conditions Compel Change in the Proposed Reorganization . A hitch has come in the plan for the reorganization of the Metropolitan Street Railway system . Charles F. Mathewson , counsel to the joint committee of bondholders , has written to Public Service Commissioner Maltbie requesting the commission to suspend consideration of ' the plan already presented . Mr. Mathewson says that " the petitioners find that , by reason of recent changes in conditions , quite unforeseen months ago when the plan was filed , or even a few weeks ago , it will be necessary to make inoVeications in the plan in order to protect the financing of the reorganization . " The difficulties to which Mr. Mathewson refers have not been explained to the commission . STATEN ISLAND TRANSIT PLAN Service Board to Consider if Steam Roads Should n't be Electrified .
