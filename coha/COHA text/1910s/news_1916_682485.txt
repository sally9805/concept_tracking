txt A correspondent of Exaggerated ours who confessed a Small in a letter printed . on this page yesterGrievance. to having been dishonorably discharged from the army as a deserter  --  fortunately for himself it was in time of peace  --  strongly indicated that in his opinion he considered it a withering outrage on soldierly dignity to photograph each man and take his finger prints . That is the modern custom , and one of its objects unquestionably is to facilitate the apprehension of deserters . The writer of the letter did not say in so many words that his desertion was because he saw in the practice a terrible imputation of possible disloyalty to the colors , and he could n't endure its abrasive effect on his sensitive nature , but that was seemingly what he wanted to have inferred . Be expects too much . In the first place , the photographing and fingerprinting of soldiers serve more purposes than the one he mentioned , and there is nothing even remotely invidious about the others . Again , the invidiousness , such as It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so only to a somewhat morbid mind  --  or a mind with an uneasy conscience . A like reflection is made upon us all by every locked door we pass and by the policeman on the street . Men whose honesty has never been impugned do not feel offended when asked to give bonds before they handle other people 's money , and the common expectation of receipts for payments made , though it hints the possibility of another and unjust demand , is met by most of us with fair equanimity . The world , like the army , is full of cruel wrongs and bitter insults for those who look for them , but when real troubles are so many , why manufacture more out of nothing  --  or of the easily tolerable things like having one 's picture and finger prints on record ? A task that confronts Work for the builders of aeroa Great planes , and must be per= . formed by them If aerial Inventor. navigation with machines of this sort is not soon to cease advancing , has been revealed in a. special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeroplane of recent conetrectien which is to the fastest of its Predecessors as a swallow to a hawk . Its normal speed is 125 miles an hour , and it can mount into the air with an ease and rapidity jpetifyina- , cothparlion with the bitq which in slenderness of wing and body it resembles . These are most excellent abilities for both peace and war , but unfortunately this " sped , " as it is called , from the initial letters of the Societe pour ) ' Aviation et Derives , under the auspices of which it has been developed , has the necessary and inevitable defects of its qualities and its construction . Its sustaining planes , while quite broad enough when at full speed , are inadequate when the rate of motion decreases . The result is that landing is so difficult and dangerous that it can be done only on the best of ground , and there only by aviators of the most skillful sort . The utility of the spad is therefore restricted within narrow limits , and it probably represents the end , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the building of aeroplanes is effected ? a change that will permit the aviator to do with his " wings " what every bird of swift flight does every time it alights . The planes , that is , must be rendered capable of some degree of revolution on their longitudinal axis , in order that by turning against the air in front the two forces at the aviator 's command may be so combined against each other as to permit a gentle dropping to the ground . Theoretically , this is easy , but the practical difficulties are enormous , for meeting the requirement will not only render the aeroplane a much more complicated machine than it now is , but will seriously diminish its structural strength and cut down a margin of safety already perilously small . Problems , however , are not without solution merely because of difficulty , and the existence and daily use of a machine which a few years ago existed only in the dreams of men whom everybody with common sense called mad , and gave figures to prove it , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is more nearly true that whatever must be done , can and will be . Dr. EATON of the Not All of Madison Avenue Them Baptist Church is not alone in seeing Are Madmen* the error there is in the too frequent statement that all Europe is " war mad . " That the pacifists say this is natural enough , ' for they know of no reasons , or at any rate admit the adequacy of none , that justify resort to arms , and it is logical for them to charge insanity against all who engage in war . But others who are by no means advocates of peace at any price occasionally make the same mistake and heap what is in effect a common condemnation on all participants in the great struggle . Even the President , in his Mecklenburg speech , was not as careful clearly to discriminate between offensive and defensive war  --  between war for a good and sufficient cause and war for one bad and insufficient . Certainly not all the peoples of Europe are mad in the ordinary sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they have divided deserves the appellation from anybody who admits the soundness of the premises on which it is acting . The great question for the uninvolved observer to decide is as to the quality of the respective premises , Teutonic and Allied . If the Germans are war mad , then the British , French , and Russians are not , and , conversely , if the Germans , as they say , are fighting for existence against a combination of envious rivals , then they are not war mad either , while their enemies can properly be so described ? by a stretch of charity . There is , indeed , a state of mind  --  a " baresark " rage  --  Into which all fighters , whether for good cause or bad , are prone to fall , and it is not a state of mind conducive to the best thinking or the wisest judgment of a situation . In that sense alone  --  and it was the sense , presumably , in which the President spoke  --  there is an element of truth in calling all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is room for discrimination between the participants In every war not waged between mere savages on both sides . And as regards arbitrators , it is well to remember that the obligation to be neutral rests on them only till they know the facts . Thereafter they are ? must be  --  partial . It is their business ? what they are for
