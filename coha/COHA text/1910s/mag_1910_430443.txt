Although the name of Bernard Shaw is , in a popular sense , all but unknown in France , ? less known , indeed , than it is in America , and according to accounts than it is in Germany and Austria , ? y et his work has been examined with great thoroughness by the students and critics who have interested themselves in it , with the result that their comments are notably free from traces of that idle chatter which has been a dominating element in his reception elsewhere . The Shaw movement , as it may now be called , seems to be confined to university consideration on the one hand , and to the discussion arising from the production of one of the plays in Paris on the other . Last winter no less than four Shaw courses were given to university audiences ? at the Sorbonne , at Brussels , at Bordeaux , and at Geneva . Considering the fact that it is less than four years since the first extended article on Shaw appeared in a French review , the assumption may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the article referred to was M. Jean Blum , a native of Paris , who has been a professor of German at Turcoing and at Oran , and is also interested in contemporary English letters . He modestly admits that he could not literally have been the first to introduce Shaw to his countrymen , as several notices had appeared in print previously , some of them as early as 1897 or 1898 . Nevertheless , to M. Blum beyond doubt is due the credit of being the first to write on Shaw at length , at first hand , and quite independently of his reception in England . It may safely be said that such an introduction has had not a little to do with keeping the Shaw movement free from the absurdities of faddism ; for M. Blum 's presentation , instead of being indiscriminately eulogistic , was thoughtful and moderate . The man who has written and spoken most on Shaw in France , and the one most widely known as his expounder , is N. Augustin Hamon , who with his wife has recently completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamon , when asked by the author to undertake the translation of his entire work , accepted for the socialistic and political tracts , but not for the plays , regretting that as he himself was not a dramatist he did not feel qualified for the task . Shaw would not accept the excuse , writing : " I know well what I am doing . The vivacity of certain accounts of yours of Socialistic Congresses has convinced me that you are the man to write a French version of my comedies . You know modern society and human nature , and that is the important part in the work which I ask you to undertake . " The translator was a Paris student , and is now a Brussels Professor . He is a copious writer , and a contributor to influential periodicals in half a dozen countries . The drift of his mind may be inferred from the titles of his books . He joins hands with Shaw in anti-militarism ; and his work on " The Psychology of the Professional Soldier " got him into serious trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the affair of the anarchists Henry and Caserio , the author left France for some months , for England , where he contributed to the " Free Review " and " Liberty , " and wrote " The Psychology of the Socialistic Anarchist . " VSTith such a record , it is perhaps less strange that M. Hamon should find in Shaw one who shares his views than that he should see anything else in him . M. Hamon seems , in fact , to be the only French critic of Shaw who is a socialist , or who has been drawn to Shaw by this bond of sympathy . He is the most zealous , the most enthusiastic , the most eulogistic Shawite in France . He regards Shaw 's works as the dramatic expression of ideas which he himself had expounded in pamphlets and on the platform . M. Hamon delivered a series of lectures on Shaw at the Sorbonne the past winter , and their success is shown by the recent announcement of a second series for the current session . M. Charles Cestre , formerly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English in the University of Bordeaux , delivered there a series on Shaw , which was better attended than lectures of like character have been for years . The publication of these lectures is called for ; and it is probable that M. Cestre ( who is a Harvard A.M. ) will be his own translator into English . M. Cestre 's previous books , dealing with French ideas of social democracy as they affected England at the time of the Revolution , have qualified him peculiarly for a discussion of this exponent of the modern spirit . The fact that the Bordeaux professor is not a socialist , and that , while sympathetic , his approval and admiration are qualified , enhances the value of his work , and at the same time shows the rational character of the Shaw movement . M. Henri Odier , a graduate of the University of Berne , with a thesis on the psychology of words and a work in prospect on Hawthorne , lately gave a short series of lectures on Shaw at the Athen4e of Geneva ; and these lectures are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Brieuc , has also lectured on the same subject ; and Shaw has been commented upon in the periodicals by such  | men as MM . Henri de Regnier , Adolphe Brisson , Henri Bidou , Firmin Roz , Ernest Charles , Gaston Rageot , Regis Michaud , Raymond Recouly , and others . Only those writers who are taken seriously have the sources of their ideas investigated ; and there has hardly been a French reviewer who has not suggested a philosopher or dramatist as a test of comparison with Shaw . That the names thus brought out are so often the same shows at least the existence of a standard . One critic , M. Michaud , says that , as a revolutionary , Shaw is to be thought of with Byron , Shelley , Ruskin , and Morris ; and he is credited with familiarity with Darwin , Spencer , and Schopenhauer . In the apology of faith versus works , of spontaneity and sincerity against the formalism of institutions , of individuality against appearances , M. Roz finds signs of Shaw 's ideals in Bunyan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in the longer reviews are Ibsen and Nietzsche , ? and this in spite of Shaw 's retort to his English reviewers regarding his debt to Charles Lever , Samuel Butler , and others still less known . Ibsen held that our modern conception of virtue holds us in real slavery . The quintessence of Ibsenism , according to Shaw , is in the destruction of this conception , of this ideal ; this , according to M. Blum , is the bond between the two , the founda tion on which Shaw builds his philosophy . M Rageot notes that Shaw 's mission is comparable to that of Ibsen , as shown in their fondness for mora problems and in their treatment of anguish of con science . On the dramatic side as well , Shaw is said to have learned from the Norwegian the art of joining exposition to action . Points of dissimilarity , on the other hand , are not wanting . Chief of these is tha Shaw is essentially comic , while Ibsen is mainly tragic . Shaw 's optimism contrasts with Ibsen ' pessimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamon claims that from the socia point of view , Shaw 's work is richer and deepe than Ibsen 's ; that in Shaw 's work the lower classe play a more important part ; that he is not interested as Ibsen is , in social pathology ; and that woman i considered by Shaw more realistically , in contras with the comparative idealism of Ibsen 's treatment Upon the appearance of Shaw 's " The Quint essence of Ibsenism , " the Germans discovered th author 's affinity with Nietzsche , whom he then began to study . The result is held to have been a recog nizable obligation and similarity as clear as that with Ibsen , and followed likewise by points of disagree went . Nietzsche explained European nihilism by the intermingling of masters and slaves , by the dis appearance of castes ; he believed the Superman to be realizable by a small number of masters rigor ously separated from the troop of slaves . Superman is the aim and ideal of his thesis , caste regime bu a means ; if this means be ill-chosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older conception o socialism lies in distinguishing between the emo tional element and what has clumsily been called th scientific element . The first he regards as unnecessary , and even as unworthy of socialism . By means of the second he attempts to sever the old union of moral romanticism and socialism . For this purpose he borrowed from Nietzsche both the word and idea of Superman , declaring that the aspiration to the Superman and its preaching by Nietzsche accords with the religious precept , " Ye must be born again . " But as opposed to what might be called the class philosophy of Nietzsche , Shaw holds that the two fundamental institutions of our society , property and marriage , are unfavorable to the advent of Superman . The opposite opinion arose from the fallacy that men could be bred for the development of particular traits , just as cocks are bred for their combative qualities . On the contrary , what in man is really important we do not yet clearly understand . It is the " inconscient " which is the living source of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shaw then falls back on communism for methods and means for the attainment of the ideal of Superman . In other words , his synthesis combines real communism with the fundamental tenet of Nietzsche . The leading critics are in the main agreed on this point . M. Cestre arrives at practically the same conclusion from another viewpoint . hinting that Nietzsche is a variation of Carlyle ; and he adds that Shaw is a democratic Carlyle . The only one of Shaw 's plays that has yet been acted in the French-speaking world is " Candida , " and that was first played , not in the French but in the Belgian capital . It seems to have been a substantial success ? due partly to the fact that it was well acted , but doubtless still more to the intelligent interest aroused by a discourse on the dramatist 's work , and an exposition of " Candida " in particular , which M. Ramon delivered immediately before the performance . M. Brisson regrets that the Paris production had no such preliminary explanation ; the dramatis personce , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disconcert him . " The atmosphere chills ; we feel that we are not in touch with the author . Eugene exasperates , Burgess seems caricatured . Yet there is a creative force , a desire to ignore the superficial and to dig down to the naked truth ; there is a beauty which I only perceive in spots , and I more than regret my lack of comprehension . Candida is not ours . An effort is necessary in order to fathom her . In many of our plays we see a woman obsessed by a husband and a lover , hesitating between the two , or resigning herself to both . The moment we understand her character we foresee the conclusion . Candida does not belong to any of our categories ; she is apart . " M. Bidou calls Candida an embodiment of charity , reason , and love . " She has the good sense that belongs to our race . Does she not get her reasonableness from the Celtic spirit , which is as practical as it is imaginative ? An Ibsen heroine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Doll 's House " as being anti-social in comparison with Candida . MM . Hamon and  | Cestre are of conflicting opinions in regard to the wife 's motive for staying with her husband , ? the one holding that it is from love , not from duty , the other contending that Candida believes it her duty to remain with the man who needs her most . M. Recouly , speaking of Morell , asks : " This need of setting forth so candidly his conjugal felicity , and associating the kingdom of heaven with the joys of married life , this mania of preaching to the young celibate , urging him to take his part of a God-given happiness , ? is it not for all the world like a British clergyman ? " The Paris production of " Candida " was a distinctly literary enterprise , and on the whole was coldly received . The piece was generally regarded as too remarkable to be laughed at , and many confessed that its originality gave them pause ; but also that they did not understand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not accept her . Some think that the play which should have been presented first is " Mrs. Warren 's Profession , " and this notwithstanding its resemblance to Maupassant 's " Yvette . " But from this M. Michaud dissents . There is no danger , he says , that from a given situation Shaw will draw conclusions that either seem to be logical or that are ever twice the same . He seems to take pleasure in this , and in inserting in the same play ideas most opposed to each other . In this art he excels ; and it is apparently the most substantial profit that he gets . Allied to the question of feminism , of which Lady Cicely and Mrs. Clandon are but two out of many examples , is the question of love and its treatment in ways that are novel to the French public . Shaw 's ignoring of the unpleasant aspects of realism , in contrast to Ibsen or to Tolstoi , has been the subject of no more comment than the absence of physical passion . This gives rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaste bachelor , the Philanderer . There is not in Shaw the sentimentalism of corruption of which Murger 's " La Vie de Boheme " is an instance . Schopenhauer , according to M. Cestre , influenced Shaw and his theory of love , in that with him love has a physical basis and moral effects . The idealism with which love is surrounded is only a trap which nature sets for us to ensure the perpetuation of the race . Love , while thus losing its poetry in a way , none the less has a noble moral beauty , binding us to nature and revealing our responsibilities . The special manner in which Shaw treats love as a duel between the sexes is quite new to the French . Exultation in love is the summit of strength , of courage , the triumph of impulse over individualism . Valentine , for example , in " You Never Can Tell , " feels that the triumph of love in him is a defeat of his nature , a surrendering of individualism . The duel is found in " Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman versus the genius of producing thought in man . Quite different also is the Shaw way from that of Dumas , in whose work a plot hangs on a custom or legal detail . " Divorce " deals with a special point of legislation ; whereas with Shaw there is a thesis of general psychology , of love in general , and of marriage considered as a psychological event . This aspect of his work is , however , not the only point of interest . The employment of three kinds 3f background is noted : ( 1 ) the historic , as in The Devil 's Disciple " and " Antony and Cleopatra " ; ( 2 ) an exotic setting , a world of surprise , accepted by the English , too extravagant for the French ; ( 3 ) a setting not exotic , but strange , as the Ibsen Club in " The Philanderer , " or the transformation of the upper circle in " Major Barbara . " The variety of the minor or episodic characters is unchallenged , but there are diverse views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not voice the current Anglo-Saxon opinion when he says that Shaw 's men are portraits of Shaw himself . The women too , the lecturer adds , do not have the same complexity or the same conformity to the conditions of Life that women of the French theatre have . Shaw 's successful **25;276;TOOLONG is the accident of Fertile invention , not the outcome of interest in the individual . Notwithstanding the entente cordiale , the French still delight in jibes of the olden time ; and Shaw 's caustic remarks to his native audience delight their hearts . Here is one explanation of how he captured London : in a country where the theatre was chiefly given to dancing , a man appeared whose plays made people think . Intelligent and literate spectators , like people who have fasted for too long , threw themselves on the new food , carrying along with them the snobs who abound there in greater numbers than anywhere else in the world . In this way was Shaw 's success made . Another critic adds : thus Shaw , with almost excessive but sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ingenuity ceaselessly renewed , is the English writer who has best shown the practical and moralizing genius of this nation of shopkeepers , which is never in want of principles to justify her interests . This explains the resistance and the favor met with in England by this too clear-sighted , indiscreet , and amusing moralist . Still other explanations follow : Shaw 's London audiences had difficulty in understanding him , because his vision of things was not like theirs , perverted by prejudices , by obscure sentiments , and by ill-formed ideas . He was indifferent to what seemed to them capital questions , and curious about others which they wondered were asked . He has revealed to his compatriots the French disrespect ; and if not the only one , is at least the one who has proclaimed most loudly that all is not for the best in the best of empires . This attitude of mind brings forth such an interpretation of " Candida " as M. Rageot 's . The play gives us a glimpse , he says , of what we shall like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape us in his vigorous and combative talent . Above all a satirist , he observes the vices of English social life . and excels in expressing the secret restlessness of certain minds which suffocate in that puritan atmos- phere , under the national mask of respectability . The English mind lives in an atmosphere of falsehood and illusion . " Candida " is a vigorous attack against false religion ( English ) , against clergymen who live by it , and against hypocritical adepts who keep it up . It is the more telling because of its precision and moderation . What stings the English to the quick is hardly felt by the French , who remain strangers to the foundation of Shaw 's works , social satire . The French are , of course , convinced that Shaw has an excellent subject in satirizing English life . They are equally sure that whatever in him is remarkable is French , and that they should recognize him as one of themselves . M. Blum frankly states that in his opinion it will be Shaw 's fate to fail , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in England . M. Odier ? who , it should be remembered , is Swiss ? writes that Shaw 's seemingly light wit may prevent the French from appreciating his common-sense , and will cause him to be regarded by most serious people as a charlatan . M. Odier holds , with M. Blum , that there is in France to-day such a large element of readers and playgoers who are enamoured of the exotic and the revolutionary in literature , that Shaw may be the object of an artificial vogue like that of Ibsen , who has never really taken with the French public . M. Brisson writes that it is as inevitable that there should be Shawites as that there have been Ibsenites , but that such a phenomenon has at least the advantage of enlarging taste . M. Blum presents a detailed comparison of Shaw and Beaumarchais ; and M. Hamon a much fuller one between Moliere and Shaw , heralding the latter as the successor of the former , and as the scorner of nineteenth century models , Scribe in particular . M. Hamon finds Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate acceptance in France . M. Rageot says there is real intellectual relationship between Shaw and the French ; for if fundamentally he resembles Ibsen , and seems to have been influenced by Tolstoi and Nietzsche , by the form and turn of his mind he fs related to Voltaire and Anatole France . Like them , he handles irony , which is the only weapon of satire , and which is essentially French . M. Michaud 's words are to the same effect . Translated into our tongue , he notes , Shaw will belong to us by more than one right : equally by the social , intellectual , and Utopian elements in his work . Although he does not admire our stage ,  --  he rates Duse above Sarah Bernhardt , does not enjoy Musset , still less Sardou , Coppee , and Rostand , and seems to prefer the Th4-atre de l ' IEuvre to that of the Boulevards , ? yet he knows that we are of the country of Moliere and of Coquelin , that our greatest lyric poet is the author of " Les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur Bergeret " side by side with the English Lake Poets and with Tennyson . Discussion of Shaw as a philosopher is apt to stop with mere acknowledgement of his suggestiveness . M. Blum calls him dramatist and philosopher in equal degree ; but doubtless the most eulogistic claim comes from M. Roz . Shaw styles himself a philosopher , he writes ; that is true , provided this word calls to our minds , not Descartes or Spencer , but rather Anatole France . In effect , if Anatole France had been inspired by Schopenhauer , Ibsen , and Nietzsche , rather than by Voltaire and Renan , thus being or appearing to be more profound , and let the wings of his fancy float in metaphysics , he could almost give us the idea of Bernard Shaw . Though cognizant of the formidable obstacles which must be overcome if Shaw 's reputation is to cross the Channel , M. Cestre is none the less hopeful of ultimate success . Summing up the essential factors of the situation , he says in substance : One of the leading characteristics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French mind , is the combination of the power of observation and of portraiture with the philosophical imagination and the reformer 's enthusiasm . We are not likely to take so much interest in the metaphysics of the third act of " Man and Superman " as in the psychology spread throughout the play . We do not have the longing of Germanic peoples for the solution of the riddle of the universe . We are content to take the cosmos on credit , and are rather attracted by artists and thinkers who search far and deep into the complex world of emotions and motives . Shaw puzzles French readers by the ( to them ) outlandishness of the characters and manners of his plays . They are not shocked by his onslaughts on respectability and piety , for these bogies have long been exploded in France ; but it is their sense of literary propriety , their inborn regard for sentiment , that are uncomfortably shaken . Shaw needs to be explained to them ; but I dare say his intellectuality , his keenness and boldness in handling moral questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run be appreciated . Apt as the French are to worship literary canons , they will have to be gently initiated into a new form of problem play . Alexander Dumas and his disciples opposed on the stage the individual passions or collective prejudices whence spring social evil , or they dramatized the conflict of feelings which arise from the marriage laws . But no French dramatist has yet done what Shaw so well succeeds in doing , ? describing the ethics of a future state of society involved in a picture of present-day manners , and attributing to his characters unwonted feelings and unusual motives of action , while making them living and likable , in so many ways of our own kith and kin . It may be too early to predict whether or not Shaw 's name in France will be known only to the few , like Swinburne 's or Meredith 's , or become a veritable household word like Kipling 's or like Wells 's . A hopeful interpretation may be put on the comparative disregard of his superficial qualities , such as paradox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases . To think of Shaw , even tentatively , as the English Anatole France , seems to have a certain attraction for the latter 's compatriots . It would be quite  | unfair to say , although the comparison has been frequently remarked , that it has been made too much of . The fact itself suffices to show how respectful the consensus of French opinion is . The contrast in the two estimates could not perhaps be more glaringly illustrated than in the reflection of the probable effect in America , if not in England , of a serious discussion of the author of " L'Ile des Pingouins " as the Bernard Shaw of France .  |
