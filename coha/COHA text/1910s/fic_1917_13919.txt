MME . SAND 'S apartment in the Quartier , Paris , 1833 . It is a large studio-like room . Through a long window in the rear one sees the roofs of the city and the streets beyond with the first lamps lit . In the far distance are the twin towers of Notre Dame . The room is a shrine of literary Bohemia . The furnishings are of bizarre incongruity . An ornate Japanese screen barely hides an old-fashioned rubber bathtub , an India chest shows its design of arabesque in the shadow of a bed couch near a piano of the period . In the window are several cages in which canaries are asleep . On the balcony is a sort of little conservatory enclosed in glass . About the place are trunks , half finished in the packing and clothes , hats and shawls are scattered about . Books are everywhere . In the center a table is set for supper . The place is dim with candle light and shadows . The atmosphere is confused , that of an impromptu feast on the brink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S servant , a pretty blunt country woman of about thirty , does not know that the curtain has risen . She is seated at MADAME 'S writing desk and at the moment is deeply puzzled , attempting to read the fifth chapter of MADAME 'S new novel which is piled in manuscript before her . She turns the leaves , one by one , and is bored . The bell of the concierge jangles . She reads on . Again the jangling of the bell . The girl is oblivious . The canaries wake to a little shower of song , then silence , then footsteps below in the streets . ROSALIE mystified , turns another page . MADAME does n't write for such as she . A knock at the door . She jumps up , pushes the manuscript into the rear of the desk and opens the door to PAUL and MME . DE MUSSET . MME . DE MUSSET is an aristocrat , a mother of the old rgime who never loses the quiet dignity of her manner even under the stress of intense emotion . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists only in his own estimation . He hopes he is something of a gallant and does n't for a moment doubt that he is a wit . MME . DE MUSSET sinking into a chair.Those stairs ! Ah , my poor heart ! p. 3 PAUL You took the four flights without stopping . MME . DE MUSSET Do you think a mother ever stops when her son is in peril ? ROSALIE to PAUL.Good evening , monsieur . MME . DE MUSSET I am Mme. de Musset . Is Mme. Sand in ? She glances about the room . ROSALIE No . Madame is not at home . MME . DE MUSSET to PAUL.Home ! Why , there is actually a bed in the dining room ! PAUL These artists think it is a waste of time to live in more than one room . MME . DE MUSSET You might spare me these disgusting details . Then to ROSALIE . What time will Mme. Sand return ? ROSALIE I do not know , Madame . MME . DE MUSSET But you must know . I am Alfred de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave me a hundred francs when my sister was careless  --  and  --  MME . DE MUSSET Alfred ! PAUL Mother , Alfred is not the papa of every bambino in Paris . Then to ROSALIE . You do n't know when they are coming back ? p. 4 ROSALIE These days I know nothing . Everything is up-side down now that Madame is leaving . MME . DE MUSSET Ah , my mother 's instinct . I was right . So she is going when  --  when ? ROSALIE I do not know , because Madame does not know . On Monday I pack because Madame is leaving on Wednesday . On Wednesday I unpack because Madame is staying till Friday . On Friday I pack because Madame leaves on Saturday and on Sunday I unpack because Madame is n't going at all . PAUL You see , mother , there is no need to worry . ROSALIE And while I pack and unpack Madame sits writing , writing all the time . She never stops . I go to bed . At four in the morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself . I come in . Instead of writing she is mending furniture . And then she goes out . One night I followed her . She leans on the walls of quays watching the river till the washer women come out and the sun 's up . She 's a queer one . All that scribbling has gone to her head . MME . DE MUSSET Alone at five in the morning ? PAUL Well , anyway , she is alone . ROSALIE Sometimes I try to read what she 's written . I ca n't make it out . The words are too long . Sometimes she cries when she writes . MME . DE MUSSET has been examining the room and at this moment she reaches the table. p. 5 MME . DE MUSSET The table is set . At what time do they dine ? PAUL They never dine in the Quartier . They only eat . He enjoys this immensely . MME . DE MUSSET Paul , how can you waste your time trying to be witty when Alfred is in danger ? Then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame gets back . She orders dinner at six and it turns into supper at eleven . It makes no difference , nothing matters . Madame is busy writing . All the time writing , except when the gentlemen come . Dinner for breakfast , breakfast for lunch . She 'll let her omelet cool while she scrawls her ten pages . Nothing matters as long as there 's ink for Madame and plenty of cigars . It was n't like this in the country . MME . DE MUSSET amazed.Cigars ! ROSALIE Black and long , twenty-five centimes . Now I must see to my tarts . Mons. Alfred likes them . Call if you want me . She goes out . MME . DE MUSSET Except when the gentlemen come ! Cigars ! Five o'clock in the morning ! God help my boy . She is walking in agitation about the room . She stops in front of the screen . Heavens , is n't this a bathtub ? p. 6 PAUL What could be more innocent than an empty bathtub ? Ha ! Ha ! MME . DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers over the top of the desk and lifts them covered with dust . She is n't very clean . So ! In such a dusty place as this she snares men with her smiles . She has reached the window . And look ! A tone of deep shame in her voice . In sight of Notre Dame . She grows more excited . God grant I 'm in time . PAUL You must keep calm , mother . MME . DE MUSSET I am calm , Paul . I 've been trained to control myself . Only peasants and literary people give way to their emotions . PAUL You should n't have come . MME . DE MUSSET I do not regret it , even after having seen the place . I 'll do my duty . She sha' n't take him with her . God give me strength . PAUL Has n't he promised you he would n't go ? MME . DE MUSSET Yes , but he will , unless I am by to save him . She is his mistress  --  and I  --  am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . MME . DE MUSSET As I did from the beginning and what has happened ? Were you blind ? When I asked you what was going on , you told me Alfred was looking well  --  my poor Alfred  --  and that Madame was only more intelligent than charming . p. 7 PAUL You might think so yourself if you knew her . MME . DE MUSSET Paul ! PAUL Sometimes I envy Alfred . MME . DE MUSSET My son ! Have you forgotten I 'm your mother ? PAUL I do n't think you 'd better stay . MME . DE MUSSET You were the elder . You should have known what would come of this . He was a most sensitive baby , a most fragile boy ; and now at the beginning of his career , just when the great Hugo has praised his verses  --  she ! she ! My boy , my poor boy ! PAUL Why , you 've never even seen the lady . MME . DE MUSSET Yes , once in the Bois . She was driving with Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon decked in ribbons . God help him ! PAUL Well  --  er  --  do you think she is the first woman that Alfred has  --  shall I say known ? MME . DE MUSSET defending her darling.No , Paul . How could one expect that from Alfred ? I can understand my son 's having a mistress but let my son 's mistress belong to my son . When my son belongs to his mistress it is time for his mother to descend from modesty and reticence . PAUL If you 'd only given me a little longer . p. 8 MME . DE MUSSET They might have been on their way to Egypt and those dreadful crocodiles . My poor boy ! She weeps . PAUL What are you going to do ? MME . DE MUSSET Plead with her as a mother . She is a mother , is n't she ? PAUL Heine says she was born a mother and that her dolls were her lovers . MME . DE MUSSET Do n't you ever bring that man to my house . These artists have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PAUL You ca n't understand their sort . MME . DE MUSSET Thank God for that . PAUL Mother , you 're no match for her . MME . DE MUSSET proudly.Why not , my son ? PAUL Because you 're a lady and she 's a woman . MME . DE MUSSET I can descend . You think , do n't you , that I know of nothing but my flowers and my old laces ,  --  but life has taught me many things . PAUL A man must love , mother . Does it matter whom ? Love is only an affair of good evening , good morning  --  and good-bye . MME . DE MUSSET Then he must say goodbye . She sits down. p. 9 PAUL Do you find it so pleasant here ? MME . DE MUSSET Pleasant ! Why , the place reeks of Bohemia . PAUL taking up his hat.Then let 's drive in the Bois . It will calm you . MME . DE MUSSET For a little while . Perhaps the air will do me good . PAUL gives her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops . But if they leave before we get back  --  PAUL Do n't you see the table is set for supper ? They are spiritual but they still have stomachs . They have reached the door . Suddenly it flies open and CASIMIR DUDEVANT bursts in . He is " fresh come " from Nohant and has been paying his respects to the Parisian cafs . He is rather handsome but not of an unusual sort , a mixture of the military and the country squire . At the moment he is a trifle unsteady . DUDEVANT politely but swayingly to MME . DE MUSSET.Good evening , Madame . MME . DE MUSSET drawing back , half in dignity and half in fright.Another friend of Madame Sand ? DUDEVANT with a deep tho tippling bow.No , Madame , not a friend . I am her husband . And PAUL and MADAME DE MUSSET are gone and CASIMIR from the top of the landing is waving them farewells . Then ROSALIE enters from the kitchen with her dish of tarts . She does n't see DUDEVANT who is now leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute later and the girl is again engrossed in the manuscript of MADAME 'S new book , " Valentine . " p. 10 DUDEVANT as he recognizes ROSALIE.Good evening , my girl . ROSALIE How did you get in without ringing the bell ? DUDEVANT I slipped by , my dear ; because this morning when I asked below for Madame , my wife , he said no one was at home . And this afternoon again no one was at home , and when I said are you sure , he said he was sure , because Madame was never at home ; and when I came again this evening He sways a little . I could n't bear to hear him repeat himself , so I came right up . The door was open and here I am . ROSALIE Well , what do you want ? He has been eyeing her as he used to at Nohant . DUDEVANT First , I want to sit down . And he does so . And now , have you a nice little glass of wine for my nice little stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUDEVANT You have n't learned to talk like a Parisian . He leans against the table . ROSALIE No , and I never wish to . Do n't lean on that table cloth . It was clean three days ago . DUDEVANT So then I 'm in time for dinner  --  Ah , my poor little stomach . p. 11 ROSALIE Get away from there . DUDEVANT If I were n't a gentleman , I might n't like your tone . But I do n't mind , I 'm used to it . ROSALIE turns away from him . I always like the swing of your hips ; so I came up from Berri to get you . You can tell a horse by its flanks and a woman by the swing of her hips . He comes nearer . ROSALIE more hotly.Get away ! DUDEVANT So , so , and your hot little temper , too . Come here , my dear , I think I 'd like to burn myself . He steps nearer . ROSALIE None of that , I was n't born yesterday . DUDEVANT Then thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSALIE No , I do n't , and I never did . I would n't come within ten feet of you by choice . DUDEVANT Then I must take the first step . But he finds this difficult to do . Why do n't you have sawdust on the floor ? I can move much better in a stable . The city always makes me thirsty . He begins singing . " How sweet are the fields , the fields of clover . " Stop looking at me like that . p. 12 ROSALIE dodging him. What did you come here for ? DUDEVANT To tell Madame I do n't like the way she 's carrying on . Ai n't I her husband ? I 've come to take the census of her lovers . ROSALIE resenting this.Get out of here or I 'll call the concierge . DUDEVANT Is he one of them too ? Ha ! ha ! Call until all the pretty angels listen , you ca n't budge me . He tries to take her in his arms . She runs from him . DUDEVANT reeling a little.Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into a corner . I 've always wanted you . He has crossed the room and is in front of GEORGE 'S desk . So here 's where she scribbles . Fine , very fine . But she never thinks of me . He takes up some sheets of the new manuscript . ROSALIE Let that alone . She pushes him away from the desk and stands on guard . That cost Madame five sleepless nights . DUDEVANT And how many sleepless nights do you think Madame has cost me ? He sings " Your teeth are like dew in the roses . " I have n't forgotten you , my pet . He lurches towards her and slips his arm around her waist. p. 13 ROSALIE shoving him away.You 'd better get out of here before the gentlemen come . DUDEVANT Maybe I will and maybe I wo n't . I 'll stay to see my darling . And then very maudlin . I 'm the father of her children , she 's the mother of mine . Nature , how wonderful is nature . She , me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is ill , she writes to her mother , and I come up to Paris to see her and you , my pet . If she 's ill , she needs me . He weeps . Look at me , I 'm a very worried husband . Kiss me , before my heart breaks . ROSALIE Get away , I 'm too old for that sort of nonsense . I told you that long ago . DUDEVANT How do you know , my darling , until you 've tried ? He hums . " How innocent are the fields , the fields . " ROSALIE Sh  --  be quiet ! His voice grows louder . Sh  --  some of the guests are coming . DUDEVANT Maybe they 'll pity a poor wronged husband . ROSALIE They must n't see you like this ; get out . DUDEVANT You want me to leave without seeing her ? What gentleman would do that ? He again bursts into melody . " How sweet are the fields . " p. 14 ROSALIE pushing him toward the kitchen.Sleep it off in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sweet are the fields . He stops . But I must see Madame . ROSALIE Yes , yes , I 'll tell her . She 'll come in to you . Get out ! Get out ! There is a sound of footsteps on the stairs and CASIMIR barely tumbles into the kitchen as ROSALIE opens the door for BULOZ and HEINE . BULOZ is a sort of sublimated journalist , terse , pat , with his eyes perpetually on the literary chance . He is editor of The Revue des Deux Mondes and finds MADAME 'S " stuff " an attractive feature . HEINE is a tense , wandering soul who has drifted to the spiritual haven of Paris . Distinguished , keen ,  --  he is dynamic even in unessentials . BULOZ I almost knocked you over , Heine . HEINE I was finishing this on the last landing . I 've been half an hour coming up . Each floor I read a few pages . He looks at an open book in his hand . She writes like water tumbling from a pump . Some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned . ROSALIE Good evening , gentlemen , Madame will be back soon . p. 15 BULOZ Good evening , Rosalie . Then to HEINE . Whenever George finishes a new book , I kiss Rosalie and sometimes she kisses me . It 's a sensible arrangement . Then to ROSALIE . When Madame leaves , would you like to come and cook for me ? ROSALIE No , sir ; I 'm a respectable girl . BULOZ anxiously.They 're leaving tonight , are n't they ? ROSALIE I do n't know . One day she 's going , the next she ai n't . CASIMIR 'S voice is heard singing in the kitchen . ROSALIE Ah ! I have n't washed the endive . The voice becomes more distinct  --  " The fields of cl  --  o  --  ver . " HEINE How sweetly the salad sings . ROSALIE exits . HEINE has reached the table . HEINE Seven candles . That 's for luck , but I thought George was giving this farewell supper to commemorate her parting from Alfred . BULOZ The bulletins differ . But we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be difficult for George . A woman can do what she wants with a man until another woman knocks at the door . Then the Gods bend down to listen , knowing the odds are even . p. 16 BULOZ There 's the real danger . Tho he does n't know it , he still obeys his mother . She has written George threatening to prevent it . HEINE And George ? BULOZ She 's distracted with uncertainty . I 've had five letters since noon . The first dark despair . Alfred has again given his word to his mother . He wo n't go . He takes a packet of letters from his pocket . The third is cryptic . What do you make of this ? He reads . " Night , Nubian night , but a skylark still soars in my heart . " HEINE Rather confining for the skylark . BULOZ Then the fourth  --  again abject misery . Written on the back of a menu of the Caf de Soleil . She contemplates suicide . HEINE Everybody does since " Werther . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper.She regrets the river is frozen near the quays . Every week , every hour , they decide to part  --  but the fire of hope burns eternal . HEINE an echo of bitterness in his voice.Till fate chokes the flame with the douche of disillusion . BULOZ You 're still young enough to be a pessimist ? p. 17 HEINE Pessimism is my spiritual purge . How else can I keep my soul clean in this filthy world ? My faith is the faith of tomorrow . I 'm a Jew by birth , a Christian by necessity and an atheist by conviction . He glances at the table . Changeably religious  --  but always hungry . When will they be back ? BULOZ Here 's her last note . They are going together to the top of Notre Dame , to say farewell in the sunset . HEINE Pinnacles are her obsessions . But she 'll come down . Bed 's the great leveler . Ca n't you see them , Buloz ? Here 's Madame preparing for the lover 's leap . The last farewell has driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parapets ,  --  wondering just where they 'll bump first . And the gargoyles with their granite hearts ,  --  hideous because they are doomed to grin forever ,  --  leer in silence lest their laughter should shake the turrets when George again nobly renounces death . Then bitterly . Ah , Buloz , beware of this love of ours . It is our enemy , most selfish , most subtle , and most sinister . What time does the coach start for Lyons ? BULOZ At nine from the Post Hotel . HEINE looking at his watch.Nearly eight . They 'll be here in ten minutes . Supper in fifteen . Haste may outwit his loving and too watchful mother . They 've tasted love and drunken , they know not they are drunk . Then , Italy  --  Italy , where golden youth lies sleeping in the shadow of the centuries . Italy and dreams  --  and then some rainy morning ,  --  the awakening . p. 18 BULOZ They must go . Think what it means to me . HEINE You ? BULOZ I 've signed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I needed just her sort of copy to boost them . Nothing sells like love . HEINE Except a liaison . BULOZ Exactly . HEINE musingly.And if they should awake too soon and suffer  --  BULOZ laconically.I count on that . Pathetic relief  --  the contrast of tears . HEINE There 's a thought to make an essay . BULOZ Send it to me first . I 'll print it in The Revue . HEINE half to himself.Some must suffer that others may sup . Socially , spiritually , everywhere , always true  --  paying the toll to life  --  that others may sup . BULOZ That ought to make , say , seven thousand words . Large type that means , shall we say  --  er  --  twenty pages ? HEINE tempering his scorn with a smile.You journalistic Judas . For thirty new subscriptions you would sell your soul . p. 19 BULOZ oblivious.Or perhaps twenty-two pages . We can expect something from de Musset , too . HEINE Of course . He has a splendid past ahead of him , and besides he 's a poet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he needs more rust in his blood . BULOZ dryly.And you ? HEINE I 'm perfect where I am , Buloz , but not quite finished . Do n't misjudge me . I 'm not as modest as I sound ,  --  but hungrier . ROSALIE rushes in from the kitchen . ROSALIE A cab has stopped in the courtyard . She begins lighting the candles . Then to BULOZ . Do n't let her start writing again till dinner 's served . BULOZ anxiously.Not if we can help it . HEINE But if Calliope descends  --  ROSALIE Another of those actor people ? Put her out and remember the omelet . She leans out of the window . Yes , it 's them , it 's them . Madame is helping Monsieur out . Madame is paying the driver . Monsieur Alfred is coming up . He 'll be so tired and so hungry . She 's most likely been telling him novels all day . He 's been so good to me . And she runs into the kitchen. p. 20 HEINE And how long do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? Does that matter if the copy is good ? And ALFRED stands in the doorway , a poet , an aristocrat and something of a dandy . His glance is firm , his red lips half open . He is fragile and fine with that exquisite delicacy of virility , so irresistible to women . ALFRED in the doorway.My friends ! My friends ! So you have come to say goodbye and I have come to say good-bye . I am giving up forever BULOZ starts. the most beautiful companion that man has ever known . ROSALIE enters . Rosalie , a glass of wine . He drinks it and sinks into a chair . See my people for me . I ca n't face them now . I might curse my mother whom I would die to save from suffering . His head drops in his hands . Buloz , you see my brother and say good-bye for me , and you , Heine , because your style is rarer , you see my mother and tell her I bless her and will pray for her and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ROSALIE.Bring the soup . ALFRED I 'm so tired . George almost carried me up the last turn of the tower . Paris was like a fading print below us . Half-way up we saw two lovers embracing in a window . p. 21 HEINE Life is a see-saw and love swings the plank . Up and down , up and down . ALFRED Till we slip , and the blind little worms are waiting . On the top of the tower verses came to me . I called them " The Blind . " Where 's the absinthe ? Listen . He pulls out his cuff and begins reading the lines he has composed and which he has scrawled on his linen . " The nightingale impassioned wounds his heart to sing , Whilst in the perfumed shade of roses mating . Love bursts to blossom each new bud of spring . But death , dim death with scythe in hand stands waiting . " ROSALIE , enraptured in spite of herself , stands in the door to the kitchen . HEINE looks at BULOZ , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to ROSALIE.I told you to bring the soup . And she goes out . ALFRED That 's death 's victory and life 's defeat . We are the blind . HEINE We ostriches sticking our heads in the sands of hope . And at this moment enters GEORGE  --  the brilliant , sumptuous , ridiculous but conquering GEORGE . She is never sentimental , never sententious , never conscious of her exuberance or her exaggerations ; mistress of everything but her emotions which , tho she thinks she masters , master her . The men listening to ALFRED do not see her. p. 22 ALFRED turning over his cuff , goes on with his reading . " Upon the moon-white waters glides the lonely swan , The willows bend  --  " He stops , looks at the other side of his cuff , then back , then to the other cuff . ALFRED slightly embarrassed repeats the last line . " The willows bend "  --  ahem  --  eh  --  There is a pause . I must have stopped writing . And then GEORGE steps forward and speaks very simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alfred , because at that very moment we said good-bye forever . Again BULOZ starts . We were born but to say good-bye . There is a danger that the moment may become unbearably sublime , but ROSALIE opportunely arrives with the steaming tureen . ROSALIE Here 's the cream of onions , Madame . BULOZ sniffing.Supper at last . GEORGE SAND to BULOZ.Is your stomach more important than our souls ? HEINE No ! But emptier . And the romantic spell is broken , and greetings are exchanged. p. 23 GEORGE SAND to BULOZ.Did you get all my letters ? Then to HEINE . Do n't be too bitter tonight . I always mistrust you pessimists . Far down you 're apt to be so sweet . Look deep enough in tears there 's laughter , and deep enough in laughter , tears . Ah , well ! Let 's be gay . Tho we feast on the brink of a precipice I shall smile . One must either smile  --  or die . During this speech they have taken their places at the table . ALFRED Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll get drowsy and I ca n't let you sleep here tonight . I 've got to unpack and finish five chapters . BULOZ eagerly.Five chapters tonight ? GEORGE SAND Perhaps six . I 'm very tired . She looks lovingly at ALFRED . My soul has been sapped today but I must work . That 's the one way of forgetting . Six chapters  --  and I have n't yet planned the fourth . She sits for a moment in deep thought eating radishes . I 'll bring in this farewell supper . Why not , why not , I ask you ? My stories are the mirror of my life . Tho I write with my heart 's blood , still I must write . This supper will make chapter five . She starts improvising . After the opera this little farewell feast . Bitter herbs and tears . She begins eating the onion soup as she talks . For weeks , Olivia has refused to see Raymond , but that night at the opera to the divine strains of Donizetti their eyes have met . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onion soup ? Where was I ? A moment and then she recaptures her theme . Ah ! yes ! Raymond has left his box and come over to Olivia 's . Her hair is dark as night in the Apennines . Then very sadly . We might have seen the Apennines , Freddo  --  if  --  p. 24 ALFRED " If " is the epitaph on the tomb of opportunity . GEORGE SAND patting his hand.Never mind , dear . We must be brave . Another loving glance and then she goes on with her story . There in the shadow of her box , whilst the melting music woos the stars . Suddenly she jumps up from the table and brings paper , ink and pen from her writing desk . Writing , she repeats . Whilst the melting music woos the stars  --  charming phrase , is n't it ?  --  There is a hurried conversation . Yes , she will go to his apartments , that very night for their last supper together . Theirs and  --  ours , Freddo ,  --  ours . She chokes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might open the window , Rosalie . GEORGE SAND continuing.She has ordered her coachman to drive thru the Bois . She must think , her brain pulses like Vesuvius . She gives a quick glance in ALFRED 'S direction . He sits sadly examining the bottom of his empty glass . She goes on . Vesuvius . Passion masters her . Where are the olives , Rosalie ? She continues . It has begun to rain . She leans from the window . The great drops wound her brow . She makes a note of this . Yes , she will go to Raymond , but  --  to say farewell . That ought to be a good ending for chapter four . p. 25 HEINE Yes , very . If it ends there . GEORGE SAND Chapter five . Her husband has been hunting tigers in the Pyrenees . BULOZ But are there any tigers in the Pyrenees ? GEORGE SAND What difference does that make ? Are n't there giraffes in the zoo ? BULOZ consoles himself with his fish . GEORGE SAND unruffled.Her husband , whilst hunting tigers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh ? Then she goes on . Whilst hunting tigers has been wounded . Chapter five brings him back to Paris . At an inn on the way he has seduced Carmella , a peasant girl . BULOZ methodically.Of course ! HEINE Is there a peasant girl in Europe that has n't been seduced ? GEORGE SAND undisturbed.He brings with him a Spanish dagger , bought at Burgos . ALFRED catching her spirit.From a stall near the sunburnt cathedral . GEORGE SAND Sunburnt cathedral  --  that 's a charming phrase , Freddo . She jots it down. p. 26 ALFRED playfully.Plagiarist . GEORGE SAND patting his hand.Darling . He arrives at his home . It is past midnight . Madame is out . In her boudoir he finds Raymond 's handkerchief . He recognizes the crest . Meanwhile , the lovers are at supper . How do you like it , Buloz ? BULOZ That 's just the place to announce the next instalment . ALFRED Why have we decided to part ? GEORGE SAND We ? ALFRED I might have persuaded you to give up writing novels . BULOZ Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have led together philosophising under all the chestnut trees in Europe . He takes her hand . GEORGE SAND looking deep into his eyes.We must learn to live alone , Freddo  --  alone . She presses his hand to her lips . BULOZ sits watching them . HEINE aside to BULOZ.Do n't worry , she wo n't stop writing . Every novel to George is a new love affair . She always sees them thru to the end . p. 27 GEORGE SAND But you must n't interrupt me , Freddo . Then choking back her sobs . I call him Freddo because we were going to Italy together . Where was I ? Recalling . The rain has ceased . There is a slight disturbance in the kitchen . BULOZ at the door.Sh  --  be quiet . Madame is composing . ROSALIE sticking her head in , rather excited.I 'm beating the eggs for the omelet . She closes the door . GEORGE SAND by mistake sprinkling her salmon with sugar.They are out on the veranda together in the moonlight . ALFRED What would the romantic movement do , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , George , not salt . GEORGE SAND oblivious.She has come to say farewell , but poor , weak woman , she has forgotten the feud twixt flesh and spirit .  --  We are but marionettes hung from the nimble fingers of the Gods . HEINE looking up quickly as he breaks his bread.Yes , all of us ! We jig at the end of the wires , poets and cooks , saints and grisettes  --  hung from the nimble fingers of the Gods . All , all of us  --  even you , George ,  --  even you ! p. 28 GEORGE SAND You must n't break in with your Germanic philosophies . Then as she turns to ALFRED , slightly wetting her lips with her tongue . There in the pungent odors of the night they melt into each other 's arms . And Olivia turns only to see her husband standing in the room . And this is only too true , for the noise outside has increased , and at the next moment , CASIMIR bursts in from the kitchen , bottle in hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Wait a minute , please . Then unperturbed , she goes on with her story . Olivia , trembling like a lily in the wind She is writing this all down. throws herself between the men as the Burgos blade A loving glance at ALFRED. bought from a stall near the sunburnt cathedral ,  --  flashes in the moonlight . She dots the sentence and turns to CASIMIR . GEORGE SAND And now , what do you want ? DUDEVANT leering.You . I want you to come back to the country , my dear . I 've no one to talk to , your mother 's too old and the servants each has each . He comes towards her . ALFRED intercepts him. p. 29 ALFRED Do n't you dare come near this lady . DUDEVANT Eh ? HEINE goes over to the window and stands there calmly smoking . The others are all excited except GEORGE , who sits quietly finishing her salmon . ROSALIE peeps thru the door . ALFRED Get out of here , you 're drunk . DUDEVANT lurching forward.Ai n't I her broken-hearted husband ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE SAND Have you come up from Nohant to teach me the law ? DUDEVANT You still talk just like a man , Aurora . You have n't changed at all , but you 're a wee bit fatter , my dear ,  --  a wee bit fatter . GEORGE SAND really resenting this.Nonsense , Casimir . And then very significantly , as she glances towards the door . Good-evening , now . These three gentlemen are my friends . DUDEVANT Friends , Aurora ? Is n't that a fancy way of putting it ? He pats ROSALIE on the cheek and begins singing " How sweet are the fields . " ROSALIE to GEORGE.He was after me at Nohant , too . That 's why I came with you . He was awful bad and tho you 're kind of queer , I knew it would be better with you and anyhow I 'd be safe in Paris . p. 30 DUDEVANT lyrically . " The  --  fields  --  of  --  cl  --  oo  --  o  --  ver . " HEINE So he was the singing salad ! ROSALIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , because you told me this morning you 'd surely be leaving for Venice tonight . There is a quick glance exchanged between HEINE and BULOZ . General consternation is imminent , but GEORGE is ready . GEORGE SAND sweetly and with a swooning look at ALFRED.But since then so much has happened . Trustingly he takes her hand . HEINE comes down to BULOZ . HEINE aside to BULOZ.I ca n't let these domestic scenes spoil my supper . He sits down and begins to eat . DUDEVANT to ALFRED.Let go that lady 's hand . ALFRED Keep away or I 'll throw you out of the window . DUDEVANT You will ? He roars with laughter . You will ,  --  you , with your pale face and your hair like a woman 's ? I 'm a soldier , young man , do you know I 'm a soldier ? ALFRED steps threateningly towards him. p. 31 GEORGE SAND calmly.You 'd better go now , Casimir ,  --  And then pointing it with smiling delicacy. before these gentlemen show you the way . The stairs are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have some more salmon , do . DUDEVANT nastily.Look here , I 've had enough of your cooing voice ! Ai n't you my wife ? GEORGE SAND I have as much respect for our marriage contract as I have for you . The day you took the whip into your hands , I took the law into mine . DUDEVANT cowering.Wives do n't talk that way . GEORGE SAND Then it 's time they did . I do n't want you , I do n't need you . And then ever so sweetly . Are you going now ? DUDEVANT reaching the door and stopping.I ca n't leave , I ca n't . BULOZ and ALFRED step forward . GEORGE , with a gentle smile on her face , sits watching the scene . DUDEVANT You see  --  well  --  er  --  I  --  GEORGE SAND Is it money , my dear ? p. 32 DUDEVANT brightening.Just like you , Lucy . Sooner or later you get to the point . The fact is  --  He reels . I lost a few francs at my inn . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  and now I 've nothing to take me to Nohant . GEORGE SAND going to her desk.Here are twenty francs . And then to BULOZ . Advance me a hundred , Buloz . So ,  --  a hundred and twenty and you  --  She turns to HEINE . What do you add to get rid of this nuisance ? That makes nearly two hundred . Rosalie , lend me ten francs . Which the girl takes from her stocking . ALFRED And I ? GEORGE SAND modestly.No , no ; not that . Could I borrow from you to get rid of a husband ? ALFRED If it means your happiness . GEORGE SAND melting.Well , since you put it so beautifully . And unwillingly she takes the money and gives it to CASIMIR . GEORGE SAND Good-bye . Do n't stop to thank us . CASIMIR takes the money , and stuffing it in his pocket , again reaches the door , and again stops. p. 33 DUDEVANT I might have forgotten , Aurora , if my hand had n't got to my pocket . He takes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gives her a little water-color drawing . GEORGE 'S whole manner changes . All the mother in her welling up at the thought of MAURICE . GEORGE SAND My little darling . How is he , Casimir ? Is he well ? Does he blow his nose nicely ? Is he kind to mother ? Kiss him for me . CASIMIR steps towards her , ALFRED again threateningly intercepting him . DUDEVANT stumbling back.To think that I should live to see the day when my wife sits at table with murderers and longhaired swine . You 've broken my heart , Aurora . And singing " How fair are the fields , " he reels down the stairs . There is an embarrassed silence . GEORGE SAND lifting the gloom.My friends , do n't take this too seriously . What does a husband matter ? He is an incident all married women should forget . Then reminiscently . My marriage began what might have ended happily . She smiles wanly at ALFRED . What might have ended happily , Freddo , if fate had willed it . p. 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat . GEORGE SAND fervidly.What have I now to live for , but my children and my dreams ? Today I have lacerated my soul on the altars of renunciations . A poignant glance at ALFRED . Life called us and we turned away . ALFRED How can I leave you to face the possibilities of such another scene ? You have suffered and you have borne in silence . There are tears in your eyes . GEORGE SAND resignedly.My friend , do not hope to dry them . I must weep lest my heart break . She looks imploringly thru the ceiling as tho trying to see God , then she rushes over to the piano , she begins to play a sad lament , in a desolate minor key . Then a few chords , arpeggios , and she begins chanting . " The nightingale impassioned wounds his heart to sing , Whilst in the perfumed shade of roses mating . " BULOZ to ROSALIE , who stands listening.Go and get the omelet . ROSALIE The eggs are beat . HEINE with an apprehensive glance towards the piano as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then to BULOZ . You should n't have brought me here . I ca n't stand music while I 'm eating . p. 35 BULOZ Honestly , I did n't count on this sort of thing . ALFRED tenderly to GEORGE.You have remembered my poor verses . GEORGE SAND Are they not seared in my soul ? More arpeggios . Then thru her sobs she continues her chant . " Love burst to blossom each new bud of spring , But death  --  A chord , two chords , three chords . Dim death with scythe in hand stands  --  " She ca n't finish the line . She throws herself into ALFRED 'S arms . A passionate embrace . Then she rushes from him over to the window . It is nicely timed , the moon is rising . Swiftly she opens one of the bird cages and takes out one of the canaries . GEORGE SAND in an ecstasy.At least there shall be one free thing answering the winds of desire . She sets the bird free . Let him fly into the dawn . BULOZ Him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In such matters she is infallible . There is a tableau at the window . The music , the moonlight and the flight of the bird have been too much for ALFRED . He leans sobbing against the window frame . GEORGE is watching him . Then suddenly he reels about. p. 36 ALFRED No ! no ! I shall not sacrifice two souls to duty . HEINE dryly.As I thought . He is beginning to realize that virtue is its own disappointment . GEORGE and ALFRED are in each other 's arms . A passionate embrace thru which HEINE and BULOZ speak . HEINE Do n't you think we had better go into the kitchen ? BULOZ Why ? HEINE I am being pushed into the corner . Nothing fills a room like love . A sigh from the lovers . When do you think it will be finished ? BULOZ with an apprehensive glance towards GEORGE and ALFRED.What ? The kiss ? HEINE with an eager look in the direction of the kitchen.No . The omelette . A moment later and ALFRED in a rapture swings GEORGE toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city love is calling ! Beyond the roofs of Paris lie the radiant valleys of the south ! HEINE Splendid eye-sight , has n't he ? The heart sees all . p. 37 ALFRED You love me , George ? GEORGE SAND mysteriously.As I have never loved before . ALFRED lyrically.There is a higher right than duty , my adored one . Let us not hesitate . Love is calling . Italy and the waiting years . Italy , where one drinks oblivion in a moment 's ecstasy . GEORGE SAND in a sort of vision.Italy !  --  The moon is rising in my heart . A trill of song from the canaries . Listen ! That is the music of the serenata . The night is waiting . We are at the gates of Eden . ALFRED Then let us enter in . HEINE At the very gates . What if they should slip ? A sound comes up from the street . Voices , laughter . It is Paris , not Italy . Suddenly GEORGE awakes . GEORGE SAND her voice gone gray.And your mother ? ALFRED She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of her tomb . GEORGE SAND barely controlling her triumphant satisfaction.Alfred , my own , I have been waiting . Again they are in each other 's arms as ROSALIE arrives with the omelet. p. 38 GEORGE SAND Quick ! My bags , my trunks , my shawls , my manuscripts ! Then follows a scene of intense confusion , all of them running about to get the traps ready while HEINE , undisturbed , sits eating . GEORGE SAND Hurry , Rosalie , my bonnet ! ROSALIE The new one with the broad brim which you bought for Italy ? GEORGE SAND Yes , hurry , hurry . BULOZ is out of breath strapping the bags . Supper is forgotten . ALFRED is no help . He is in the way ; every moment insisting on clasping GEORGE to his bosom . Soon , however , they are ready . BULOZ You go by way of Avignon ? GEORGE SAND Yes  --  but first a stop at Lyons to see Stendhal . ALFRED remonstratingly.But he will talk to us all night . GEORGE SAND No . He will dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . HEINE as he takes the last olive.Yes . We are all of us afloat . GEORGE SAND her voice aflame.Ah , my friends , life is meant to be squandered . Buloz , Heine , farewell , farewell . I 'll write  --  I 'll write . Then general embracing . For a moment the lovers stand bathed in the moonlight that floods the room . Confused voices : " Good-bye , farewell , Italy , life , love , etc. , etc . " They turn to leave . Suddenly there is a knock at the door . ROSALIE looks up . She hesitates . Then she goes to the door . In a moment she is back. p. 39 ROSALIE furtively.There is a lady to see you , Madame . GEORGE SAND gayly.Tell her I am dying of love and can see no one . ROSALIE She 's been here before . GEORGE SAND I never turn a beggar from my doors . Buloz , give me twenty francs . ROSALIE vainly trying to warn her.She came in a carriage . GEORGE SAND I 've no objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is repeated . Timidly ROSALIE opens the door and MME . DE MUSSET and PAUL enter . ALFRED Mother ! MME . DE MUSSET who with quiet dignity has arisen to the occasion.Alfred ! BULOZ under his breath.Mme. de Musset ! MME . DE MUSSET with gentle courtesy.Pardon this late intrusion , Madame . I see I disturb you at dinner . And then , pointing the facts with delicacy , but with a will behind it . I thought my son might be leaving and would care to drive home with me . A tense moment . The literary history of France hangs in the balance , and then MME . DE MUSSET brilliantly comes to the rescue. p. 40 MME . DE MUSSET with sudden inspiration.Delightful weather for December ? HEINE dryly.It always is . BULOZ clearing his throat.Hem ! MME . DE MUSSET quietly but firmly.Well , Alfred ? ALFRED Please , mother , let 's avoid a scene . MME . DE MUSSET I 've spent most of my life doing that , my son . She glances at GEORGE . Are you coming , Alfred ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DE MUSSET It will be very quiet in the carriage . Paul can take a cab . And then , with a note of graceful condescension , she turns to GEORGE . Madame , I hope I find you well ? And then equally sweetly , GEORGE , who mentally has been aiding destiny , answers her . GEORGE SAND I 'm well , Madame , I thank you , very , but wo n't you and your son finish supper with us ? We 've but just begun . ROSALIE cheerily.Yes , the omelet just finished . Have some , Monsieur Paul . It 's the kind you like . PAUL involuntarily steps towards the table. p. 41 MME . DE MUSSET Paul ! Then to GEORGE.Thank you , Madame , but I 've already supped . But we are keeping you so long from table . Come , Alfred , have you forgotten that you promised to read your new verses to your sister 's friends , this evening ? She steps towards the door . A thousand apologies for my intrusion . Good-evening , Madame ; good-evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his mother 's side . All eyes are on ALFRED . He steps towards the rack where he has hung his cape and hat . A pause . Then GEORGE takes the reins . GEORGE SAND Madame , will you permit me to speak to you alone ? MME . DE MUSSET I doubt , Madame , if there is anything that we have to say to each other . GEORGE SAND **25;2566;TOOLONG are fragile . Shall we bruise them on the anvils of our rashness ? MME . DE MUSSET slightly mystified.Pardon me , Madame , but  --  GEORGE SAND Gentlemen , you will excuse us . There are things that we women say to each other that you men can never know . Do n't go into my bedroom , if you please . The bed is tossed . And ROSALIE and the gentlemen go off leaving the candle-lit battle-field to GEORGE . Throughout the following scene her tone varies . One moment she is soft and feminine , the next masculine and dominant ! p. 42 GEORGE SAND And now we can have a nice cozy chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly.Thank you . But she remains standing . GEORGE SAND lightly.As you please . And GEORGE , turning a chair about , seats herself at the table . GEORGE SAND offering MME . DE MUSSET a cigarette.Will you smoke ? MME . DE MUSSET That is one of the things , Madame , that I leave to men . GEORGE SAND pleasantly.That 's the mistake we women make . We leave too much to the men . We bury our souls in satin , and they take advantage of our weakness . Perhaps you would prefer a cigar , Madame . MME . DE MUSSET a gasp.No , Madame . GEORGE SAND After breakfast I can not live without my cigar . The odor is so delicious mixed with my rose geraniums . She sniffs . Is there anything in the world so redolent as the odor of rose geraniums ,  --  or perhaps you prefer jasmine ? But it 's too late for jasmine . p. 43 MME . DE MUSSET involuntarily sitting down.Madame , do you think I came here to talk botany ? GEORGE SAND tensely.No , Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to command two people to cease loving each other . Do you think you can do that , Madame ? Since the beginning of time all nature has been preparing for this love of ours  --  Alfred 's and mine . The stars are in their allotted places so that we might love . MME . DE MUSSET I know nothing about astronomy . GEORGE SAND oblivious.Eden first bloomed so that we might love . She has stretched across the table and has reached her ink and pen and paper , and in the shadow of the sugar bowl , is jotting down the phrases that particularly appeal to her . Abel slew Cain  --  er  --  er  --  so that we might love . Since the remotest hint of time , fate has willed it . Are you God , Madame ? Can you toy with destiny ? MME . DE MUSSET Pardon me , but I can not understand this literature you speak . GEORGE SAND You call my words literature ? No , indeed , Madame , they are the burning truth ,  --  a truth you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your damask-dusty world where the blinds are always drawn whilst I ,  --  I have cut my flesh on the thorns . Do you know what my life has been ? p. 44 MME . DE MUSSET No , that I do not presume to know . I do not wish to know . It will not move me ; my son shall not go with you . What would become of him ? GEORGE SAND He would enter the glorious kingdom hand in hand with the woman he loves . Do you dare deny him that ? Can God ,  --  God who is love be watching this ? MME . DE MUSSET Madame , spare me this melodrama . You are right . I have lived a guarded and what you would call a narrow life , but in that old-fashioned , ridiculous seclusion at which you scoff I have learned to respect tradition . GEORGE SAND tensely.Need is the only tradition I acknowledge . MME . DE MUSSET Alfred will not go with you . He has given me his word . He is a gentleman . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman , but it takes only one man to make a generation . I am helping to make mine because I am free . He , too , must be free . Do not fetter a falcon lest he break his chains . MME . DE MUSSET not quite sure that she understands George 's elaborate simile.If you mean that I restrain Alfred , you are wrong . GEORGE SAND Ah , that 's what you would have him think . But you mothers have a way of holding on . I tell you he must be free to sing . I have bought my freedom with my heart 's blood . I have suffered . p. 45 MME . DE MUSSET And we mothers , do you think we mothers do not suffer ? This is a superb moment for GEORGE . She snatches from her bosom the little water-color drawing which CASIMIR has brought her . GEORGE SAND I too am a mother , Madame ! Look what my darling son has sent me ! This poor little painting of roses . She is sobbing . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MME . DE MUSSET Then give my son back to me . GEORGE SAND I have not taken him . God has sent him . Ah , my friend , he has made me so happy . Every day finds me more attached to him . Every day the beauty of life shines more brilliantly . Would you shatter this love of ours ? He is my universe , my all . MME . DE MUSSET slowly.Pardon me , Madame , but you force me to be cruel . GEORGE SAND Go on , go on , life has not spared me , why should you ? MME . DE MUSSET You say you are his universe , but , Madame , are you sure you are all of this to him ? GEORGE SAND Ask him and his tears will answer you . She jots this down . After the desolation of my past he has come like a new dawn into my life . I was a mere girl when I married , young , furtive , reticent , romantic . I adored my husband . I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of them ? p. 46 MME . DE MUSSET Spare me . GEORGE SAND leaning towards her.He tossed them to the first chambermaid that smiled on him . I suffered this because I still loved him . Men ,  --  Madame , men never know what agony we women hush in our hearts . MME . DE MUSSET in spite of herself.Yes  --  that is true . GEORGE SAND I bore this . My baby came . I still preserve his first wee darling shoes . MME . DE MUSSET off her guard.And I 've kept Alfred 's curls . There 's still a glint of gold in them . Her voice softens . GEORGE SAND making the most of the moment.I bore this till the day he struck me . MME . DE MUSSET more gently.Struck you ? GEORGE SAND Then I left him forever to find refuge in Paris and consolation in my work . Ah , Madame , do you begin to understand ? Then MME . DE MUSSET speaks very quickly attempting to cover a softening emotion which she ca n't suppress . MME . DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy from all the men you  --  She stops short. p. 47 GEORGE SAND Because he has come as my first love , when I thought that love was over forever . You must not , you can not take him from me . MME . DE MUSSET is half-consciously beginning to pity her and she fights against it . MME . DE MUSSET I am taking him away to save him . GEORGE SAND Save him ? Is he not a man ? Would you fling him to the grisettes of the boulevard as the Philistines flung Daniel to the lions ? Again the Bible . The Scriptures were ever her " present help in trouble . " No ! no ! I will be a mother to him . A mother and a mistress . That combination is unique , Madame , unique , but none the less sublime . MME . DE MUSSET I  --  GEORGE SAND in a last beautiful effort.You are his mother . You gave him life . He drank in love at your breasts . You have reared and tendered him and in gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him . He would pay heaven by loving in return . There are tears in your eyes . There are tears in the hearts of each of us . You have taught him love and now he would bring an offering of love to lay on the altar of my heart . MME . DE MUSSET almost won.Your eloquence , Madame  --  p. 48 GEORGE SAND No ! No ! It is not my eloquence , it is your mother 's love , understanding the love of an unfortunate sister . She throws herself on her knees before her , then with dulcet sweetness . May I call you mother ? MME . DE MUSSET I have misjudged you , Madame . I ask your pardon . There is much good in your heart . GEORGE SAND I have opened it to you . And then from a sublimated height of spirituality . You will tell him to go with me . MME . DE MUSSET on the verge of a collapse.I  --  I  --  GEORGE SAND very gently.You will , mother ? MME . DE MUSSET slowly.Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushes triumphantly to the door of the kitchen . GEORGE SAND calling.Alfred , Alfred . Madame , you have chosen well . But the emotional strain has been too much for MME . DE . MUSSET and she is weeping when ALFRED enters . ALFRED Mother , my mother , do not weep . If one of us must suffer , it shall not be you . p. 49 MME . DE MUSSET My son , my son . ALFRED You have suffered agony to give me life , shall I not suffer agony to bring you peace ? Come , mother , I renounce my love , and will go with you . And MME . DE MUSSET is so swept away by her son 's nobility that she forgets her words to GEORGE . MME . DE MUSSET throwing her arms about him.Then come , my Alfred , and your mother will help you to forget . They move towards the door . A pause . GEORGE is almost swooning . But a moment later and she is ready even for this seeming defeat on the brink of victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with his life And then very tragically . He will not hesitate if you come between us . He is a genius , and geniuses do not stop to think . In horror MME . DE MUSSET looks at ALFRED . Dejectedly he turns away , his head fallen . MME . DE MUSSET in terror.No ! No ! Not that ! Not that ! The men crowd in at the doorway . ALFRED I am but a poor reed , broken in the wind of destiny . GEORGE watches MME . DE MUSSET . Her last thrust has gone home. p. 50 HEINE with a quick glance at GEORGE as she puts on the new bonnet bought for Italy.The wind has changed . ALFRED I am ready , mother . I shall go with you , tho I leave my life behind me . Candle-light and pathos crown the scene . Then MME . DE MUSSET speaks . MME . DE MUSSET her voice trembling.No , Alfred , you shall go to Italy . I am your mother and I wish it . I have misjudged this lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sinks into a chair at the table and ALFRED throws himself on his knees before her . ALFRED My mother , my noble mother . Pause . Tableau , then BULOZ bustles in . BULOZ briskly.You have n't much time , if you 're leaving tonight . The diligence starts from the Post in ten minutes . GEORGE SAND Quick , Rosalie , a cab , a cab . ROSALIE rushes out . Alfred , when Elysium beckons we 'll not wait for baggage . Buloz , give Rosalie two hundred francs and send my trunks to Genoa and twenty reams of Weynan paper . My pen adores it . Alfred , Alfred , the world is kind . ALFRED has got up and braced himself with half a bottle of claret. p. 51 ALFRED gayly.I 'll write five comedies , a tragedy and three books of poems . BULOZ Hurry ! Hurry ! One or two wraps and a few small bags are hustled into the hall . HEINE Good-bye , fond lovers , the Gods have made you artists . ROSALIE comes rushing in . GEORGE SAND rapturously.And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab in the courtyard . Then to GEORGE . He said you told him to wait all evening . GEORGE from her pinnacle , disregarding this last blatant proof of her campaigning . GEORGE SAND Good-bye ,  --  farewell , my friends . And then beautifully to MME . DE MUSSET . Madame , God looks down on us . Love is all . MME . DE MUSSET suddenly succumbing to the practical.Be sure that Alfred wears his heaviest flannels in that drafty diligence . GEORGE SAND Trust me ! Love is all ! And snatching her half-finished manuscript from the desk , she and ALFRED rush from the room , followed by BULOZ and HEINE . MME . DE MUSSET sits silently , quite overcome , as PAUL runs over to the window to watch the departure ; and ROSALIE begins clearing the table . She sees the omelet. p. 52 ROSALIE laconically.And all those ten eggs wasted . Voices sound up from the courtyard . The noise has again wakened the canaries . There is a shower of song and the curtain falls. @x It is six months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danieli , Venice . It is evening . Through a great Venetian window , back center , in the distance across the Grand Canal , can be seen the Island of San Giorgio with its Campanile silhouetted against the moon . The room is huge , tiled and gloomy . Deep shadows are everywhere . A few chairs are about . MADAME 'S writing desk piled high with manuscripts is in a corner , and to the right a great four-poster bed with the curtains drawn . But the hand of the occupant hangs below them and is just visible in the dim light of a night lamp which stands on a little bottle-covered table near the bed . There is a suggestion of the atmosphere of a sick-room , but somehow the idea of gloom is not too pervasive . Outside on the Grand Canal a " serenata " is in full swing . One hears the call of the gondoliers , the bump of the boats , the chatter of voices , the beating of tambourines and the shrill laughter of women , like little rockets shooting up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a man 's voice sings , lusciously , meltingly , a Venetian love song with an accompaniment like a Barcarole of Mendelssohn . Italy  --  night  --  and love  --  and this sick-room . But still the background is fitting for in the deep , dark embrasure of the Venetian window in the rear which opens on a balcony over the canal , two figures are leaning , listening to their hearts and the music . They are GEORGE and her lover . GEORGE SAND No ! No ! Do n't answer . The stillness is too eloquent . Listen ! Listen ! The voice of the singer at the serenata , lifts in poignant ecstasy. p. 54 GEORGE SAND Listen , his voice has reached the stars that bend down to hear . Ah , my beloved , love is the end and the beginning . They are smoking in the shadows of the deep window . The fumes float out . GEORGE SAND Do you know what my life has been until you came bearing a light in the darkness ? Nights of despair and dawns of disillusionment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . She is almost sobbing . That thought came to me yesterday in the Hebrew cemetery . All was over and now love again sings in my heart . Let silence be our prayer of thanksgiving . A moment 's attempt at this " silence , " but the crowd outside do not understand its beautiful necessity and the next second the song is over and a tumultuous burst of applause lifts from the waters . GEORGE SAND And now we 'll have tea . How beautifully he sang . Music is perpetual passion yearning forever . Sh !  --  you must n't speak so loudly or our patient may awake . She comes from the window . Her lover stops in the shadow watching her as she glides about . She dips a taper into the night lamp and at the end of the room farthest from the bed lights a candle standing in a bracket hanging on the wall . The stage grows a little lighter . She is dressed in man 's clothing and is smoking a huge cigar . She leans over a little brazier. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adore cooking . Even making tea fascinates me . That 's why Dumas would never come to see me in Paris  --  ah , Paris  --  he was jealous of my sauces . She pours a little water into a teapot . Come , dear , it 's ready . And DR . PAGELLO steps out of the shadow of the window . He is GEORGE 'S deep-eyed , hesitant , but none too brilliant Italian doctor . He has no mental distinction , no authority , no particular magnetism , but he is charmingly simple and GEORGE has discovered in him a latent talent for the tender one-syllabled sort of love which at the moment of the threatening " debacle " of her affair with DE MUSSET , her soul needs ; and withal though he is not too masterful he is extraordinarily handsome . GEORGE SAND Sh  --  You must n't speak too loudly . He may awake . She glances toward the bed . Though he has outraged our love , still I pity him . PAGELLO He needs sleep badly . GEORGE SAND Ah , my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is weak , weak  --  his imagination has sapped his will . And then rather mysteriously . But he must not pass beyond . PAGELLO No . He will live , but I do not see why you say pass beyond . It is very difficult for a physician to understand how you other people feel about that sort of thing . p. 56 GEORGE SAND half playfully.You ponderous scientist . You wicked , wicked materialist , do n't you believe the soul goes on forever ? Then beautifully . Is n't love ,  --  our love  --  an earthly symbol of the soul 's eternity ? Do n't you understand that , Pietro ? PAGELLO I  --  I used to understand only what I saw , but you somehow , you make me understand what I do not see . I can not explain you to myself . GEORGE SAND I thought nothing was hidden from you doctors . PAGELLO Most of the women I know are different from you . You are very unlike my mother . GEORGE SAND No , no , Pietro , perhaps you misjudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAGELLO I carry my mother 's picture with me . See . He shows her a little locket , which hangs from a chain about his neck . She is very dear to me . GEORGE SAND looking at the miniature.Your eyes  --  your brow  --  and that look of trust . Some day you must tell me all about her . You will have a little rum ? Yes  --  some day we 'll go to her  --  you and I. PAGELLO starts slightly . I 'll read her part of my latest novel . I wrote for six hours last night . p. 57 PAGELLO deeply concerned.That 's too much . GEORGE SAND And for seven again this morning before breakfast . I 've gotten used to it . She glances toward the bed , and then with a note of genuine sadness in her voice . It helps me to forget . PAGELLO professionally.Work like that is bad for you , you can not keep it up ,  --  or  --  GEORGE SAND Is it can or can not ? I must live and to live I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE SAND Yes , yes , I know . She is smiling gently at him . Your mother will like my book and you too , Pietro . It is written out of my heart . PAGELLO I think my father would care more to hear it . He is a scholar , you know . He has come up from Castelfranco to read some books in the library here . He is waiting for me in the Piazzetta ; we are to have ices together . All day he is busy with his books , and in the evening I meet him . GEORGE SAND You are a dutiful son .

GEORGE SAND Some day I shall put that scene into a novel . Why not  --  life is my theme . He has come reeling home . He has squandered his money and mine , Pietro . He has lost thousands of francs at the tables . I sent to Paris , Buloz advanced me more . PAGELLO What ? This money that you earn , writing day and night ,  --  GEORGE SAND Yes !

Do you remember Dante ?  --  your Dante  --  Paolo , Francesca ,  --  only I must change the words a little . She smiles faintly . I must say ; that day I wrote no more . She drifts over to the window . She leans out . Ah ! Pietro , the night is like a drawn sword . Listen , the very stars are singing . p. 65 PAGELLO a little confused.No , that 's the tenor at the serenata . Ah , how I love you !

George , George , how grateful I am to God that so beautiful a soul as yours has bent down to me . GEORGE SAND Bent , my darling ? No ! It is you who have lifted me from despair .

There is only one cup . PAGELLO not noticing this , takes it up . PAGELLO sipping his tea.It tastes strange . GEORGE SAND fantastically.Nude girls gathered it . PAGELLO It certainly does taste different . GEORGE SAND continuing.It 's what the jeweled and drowsy nabobs sip whilst they loll in their hammocks of spun silk . She goes over to her desk and makes a note on the back of one of the sheets of her manuscript paper . GEORGE SAND writing.That 's a beautiful sentence . It has the odor of twilights in the East .

GEORGE SAND admonishing him , as she glances toward the bed.No , no , Pietro , you are too impetuous . Our poor Alfred might need something . PAGELLO He is almost well , tomorrow he can get up . He takes up his tea-cup . GEORGE SAND I am waiting till he is strong again . She glances at the doctor . Then he must be told . PAGELLO He has my pity . Sooner or later he would find out . GEORGE SAND Yes  --  we are above subterfuge . PAGELLO sipping his tea.But you are n't drinking . He looks down at the table to hand her the other cup . Why look ,  --  there is only one . GEORGE SAND Is n't one enough , Pietro ? She is over next to him . I shall sup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . And she does so , and his arm goes about her waist . And the next moment she is in his lap . And their mouths are almost touching as they press the cup to their lips . And at this moment ALFRED 'S night-capped head pops out through the curtains of the bed behind them . Tableau . He chokes back an exclamation of amazement and the curtains hanging about him tremble . GEORGE SAND wistfully.There now  --  I have had my tea . PAGELLO ardently.And I shall have my kiss . GEORGE SAND faintly.Pietro ! Pietro ! And ALFRED , pale as the curtains about him , leans forward , watching them . And passionately they embrace and then suddenly she jumps up and as suddenly ALFRED drops back behind the curtains . GEORGE SAND the " claircissement " has come.Now I understand everything . I see it all clearly . PAGELLO quite taken by surprise.What 's the matter ? GEORGE SAND We must go away , and at once . p. 69 PAGELLO What  --  GEORGE SAND We can not stay . It is a desecration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an insult to this love of ours . We dare not hesitate . PAGELLO I  --  George  --  GEORGE SAND Life is calling us . This room stifles me . PAGELLO practical as ever.Then let 's go out on the balcony . GEORGE SAND No , no , come , come away , away . PAGELLO quite misunderstanding her dynamic impetuosity.Shall we go to the Lido ? Shall I call a gondola ? GEORGE SAND No , no , to the Alpine valleys . I am dressed for climbing . PAGELLO completely stupefied.What ! George ! GEORGE SAND It is spring  --  spring . The thought gives a buoyant ring to her voice . We will wander hand in hand like innocent , laughing children , and we will love to the sound of the tumbling cascades . PAGELLO stands looking at her in wonder . GEORGE SAND And then  --  Paris . We 've got to be in time , Pietro , to see my little darlings , Solange , Maurice , take their prizes at school . p. 70 PAGELLO who can scarcely gasp.To Paris  --  GEORGE SAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . ALFRED , his head poked out on the other side , is listening . Let us not hesitate . A moment may shatter  --  all . PAGELLO completely at a loss.But  --  GEORGE SAND For weeks , weeks I have known this would come . I have prophetic visions . Tomorrow , the day after , it will be the same . I can not live in the shadow of these memories . PAGELLO not quite keyed to such speed.And  --  de Musset  --  ? GEORGE SAND He shall be told . But now , now we can not wait . We must leave together . Destiny has spoken . She is in his arms , and ALFRED is leaning half out of bed . His intentions are patently to have something to do with this destiny , but as GEORGE sweeps forward , he involuntarily slips back . GEORGE SAND Come , Pietro . PAGELLO not knowing what to say.And leave Venice ?  --  George  --  GEORGE SAND I have been sent to save you , you must go lest your future sink in the mud of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 71 PAGELLO And my patients ? GEORGE SAND inspirationally.Your patients  --  why , emperors shall call you in for gallstones . PAGELLO still unpersuaded.And my mother ? GEORGE SAND involuntarily.Mother , mother . No , no . That must n't happen again . But in a moment she has recovered . You must be free to realize yourself . I have done that . I am free . PAGELLO still doubtful.And my father ? GEORGE SAND Have you any aunts or uncles ? Your father , what of him ? PAGELLO He will never consent to this . GEORGE SAND I shall persuade him . PAGELLO in amazement.You ? GEORGE SAND He is eating ices in the Piazzetta . He is a scholar . You told me this . A scholar who is eating ices  --  the combination proves him gentle . He will understand . He will bless you and send you with me . PAGELLO But  --  GEORGE SAND Again but  --  nothing but buts . Come , Pietro . Come . They are at the door. p. 72 PAGELLO pointing to her trousers.Can you go like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . PAGELLO This is madness . GEORGE SAND Love has spoken . PAGELLO But my father will never consent to this . GEORGE SAND undaunted.I know a parent 's heart . ALFRED is about to call out . I have not lived my life for nothing . Come ! The scent of the almond bloom is calling . And half dragging him after her they are gone . ALFRED gazes after them in speechless astonishment . Then he tries to get up to follow . He is too weak . He falls back on the bed . Very far in the distance the noise of the serenata can be heard . Slowly he rouses himself . He pours out some brandy which stands on the little table near the bed . Half swooning he reaches the window . He tries to call out . His strength fails him . He leans against the window frame . Suddenly there is a knock at the door and he turns to see PAUL at the threshold . ALFRED Paul ! PAUL Good God , Alfred , what 's the matter ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 73 PAUL Where 's George ? ALFRED leaning on him reaches the bed . ALFRED Eating ices on the Piazzetta . PAUL She leaves you alone like this ? ALFRED She must have her ices . He pours out another glass of brandy . You did n't write you were coming . What brings you to Venice ? PAUL Mother sent me . She was uneasy . ALFRED Uneasy ? PAUL Yes . You and George . Your letters came less frequently . ALFRED I 've been busy . I 've started three tragedies , four comedies and a book of poems . How 's mother ? PAUL She sends her kindliest greetings to George . ALFRED smiling faintly.Yes  --  PAUL When will George be back ? ALFRED When ? PAUL Mother is so grateful to her . Buloz says she 's taken such good care of you . ALFRED And  --  PAUL But lately he 's been silent . Mother drove to his office every day . p. 74 ALFRED Poor Buloz  --  PAUL And all he would do was to sit there looking at her strangely thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stare back thru her lorgnon . Curious , is n't it , Paul ? Sometimes the harder people look the less they see . PAUL Of course I told her everything was all right . ALFRED on the verge of laughter.Of course . PAUL I saw Heine . ALFRED Yes ? PAUL Said he knew nothing but he advised me to leave it all to George . Said that she would manage somehow . ALFRED She has managed ,  --  somehow . He is laughing to himself . PAUL I told Heine I was going to Venice . ALFRED Yes . PAUL He sent you a message . ALFRED A blessing that sneers ? PAUL No , he told me to tell you that Hell is the place where the satisfied compare disappointments . ALFRED He knows . p. 75 PAUL You 're so white , Alfred , what 's the matter ? ALFRED I 've been ill . Sunstroke , lying on the beach at the Lido . PAUL You should have known better . ALFRED I could n't get away . George insisted on reading me her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and not the sun . PAUL You 're better now ? ALFRED Tomorrow I 'll be about again . PAUL Mother sent you this . He hands him a letter . ALFRED slipping it under his pillow.How much ? PAUL A thousand francs . ALFRED petulantly flinging himself back on the pillow.But I needed fifteen hundred . Has she forgiven my going ? PAUL A week after and she was glad you 'd gone . ALFRED Glad ? PAUL Said it would do you good to see life . ALFRED Yes  --  Yes  --  It 's done me good . Have a bit of brandy , Paul . He sits up and pours out a little in a glass. p. 76 PAUL As I came by two men raced past me . They almost knocked me over . ALFRED sipping his brandy.You 're not easily bowled over , are you , Paul ? PAUL These Italians have such brutal manners . But just the same I was amused . ALFRED Yes . PAUL One of them bore the strangest resemblance to George . ALFRED Naturally . PAUL What ? ALFRED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say naturally ? ALFRED speaking slowly and rather amused , watching the effect on PAUL.It was George . PAUL What ? George ? Running thru the streets with another man dressed like that ! ALFRED a twinkle in his voice.To hesitate is to hinder history . PAUL Ca n't you be serious ? Where were they running to ? ALFRED As far as their trousered legs can carry them . PAUL What ? ALFRED If something does n't stop them they 'll reach the end of the earth and then drop off . p. 77 PAUL You mean the Grand Canal ? ALFRED Not exactly . But something will stop them . PAUL I hope so . Can she swim ? ALFRED In any waters . But she 'll be stopped unless I am mistaken and by something she does n't quite expect . The old man 's a scholar . PAUL in the dark.What ? ALFRED She 'll bump into his papa . PAUL mystified.Papa ? ALFRED Yes . The papa of the other man who nearly knocked you over . PAUL I  --  ALFRED shedding the light.She is planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended ? ALFRED How swiftly you deduce . A great philosopher lies buried deep  --  very deep , in you . PAUL If ever again I believe in a woman I 'll cease to believe in God . I 've come just in time . Mother was right to send me . Perhaps I can patch it up . ALFRED No , leave it torn . That 's how the light soaks thru . p. 78 PAUL sympathetically coming towards him.My poor , poor Alfred . Do n't let it hurt too much . Paris is crowded with women . They may n't all know literature but nearly all know love . ALFRED Yes , Paul . PAUL My poor , poor brother . ALFRED My poor , poor imbecile . Thank God it 's over ! I wish she were in Hell ! And PAUL flops back into his chair and then ALFRED lets loose what has been storing up in him for months . ALFRED I ca n't bear her about me . She 's like a noisy old clock that ca n't stop ticking . Why , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sunstroke He takes a gulp of brandy. to sit next to my bed scratching away all night at her endless novels . She writes as a cow gives milk . All she has to do is to jerk at her mind . Sometimes I drank a little to forget . PAUL in silent astonishment sits listening . There are two ways to get to know a person , Paul . Gambling with them or travelling with them . The first is better , it 's over sooner . His pent-up vehemence comes pouring out . She has the soul of a bourgeoise . One day I sat there trying to write and what do you think I heard in the next room ? She was telling the chambermaid  --  the chambermaid , Paul , how her mother was dancing at a ball a month before her marriage and how she stopped in the middle of the quadrille and five minutes afterwards gave birth to George . p. 79 PAUL My God  --  no  --  ALFRED I called her in . I remonstrated with her and she sneered at my hypocritical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? ALFRED She laughed at me and said that many of the best family trees bore the worst fruit . I rushed away and drank , drank , drank And he does so. to forget the vulgarity of it all . PAUL commiseratingly.My poor Alfred ! ALFRED And when I got back , there she sat scribbling . All my beautiful , glorious ideas deserted me . There she sat  --  scribbling , scribbling all the night long , scratching away like a rusty old file . He is exhausted and falls weakly back on the bed . PAUL leaning over him.My poor brother , what you have lived thru . ALFRED Think of it , Paul . Only a few minutes ago I caught them kissing , actually kissing , in the shadow of my bed ,  --  my bed of torture . PAUL slowly.What will mother say ? ALFRED She must never know . p. 80 PAUL Two weeks and the boulevards will be gabbing . George tells everything to Buloz . ALFRED She tells everything to everybody . Then half bitterly , half humorously . Copy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know the truth . ALFRED suddenly sitting up.What ? PAUL I 'll answer her . Leave it to me ; wait and see . ALFRED making the most of the moment by adding to the data.There she lay in his arms , Paul , drinking my tea from the one cup , both of them , whilst she mumbled something about haste and almond blossoms . PAUL And so George the untiring , weary of the de Musset doll , tosses the broken puppet into a corner . ALFRED God knows how kind , how gentle , I have been with her . And then he too begins thinking of the beginning of their love in Paris . How she urged me to go to Italy when I hesitated . I at least have been faithful . PAUL And now she 's leaving you ? ALFRED If fate is kind and the old father is a fool . If he ca n't stop her nothing will . Listen , they are coming back . He points to a door beyond the bed . Quick , wait in there . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next instant the door flies open and LUCREZIA VIOLENTE , PAGELLO 'S mistress , rushes into the room . She is tense , dark , scented , a colorful combination of a languorous poppy when happy and an angry firecracker when stirred . She slams the door behind her and leans against it. p. 81 VIOLENTE panting.I must speak with you , you . She glares at ALFRED . You ! And PAUL with a sly , knowing glance at his brother , begins to whistle a sprightly snatch of a love song and then trips over to examine more closely the beautiful , though tempestuous LUCREZIA . ALFRED to PAUL.What are you doing ? What 's the matter with you ? PAUL smiling significantly.So ! So ! My naughty , naughty brother . And this is why the George gets on your poor nerves . But I do n't blame you , Alfred , really I do n't . Very intimately he begins ogling LUCREZIA and whistling even louder . He steps with a swaggering familiarity closer to her . ALFRED coming between them.I tell you to wait in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three 's a chaperon . And he enjoys his wit immensely , to the intense discomfort of ALFRED and the astonishment of LUCREZIA . ALFRED Get out . I tell you I 've never seen the girl before .

VIOLENTE with terrific speed as she speaks throughout.Lucrezia Maria Camilla Elvira Violente . ALFRED rather gallantly but a bit uncertain.And what do you wish with me , my dear ? VIOLENTE resenting his tone.What do you think ? ALFRED taking her in.Well  --  er  --  er  --  LUCREZIA with a slight swagger steps towards him . VIOLENTE Well ! ALFRED smiling at her.Did the French Consul send you to me ? VIOLENTE No one has sent me . ALFRED I have n't seen you at the serenatas . VIOLENTE No . ALFRED Nor at the opera . VIOLENTE No . ALFRED Nor in the Piazzetta , watching the fireworks . VIOLENTE as he steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ground but he is ALFRED and she is beautiful.Well , you see And then very sweetly. , my dear  --  He is closer to her. p. 83 VIOLENTE starting back.My dear !

VIOLENTE Lucrezia , Maria  --  ALFRED stemming the tide.Yes , yes  --  but where do you come from ? VIOLENTE From Castelfranco . ALFRED And what do you want with me ? VIOLENTE not tempering her disdain.You  --  I want nothing with you . ALFRED resenting this , his tone a mixture of surprise and disappointment.Then why do you come here ? VIOLENTE almost spitting the words in his face.It is your woman , your woman that I want . ALFRED in the dark.What  --  why , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bah ! With a gesture as though wiping him off her hands . I am an Italian . I want to see this George Sand . She has a curious way of sounding the " e " in George . ALFRED backing into a chair at the table.Yes . I see that you 're an Italian . And what do you want with Mme. Sand ? VIOLENTE mysteriously handling something which is in her belt under her shawl and speaking very simply like a wide-eyed child.I wish to kill her . ALFRED darting back.Good God ! Who are you ? What are you ? VIOLENTE coming close to him and leaning in his face as she speaks the words slowly and with intense significance.I am a friend  --  a good friend  --  of Dr. Pietro Pagello . Do you understand me , you Frenchman ? ALFRED the light breaking.How did you get in here ? VIOLENTE I said I had come to nurse the invalid . Bah ! She glares at him in abject disgust . And now where is this Signora George Sand ? ALFRED She has gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a friend  --  a friend .

Yes  --  yes . His imagination begins to work . Madame could n't stand the noise of the serenata . Listen , it 's coming back . The boats on the Canal have shifted and are coming nearer . Listen ! VIOLENTE So ! So ! She draws a chair away from the table and sits watching ALFRED . Then I will wait till she comes back from this open sea beyond Murano with this friend . Her breath comes in little panting gasps . Madonna mia , this friend  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away all night . VIOLENTE her eyes aflame.Madonna mia .

Ca n't you see I 'm in my dressing gown ? VIOLENTE If you are so modest , my little Frenchman , then go back to bed . I did n't come to talk with you . ALFRED But see here  --  people do n't do that sort of thing . Stop and think . VIOLENTE My heart speaks . I do not stop to think . ALFRED No . I can see that . VIOLENTE What do I care what you see ?

ALFRED at a loss.Yes  --  was  --  that is  --  yes  --  yes , of course I am . His emotions are mixed . Now you just go away and I 'll have a nice little talk with George and she 'll send him back to you . VIOLENTE the hand under her shawl nervously twitching.If  --  I  --  no , no  --  there is nothing but milk in your veins . ALFRED vainly groping for a way out.Yes , yes , lots of milk .

He tries to get up but sinks back on the pillow . Quick ! Some verses have come to me , beautiful verses . The first in months . There is something pathetic in his voice . LUCREZIA goes towards the desk . ALFRED Yes . That 's it . Several sheets . VIOLENTE lifting up some of the pages of GEORGE 'S latest romance.This ? ALFRED Yes , yes . It 's her new novel .

He begins writing whilst she backs to the table and sits watching him . VIOLENTE under her breath.I can not understand these Frenchmen . They are mad . And in her deep disgust she goes to the window and stands looking out . ALFRED fanning his inspiration.Yes  --  yes  --  yes  --  His pen glides over the paper . Silence for a moment , only the scratching of the quill is heard . Then suddenly voices sound just outside the door . LUCREZIA leaps up like a smoldering flame that is hit by the wind , and instinctively glides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall from ALFRED 'S hand to the floor as swiftly he draws the curtains together and slips back into the bed . A moment and GEORGE triumphantly enters smoking a huge cigar and at her heels is Pagello , his big eyes filled with love. p. 91 PAGELLO Ah , my beloved , how you spoke to him . There were tears in his eyes . Such eloquence . LUCREZIA is watching them . She is mystified . PAGELLO is PAGELLO but who is GEORGE ? The man 's costume baffles her , the room is but dimly lit . But then GEORGE speaks . GEORGE SAND No , Pietro , it was not my eloquence . Then the girl recognizes her . She is about to spring forward but GEORGE goes on . GEORGE SAND lyrically.He understood my sorrow . I will bless and remember him forever . His heart is gentle . There is only one wound that hurts my happiness . PAGELLO There is much perhaps that I should tell you . GEORGE SAND No , no , not you . Then sadly she glances towards the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE SAND Tomorrow we may die . Life has spoken . What must be , must be . She goes towards the bed . She draws back the curtains . Tenderly she leans over the patient . GEORGE SAND Alfred ! Alfred ! A moment 's quiet . Then ALFRED stirs in his slumber . Then he awakes. p. 92 ALFRED with a far-away voice.Ah ! You , George . What time is it ? You 've been gone so long . He leans out of bed and looks about him . Ah ! She is gone . LUCREZIA is too deep in the window for him to see her , but she too is leaning forward listening . GEORGE SAND at a loss.Who ? Who ? ALFRED That 's well . That is well . She is gone . GEORGE SAND mystified.Who ? Who ? ALFRED Perhaps I 've been dreaming . I 'm so tired . PAGELLO Yes . Lie down . Then softly to GEORGE . He still is weak and imagines that he sees things . He draws her away from the bed . Wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ALFRED trying to overhear them.What are you two whispering about ? Do n't tell me that I 've got to take one of those nasty powders and more milk . I 'll fling it out of the window . GEORGE SAND Yes . He 's better . Much better . It is time . She goes towards the bed and stands for a moment looking at him . Her hesitancy worries him. p. 93 ALFRED encouragingly.I 'm well again . Strong as a porter . He glances at GEORGE . Look . And expectantly he sits bolt upright in the bed . My sunstroke 's over . GEORGE SAND Ah , my friend , you must beware of this sun that comes in bottles . ALFRED Strong as two porters that I 've seen somewheres . GEORGE SAND putting her hand on his shoulder . Her tone is simple but deeply fraught.Alfred , I have something to say to you . ALFRED eagerly.Yes  --  yes  --  GEORGE SAND almost philosophically.Life is so different from literature . ALFRED not expecting the digression.What ? GEORGE SAND Some day I must use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unelaborate . ALFRED lest her commentary go on too long.Doctor , do you think I 'm strong enough to talk literature ? GEORGE SAND No , my friend , I have n't come to speak of literature  --  but life . But I was thinking after all how very simple reality really is . Be brave , Alfred , I have something to say to you . p. 94 ALFRED Yes ? GEORGE SAND We are at the cross-roads . Even as Ruth A puff at her cigar and Naomi . As always God and the Bible are her refuge . ALFRED impatiently.Yes  --  yes . GEORGE SAND very simply.I can no longer be your mistress , Alfred . I can only be your friend . I love Dr. Pagello . A pause . Four hearts are for a moment still . From the water lifts the sound of the serenata . The girl in the window starts forward but the next instant out of the bed comes what is meant to be a heart-broken wail of despair . ALFRED from among the pillows.George , George , why do you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brave , my friend . PAGELLO stands looking at her in rapture . I tell you this because I can not let the shadow of a lie dim the fading memory of what once we were to one another . And she takes a long deep pull at her cigar . ALFRED George , George , how can I bear this ? p. 95 GEORGE SAND We are but born to bear . We poor pilgrims . And she smiles tenderly at the doctor . Life is our cross . Then she turns to ALFRED . I shall remember that once I loved you . ALFRED taking her hand and pressing it to his lips.Though I weep I shall remember He is perhaps sobbing a little. what you have done for me . LUCREZIA in blank-eyed amazement leans forward listening to their beautiful pathos . GEORGE SAND It is over , over . Our poor romance is ended . Time has written Then she turns graciously to PAGELLO. finito . Come , Pietro , this place is no longer holy . This shrine of love has been defiled . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the something in the window is almost convulsed with passionate hate . GEORGE SAND Come , my beloved . And then she turns to ALFRED , speaking with childlike frankness . We must go from here . Out into the light . We are going high into the mountains where the air shall purify . There , there perhaps I shall be able to forget . She turns to the doctor . Come , my beloved . She is almost in his arms but suddenly from the window there is a mad little yelp of rage and the next instant LUCREZIA springs forward confronting her , burning , indomitable. p. 96 ALFRED as the beautiful structure of similes tumbles.She ! She ! I thought she 'd gone . PAGELLO as tho shot.Lucrezia , you ! You ! GEORGE SAND quite calmly.Good evening , Madame . Did you climb up the columns to the balcony ? VIOLENTE You shall not take him . You shall not . GEORGE SAND What , Madame ? VIOLENTE I shall kill you . GEORGE SAND oblivious.I ca n't see how you ever did it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pietroninni , caro mio , caro mio  --  you no longer love me  --  me . She is shrieking . Dio ,  --  Madonna  --  you no longer love me . GEORGE SAND I beg you , Madame , not to shout . My friend Monsieur de Musset is none too strong . Wo n't you be seated ? And GEORGE sits down at the table unbuttoning the lowest button of her vest . VIOLENTE Who are you ? What are you ? You crazy woman ! Her fingers are twitching . You woman in breeches dressed like that . p. 97 PAGELLO Lucrezia , be still , be still . VIOLENTE poco fortissimo.No ! No ! She must listen . No ! No ! GEORGE SAND I am trying to , Madame , but you make so much noise . I can not hear you . VIOLENTE piu forte.I make noise ! No ! No ! I make no noise ! She is almost dancing in her rage . GEORGE SAND What a fascinating personality ! And she goes over to her desk and brings over some manuscript paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE SAND No , I would n't do that . It is n't nice . VIOLENTE Nice ! Nice ! I dig my nails in your heart . GEORGE SAND sweetly.My dear girl , save up all that energy and one of these days you 'll bring beautiful children into this ugly world . I am a mother and I know . LUCREZIA suddenly whips the stiletto from under her shawl and springs towards GEORGE . VIOLENTE You sneer , you short-haired French one . And she makes a dash towards her . PAGELLO catches her by the wrist and the knife falls to the floor. p. 98 PAGELLO For God 's sake , what are you doing ? GEORGE SAND calmly taking notes.Ah ! What a place to end a chapter . PAGELLO struggling with the girl.Do you know who she is ? VIOLENTE trying to get away.What do I care who , what she is . PAGELLO with a sort of awe.She is the great George Sand . And GEORGE glances up from her writing smilingly to accept the compliment . PAGELLO She is a famous woman . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching one of the posts . ALFRED Have you no respect for literature ? VIOLENTE in blinding scorn , sizzling over like a miniature Vesuvius.Literature ! What do I care  --  literature , lies , lies . I too know literature . And then in her rage she flings out all the names she can remember , mixing geography with letters to justify her claim . Dante , Dante , Alighieri , Tasso , Campanile , San Marco , Venezia , Ariosto , Petrarca , Laura . Literature , bah ! bah !  --  lies , lies ! I spit at them . I spit at you . She is again going for GEORGE wildly gesticulating and PAGELLO again intercepts her . Suddenly in a wild paroxysm of passion she clutches him to her breast . By this time ALFRED is almost tumbling out of bed and GEORGE sits quietly writing. p. 99 VIOLENTE clinging to him , her voice hot with passion and rage.I love you . I hate you . I love you . I speak your name when I sleep ; when I go to the well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and drink . GEORGE SAND writing as quickly as she can.Charming , charming . Do you mind repeating that ? How many times did you say drink ? Alfred , what does fiction know of life ? LUCREZIA clings to PAGELLO as to a spar in this tossing sea of passion . VIOLENTE Pietro ! Pietroninni ! ALFRED looking at GEORGE and speaking into the curtain of his bed.God ! That woman , even now she can write . GEORGE SAND Ah ! What a scene this will make when I 'm thru with it . Such fervor , such reality . Buloz will be delighted . PAGELLO has forced LUCREZIA into a chair . In a frenzy her fists beat the table . GEORGE SAND Do n't do that , my dear , or I ca n't write . And then LUCREZIA , her passion for the moment spent , goes forward , her head in her arms , shaken with convulsive weeping . And then GEORGE springs up and goes over to her . Her whole manner changes . She speaks to her as she would to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , Madame . I speak to you out of my soul . I too have loved and lost . Sorrowfully she glances at ALFRED . That is the lot of us poor women . We give our love only to be forsaken . PAGELLO half in a whisper , half stupidly.I wanted to tell you , tell you all . GEORGE SAND No , no , do n't speak . I understand . And then with a tone of universal pity . We are but human . By a glance she even includes ALFRED in her deep love for humanity . Then sympathetically to LUCREZIA . Life has spoken and life must be answered . He has come to save me when my nature faltered and he shall go with me  --  eventually  --  to Paris . And at this LUCREZIA springs up . This is the last straw . Again her rage begins to bubble . VIOLENTE No . No . GEORGE SAND Not right away . After we have found love in the Alpine valleys . Ah , the scent of the almond blossoms . VIOLENTE turning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lied to me . You have deserted me . GEORGE SAND gliding between them.Madame , you are wrong . He has not deserted you . God has sent him . p. 101 VIOLENTE No ! No ! GEORGE SAND Who can change the choice of love ? It is as blind as we . VIOLENTE by this time strident.No ! No ! You shall not take him . You shall not take him . GEORGE SAND Love is our master . This is almost to herself . A sad little smile plays about her lips . VIOLENTE glaring at her.You ! You oil your words with lies . GEORGE is standing in a sort of sublimated ecstasy lit by the light from the night lamp . The music sounds from the serenata . ALFRED on the bed 's edge sits watching her in wonder . GEORGE SAND her head shaking slowly.Love gives us power  --  power but to obey . VIOLENTE almost frightened.Pietro ! Look ! The devil 's speaking to her . Come away . Her heart is black . A moment 's pause . They all look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar and goes over to her desk to make a note of this power of love . GEORGE SAND to LUCREZIA . From the farthest heights of sisterly sympathy.Madame , you have my love . LUCREZIA makes another dash for the knife . PAGELLO stops her. p. 102 GEORGE SAND Take her to her gondola , Pietro . ALFRED starts . I shall watch from the window . And PAGELLO attempts to lead the struggling LUCREZIA from the room . VIOLENTE in a last wild frenzy.You shall not take him . No ! No ! GEORGE SAND quietly.Love has spoken . PAGELLO and the girl have almost reached the door . VIOLENTE I 'll follow him . I 'll save him . He will come back to me . ALFRED involuntarily.I wonder . VIOLENTE I will follow you to Paris or  --  to Hell . She is half kissing , half beating the doctor as he leads her from the room . GEORGE SAND at her desk making a last note or so.What a wonderful girl . The most splendid type I have seen in Italy . Ah , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window and leans out to see that no harm comes to PIETRO . ALFRED lifting up the sheets of manuscript near the bed.Look , George , I have been reading your last few pages . They are wonderful . How you have moved me . If I could write as you  --  p. 103 GEORGE SAND I 'll do even better after tonight . Ah ! There they are ! She is weeping . How gently he helps her into her gondola . ALFRED braces himself with another swallow of brandy and steps towards her . ALFRED There is something besides farewell that I must say to you . GEORGE SAND oblivious.He shall be the hero of my next romance . ALFRED with a strange note of seriousness in his voice.Some day , George , this love of yours will break your heart . GEORGE SAND almost tragically.You say that after what you have done to me . Then again at the window , her voice low and tender . Look , Freddo , they are weeping . ALFRED for a moment succumbing to her mood.You will never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing.Ah , my friend , do not let the sorrow of our parting break your heart . Some day you will forget me . ALFRED sadly.If such is fate . GEORGE SAND almost sternly.Our fate is what we make it . p. 104 ALFRED with a note of bitterness.Do you remember that night in Paris ? " We are but marionettes , " you said . GEORGE SAND her voice soft again.Pietro  --  my Pietro  --  ALFRED " Hung from the fingers of the gods . " Heine stopped you as he broke his bread . GEORGE SAND He eats too much . Besides Heine is a German and I mistrust him . ALFRED That is true of all of us , he echoed . GEORGE SAND again leaning out.Look at his profile in the moonlight . Worthy of Giorgione . I shall love him forever . ALFRED You too , George  --  even you  --  must jig to this music of fate . GEORGE SAND lyric , dominant , speaking as a priestess with a prophecy.There is no such thing as fate . That is what life has still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coward . I at least am mistress of my destiny . ALFRED with a touch of cynicism , perhaps of anger in his voice.We shall see . GEORGE SAND in glory.Look ! He is coming back . Yes , we shall see . And she rushes over to the door and stands anxiously waiting , and in a moment she is in PIETRO 'S arms. p. 105 GEORGE SAND Ah ! How noble you were , my Pietro , and she ,  --  she will forget . ALFRED sotto voce.Perhaps . GEORGE SAND sadly to ALFRED.It is time to say farewell . Once our love was noble . May our friendship still be beautiful . And she gives him her hand . ALFRED bends over it . PAGELLO catching the mood.Alfred , will we ,  --  we still be friends ? ALFRED magnificently rising to the beauty of the moment.George ,  --  Pagello ,  --  my companions , my saviors , and my friends ! Then to PAGELLO . You have given life back to me . And then to GEROGE . You have taught me the nobility of love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal our trinity of trust ? Their three hands are almost touching . Suddenly he sees LUCREZIA 'S stiletto at their feet . He can not resist the romantic effect . He takes it up . ALFRED On this let us pledge our faith ! GEORGE SAND Yes ! On this symbol of death we shall pledge our love that shall survive the tomb . p. 106 PAGELLO not quite liking the sight of LUCREZIA 'S stiletto.No ! No ! Not on that ! On this . It has never known hate ! And he tears out from under his shirt his mother 's picture . Their hands close about it . The light in the night lamp flickers . GEORGE SAND solemnly  --  lyrically.Forever friends . ALFRED echoing.Friends . PAGELLO on the verge of tears.Friends . GEORGE SAND And now farewell . Come , we shall see the sun rise , Pietro , and then to Padua . They are about to move . Then PAGELLO stops embarrassed . PAGELLO But  --  I  --  GEORGE SAND What ? What ? PAGELLO I have but His hand comes out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seven lire . And he holds them out . I have a little money in my office but most of what I make goes to my mother . GEORGE rushes over to her desk and flings the drawer open. p. 107 GEORGE SAND on the brink of disaster.Only yesterday the bill was paid . There is no money . A pause . Imminent tragedy . PAGELLO is in despair . GEORGE for the second time in six months is on the verge of swooning . ALFRED sees his freedom tumbling ; but suddenly he jumps into the breach and to the rescue . He rushes over and snatches from under his pillow the money that his mother has sent him . ALFRED Here , my friends , go , go . Love must be obeyed . Here are a thousand francs . He forces the money into PAGELLO 'S hand . GEORGE SAND gazing at him in admiring wonder.Alfred ! Alfred ! You have redeemed our love . And again their three hands are clasped , this time over the money . GEORGE SAND Come , love has saved us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then to Padua . Alfred , see Pietro 's papa and have his things and my other trousers sent there , poste restante . And she snatches her new manuscript from her writing desk and they are gone , and the door slams behind them and in the reverberating echoes ALFRED is heard laughing softly . Then he calls . ALFRED Paul . Paul . p. 108 PAUL rushing in.You 've kept me waiting . ALFRED significantly.History was in the making . PAUL And ? ALFRED leaning against the bed post.They 're gone . PAUL If you had only left it to me . ALFRED laughs . Are n't you laughing to hide something that hurts ? ALFRED Hurts ! I am healed . Gayly . I have n't felt better since Paris . PAUL And what will mother say to this ? ALFRED God bless her . She has saved me . PAUL Mother ? ALFRED Yes . The thousand francs she sent me . Her money pays their way . She 's bought me back . But the emotional strain has been too much for him . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History will complete the catalogue . Sandeau  --  Mrime  --  De Musset  --  Pa  --  The curtain is descending as he speaks . The list is incompleted , whilst from the Canal the tenor 's voice again singing of love for a little moment , lifts in poignant ecstasy and then dies away in the starlit stillness of the night. @x The scene is a reception at Baron de Rothschild 's . The room is a typical drawing-room of the period , panelled , severe , dignified , with a sense of quiet spaciousness . The furniture does not clutter the stage . What there is should be exquisite in design and lend to the general air of distinction . Down left is a fireplace , and below this is a door with a smaller drawing-room beyond . Down right is the entrance to the conservatory . Towards the rear is the entrance from the hall of the house and to the right of this a great door beyond which is the music room . If practical throughout the act , the guests should be seen coming and going , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refinedly expectant atmosphere of this soire of tuft-hunters and celebrities . Later on a charming effect could be realized if the people in the picturesque costumes of the period could be seen , rapt and ecstatic , listening to the playing of the virtuosi . I leave the possible arrangement of the room beyond to the genius of the scene designer . It is not inevitably essential to the action of the play . The lighting is candle light , low , soft , rather too little than too glaringly distinct . Throughout the act a sound of admiring murmurs and subdued applause should be heard from the music room . The curtain lifts on three pretty chattering girls , quaint , beruffled , beribboned . Two are on a long sofa and one is opposite or vice versa , rearranged as best accords with the charm of the decoration . It is the first great reception for these three demoiselles and their hearts and tongues are aflutter ; but now the curtain is lifted and you can see and hear for yourself . They are MLLE . DE LATOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MLLE . DE FLEURY I think we are too early . p. 110 MLLE . ROLANDE I am afraid I exasperated mamma . She 's in the little drawing-room . I could n't wait until we 'd started . MLLE . DE FLEURY How adorable of the Baron to ask us . MLLE . ROLANDE It was surely the idea of the Baroness . MLLE . DE FLEURY What matter ! We 're here . And as every one is going to be so important , there may as well be a few who are pretty . And they laugh like children . Do you like my new gown ? MLLE . ROLANDE Quite adorable but I think I like you in gray better . MLLE . DE FLEURY Nonsense ! And she turns to MLLE . DE LATOUR to ask her opinion , but MLLE . DE LATOUR sits deep in thought . Elise , do n't try to hide your excitement by attempting to look bored . MLLE . DE LATOUR I was just wondering how many pages of my diary I would need to write about everything tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap . MLLE . DE FLEURY A hundred at least . Then with ill-concealed excitement . Do you know who is coming ? MLLE . ROLANDE De Musset and Heine. p. 111 THE OTHER GIRLS Yes ! Yes ! MLLE . ROLANDE And the great Franz Liszt . MLLE . DE FLEURY And his rival Thalberg ? MLLE . ROLANDE I do not think so . They are seldom seen together . MLLE . DE FLEURY Who else ? Who else ? MLLE . ROLANDE Surely the Italian , Pagello . I saw him in the Palais Royal leaning on her arm . She gives a quivering stress to the " her . " MLLE . DE FLEURY Is he a blond ? I think blonds are so wonderful . MLLE . ROLANDE No , he is more wonderful than any blond . He looks like Paris of Troy . MLLE . DE LATOUR How do you know that ? MLLE . DE FLEURY Elise , you have the silliest way of asking things . And again they laugh merrily . MLLE . ROLANDE And Chopin , imagine , Chopin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROLANDE If the whim moves him . Of course the Baroness would never ask him . MLLE . DE LATOUR I do n't see why not . p. 112 MLLE . DE FLEURY Elise , you are too absurd . How could one have the atrocious taste to ask a guest to perform ? These artists are not trained monkeys who will run up a stick when you want them to . MLLE . ROLANDE I do not suppose we can ever understand them . Ah ! these artists  --  they are so different from us ordinary mortals . MLLE . DE LATOUR Yes ? MLLE . ROLANDE They are not moved by human passions as you and I. MLLE . DE FLEURY No . No . MLLE . ROLANDE Their life is aloof ,  --  removed  --  they do not suffer as we suffer . MLLE . DE FLEURY No . No . MLLE . DE LATOUR quite unsentimentally.I do not suffer . MLLE . ROLANDE Wait till you are a little older , Elise . Ah , have you seen this Pagello ? I have been dreaming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give all the world if I could be a great artist ,  --  a writer . There are only four things I love : literature , art , music and nature . Ah !  --  imagine what it would mean to see one 's name in the Revue of the great Buloz . MLLE . ROLANDE He 's coming too . p. 113 MLLE . DE LATOUR I am more anxious to see her than any of the others . MLLE . ROLANDE with awed voice.Her ! MLLE . DE FLEURY as though addressing God.Her ! MLLE . ROLANDE She is removed from earthly passions . She lives in a sphere apart . MLLE . DE LATOUR What do you mean by that ? MLLE . DE FLEURY Elise , you ask as many questions as a hungry parrot . And they all burst into ripples of laughter . Some guests pass through the room beyond . MLLE . ROLANDE She is the greatest woman in France . MLLE . DE FLEURY in astonished contradiction.In France , Mathilde ? Why , in the whole , whole world . MLLE . DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MLLE . DE FLEURY to silence her forever.No ? Have you ever read She lowers her voice . " Lelia " ? MLLE . DE LATOUR No . MLLE . ROLANDE Mamma forbids me to read any books of hers . Again the religious intonation. p. 114 MLLE . DE FLEURY So does mine but my maid bought " Lelia " for me . I sat up all night reading it and I wept and wept and wept . I never enjoyed myself so much . MLLE . DE LATOUR Because you wept ? MLLE . ROLANDE Of course . Elise , you are too funny . And the two girls laugh together . MLLE . DE LATOUR I shall ask her to write in my album . I brought it with me . MLLE . DE FLEURY springing to her feet as though shot.Elise , my dear , you would n't do that ! One can see that you went to school in the country . Why , I 'd rather cut off my little finger than even dare speak to her . MLLE . DE LATOUR I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackey pass through the room . MLLE . ROLANDE over at the door.Quick , my dears , quick , some one has arrived . MLLE . DE FLEURY We must n't miss anything . Who ? Who ? MLLE . DE LATOUR laconically.It ought n't take more than three pages of my diary . Some people pass into the conservatory and the three girls flutter after them . And then the door is opened by a lackey and BULOZ enters . He is somewhat nervous . With him is PAGELLO and at their heels is HEINE. p. 115 BULOZ to PAGELLO , pointing to the little room on the left. You can wait in there , Doctor , if you wish to . PAGELLO But I do not understand . What has happened ? I was to meet Mme. Sand and she was to present me to the Baron . BULOZ I do n't think she has arrived yet . The moment she comes I will send for you . You will excuse me  --  I should say us . I have something important to say to Heine . PAGELLO Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , literary business . It 's terrible being the editor of a magazine . You will find some charming books on the table in there . HEINE Nothing medical , Doctor , I 'm afraid , but perhaps something of Mme. Sand 's . And BULOZ almost pushes PAGELLO out of the room and quickly closes the door behind him . Then he turns very excitedly to HEINE . BULOZ But , good God , what are we to do ? HEINE Do n't talk so quickly . Give me a moment to think . BULOZ In a moment that girl will be up . Nothing will stop her . I asked her to wait . I told her I 'd bring Pagello down . George will be here any second . She 's dining with Liszt . He 's bringing her here . p. 116 HEINE We 've a moment then . That means they 'll talk late . BULOZ Yes  --  HEINE How did you prevent Pagello seeing this Italian ? BULOZ Whilst he was leaving his cloak I managed to get her into the picture gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . As soon as she asked for him I knew something was wrong . HEINE Who is she ? BULOZ His mistress . She had a letter with her . Some enemy of George has sent the girl money to come from Venice . HEINE Our enemies are the price we pay for fame . BULOZ What shall we do ? HEINE is silent for a moment in thought and then.It would be best to wait until tomorrow . BULOZ By tomorrow they may be gone . HEINE She will be able to bear it better when he is no longer in Paris . BULOZ It will break her heart if she is separated from him . HEINE I wonder  --  BULOZ She has never loved like this before . There is something mysterious , something hidden about it . p. 117 HEINE The hidden is not always the mysterious . But when you say hidden perhaps you are right . BULOZ It 's not as it was with de Musset . It 's deeper , more profound . HEINE How do you know that ? BULOZ Because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her heart . HEINE slowly.Perhaps she 's reading it and has n't time to write . BULOZ thinking it out.If we do n't tell her the girl has come she 'll never forgive us for not warning her and if we do it may kill her . HEINE Think of the Revue . Do n't tell her . BULOZ I must . HEINE Why ? BULOZ Because she 's the one woman in Paris who would know how to find a way to prevent it . What shall we do ? HEINE First find our chessman , if we 're to play the game . I 'll see if George is in the music room . Keep Pagello in there until I warn you . Then we must get him home . And as he goes into the music room and BULOZ in to guard PAGELLO some guests cross the stage on their way to the conservatory . As they enter the chatter of voices is heard and a moment later a lackey opens the door and FRANZ LISZT comes in , and with him is GEORGE . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little unusual , the conventional might even say a bit bizarre , but nevertheless she looks extraordinarily handsome and though her soul is sad she has made the most of the beautiful shoulders which HEINE so much admired . LISZT is thin , pale , distinguished , aesthetic , but not of the exquisite fragility of CHOPIN , who is also on his way to the reception . He is a queer mixture of impetuosity and method . A surprising streak of practicality governs his pyrotechnic nature . GEORGE 'S manner is fraught with melancholy and deep intentions. p. 118 FRANZ LISZT These Parisian dinners , George  --  GEORGE SAND I 'm telling you this , Franz , because you know the human heart . FRANZ LISZT If I do it is because I do not try to . But why have n't you told Buloz ? GEORGE SAND Because he would n't understand . FRANZ LISZT And Heine ? GEORGE SAND Because he would understand too well . It 's you I may need as I did this morning . He has come . He would n't stay at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAND Poor boy , he never wants to leave me . He 's afraid of being alone . He 's insensible . FRANZ LISZT Quite ! Quite ! GEORGE SAND Weeks ago it was over and he still stays on . FRANZ LISZT Seeking the oasis in the desert of your heart . GEORGE SAND I can still respect his simplicity , but I can no longer love his navet . FRANZ LISZT He needed his background of lagoons . GEORGE SAND sadly , reminiscently.Perhaps , perhaps . p. 119 FRANZ LISZT Alas , " Lelia "  --  how circumstances alter love . GEORGE SAND Can you expect me to be untrue to my soul ? FRANZ LISZT subtly.If you mean by that your instincts  --  no , never ! GEORGE SAND I was blind . What I thought was his purity I have found to be his emptiness . FRANZ LISZT Lelia , I too have learned from life that nothing is so unlovely as the thing one used to love . Some day I shall write , shall I call it a symphonic poem with that idea for theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Disillusion in the violins struggling against love in the wood-winds . Write the program for me , Lelia . GEORGE SAND disregarding the digression.He has cost me dearly . FRANZ LISZT Yes , spending emotion leaves one poor . GEORGE SAND I have ceased to love him and With a tone like a funeral knell. ceasing to love him I have ceased to love forever . FRANZ LISZT When one says forever one is apt to forget tomorrow . Something must be done . He ca n't spend the rest of his life going from hospital to hospital studying these diseases . It is n't healthy . p. 120 GEORGE SAND No , you are right . FRANZ LISZT Heine has n't decided which is dearer to Pagello , you or these gall-stones . GEORGE SAND Do not speak unkindly of him , Franz . FRANZ LISZT Why , all you had to do was to look at his perfect profile to realize his limitations . GEORGE SAND That is the way a man reasons . A woman only feels and knows she is right . FRANZ LISZT And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school . FRANZ LISZT Paris has soon wearied of this moony medico . GEORGE SAND He was once dear to me . And then almost tenderly . He still imagines that he loves me . FRANZ LISZT Poor Pagello ! Why , any man knows that love is over the day the woman begins telling herself that it will last forever . GEORGE SAND very melancholy , thinking perhaps more of herself than PAGELLO.Yes , yes . FRANZ LISZT And when will this be over ? GEORGE SAND quite simply.If things happen as I plan , tonight . p. 121 FRANZ LISZT And how ? GEORGE SAND as though she might be saying " good morning " . I am sending him back to Venice . And LISZT looks up barely concealing his astonishment . FRANZ LISZT What ? GEORGE SAND in explanation.It breaks my heart to see the poor boy suffer . FRANZ LISZT with a smile.So , so ,  --  and that is why you 're out of mourning . GEORGE SAND in the dark.Mourning ? FRANZ LISZT Yes , this is the first time since Italy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage this with Pietro ? GEORGE SAND He will leave tonight for Lyons . FRANZ LISZT smiling ever so little.Poor Pagello ! Poor poodle ! He entered Paris a triumphant captive of love and now he goes back alone . GEORGE SAND No , not alone . A month ago a letter arrived from Castelfranco and with that letter my salvation . FRANZ LISZT Salvation by post ? p. 122 GEORGE SAND oblivious.Yes , yes . FRANZ LISZT Why not , salvation is such a little thing . Just what one wants at the moment . GEORGE SAND continuing.Suddenly everything was clear to me . I got money from Buloz on my new book . Pagello is the hero . And then quite unconscious of the subtle truth she is speaking . The book is almost finished . FRANZ LISZT So is Pagello . GEORGE SAND Of this money I sent her enough to come to Paris . FRANZ LISZT Ah ! His mother ? GEORGE SAND No ! No ! I am done with fathers and with mothers . FRANZ LISZT If not his mother , then  --  He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . His mistress . The letter came as from any anonymous sympathetic friend of Pietro 's here in Paris . FRANZ LISZT in admiration.So ? GEORGE SAND Ah , I can tell you , Franz , that friend did not spare George Sand . FRANZ LISZT Then his mistress is the woman I met at the coach this morning ? p. 123 GEORGE SAND Yes , she will follow him here . FRANZ LISZT Here ? GEORGE SAND I came tonight because my soul needed the consolation of the music . As I tell you , he would not stay at home ; but I left word where he was going . FRANZ LISZT Swift as my technic , Lelia . You act as quickly as I play my scales . And he runs his fingers through the air . GEORGE SAND If I know her , and I think I do , she will come tonight and fetch him . I can not stand the strain a moment longer . It must end at once . I am saving him , Franz . His sadness breaks my heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the shears . And he makes a snapping little movement as though cutting the thread in two . Then suddenly . Ah ! That would make a splendid finger exercise . And he begins trying it over and over . Do you know that Chopin is going to play tonight ? GEORGE SAND looking up.Why has he refused to meet me ? FRANZ LISZT Because being an artist he has little time for art . Besides I do n't think he likes you . He 's very shy . GEORGE SAND as though trying to explain it to herself.There is something in his music as of desire , chained . p. 124 FRANZ LISZT He is the greatest artist in the world , save one . GEORGE SAND Thalberg ? FRANZ LISZT angrily.No , no , one Liszt . Franz Liszt . If the women keep away long enough to allow him to practice the world will hear of him . GEORGE SAND And what of Chopin ? Do the women bother him ? These Poles are so romantic . FRANZ LISZT Poor Frederick , he has just recovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was a woman she has married some one else . It nearly broke his heart . GEORGE SAND deeply.Life is cruel and the most sensitive to beauty are those who suffer most . The other night at de Custines when he was playing it was as though a soul were singing  --  seeking . And at this moment the three girls appear in the doorway whispering together and trying not to seem too rudely interested in the celebrities . GEORGE SAND Ah , we are early , Franz . But it is just as well . I shall come back here and sit alone to listen to the music . Sorrow is but unwelcome company . And she sighs deeply as she glances at the three girls . Come , Franz , where is the Baron ? I must say good evening . p. 125 FRANZ LISZT They are receiving in the conservatory . GEORGE SAND Come . And she goes into the conservatory , followed by LISZT . MLLE . ROLANDE That was she . MLLE . DE FLEURY breathless.Yes , yes ! MLLE . DE LATOUR Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chopin . MLLE . DE FLEURY No , my dear , I 'm sure it was de Musset . Chopin is taller . MLLE . ROLANDE Did you notice how she glanced at us ? Let us follow them . MLLE . DE FLEURY Do you think we ought ? MLLE . DE LATOUR Why not ? MLLE . ROLANDE We can stay at the other side of the room and seem not to be watching them . MLLE . DE FLEURY Is n't it all just wonderful ? Did you like her dress ? MLLE . ROLANDE That certainly was last year 's bodice . MLLE . DE LATOUR Let 's go after them . THE OTHER GIRLS Yes ! Yes ! And they follow GEORGE and LISZT into the conservatory as HEINE comes in from the music room . He goes over to the door of the little drawing-room and calls BULOZ. p. 126 BULOZ entering.Well ? HEINE She 's come . They are in the conservatory . Only a few are ahead of them . They 'll be back in a second . BULOZ They must n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that woman takes Pagello away from her . She must n't break down for my sake . HEINE Your sake ? BULOZ She 's promised me three chapters before morning . We go to press at ten . Did you see how that Italian woman looked ? HEINE Silent as a pool before the storm . BULOZ If it were the old George she 'd meet her match . HEINE George is unmatchable . BULOZ at his wit 's end.Well , what will come of it ? And indeed at this moment there is a sound of voices from the hall . BULOZ Chopin has arrived . Hear them buzz . HEINE mischievously , with a sort of impish prophecy.The toy box is too crowded . Some of the dolls will be broken . Pagello  --  George  --  this girl  --  and Chopin come in the nick of time , perhaps , to play an obligato to their parting . He begins laughing quietly to himself . The gods are busy at the strings . Come , Buloz , let us dance , dance ! And at this moment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackey and from the conservatory opposite comes GEORGE followed by LISZT . And as they come forward GEORGE and FREDERICK stop and look at each other even as Tristan and Isolde and as all other mortals who are doomed to love have looked since the beginning of time when Adam  --  or was it Eve  --  looked and thus began the trouble. p. 127 FRANZ LISZT rushing forward to CHOPIN.Frederick ! And CHOPIN speaks . He is fragile , exquisite , spiritual . There is something about him as of flame and sleep . He is simple and profound , childlike and dominant , his whims are emotional necessities . He is part reticent reserve and part sudden irritability . Withal he is a genius who in the words of Balzac was less a musician than a soul which makes itself audible . FREDERICK CHOPIN Good evening , Franz . Ah , Heine ,  --  Buloz  --  HEINE with elaborate and fantastic ceremony.May it be my privilege to present the matchless composer of the B Minor Scherzo to the peerless creator of the immortal Lelia . And GEORGE gives CHOPIN her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . FREDERICK CHOPIN kissing her fingers.Madame . GEORGE SAND as their eyes meet as he straightens up.You have suffered , that is why you can sing . You must come some time with Franz to see me . FREDERICK CHOPIN Madame . He again bows and she turns to HEINE. p. 128 FRANZ LISZT to CHOPIN.Shall I present you to the Baron ? HEINE I can hear Olympus rumbling with almighty laughter . And as LISZT and CHOPIN cross to the right of the stage HEINE and GEORGE cross to the left . FRANZ LISZT low to CHOPIN.What do you think of her ? FREDERICK CHOPIN low to LISZT.Her eyes are too large but she is less impossible than I thought . HEINE low to GEORGE.What do you think of him ? GEORGE SAND low to HEINE.His chin is weak but he is more of a man than I had imagined . And at this moment the three girls appear , still hunting the celebrities , and as CHOPIN and LISZT go in to the conservatory LISZT stops to chat with them and then he and the adoring girls exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this party bearable . The Baron is a charming gentleman , but his guests are too wealthy to be anything but stupid . BULOZ aside to HEINE.What shall I do ? p. 129 HEINE Tell her now . BULOZ coming forward  --  nervously.Good evening , George . GEORGE SAND Ah , Buloz . Now I know what you 're going to say . BULOZ starts . HEINE Not this time , George . GEORGE SAND Heine , please do n't begin quoting Faust in that horrid guttural German , and you , Buloz , do n't jump at my throat and shriek for those last two chapters . You shall have them by tomorrow . HEINE trying to lead up.Perhaps you may n't write tonight , George . GEORGE SAND Nothing but death can stop me . BULOZ desperately.Why should we beat about the bush ? GEORGE SAND lightly.Why not ? That 's one way of stirring the birds to sing . HEINE To sing ? First they may fly away . GEORGE SAND Questing the eternal fires of the dawn . Ah , that 's a fine phrase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging at her waist and jots down the words on one of the panels of her fan. p. 130 BULOZ guardedly , darkly , attempting to begin.George , I believe in you . GEORGE SAND lightly.Of course you do . Do n't you print me ? BULOZ lugubriously.George  --  GEORGE SAND You sound as if you were reciting Corneille . He hesitates and looks across the room for help from HEINE , but HEINE is deep in a book he has lifted from the table . BULOZ clearing his throat and attempting to go on.You are strong , you can control  --  Embarrassed , he stops short . GEORGE SAND Are you writing my obituary ? BULOZ Be brave . Remember you have children . And GEORGE springs up and for a second goes white and leans half fainting against her chair . GEORGE SAND My God ! My children ! Maurice , Solange . Have they fever ? Are they dead ? BULOZ No , George , it is not your children , but  --  And the next second the light breaks in GEORGE 'S face and she can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while HEINE stands scrutinizing her. p. 131 GEORGE SAND What is it ? Tell me . Tell me . BULOZ speaking very slowly . He is doing his stumbling best to keep from hurting her too suddenly.Remember , France , the world , has need of you . GEORGE SAND Is it all preface ? Begin  --  Begin . BULOZ he stops and wipes his monocle.Well  --  GEORGE SAND Yes . BULOZ carefully , with deep pity for her , watching the effect.Pagello 's mistress has come from Italy . And to his amazement she takes the news quite calmly . Indeed in a way that puzzles him . But HEINE 'S eyes never leave her face . GEORGE SAND Lucrezia ? BULOZ She is waiting in the hall for him . GEORGE SAND solemnly , as though she felt HEINE 'S eyes.It is the hand of heaven . Fate does n't mean that I should keep him from her any longer . And a sound of voices is heard beyond in the hall  --  A lackeys and a woman 's voice in remonstrance and the door is thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , I tell you . I will wait no longer . Then she sees GEORGE . You ! You ! Where are your breeches ? BULOZ Not so loud , Madame . The greatest pianist in the world is about to improvise in the music room . HEINE Whilst fate is improvising here . And then almost inaudibly . Fate  --  or George . VIOLENTE threateningly to GEORGE.Once before you drove him dumb with your words . This time I shall speak . GEORGE SAND quite unflustered.Yes , apparently , apparently . And how is Venice ? Do tame nightingales still sing on every balcony and are there still fresh oysters on every doorstep ? VIOLENTE pointing to the letter in her hand. I know all , all . HEINE Rivalling the Omnipotent . Does she mean George or God ? VIOLENTE Madonna , what have you done to him ? GEORGE SAND What have I done to him ? Perhaps the greatest thing any woman can do for any man . I have given him his soul . VIOLENTE It is all written here . And she waves her letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the lies your heart hides and has told me all . Caro mio Pietro . And to stifle back her tears her voice goes louder . Pietro ! And the door of the little drawing-room opens and PAGELLO enters , an open book in his hand. p. 133 PAGELLO on the threshold , not seeing LUCREZIA.Did some one call me ? HEINE Yes , Doctor , a voice from beyond the Alps . PAGELLO I do not understand this poetical way you have of saying things . Ah , George , good evening . GEORGE SAND a bit mournfully but nevertheless leading in the right direction . " Good evening " ?  --  No , my friend , not good evening but alas , good-bye . PAGELLO as usual a bit mystified.What ? GEORGE SAND unable to resist the cadence.Goodbye  --  forever . And in a second all is clear because as he looks up for an explanation he sees LUCREZIA and he stumbles back against the sofa and the book falls from his hand . PAGELLO San Giovanni ,  --  San Pietro ,  --  San Paolo ,  --  San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the Italian calendar . BULOZ his eyes on GEORGE.Will she be strong enough to bear it ? PAGELLO Santa Maria , you  --  you  --  Where have you come from ? p. 134 GEORGE SAND From Italy , Pietro , moonlit Italy . And in the next room CHOPIN can be heard improvising . GEORGE SAND Ah , Madame , life has taught me much . I have wronged you , wronged you deeply . VIOLENTE to PAGELLO.Come away , she is beginning to talk . PAGELLO hardly recovered from the shock.How did you get here , Lucrezia ? VIOLENTE You have a friend in Paris , Pietroninni . One who hates this George Sand . And she again points to the letter . GEORGE SAND Madame , alas , there are many such . The rich because I would enrich the poor , the wise because I pity fools . BULOZ aside to HEINE.She is magnificent . HEINE Yes , perhaps more so than you think . GEORGE SAND In Venice , Madame , I wronged you . In Paris I ask your pardon . She steps toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner . Ah , Madame , do not shrink from me . Love has taught me humility . Though it breaks my heart I give him back to you . p. 135 VIOLENTE shrieking.You do not give him . He comes . He comes . And at this moment LISZT 'S head pops in at the door . FRANZ LISZT Shhh ! my dears ! If you are playing charades be a little quieter . You 're disturbing the music Chopin is improvising . And then he lowers his voice to a whisper and hushes them with his lifted finger . Piano ! Piano ! Then he sees LUCREZIA and begins thoughtlessly to bubble over . Ah  --  so , George ,  --  she  --  you  --  But GEORGE is ready and suddenly she turns to him and speaks as though nothing but the answer to her question mattered . GEORGE SAND Is n't that Thalberg playing ? It 's like his touch . FRANZ LISZT swiftly , almost angrily.No , no . Chopin . Only Chopin can play like that . Listen , ah , that phrasing  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAND And can you modulate so beautifully , my friend ? And the message has registered not unseen by HEINE . FRANZ LISZT his whole manner changing , looking at LUCREZIA.What a beautiful girl ! Is she an artist come to dance the Tarantula ? p. 136 HEINE No , she is an avenging fury whose wings are clipped . GEORGE SAND peering through him.That is very cryptic , Heine . HEINE smiling back.Perhaps , George , but not too deep for you to read . There is a pause . CHOPIN has reached a brilliant passage and instinctively they all stop to listen . FRANZ LISZT Ah ! Beauty made audible . Singing starlight . VIOLENTE in utter disgust.Monkey ! FRANZ LISZT Ah ! His hand lifted in ecstatic admiration . The moment 's inspiration  --  GEORGE SAND as the music swells and dies.The heritage of all the years . And LISZT , softly closing the door behind him , goes back into the music room . VIOLENTE to PAGELLO.Come away , Pietro , these people are all crazy . They rattle in their heads . PAGELLO at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAND Go , Pietro , I shall be brave . My blessings follow you , my friend . Life must be answered  --  youth be heard . She is Sarah come from the South to call you . I am as Hagar cast without . But in the wilderness I shall find my peace . My little Ishmaels are calling me. p. 137 HEINE She 's a little mixed , but what difference does it make  --  they 're Italians . GEORGE SAND Under the trees at Nohant I shall find forgetfulness and rest . Do not forget me , Pietro . And she bends over to kiss him a last farewell . VIOLENTE in a corner , her hands twitching.Madonna mia . She 's a witch . GEORGE SAND No , no , Pietro . Thru habit and not knowing what to do he is about to kiss her on the lips . No , no , not on the lips  --  the brow , my friend , the brow , as you would kiss a sister . And thus nobly and sadly they embrace . Good-bye , my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm thru his and they are moving towards the door . PAGELLO suddenly stopping.But  --  And instinctively his hand goes to his pocket . I  --  I And at a loss just how to put it.  --  I am but a poor practitioner . GEORGE SAND thoughtfully.Pietro , it seems to me I 've heard you say that same thing once before . There is an embarrassed pause but in an instant she is ready. p. 138 GEORGE SAND Of course , of course . Buloz , advance me a thousand francs . They may need it . You shall have two books for it instead of one . The writing will help me to forget . Go with them , remember they are strangers in this whirling world of Paris . HEINE with significance.Strange as two babies at a ball . And as PAGELLO comes over tenderly to shake her hand in gratitude , LUCREZIA keeps hold of his other hand with a sort of instinctive feeling that he wo n't be safe until out of sight of GEORGE . HEINE aside to BULOZ.Michael Angelo alone could do justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see these two children on their way . You remember the coach for Lyons leaves the Post Hotel at nine . And she is over at the door with PAGELLO and LUCREZIA . HEINE sotto voce to BULOZ as he moves towards them.It was on this very coach that she started with de Musset . BULOZ Well , what of it ? HEINE If this sort of thing goes on the people of the diligence should make her an allowance . GEORGE SAND Good-bye , my brother . And then even more beautifully . Good-bye , my newfound sister . And at this moment the CHOPIN improvisation is over and a burst of applause sounds from the next room. p. 139 GEORGE SAND unperturbed.Love will protect you . And she stretches out her hand to PIETRO and he bends over and kisses it . And she offers her hand to LUCREZIA but the girl refuses it and suddenly turns and faces her . VIOLENTE all the passion in her spilling over.Corpo di Cristo , I will not take your hand . I am an Italian and I do not forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stolen I have taken back . Maladetta ! What you have taught him I shall profit by . And half dragging , half embracing her recaptured Doctor , they are gone and BULOZ with them . GEORGE for a moment stands looking after them , a sad little smile in her eyes . Then she turns to HEINE . GEORGE SAND Ah , Heine , youth is the one thing worth having longest . She is glorious . Mark my words , my friend , the world shall yet be saved by women . HEINE Then as their first priestess let me tender you my homage . And he gallantly kisses her hand . If you ever cease writing , George , go on the stage . Melpomene herself could not have played it better . GEORGE SAND Yes  --  I wrote that letter , Heine . HEINE Ah , my prophetic soul . p. 140 GEORGE SAND Poor Pietro could never have managed it alone . HEINE seriously.George , I have ever loved you . GEORGE SAND lightly.Too late , too late , my German . My soul is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you means the more . Tell them to carve upon your tombstone : " Here lies George the indefatigable . " GEORGE SAND That does n't interest me . I wo n't be there to read it . HEINE You 'll probably outlive us all . GEORGE SAND No , Heine , you are wrong . And then as irrefutable proof . I 've just had my old mattresses recovered and I regret it . It was n't worth while for the little time I still contemplate living . I am going to an island in the Mediterranean to die . Wait and see , time will tell . HEINE Time tells nothing . Leave it to your biographers . GEORGE SAND though a minute ago life was over.What ! Never ! I 'll forestall their lies and some day , like Rousseau , I 'll confess in twenty volumes . Then sadly . My heart is a graveyard . p. 141 HEINE Do n't you mean a cemetery , George ? And at this moment a lackey opens the door from the hall and ALFRED DE MUSSET enters , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting since Italy . MME . DE MUSSET stepping forward and cordially taking GEORGE 'S hand.Alfred has told me all . And GEORGE is as near hysterical surprise as she has ever come in her life . MME . DE MUSSET A mother 's thanks for all that you have done for him . Yes , I know how patiently you nursed him thru his sunstroke and sat at his bedside bathing his brow and giving him his milk . GEORGE SAND equal even to this. I promised you that I would care for him . MME . DE MUSSET And you have , you have . A mother 's gratitude goes out to you . And in her enthusiasm she bends over and kisses GEORGE , and HEINE , who has been watching ALFRED  --  who stands like a monument trying to solve a riddle  --  comes to the rescue . HEINE bowing to MME . DE MUSSET.May I have the honor of escorting you to the Baron ? MME . DE MUSSET taking his arm.We are very late . Again the piano sounds from the music room. p. 142 GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Chopin . Liszt is to play later in the evening . MME . DE MUSSET Are you coming in , Madame ? GEORGE SAND No , I shall sit here alone to listen . I am not well , Madame . I do not like the crowd . MME . DE MUSSET as she reaches the door. I shall see you later then , at supper ? HEINE At supper ,  --  of course . GEORGE SAND If I stay , but alas , Madame , I am so spent . And she heaves a deep sigh . I do not know what will happen to me . As indeed she does n't . And GEORGE and ALFRED are left alone . GEORGE SAND sadly.That was kind of Heine . I wanted to see you , Alfred , once before I left Paris . I 'm very tired . ALFRED You 're overworking . You should break with Buloz . He expects too much of you . GEORGE SAND No , it is n't that . And then slowly . I have just sent Pietro back to Venice . ALFRED as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . It is the end ,  --  the end . ALFRED Go down to the country , you will rest there out in the open . It is quiet under the trees . GEORGE SAND wearily.It is a quiet deeper than the silence of Nohant that I seek . ALFRED You mean  --  GEORGE SAND Yes , my friend . I welcome it as a long rest after a too long journey . I can no longer live with dignity . ALFRED You 've been like this before . Why , by tomorrow  --  GEORGE SAND No . No . That was long ago . A nocturne of exquisite melancholy sounds from the music room . Tomorrow bears but the same sad burden as today . I shall miss only the sound of my children 's voices . Solange is so sweet  --  you should see her , Alfred . I can hardly keep from weeping when I kiss her . I shall miss my children and the feel of the wind in my face . I adore the wind . It is the symbol of perpetual energy . ALFRED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE SAND sadly . It is her tragic moment.And such is love . We are like leaves tossed in the wind of desire . Do you remember that night in Venice in the window ? I laughed at you and your fear of fate . But you were right , Alfred . Destiny has piped and I have danced  --  and now I 'm tired . p. 144 ALFRED And love ? GEORGE SAND and from her heart comes a cry of bitterness.Love , alas , I have called to love and it has answered me with lies . I am done with that delusion . It is nature 's trick to make us fools . It is empty , empty . You remember you gave me a message at parting in Venice . Now I shall give you one . And she holds out her hand to him . Store up the gold of life in youth , my friend , whilst you can still believe this lie that men call love . ALFRED bending over her hand and kissing it.Good-bye . And he goes into the conservatory and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the fireplace she sees the book that PIETRO has dropped and she picks it up . GEORGE SAND perhaps she is weeping a little . She reads the title . " Lelia . " Faithful to the last . Finis . Finis . And she glances toward the little room through which PAGELLO and LUCREZIA have gone . Adieu , Pagello ! And she lets the little book fall to the table and then she looks toward the conservatory through which DE MUSSET has gone . Adieu , Freddo . And then she looks into the fire as though bidding a last farewell . Adieu , love ! And she sits gazing for a moment into the flame . A pause . And a little later a tremendous burst of applause sounds from the music room . The nocturne is finished . Another sound of voices , then more applause and then CHOPIN bursts in from the music room followed by LISZT ; and the three young girls all aflutter are crowded in the doorway . From her deep seat next the fireplace GEORGE is almost invisible. p. 145 FREDERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tired . FRANZ LISZT The humming fools . Give them the B Minor Scherzo , Frederick . FREDERICK CHOPIN No , no . No more . No more . MLLE . ROLANDE and MLLE . DE FLEURY . Ah ! Ah ! MLLE . DE LATOUR He 's probably tired . Look how white he is . MLLE . DE FLEURY Have you ever heard anything so divine ? MLLE . ROLANDE Positively beguiling , my dear . I  --  FREDERICK CHOPIN low to LISZT.Get them away . Get them away . FRANZ LISZT with exaggerated politeness.Ladies , your pardon . And he slowly closes the door . And the three demoiselles sink back into the music room . FREDERICK CHOPIN It distresses me to play before a crowd like that . FRANZ LISZT Do you know that in the middle of your most beautiful pianissimi one of those fat hyenas sneezed ? FREDERICK CHOPIN I did n't notice it . FRANZ LISZT amazed.What , why I hear everything when I perform . p. 146 FREDERICK CHOPIN I like best playing for my beloved Poles . They are breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Then MLLE . DE FLEURY and MLLE . ROLANDE are back . MLLE . DE FLEURY to CHOPIN.Monsieur , the people are clamoring for you . FREDERICK CHOPIN Ladies , you must excuse me . MLLE . ROLANDE But we beseech you . FREDERICK CHOPIN You must pardon me . I am sorry to refuse . And as he turns away he unknowingly drops his handkerchief . The applause sounds again . Franz , for God 's sake go in and appease them . I want to be alone . Alone . And the two girls flutter up to LISZT with exclamations of admiration . And as CHOPIN turns from them barely concealing his irritation , MLLE . DE FLEURY swiftly lifts his handkerchief from the floor and with a look as though she were robbing a shrine of the sacred " bambino , " she stuffs the precious relic into her bodice and GEORGE who is watching smiles . This is unseen by all the others . MLLE . ROLANDE and LISZT are at the door . Then MLLE . DE FLEURY joins them , and as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approval . The door is closed and then CHOPIN begins walking up and down . He is warm . He wants to mop his brow . He is nervous . He looks at a picture . Then again for his handkerchief . It is gone . This increases his irritation . He sits down , still feeling in his pockets ; and then  --  and it sounds as if it came from nowheres  --  GEORGE speaks . And as she does so CHOPIN jumps up not knowing from whence it came. p. 147 GEORGE SAND Here , take mine . And she hands him her handkerchief . FREDERICK CHOPIN taking it.Ah , you . Thank you , Madame . GEORGE SAND Sit down , you must be very tired . Sit down and rest . FREDERICK CHOPIN Yes . Yes . GEORGE SAND I ca n't imagine anything more frightful than having to face a room of people like that . It must be so much more wonderful to play for two or three . FREDERICK CHOPIN I like best to play for only one . That is when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHOPIN I always choose some one to whom I play . Tonight there was no one in there who interested me . GEORGE SAND Your art is the most fragile of all the arts . It is born of the moment and as it lives it dies . FREDERICK CHOPIN Yes . Yes . He begins walking about again . GEORGE SAND Oh , do n't be alarmed , I 'm not going to talk music . Would you like some champagne ? Shall I call a lackey ? FREDERICK CHOPIN No . Let us sit quietly for a while . And they do so , listening to the music. p. 148 FREDERICK CHOPIN after a moment.That is a beautiful melody but in a second he will spoil it with his fireworks . GEORGE does n't answer . Then after a little while he goes on . FREDERICK CHOPIN I have never read any of your books . GEORGE SAND unconcerned.No ? FREDERICK CHOPIN No . Listen ! Music should have more soul and less speed . A pause . You do not answer me . Another pause . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to be still . GEORGE SAND smiling.I am listening to you . FREDERICK CHOPIN Some day I will come and play for you . GEORGE SAND unmoved.Yes ? FREDERICK CHOPIN a bit piqued at her lack of enthusiasm.I do not do that often . GEORGE SAND No , I am sure of that . There is another pause . Then GEORGE speaks . Something stirs in the ashes of her heart . GEORGE SAND Why have you avoided me since you 've been in Paris ? p. 149 FREDERICK CHOPIN I was afraid of you . GEORGE SAND Afraid ? If that is a compliment it is too roundabout . FREDERICK CHOPIN From a distance you seemed , shall I say  --  He hesitates for a word . GEORGE SAND lightly.Formidable . FREDERICK CHOPIN No  --  er  --  Then he gets it. complicated . GEORGE SAND You have chosen badly . I am really very simple . Then with a shake of her head because she really means it . Too simple for my good . And he looks at her and she turns away and gazes into the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marquis de Custine 's last Saturday ? GEORGE SAND almost carelessly.Yes . FREDERICK CHOPIN I did n't meet you . GEORGE SAND No , I left early . FREDERICK CHOPIN But women always want to meet me . GEORGE SAND You 're very shy . FREDERICK CHOPIN I thought I saw you looking at me when I was playing . p. 150 GEORGE SAND And so beautifully  --  FREDERICK CHOPIN I was dreaming of some one long ago . GEORGE SAND Yes . FREDERICK CHOPIN Why did you leave so early ? GEORGE SAND I went home to work . FREDERICK CHOPIN At night ? GEORGE SAND Yes . Till four in the morning . FREDERICK CHOPIN My art too is exacting . Sometimes I practice ten hours a day . GEORGE SAND as she glances at him , she is thinking of her writing but , alas , how often people mean one thing and say another.I have been practicing all my life . FREDERICK CHOPIN One of these days I must read something you 've written . GEORGE SAND Why ? FREDERICK CHOPIN I do not read much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is life that really matters . A note of sadness comes into her voice . Life ! FREDERICK CHOPIN You are sad , Madame ? GEORGE SAND Alas , my friend , I have suffered . She looks at him tenderly , then back into the flames. p. 151 FREDERICK CHOPIN slowly . It is to very few he would say this , but she is different.I understand , Madame . I too have lived . GEORGE SAND expectantly.Yes ? A pause . She waits for him to go on but he is silent . GEORGE SAND Some day , perhaps , you will care to tell me ? FREDERICK CHOPIN perhaps he is a little embarrassed.Listen ! Liszt is playing the " Liebestraum . " Less than Beethoven  --  but ' twill serve . Listen ! GEORGE SAND Yes . You are right . I too can not abide these people who are an olian harp thru which their grief is forever moaning . She is in danger . She is beginning to forget herself . She glances at him . He is listening to the music . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hand is on his . FREDERICK CHOPIN Since my boyhood . I do not know why I tell you this . GEORGE SAND very tenderly.That is the only love that matters . So you too have been lonely . FREDERICK CHOPIN I 've been alone for all my life . p. 152 GEORGE SAND That is the sad melody that runs through life . We are forever seeking companionship whilst in reality we are forever alone , alone . And her voice drifts away on the sweet sadness of the word . FREDERICK CHOPIN Yes . I must come and play for you . GEORGE SAND I shall listen with my soul . A little flame stirs in the ashes . Is it the spell of the music that moves her ? FREDERICK CHOPIN You are not like what I thought . GEORGE SAND No ? FREDERICK CHOPIN I imagined you were always talking philosophy . GEORGE SAND That 's what the world thinks of literary people . The truth is I seldom mention books . FREDERICK CHOPIN Franz told me that you were the cleverest woman in Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHOPIN There are days when I can not abide Paris and these crowds of brilliant people . He looks towards the music room . GEORGE SAND Yes , I know what you mean . I too have felt that . Why do n't you go away ? p. 153 FREDERICK CHOPIN I would but though I dislike people , I do n't like being all alone . It gives me a feeling of peace to know there is some one to whom I can go  --  some one who will understand . GEORGE SAND for the first time looking him straight in the eyes.Yes . That is the perfect companion . Some one you know is there and still never feel about you . I have tried many but all have failed , even Alfred . FREDERICK CHOPIN Does such a one exist ? GEORGE SAND In dreams perhaps . And she is languorously fanning herself whilst in the music room LISZT plays " The Lorelei . " FREDERICK CHOPIN What a delicious odor . GEORGE SAND " Lily of Japan . " Pagello bought it for me in the Palais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too strong for him . That 's why he 's run away to Venice . FREDERICK CHOPIN looking at her.With such a person far away  --  GEORGE SAND lightly but still with a faint sense of suggestion.In a blue isle in the Mediterranean shall we say ? I too have been dreaming of the South . p. 154 FREDERICK CHOPIN smiling back at her fantasy.Yes . Why not ? The Mediterranean  --  GEORGE SAND leaning back a little , her tongue wetting her lips , goes on with the delicious nonsense.Where the tropic palms droop in the odorous shadows and the scarlet flamingoes sleep in the sun . She likes this and begins jotting it down on her fan . FREDERICK CHOPIN What are you doing ? GEORGE SAND almost sprightly.I just thought of what I must order for luncheon tomorrow . And she repeats as she writes.  --  Scarlet flamingoes . FREDERICK CHOPIN Flamingoes for lunch ? GEORGE SAND Why not ? Perhaps you will come and dine with me . FREDERICK CHOPIN Perhaps . You are the one woman in Paris who does n't bore me . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . FREDERICK CHOPIN No . Do not think I am jesting . If for a while I could break away from all this cleverness . And again he waves his hand with a gesture of disgust towards the music room . There in this mythical island I could realize my dreams and give to the world all the music that struggles and mounts in my heart . p. 155 GEORGE SAND whimsically.And if you go I shall follow you and lie quietly listening among the ferns . He looks at her . She looks back . There is a pause . Then jestingly , laughingly . Or perhaps we might go together . FREDERICK CHOPIN slowly.Why not ? Why not ? GEORGE SAND her hand again touching his . Her voice low.Why not ? The light of the fire shines about them . Some day , perhaps . Half prophetically , half in subconscious hope . Some day . And CHOPIN sits looking at her and she leans back , her eyes slightly closed . FREDERICK CHOPIN I am so tired . GEORGE SAND leaning towards him.Shall I drive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her wanly , sweetly . GEORGE SAND Poor boy , you are very tired , are n't you ? A pause , she is closer to him . There is something about you so like my little son . FREDERICK CHOPIN Yes ? p. 156 GEORGE SAND And do you know what I should do if you were he ? FREDERICK CHOPIN No . GEORGE SAND This , my poor tired child  --  this . And like a mother  --  indeed love and the mother in her are mixed beyond comprehension  --  she takes him in her arms and kisses him and the next instant she awakes to the calamitous rashness of her deed . GEORGE SAND What have I done ? What have I done ? Can you ever forgive me ? FREDERICK CHOPIN bending towards her.Why not ? GEORGE SAND springing up as once before she has done in Venice.Now I realize it all . For weeks the ecstasy of your music has sustained my fainting spirit . All the while I have loved you , loved you as I have never loved before , loved when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't known . And now that I have told you , good-bye . She rushes from him . FREDERICK CHOPIN his voice low.Wait ! Wait ! You must n't leave me now , now at the beginning . GEORGE SAND struggling with her heart.No , no . I am done with love . I have prayed to love and it has come to hurt me . No , no . Not again , not again . I am through with love forever . p. 157 FREDERICK CHOPIN his arm is about her.This is the beginning . We have found each other in our loneliness . You have brought peace to my heart . His lips are close to hers . George ! George , nothing else matters . This is the beginning . And he kisses her . A pause . And then she breaks from him . There are tears in her eyes . For a moment she stands watching him , the old wonder ever new breaks in her heart . He comes over to her . His voice is very gentle . FREDERICK CHOPIN You know you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that she has forgotten and all that she hopes are in the words.You mean ? FREDERICK CHOPIN If you are willing  --  yes . And again they are in each other 's arms . Tableau ! From beyond sounds the music . She has lost her head . This is rash . Some one may come in . She breaks away from him . He follows her . GEORGE SAND she looks about her. No , no . This is not the Mediterranean . There are too many lackeys . She steps towards the door . FREDERICK CHOPIN But are n't you going to drive me home ? p. 158 GEORGE SAND And if I should tell the coachman to drive to this island in the sea ? FREDERICK CHOPIN I should follow you . There is too much art in Paris . Come . GEORGE SAND swiftly.A moment . A word to Buloz lest he wait for me . And impetuously she tears out the fly leaf from the copy of " Lelia " lying on the table and scrawls some words and then : GEORGE SAND Chopin , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHOPIN To the sound of music . Come . And they rush out as very cautiously from the music room enters MLLE . DE LATOUR with her autograph album in her hand followed by MLLE . ROLANDE . MLLE . DE LATOUR looking about.Why , I thought she was in here . MLLE . ROLANDE Probably they 're in the supper room . MLLE . DE LATOUR I 'm going to ask her . I may never see her again . I do n't care what Agnes says . And they run out through the little drawing-room to the applause which sounds from the music room as HEINE opens the door and comes in . HEINE calling.Frederick ! Where is he ? And BULOZ bustles in from the hall. p. 159 HEINE Where 's Chopin ? BULOZ Gone ! HEINE Gone ! The Baroness was hoping he would play again . Liszt seems tied to the piano . Nothing can budge him . BULOZ No . HEINE I 'll ask George to read a chapter of " Lelia " He takes the book from the table. ; that will quiet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . BULOZ I saw them leave together . HEINE Together ? He looks surprised . BULOZ Yes . Why not ? Ca n't a man and a woman drive from a party without the world coming to an end ? She left me this . He points to the note in his hand . It 's written on the half title of " Lelia . " HEINE Perhaps you can print it in the Revue . BULOZ with a quick look.Not yet . Read it , Heine . And HEINE does so and in his amazement he lets the note flutter to the floor . BULOZ And how long this time , Heine ? p. 160 HEINE How long ? How long ? Does it matter ? Think of the copy it will make and how the world will revel in it . And now  --  let 's go in to supper . And as they exit MLLE . DE FLEURY comes in from the music room on her way to join MLLE . DE LATOUR and MLLE . ROLANDE . Suddenly she sees the note which HEINE has let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLEURY with swimming eyes as she reads it . " Good-night , Buloz , do n't wait for me . Life is love . That 's all that matters . I 've taken Chopin home to put the poor , tired boy to bed . " And she clutches the note to her trembling heart . MLLE . DE FLEURY tenderly , lit with the thrilling romance of it all.How beautiful ! How beautiful ! And the curtain falls as LISZT , the untiring , thunders from the music room the beginning of a brilliant Polonaise.
