txt WASHINGTON , Feb. ** Hones Committeee on Foreign Affairs to-day voted unanimously to report favorably the Parsons joint resolution for the abrogation of the treaty of 1832 between the United States and Russia . This notion would be taken to register the protest of this Government against the attitude of the Russian Government toward American citizens of Jewish birth . The committee listened to a statement by Mr. Parsons of New York , who recited at some length the history of the Indignities that . have been visited upon American citizens who have desired to visit Russia , and have been barred from the country because of their birth . Mr. Goldfogle also spoke of the diffioultiea that beset men and women of culture and social position who may desire to travel in Russia and are uniformly met with a refusal to honor the passports- given by the United States Government . He emphasized especially the treatment of Oscar S. Straus , former Ambassador at Constantinople , who was considered for transfer to St. Petersburg as American Ambassador . Mr. Harrison of New York also addressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been placed on the American Jews who would naturally desire to see once more their kin and friends in the old country . Mr. Foster , Chairman of the committee , declared his conviction that this Government should abrogate the treaty and said that the time had come for decisive action . He appointed as a sub-committee to call on Mr. Knox , the Secretary of State , and get any data that he may wish to submit : Messr. of Illinois , Lowden , Garner , and Flood . This sub-committee will prepare a report on the resolution which will be laid before the whole committee , and it is promised that the report will be made to the House This week . Mr. Parsons reviewed the long dispute between Russia and the United States over the interpretation of the treaty under which Russia excludes Jews . Remonstrances had been sent by our State De , partment as far back as laei . Congress had many times voiced its remonstrance . " In 191/4 , " said Mr. Parsons , " we went further in the resolution passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introduced by my colleague from New . York Mr. Goldfogle . That requested the President to renew negotiations so , that we could have a treaty which would : eliminate all chances of any such din- ' crimination , and in 1909 this House , passed a resolution directing the Presi- : dent to renew negotiations so as to have these discriminations eliminated and abolished , and yet nothing has been accomplished . We have talked , we have passed resolutions , we have had **25;716;TOOLONG , and nothing has been accomiplished , so that if we mean what we have said ? " " Does the gentleman think , " asked Mr. Flood of Virginia , " that the President and the State Department are not carrying out the instructions of the resolution of ** " " I think they have endeavored to do so , " replied Mr. Parsons . " I know they have , but they have been unsuccessful , and I very much fear they will not be successful . " " What explanation or excuse , " asked Mr. Austin of Tennessee , " does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It claims that under this last clause of Article I. , ' that citizens of the other party shall have the right to travel and sojourn on a condition of their submitting to the law and ordinance there prevailing ' subjects the American Jews to the restrictions imposed on the Russian Jews by Russia . I think , however , Russia has now gone so far that she takes the position that she can pass any Internal law she wishes . " " Is it not a fact , " asked Mr. Bartlett of Georgia , " that v.-hen applying for passports to the State Department the department rather advises the American who applies for the passport not to go to Russia ? " " The department gives him his passport , but it tells him he will get no benefit from it , " replied Mr. Parsons . " If lie goes to the border of Russia he is turned back . Unless he can get his passport visad by some representative of Russia having authority in the matter he can not enter Russia . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport vlsed is , What is your religion ? If he says he is a Jew , then , for one reason or another , he does not get his passport visad. " - Is there any occasion where a native American had been refused admission to Russia ? " asked Mr. Hammond . " Yes ; if he is a Jew , it applies to all alike . " Mr. Parsons cited the policy of religions tolerance set forth in our Constitution , amid went on : " Whether by terminating this treaty we will soon get a new treaty which will in terms prevent Russia from discriminating , I know not , but I believe that we owe It to this fundamental principle of religious toleration , of the equality a all American citizens before the law , without regard to their religious belief , to terminate a treaty a part of which uses as authority for discriminating against some Americans the ground of their religious belief . The Russian Government also excludes missionaries , both Protestant and Catholic . I have a letter here signed by a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an address delivered upon this subject by Louis Marshall of New York , and in this letter the Bishop 's secretary writes : The Right Reverend Bishop wishes me to say that he is in hearty accord with the movement started by your committee . It was only a year and a half ago that he himself was prevented from entering Russia for only a two days ' visit . You may no doubt know that Catholic priests in general are prohibited from entering Russia . He wishes your movement every success . " This , therefore , is not simply a Jewish question . The Jews are not the only people who are discriminated against The clergy of all denominations are discriminated against . " I do not wish the committee to understand that I appeal for the termination of the treaty on the ground alone that it discriminates against some people on account of their religion . I make the appeal on the ground that it discriminates against some American citizens , and that each American citizen , no matter what his religion is , has as much right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to the protection of our treaties abroad as any other American citizen , and we should not enter into or any longer retain a treaty that does not secure to all American citizens equal treatment . - We have rid ourselves of many forms of persecution . We no longer burn witches . We no longer have slavery . But we do have , as one of the foulest blots upon our civilization , a prejudice against the Jews , virulent in some European : countries at all times , and particularly , so at other times . Fortunately , it has never expressed itself here in the form ! of persecution . On the contrary , whenever persecution has occurred in foreign countries we have protested and extended our sympathies to the unfortunate victims . " It is a well-known fact that Jews on coming to America invariably become patriotic citizens . Statistics show that in every war we have had the Jews have done more than their share in furnishing soldiers for the war . In every fight for good citizenship they have done their full share , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full share . Therefore , we , as the representatives of the , great Republic , have the duty imposed/ upon us of standing up against the preita dices that exist in other countries , and here is a case where , because of a die crimination that is made against Amert. can citizens , we should all the more insistL upon the abrogation of the treaty ; w , should insist that all American citizen ; mire equal before the law , and place our stamp of disapproval upon the anti-Se Tuttle feeling that exists in other coma tries . " Mr. Parsons was roundly applauded at the conclusion of his speech .
