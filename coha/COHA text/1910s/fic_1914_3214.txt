THE BOY SCOUT by RICHARD HARDING DAVIS Illustration : Jimmie dropped the valise , forced his cramped fingers into straight lines , and saluted . Page 10 New York Charles Scribner 's Sons 1914 Copyright , 1914 , by Charles Scribner 's Sons Published May , 1914 Illustration THE BOY SCOUT A rule of the Boy Scouts is every day to do some one a good turn . Not because the copy-books tell you it deserves another , but in spite of that pleasing possibility . If you are a true scout , until you have performed your act of kindness your day is dark . You are as unhappy as is the grown-up who has begun his day without shaving or reading the New York Sun . But as soon as you have proved yourself you may , with a clear conscience , look the world in the face and untie the knot in your kerchief . Jimmie Reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten minutes past eight on a hot August morning after he had given one dime to his sister Sadie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Palace , or by dividing her fortune patronize two of the nickel shows on Lenox Avenue . The choice Jimmie left to her . He was setting out for the annual encampment of the Boy Scouts at Hunter 's Island , and in the excitement of that adventure even the movies ceased to thrill . But Sadie also could be unselfish . With a heroism of a camp-fire maiden she made a gesture which might have been interpreted to mean she was returning the money . " I ca n't , Jimmie ! " she gasped . " I ca n't take it off you . You saved it , and you ought to get the fun of it . " " I have n't saved it yet , " said Jimmie . " I 'm going to cut it out of the railroad fare . I 'm going to get off at City Island instead of at Pelham Manor and walk the difference . That 's ten cents cheaper . " Sadie exclaimed with admiration : " An ' you carryin ' that heavy grip ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the family . " Good-by , mother . So long , Sadie . " To ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised Sadie to take in " The Curse of Cain " rather than " The Mohawks ' Last Stand , " and fled down the front steps . He wore his khaki uniform . On his shoulders was his knapsack , from his hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his " shorts " his kneecaps , unkissed by the sun , as yet unscathed by blackberry vines , showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl . As he moved toward the " L " station at the corner , Sadie and his mother waved to him ; in the street , boys too small to be scouts hailed him enviously ; even the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the news-stand nodded approval . " You a Scout , Jimmie ? " he asked . " No , " retorted Jimmie , for was not he also in uniform ? " I 'm Santa Claus out filling Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then get yourself a pair , " he advised . " If a dog was to see your legs --  --  " Jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the Elevated . * * * * * An hour later , with his valise in one hand and staff in the other , he was tramping up the Boston Post Road and breathing heavily . The day was cruelly hot . Before his eyes , over an interminable stretch of asphalt , the heat waves danced and flickered . Already the knapsack on his shoulders pressed upon him like an Old Man of the Sea ; the linen in the valise had turned to pig iron , his pipe-stem legs were wabbling , his eyes smarted with salt sweat , and the fingers supporting the valise belonged to some other boy , and were giving that boy much pain . But as the motor-cars flashed past with raucous warnings , or , that those who rode might better see the boy with bare knees , passed at " half speed , " Jimmie stiffened his shoulders and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you Scout ! " he smiled at them . He was willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who walked . And he regretted -- oh , so bitterly -- having left the train . He was indignant that for his " one good turn a day " he had not selected one less strenuous . That , for instance , he had not assisted a frightened old lady through the traffic . To refuse the dime she might have offered , as all true scouts refuse all tips , would have been easier than to earn it by walking five miles , with the sun at ninety-nine degrees , and carrying excess baggage . Twenty times James shifted the valise to the other hand , twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it . And then , as again he took up his burden , the Good Samaritan drew near . He drew near in a low gray racing-car at the rate of forty miles an hour , and within a hundred feet of Jimmie suddenly stopped and backed toward him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore a suit of blue , a golf cap ; the hands that held the wheel were disguised in large yellow gloves . He brought the car to a halt and surveyed the dripping figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes . " You a Boy Scout ? " he asked . With alacrity for the twenty-first time Jimmie dropped the valise , forced his cramped fingers into straight lines , and saluted . The young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him . " Get in , " he commanded . When James sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man , to Jimmie 's disappointment , did not continue to shatter the speed limit . Instead , he seemed inclined for conversation , and the car , growling indignantly , crawled . " I never saw a Boy Scout before , " announced the old young man . " Tell me about it . First , tell me what you do when you 're not scouting . " Jimmie explained volubly . When not in uniform he was an office-boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hastings , stockbrokers . He spoke the names of his employers with awe . It was a firm distinguished , conservative , and long-established . The white-haired young man seemed to nod in assent . " Do you know them ? " demanded Jimmie suspiciously . " Are you a customer of ours ? " " I know them , " said the young man . " They are customers of mine . " Jimmie wondered in what way Carroll and Hastings were customers of the white-haired young man . Judging him by his outer garments , Jimmie guessed he was a Fifth Avenue tailor ; he might be even a haberdasher . Jimmie continued . He lived , he explained , with his mother at One Hundred and Forty-sixth Street ; Sadie , his sister , attended the public school ; he helped support them both , and he now was about to enjoy a well-earned vacation camping out on Hunter 's Island , where he would cook his own meals and , if the mosquitoes permitted , sleep in a tent . " And you like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure ! " protested Jimmie . " Do n't you go camping out ? " " I go camping out , " said the Good Samaritan , " whenever I leave New York . " Jimmie had not for three years lived in Wall Street not to understand that the young man spoke in metaphor . " You do n't look , " objected the young man critically , " as though you were built for the strenuous life . " Jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees . " You ought ter see me two weeks from now , " he protested . " I get all sunburnt and hard -- hard as anything ! " The young man was incredulous . " You were near getting sunstroke when I picked you up , " he laughed . " If you 're going to Hunter 's Island why did n't you take the Third Avenue to Pelham Manor ? " " That 's right ! " assented Jimmie eagerly . " But I wanted to save the ten cents so 's to send Sadie to the movies . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I beg your pardon , " he murmured . But Jimmie did not hear him . From the back of the car he was dragging excitedly at the hated suitcase . " Stop ! " he commanded . " I got ter get out . I got ter walk . " The young man showed his surprise . " Walk ! " he exclaimed . " What is it -- a bet ? " Jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway . It took some time to explain to the young man . First , he had to be told about the scout law and the one good turn a day , and that it must involve some personal sacrifice . And , as Jimmie pointed out , changing from a slow suburban train to a racing-car could not be listed as a sacrifice . He had not earned the money , Jimmie argued ; he had only avoided paying it to the railroad . If he did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude of Sadie by a falsehood . Therefore , he must walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got it wrong . What good will it do your sister to have you sunstruck ? I think you are sunstruck . You 're crazy with the heat . You get in here , and we 'll talk it over as we go along . " Hastily Jimmie backed away . " I 'd rather walk , " he said . The young man shifted his legs irritably . " Then how 'll this suit you ? " he called . " We 'll declare that first ' one good turn ' a failure and start afresh . Do me a good turn . " Jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously . " I 'm going to Hunter 's Island Inn , " called the young man , " and I 've lost my way . You get in here and guide me . That 'll be doing me a good turn . " On either side of the road , blotting out the landscape , giant hands picked out in electric-light bulbs pointed the way to Hunter 's Island Inn . Jimmie grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called , " I got ter walk . " Turning his back upon temptation , he wabbled forward into the flickering heat waves . * * * * * The young man did not attempt to pursue . At the side of the road , under the shade of a giant elm , he had brought the car to a halt and with his arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless , following with frowning eyes the retreating figure of Jimmie . But the narrow-chested and knock-kneed boy staggering over the sun-baked asphalt no longer concerned him . It was not Jimmie , but the code preached by Jimmie , and not only preached but before his eyes put into practice , that interested him . The young man with white hair had been running away from temptation . At forty miles an hour he had been running away from the temptation to do a fellow mortal " a good turn . " That morning , to the appeal of a drowning Caesar to " Help me , Cassius , or I sink , " he had answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsider . That he might not reconsider he had sought to escape . It was his experience that a sixty-horsepower racing-machine is a jealous mistress . For retrospective , sentimental , or philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence . But he had not escaped . Jimmie had halted him , tripped him by the heels and set him again to thinking . Within the half-hour that followed those who rolled past saw at the side of the road a car with her engine running , and leaning upon the wheel , as unconscious of his surroundings as though he sat at his own fireplace , a young man who frowned and stared at nothing . The half-hour passed and the young man swung his car back toward the city . But at the first roadhouse that showed a blue-and-white telephone sign he left it , and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a nickel . He wished to communicate with Mr. Carroll , of Carroll and Hastings ; and when he learned Mr. Carroll had just issued orders that he must not be disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the barkeeper was instantaneous . With the aggrieved air of one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully . " What are you putting over ? " he demanded . The young man smiled reassuringly . He had begun to speak and , though apparently engaged with the beer-glass he was polishing , the barkeeper listened . Down in Wall Street the senior member of Carroll and Hastings also listened . He was alone in the most private of all his private offices , and when interrupted had been engaged in what , of all undertakings , is the most momentous . On the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer , to the coroner , to his wife ; and hidden by a mass of papers , but within reach of his hand , an automatic pistol . The promise it offered of swift release had made the writing of the letters simple , had given him a feeling of complete detachment , had released him , at least in thought , from all responsibilities . And when at his elbow the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him from a world from which already he had made his exit . Mechanically , through mere habit , he lifted the receiver . The voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences . " That letter I sent this morning ? Forget it . Tear it up . I 've been thinking and I 'm going to take a chance . I 've decided to back you boys , and I know you 'll make good . I 'm speaking from a roadhouse in the Bronx ; going straight from here to the bank . So you can begin to draw against us within an hour . And -- hello !  - -  will three millions see you through ? " From Wall Street there came no answer , but from the hands of the barkeeper a glass crashed to the floor . The young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes . " He does n't answer , " he exclaimed . " He must have hung up . " " He must have fainted ! " said the barkeeper . The white-haired one pushed a bill across the counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappeared down Pelham Parkway . Throughout the day , with the bill , for evidence , pasted against the mirror , the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale . " He stood just where you 're standing now , " he related , " blowing in million-dollar bills like you 'd blow suds off a beer . If I 'd knowed it was him , I 'd have hit him once , and hid him in the cellar for the reward . Who 'd I think he was ? I thought he was a wire-tapper , working a con game ! " Mr. Carroll had not " hung up , " but when in the Bronx the beer-glass crashed , in Wall Street the receiver had slipped from the hand of the man who held it , and the man himself had fallen forward . His desk hit him in the face and woke him -- woke him to the wonderful fact that he still lived ; that at forty he had been born again ; that before him stretched many more years in which , as the young man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make good . The afternoon was far advanced when the staff of Carroll and Hastings were allowed to depart , and , even late as was the hour , two of them were asked to remain . Into the most private of the private offices Carroll invited Gaskell , the head clerk ; in the main office Hastings had asked young Thorne , the bond clerk , to be seated . Until the senior partner has finished with Gaskell young Thorne must remain seated . " Gaskell , " said Mr. Carroll , " if we had listened to you , if we 'd run this place as it was when father was alive , this never would have happened . It has n't happened , but we 've had our lesson . And after this we 're going slow and going straight . And we do n't need you to tell us how to do that . We want you to go away -- on a month 's vacation . When I thought we were going under I planned to send the children on a sea-voyage with the governess -- so they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the eye again , I need them , I ca n't let them go . So , if you 'd like to take your wife on an ocean trip to Nova Scotia and Quebec , here are the cabins I reserved for the kids . They call it the Royal Suite -- whatever that is -- and the trip lasts a month . The boat sails to-morrow morning . Do n't sleep too late or you may miss her . " * * * * * The head clerk was secreting the tickets in the inside pocket of his waistcoat . His fingers trembled , and when he laughed his voice trembled . " Miss the boat ! " the head clerk exclaimed . " If she gets away from Millie and me she 's got to start now . We 'll go on board to-night ! " A half-hour later Millie was on her knees packing a trunk , and her husband was telephoning to the drug-store for a sponge bag and a cure for seasickness . Owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offering up incoherent prayers of thanksgiving . Suddenly she sank back upon the floor . " John ! " she cried , " does n't it seem sinful to sail away in a ' royal suite ' and leave this beautiful flat empty ? " Over the telephone John was having trouble with the drug clerk . " No ! " he explained , " I 'm not seasick now . The medicine I want is to be taken later . I know I 'm speaking from the Pavonia ; but the Pavonia is n't a ship ; it 's an apartment-house . " He turned to Millie . " We ca n't be in two places at the same time , " he suggested . " But , think , " insisted Millie , " of all the poor people stifling to-night in this heat , trying to sleep on the roofs and fire-escapes ; and our flat so cool and big and pretty -- and no one in it . " John nodded his head proudly . " I know it 's big , " he said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are sleeping to-night on the roofs and in the parks . " " I was thinking of your brother -- and Grace , " said Millie . " They 've been married only two weeks now , and they 're in a stuffy hall bedroom and eating with all the other boarders . Think what our flat would mean to them ; to be by themselves , with eight rooms and their own kitchen and bath , and our new refrigerator and the gramophone ! It would be Heaven ! It would be a real honeymoon ! " Abandoning the drug clerk , John lifted Millie in his arms and kissed her , for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother . * * * * * The younger brother and Grace were sitting on the stoop of the boardinghouse . On the upper steps , in their shirt-sleeves , were the other boarders ; so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers . The air of the cross street was stale and stagnant ; from it rose exhalations of rotting fruit , the gases of an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and the hall bedroom , with its odors of a gas-stove and a kitchen , the choice was difficult . " We 've got to cool off somehow , " the young husband was saying , " or you wo n't sleep . Shall we treat ourselves to ice-cream sodas or a trip on the Weehawken ferry-boat ? " " The ferry-boat ! " begged the girl , " where we can get away from all these people . " A taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street , kicked itself to a stop , and the head clerk and Millie spilled out upon the pavement . They talked so fast , and the younger brother and Grace talked so fast , that the boarders , although they listened intently , could make nothing of it . They distinguished only the concluding sentences : " Why do n't you drive down to the wharf with us , " they heard the elder brother ask , " and see our royal suite ? " But the younger brother laughed him to scorn . " What 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal palace ? " An hour later , had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head clerk , they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling murmur of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of " Alexander 's Ragtime Band . " When in his private office Carroll was making a present of the royal suite to the head clerk , in the main office Hastings , the junior partner , was addressing " Champ " Thorne , the bond clerk . He addressed him familiarly and affectionately as " Champ . " This was due partly to the fact that twenty-six years before Thorne had been christened Champneys and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven of one of the Big Three to the championship . " Champ , " said Mr. Hastings , " last month , when you asked me to raise your salary , the reason I did n't do it was not because you did n't deserve it , but because I believed if we gave you a raise you 'd immediately get married . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted with indignation . " And why should I not get married ? " he demanded . " You 're a fine one to talk ! You 're the most offensively happy married man I ever met . " " Perhaps I know I am happy better than you do , " reproved the junior partner ; " but I know also that it takes money to support a wife . " " You raise me to a hundred a week , " urged Champ , " and I 'll make it support a wife whether it supports me or not . " " A month ago , " continued Hastings , " we could have promised you a hundred , but we did n't know how long we could pay it . We did n't want you to rush off and marry some fine girl --  --  " " Some fine girl ! " muttered Mr. Thorne . " The Finest Girl ! " " The finer the girl , " Hastings pointed out , " the harder it would have been for you if we had failed and you had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened with sympathy and concern . " Is it as bad as that ? " he murmured . Hastings sighed happily . " It was , " he said , " but this morning the Young Man of Wall Street did us a good turn -- saved us -- saved our creditors , saved our homes , saved our honor . We 're going to start fresh and pay our debts , and we agreed the first debt we paid would be the small one we owe you . You 've brought us more than we 've given , and if you 'll stay with us we 're going to ' see ' your fifty and raise it a hundred . What do you say ? " Young Mr. Thorne leaped to his feet . What he said was : " Where'n hell 's my hat ? " But by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners . " I say , ' thank you a thousand times , ' " he shouted over his shoulder . " Excuse me , but I 've got to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not explain to whom he was going to break the news ; but Hastings must have guessed , for again he sighed happily and then , a little hysterically , laughed aloud . Several months had passed since he had laughed aloud . In his anxiety to break the news Champ Thorne almost broke his neck . In his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the elevator was going down or coming up , and sooner than wait to find out he started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the elevator-door swung open . " You get five dollars , " he announced to the elevator man , " if you drop to the street without a stop . Beat the speed limit ! Act like the building is on fire and you 're trying to save me before the roof falls . " Senator Barnes and his entire family , which was his daughter Barbara , were at the Ritz-Carlton . They were in town in August because there was a meeting of the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a secret meeting . Those directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been summoned by telegraph ; those who were steaming across the ocean , by wireless . Up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal , sickening , grim , terrible . As yet it burned beneath the surface , giving out only an odor , but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself . At any moment it might break into flame . For the directors , was it the better wisdom to let the scandal smoulder , and take a chance , or to be the first to give the alarm , the first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out ? It was to decide this that , in the heat of August , the directors and the president had foregathered . Champ Thorne knew nothing of this ; he knew only that by a miracle Barbara Barnes was in town ; that at last he was in a position to ask her to marry him ; that she would certainly say she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year before he had issued his declaration of independence . Before he could marry , he told her , he must be able to support a wife on what he earned , without her having to accept money from her father , and until he received " a minimum wage " of five thousand dollars they must wait . " What is the matter with my father 's money ? " Barbara had demanded . Thorne had evaded the direct question . " There is too much of it , " he said . " Do you object to the way he makes it ? " insisted Barbara . " Because rubber is most useful . You put it in golf balls and auto tires and galoches . There is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoches . And what is there ' tainted ' about a raincoat . " Thorne shook his head unhappily . " It 's not the finished product to which I refer , " he stammered ; " it 's the way they get the raw material . " " They get it out of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! " she cried , " you are thinking of the Congo . There it is terrible ! That is slavery . But there are no slaves on the Amazon . The natives are free and the work is easy . They just tap the trees the way the farmers gather sugar in Vermont . Father has told me about it often . " Thorne had made no comment . He could abuse a friend , if the friend were among those present , but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as he disliked Senator Barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to others . And he knew besides that , if the father she loved and the man she loved distrusted each other , Barbara would not rest until she learned the reason why . One day , in a newspaper , Barbara read of the Puju Mayo atrocities , of the Indian slaves in the jungles and back waters of the Amazon , who are offered up as sacrifices to " red rubber . " She carried the paper to her father . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it were true it was the first he had heard of it . Senator Barnes loved the good things of life , but the thing he loved most was his daughter ; the thing he valued the highest was her good opinion . So when for the first time she looked at him in doubt , he assured her he at once would order an investigation . " But , of course , " he added , " it will be many months before our agents can report . On the Amazon news travels very slowly . " In the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered . " I am afraid , " she said , " that that is true . " That was six months before the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber Company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the Ritz-Carlton . They were due to arrive in half an hour , and while Senator Barnes awaited their coming Barbara came to him . In her eyes was a light that helped to tell the great news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted at once to play a part in her happiness , to make her grateful to him , not alone to this stranger who was taking her away . So fearful was he that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for half his kingdom he would have parted with it . " And besides giving my consent , " said the rubber king , " for which no one seems to have asked , what can I give my little girl to make her remember her old father ? Some diamonds to put on her head , or pearls to hang around her neck , or does she want a vacant lot on Fifth Avenue ? " The lovely hands of Barbara rested upon his shoulders ; her lovely face was raised to his ; her lovely eyes were appealing , and a little frightened . " What would one of those things cost ? " asked Barbara . The question was eminently practical . It came within the scope of the senator 's understanding . After all , he was not to be cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered airily : " Anything you like , " he said ; " a million dollars ? " The fingers closed upon his shoulders . The eyes , still frightened , still searched his in appeal . " Then for my wedding-present , " said the girl , " I want you to take that million dollars and send an expedition to the Amazon . And I will choose the men . Men unafraid ; men not afraid of fever or sudden death ; not afraid to tell the truth -- even to you . And all the world will know . And they -- I mean you -- will set those people free ! " Senator Barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he concealed under a manner of just indignation . " My mind is made up , " he told them . " Existing conditions can not continue . And to that end , at my own expense , I am sending an expedition across South America . It will investigate , punish , and establish reforms . I suggest , on account of this damned heat , we do now adjourn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his wife all , or nearly all . He did not tell her about the automatic pistol . And together on tiptoe they crept to the nursery and looked down at their sleeping children . When she rose from her knees the mother said , " But how can I thank him ? " By " him " she meant the Young Man of Wall Street . " You never can thank him , " said Carroll ; " that 's the worst of it . " But after a long silence the mother said : " I will send him a photograph of the children . Do you think he will understand ? " Down at Seabright , Hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden . The moon was so bright that the roses still held their color . " I would like to thank him , " said the young wife . She meant the Young Man of Wall Street . " But for him we would have lost this . " Her eyes caressed the garden , the fruit-trees , the house with wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these roses , " said the young wife . " Will he understand that they mean our home ? " At a scandalously late hour , in a scandalous spirit of independence , Champ Thorne and Barbara were driving around Central Park in a taxicab . " How strangely the Lord moves , his wonders to perform , " misquoted Barbara . " Had not the Young Man of Wall Street saved Mr. Hastings , Mr. Hastings could not have raised your salary ; you would not have asked me to marry you , and had you not asked me to marry you , father would not have given me a wedding-present , and --  --  " " And , " said Champ , taking up the tale , " thousands of slaves would still be buried in the jungles , hidden away from their wives and children , and the light of the sun and their fellow men . They still would be dying of fever , starvation , tortures . " He took her hand in both of his and held her finger-tips against his lips .

If it had n't been for you he 'd ha ' drownded . " " He would not ! " said Sammy with punctilious regard for the truth ; " it was n't deep enough .
