txt It is to be assumed that when the Kaiser and the Czar met at Balttschport the latter was ready to explain to the former all that he was entitled to know as to the vote of two-thirds of a. billion of dollars by the Duma for the increase of the Russian Navy . It is equally to be assumed that the Kaiser from his own sources of information knew nearly as much as the Czar could tell him . In the light of that information it would be very natural that the Kaiser should suggest to his imperial brother that neutrality in case of a war in which Germany was engaged would be a most agreeable thing . That such a suggestion was received with favor by the ruler of all the Russias is extremely unlikely . It is impossible that the Czar has forgotten , and improbable that he has forgiven , the sore wound to his selfj respect inflicted by Germany when Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzogovina and when the Czar 's objections were met by a mobilization of German troops on the Russian frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manchuria . It sank deal ? in the minds of Russian statesmen , and though they maintained the polite attitude that convention demanded , they did not ignore the lesson . The process of reinforcing thej military strength of Russia , especially in the naval branch , was immediately pushed with increased vigor . The plans announced last week , to be executed within five years , will make the fighting force of Russia on the sea greater than that of Germany and second only to that of Great Britain . What these two navies , with that of France , could do to influence the development of German policy the Kaiser knows . It is not pleasant , but it is unavoidable , whenever the possibility of weals considered , to think first of Ger-1 many . It Is plain that there can be no war of consequence in which she does not take part , and It is generally believed in the Chancelleries of Europe that there will be none in which Germany is not the aggressor . German statesmen deny that this is a fair interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Kaiser would be as emphatic as that of his Ministers . But it Is the state of mind that , unfortunately , has to be taken into account . The steady increase in the military preparations of Great Britain , the maintenance of heavy expenditures for a like purpose in France , and now the enormous burden assumed by Russia with similar aim , are all based on the fear if not the conviction that they may be required for use in a. conflict that would not arise were Germany not armed to the teeth and menacing in her general attitude . In these circumstances , it Is extremely improbable that the Czar would listen favorably to the suggestion which the Kaiser is reported to have made to him that in case of a ar between Germany and AustriaHungary on the one side and England and France on the other Russia should promise to remain neutral . So far as France is concerned Russia could not do so without.violating the treaty of defensive alliance by which the two countries have so long been bound . And even if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without grave apprehension the possibility of the crippling of France by Germany . The position of the Muscovite Empire is such that it may be threatened by Germany , and very seriously , but not at all by France , and only indirectly by Great Britain . The German element in the western provinces of Russia is considerable . The German element in Austria is very strong . Russian interests in the near Orient are opposed to those of the Triple Alliance . The Czar has nothing to gain and very much to lose by the loss of strength and influence by France , and , in less measure , by Great Britain . It is unreasonable to suppose that he would promise to stand idle while such an event was being brought about . Onthe other hand , we need not infer that the strengthening of the Russian Navy , with that of the army which is to go with it , Is a menace to peace . If the purpose of the Triple Entente remains , as it is now accepted to be , really defensive , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is the view that the German Kaiser is constantly presenting as an explanation of the policy of Germany . It works both ways
