txt Following the removal of Dora Schram from the Matteawan State Hospital for the Insane three weeks ago by order of Justice Morsehauser , Mary Mullen , and other patient , was taken before Justice Tompkins at Newburg yesterday on a writ of habeas corpus and the court intimated that he would issue an order in a few days for her release . Dora Schram , who was transferred to the Hudson River State Hospital , was again before Justice Murschauser at Poughkeepsie yesterday on a new writ of habeas corpus . The Hudson River authorities declared her sane , but she was again prevented for the present , by the mass of red tape in which she has become entangled , from being set at liberty . Still another habeas corpus proceeding was heard by Justice Tompkins yesterday , in which he reserved decision . This was the case of John Healy , who shot Michael Kibben in this city about fifteen years ago . Kibben was not fatally hurt . Healy was not tried , as he was admittedly insane , but was sent to Matteawan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomas Healy , of 475 Fox Street .

The petition is based on the ground that he is now sane . Dr. Baker , Assistant Superintendent at Matteawan , declares him insane , just as Dr. Sears , who has charge of the women patients , declared Dora Schram and Mary Mullen insane . Besides having these three proceedings on hand , the Matteawan authorities have been kept busy for the last week by a double-headed investigation of the death of John J. Nugent . These investigations have been carried on , respectively , by the State Lunacy Commissioners and by Judge Hasbrouck of Dutchess County . with the aid of Assistant District Attorney Conger . The body of Nugent. which was buried in this city , is to be exhumed early this week in the effort to establish whether his death was due to a fall or to brutal treatment on the part of keepers , Mullen Girl Feigned Insanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became wayward when 14 years old , when she was working in a cigarette factory in Richmond , Va. , where she was i.orn .

I told miss Dathe Superintendent . I wanted to 7 ' 2:9 , aPrn and began to sham insanity . I re-I ur:ed to dig ditches , and started breaking 1 windows . Two doctors came and t xem-I ined me . One said I was insane and the other that I was acting a little off in breaking the windows . So I was transferre.d to Matteawan . When I first came I was put in the violent ward : : " Were you violent ? " asked Justice ' Tompkins . " No . Sir ? I was not . " " Did you have any ocealiar ideas ? " asked the court . " No . Sir ; not at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposed her counsel . N D. Belknap of Newburg. " that you had some queer ideas ? " Oh . yes : that was when I got the hypodermic . Dr. Seats gave it to me . He also gave me what the patients call knockout drops . This affected me for two ? days . I had queer ideas then , and the attendants frightened me when they came near . " " Did you have delusions at any other time ? " " No , never . " The examination then developed the fact that she had not broken any windows since last April when she made " a contract " with Dr. Sears . agreeing that if she did not stop destroying State property she would consent to stay in Matteawan a I year beyond the time for which she was committed . Accuses the Attendants . " When I broke the windows in April , " she said , " I was very nervous , and had been drinking . The men attendants used to give us drinks and cigarettes through the windows . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Justice Tompkins . " Yes , Sir . , one of the keepers , came up one time and pushed me into I my room with his fist . " Justice Tompkins brought out the fact that the attendants who had furnished ** and cigarettes were no longer at Matteawan . " The last time I was locked in my room . " continued the witness , " was when I had a sore throat and asked for water . The nurse would n't give it to me , and I broke some windows then . Dr. Sears hit me in the mouth and cut my lip at that time . I made the contract after that , and have n't broken any windows since . " The witness said she had been in the Washington Home and the Magdalen Home before being committed to Bedford . She had been arrested in Baltimore and sent to jail . She tried to escape from the Magdalen Home . but had had no other trouble in any of these institutions except at the House of the Good Shepherd in Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with one of the sisters , " she said , " and I went to her assistance . The sister twisted my arm , and I knocked her down . I broke a window then because my friend had been locked up unjustly , and I wanted to share her punishment . Since last April I have done everything the doctors asked me to . " Dr. Talcott 0 . Vanamee of Newburg was called and qualified as an expert . He said he had examined Mary Mullen last Friday for 45 minutes and found no evidence of delusions or insanity . He deGlared emphatically that in his opinion there would be no danger to the public in letting her go free . Not Sane , Says Dr. Sears . Dr. Keith Sears of the Matteawan Asylum said that at the time of Mary admission she was quiet and denied that she had ever had hallucinations . " After awhile , " said Dr. Sears , " ehe assaulted one of the attendants and broke all the windows in her room and also broke the sash . Then she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut her hand badly , and while I was waiting for an attendant to return with a bandage I stood over her where she sat in a chair . She became obstreperous , and in the struggle my hand accidentally hit her mouth . That 's all there was to my hitting her . " " How has she been for the last six months ? " asked Justice Tompkins . " She has been nervous and irritable . She has n't broken any windows since she made the contract . " " What is her present condition , " " I do n't think she is well . " " Would it do harm to release her ? " " It would n't do any good . She would be back in a couple of months . However . we intend to send her to her sister in Richmond on March 16 when the time of her commitment expires . " " Do you swear , " Dr. Sears was asked on cross-examination , ' ? that she is now insane ? " She is a victim of constitutional inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence . " " Do you swear she is insane ? " repeated Mr. Belknap . ' Yes , I do , " replied Dr. Sears . The witness said that the hypodermic injection given to the patient contained one-fiftieth of a grain of hyoscin , which has a quieting effect He admitted that it might have caused the delusions she had on that occasion , and that she had never had any delusions since , In answer to questions he said he did not know of any destructive outbreak on her part except when she was confined in institutions . To Send Her to Booth Home . Norman A. Lees of 181 Douglass Street . Brooklyn , whose own release from Mat- , teawan on a writ of habeas corpus was obtained last Fall , and who has been active in the interest of other patients claiming to be sane , took the stand to testify that Mary Mullen 's sister did not want her sent back to Richmond , as planned by the asylum authorities . Mr. Lees said he had seen the sister , Mrs. Laura Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habeas corpus petition , but she would not consent to her return to Richmond on any conditions . " What do you propose to do with her , then ? " asked Justice Tompkins . " I have arranged , " said Mr. Lees , " with Mr. Booth . son of Maud Millington Booth , that if freed she shall go to the home maintained by the Volunteers of America at Valley Cottage , Mrs. Rhinehart , the Superintendent , is willing to have her , and the girl is willing to go . In that way she will have the best kind of an opportunity to make afresh start in life . " " That would seem to be the best disposition we . could make of the case , " said Justice Tompkins . " I know the institution , and it is a fine one , " Dr. Sears said he had no objection to that disposition of the matter . It was also contended by the petitioner 's attorney that MarY Mullen was not properly committed to Bedford in the first place , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Droege , provided only for sending wayward girls to either the Protestant Episcopal House of Mercy , the Roman Catholic House of the Good Shepherd , or the New York Magdalen Society . The court said this would also be taken into consideration , and that a decision would be given in a very few days . In the meantime Mary Mullen was sent back to Matteawan . Odd Case of Dora Schram . The case of Dora Schram , which first came before Justice Morschauser at Poughkeepsie on Jan. 29 , was unique in that she had never been formally accused Of any crime or even minor offense . She was committed to the State Training School for Girls because when her father died she was left without any proper guardianship . From there ' the urea ftana. ferred to Matteawan , which is an asylum for the criminal insane . She had previously been in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum , and had been placed out by the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society . She had been in Matteawan nearly a year . and le now only 17 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent to Mattea wan from the training school and that his only recourse was to send her back there it he found her sane . The training school authorities refused to receive her back . difficulty was solved for the time being by agreement between the attorney for the petitioner who was her uncle , Jacob Bercowitz of Brooklyn , and the Deputy Attorney General , under which she was sent to the Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane , a non-criminal institution . Her behavior there has been reported as unexceptionable and accusations made against her previously affecting her moral character have been disproved . When the now writ was sworn out by her uncle yesterday against the Hudson River State Hospital , Justice Morschauser made it returnable immediately , Dr. P11-grim , head of the institution , declared the girl sane . This left the court in the same Quandary as berore . His wish was to set her free to go home with Borcowitz , but the commitment to the training school stood in the way . He tried to arrange another agreement among all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have her released . Justice Morschauser then coinmuilicated with the training school , which is at Hudson N. T. , asking that she be discharged from the commitment . Although the authorities at that institution have emphatically refused to have her sent back there , they did not feel warranted in discharging her except by authority of the Board of Trustees . Jusdee Morschauser thereupon continued the case until next Saturday in the expeota ! non that in the meantime the trustees will meet and cut the last piece of tape that keeps Dora Schram , admittedly sane , in an insane asylum . Should the court be compelled to send her buck to the Training School without such a discharge , the complications to which she will be subjected may be judged from a letter from Charles H. Strong , Chairman of the board , written Friday , in ? which he says : My own view le that It would be our duty to the girls properly committed to this institution and under our care and training to oppose Dora 's return to us , on the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the reason that she is , in our opinion , mentally and physically incapable of being materially benefited by the training and discipline of this institution . If you examine the statute you will find that a girl who falls within this class can not be committed by any court to this institution . " If our contention in this respect is overruled by the court and she is returned to this institution , my view is that we will adopt either one of two courses , after she has been quarantined for the two weeks period required by law and after we have thus had an opportunity to observe her , namely , ( a ) retain her until she reaches the age of 18 , unless she is earlier fitted for patrole , which is not likely , as I do not believe she has had much , if any , of the training in cooking and sewing , &o.,; that it is our duty to give , and ? that we do give to all the girls capable of receiving it ; or ( b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some other institution , on the ground that she is incapable of being benefited as above stated . If you will examine the statute you will see that we can adopt either of these two courses . "
