NOT many months ago , in a little afterdinnercompany at Washington , the conversation fell upon our foreign service . The comments made were chiefly of a personal character , consisting of references to the qualities and peculiarities of our diplomatic representatives in foreign capitals . Only one general observation illumined the dismal gossip of the evening . As the party was about to break up , a newly elected Senator , who had maintained an interested silence during the conversation , suddenly remarked , " I do n't understand why we have those fellows , anyway . " This observation , which evoked an outburst of laughter but elicited no response , has the threefold merit of being just , kindly , and honest , which is saving much in these days of searching criticism upon questions relating to public life . It is just , because it clearly indicates the proper starting-point of a discussion regarding our diplomatic service . It is kindly , because it places without discrimination all the representatives of our country engaged in that service in the same large , generous category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect , at least does not imply any opprobrium . It is honest , because it is a frank confession of ignorance , betokening a state of mind at once docile and unassuming ; and , if not keenly curious , implies no unconquerable prejudice . At a small gathering in a well-known club in the city of Washington , where the Senator 's observation was quoted , it was caustically remarked that when that gentleman had been longer in politics he would discover the practical reasons " why we have those fellows . " The obscurity of this observation , coupled with the expression of countenance with which it was uttered , moved a young lawyer not long out of the lawschool to ask for an explanation ; whereupon the first speaker remarked that every one who had had practical experience with politics understood what he meant , and that it was not a matter for public discussion . The vague smile with which this remark was received by those present plainly indicated that it was not agreeable to hear a branch of the public service spoken of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were American citizens , and that not only public officials , but the manner of conducting public affairs , were being made the objects of a covert , yet not very covert , sneer . The young lawyer seemed especially annoyed by the speaker 's insinuation , and asked what he meant by such a statement . " I mean , " was the reply , " that the entire vocabulary now in common use regarding this subject indicates that the country has no serious interest in the diplomatic service . It has been assailed in Congress as " purely ornamental . " It has been retained only because of its utility to party politics . It is the very life of a Presidential election . " " And you believe in continuing this system ? " asked the young man . " Sinecures , " was the reply , " are necessary to the life of a political party . The indefinite character of the diplomatic service renders it particularly useful ; for , while it appeals chiefly to men of leisure , it stimulates aspirations which awaken an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the service has no standard of qualification or efficiency , there is no limit to its political usefulness . " " You think , then , that this system is a public advantage ? " asked the lawyer . " I shall not say a public advantage ; the public has no interest in it . But it is a political advantage , both before and after elections . " " How is that ? " inquired a man who had been trying to read a newspaper . " Why , " answered the first speaker , " you look to the Executive to promote legislation . If Congress becomes lethargic , the diplomatic service is there to be used as a stimulant . You like a strong Executive , do you not ? Well , what gives a stronger hand than the power to bestow and the power to withhold ? Nothing serves to quicken interest like ? " " But , " broke in the young lawyer , " do you think it is right to apply such motives ? " " It is always right to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of the people 's will . They have placed him in the seat of power . It is unreasonable to expect him to make bricks without straw . " How about the legislators ? Have they no mandate from the people ? " queried a voice from a corner of the room . " Personally , I believe in a strong government , " replied the first speaker , and nothing strengthens a government like offices that can be vacated and filled at will . The purists , with their foolish diffusion of power , are bringing politics into disrepute . " " The founders of our government did not regard public office from your point of view , " replied the young lawyer , earnestly . " Public positions were created for the service of the nation , not for party or personal advantage . I do not pretend to know whether the diplomatic service is useful to the country or not . But it makes no difference to my contention . If it is useless , it ought to be abolished . If it is useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of traffic . We have had in the foreign service of our country men of the greatest personal eminence and of the highest qualifications , who were not chosen for the reasons you have intimated . Adams , Jefferson , Madison , and Monroe , not to mention Franklin ? men who have been honored with the Presidency ? were among our earliest ministers abroad . The service has been adorned by some VOL . CXXVIII. ? No. 764. - 24of our most illustrious writers , such as Irving , Bancroft , Motley , and Lowell . To the greater Powers we have habitually sent our most distinguished citizens ? a long roll of eminent men who were not politicians in any narrow sense , though many of them were statesmen of a high order . Your insinuation is unjust to them , to our Presidents , and to the American people . " " You young reformers are always talking about the ' people . ' What do the people know or care about these things ? They only want to be left alone . Nobody cares who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A clergyman who happened to be of the company , fearing that the debate was becoming too heated and might lead to scandal , thought it advisable to turn the current of talk into a different channel , and said : " I think it is not always profitable to discuss too freely the motives of men . Is it not better to consider their difficulties and embarrassments , and try to remove them ? I have always supposed that every deliberate provision of government has some purpose of distinct public usefulness , and I suppose this one has ; but I am very much in sympathy with the sentiment expressed by the new Senator . I do not understand fully why we have ambassadors , except for social purposes , and I should very much like to be informed . " There was a long silence , finally broken by an elderly gentleman of scholarly appearance whom every one addressed as " Judge . " " If I remember rightly , " he said , " the Constitution of the United States , in Article II. , Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of ambassadors and other public ministers as for judges of the Supreme Court . The natural inference is that the framers of our form of government regarded them as equally important , and it is certain that they invested the selection of the persons who should serve in this capacity with precisely the same safeguards as were applied to the choice of the highest judicial officers of the nation , namely , nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate . It was probably intended that the President should observe the same care and be actuated by the same motives in both cases , and that the Senate would see that he did his duty in this respect . There is no evidence that these offices were designed to serve any merely partisan or personal purpose , and it is fair to suppose that it was not even imagined that any other motive than a desire to secure the most efficient public service would ever affect such appointments . " " That is all very fine , " interrupted the propounder of the political-reward theory , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is useless to speak of the provisions of the Constitution . The Fathers took care to provide offices enough to go around ! " The young lawyer 's eyes blazed with indignation as he exclaimed : " The Fathers would Feel contempt for us if they could know the spirit in which their labors are considered . The system which you openly defend would have been regarded with horror by the framers of the Constitution . They did everything in their power to prevent such a system . I feel a sense of shame in hearing these accusations as I recall the words of Washington when he took command of the army : ' I will keep an exact account of my expenses ; those , I doubt not , will be discharged , and that is all I desire . ' The Fathers gave us a country to defend and honor by service and sacrifice , and set us the example of unselfish patriotism . " The Judge 's face remained calm and placid as he turned alternately toward each of the belligerents , who seemed determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold fast to some line of reasoning , he promptly added : " Those men were engaged in a great task , and their minds were filled with a deep sense of responsibility . We were then a small and weak country . We had profited greatly from the diplomacy of the Revolution . Lord Acton is of the opinion that without the aid of the French fleet our independence might not have been established . at least not so early ; and many American writers agree with him . But we do not need to enter upon a debate on this point . The delegates to the Constitutional Convention remembered with gratitude what Franklin had done for us . Our first attempt in diplomacy had borne rich fruit . It had also taught us many lessons , and a cautious foreign policy promised still to be necessary ; as , indeed , it proved to be . It was a matter of common consent that ambassadors and other ministers ' would be needed , and in the article of the Constitution I have cited their appointment was provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No objec-tion to providing for them was offered , but the creation of the Supreme Court was a thorny question . The power to send and receive ambassadors had been distinctly accorded in the Articles of Confederation and required no debate , for it was an essential attribute of a sovereign nation . The Supreme Court , on the contrary , was a new institution , as novel in its conception in 1787 as an international court appeared to be a century later . It should be further remembered that in the first draft of the Constitution the power to appoint ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court was given to the Senate alone ; and that it was by subsequent modifica-tion , unanimously adopted , that the power of appointment by the President , with the advice and consent of the Senate , was conferred . The intention to place such appointments upon the highest possible plane , and to invest them with the highest degree of responsibility , is , therefore , very clear . " It was not until the Judge had pronounced the words " Constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on a conversation in a corner of the room with another gentleman , had knocked the ashes from his cigar and turned to listen . It was i a well-known Representative in Congress from a state of the Middle West . " What you have just said , Judge , " he observed , " is very interesting from an historical point of view , but it seems to me that times and conditions have changed entirely since the Constitution was framed and adopted . First of all , we have greatly changed as a nation . Then we were weak and small , now we have become strong and great . We have no neighbors who would ever think of attacking us . We fear nothing and want less from Europe , What need , therefore , have we of ambassadors and the paraphernalia that goes along with them ? We are a plain and peaceable people , with whom no one is likely to interfere . And not only that , but conditions have changed . We have the telegraph , not only the transatlantic cable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication and rendered ambassadors and the whole costly outfit superfluous . Worse than that , by leaving ambassadors nothing to do it opens the way to all sorts of folly : the vanity of women , the even greater vanity of men , with their foolish taste for uniforms ? which Congress has positively forbidden them to wear ; and decorations , equally forbidden , but sought for and worn just the same . It is time to stop this nonsense , which makes us ridiculous abroad and ashamed at home . And now these people want palaces to live in at public expense ! I want to abolish the whole thing . " A long silence fell upon the company . The Representative 's ardor and fluency rendered a reply difficult . No one seemed to have the courage to speak . He was known to be a keen debater , and not too tolerant of opposition . His resources of ridicule in this case were twofold ? the bold , direct rhetoric to which he was accustomed , and the salient points of attack afforded by the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent , but the young lawyer , in that splendid spirit of knight-errantry which scents with joy the breath of battle , ventured to remark : " It seems to me that much , if not all , of our legislation might be handled in a similar manner . It is , after all , simply a question of choosing between what you want and what you do n't want . Let us abolish Congress ; let everybody make his suggestions for new laws to a bureau of law-writers m Washington , to be put by them into the form of bills ; let these be printed in the newspapers , with a coupon attached on which to express a vote , and let the laws that have a majority for them be published for the information of the people . It seems very simple . " This sally was greeted with a general laugh , in which , however , the Representative did not join ; and he was evidently annoyed by the attempt at sarcasm of one so young and so little entitled to hold the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , with the flicker of a smile , " and not meant to be taken seriously . Legislation by such a method would be impossible . Without party councils , conferences , debates , and compromises , no laws could ever be passed . The personal element and the associative element are both essential to any understanding , and every law fit to be inscribed on the statutebook implies an understanding . In foreign relations it is different . Each nation is represented by some one person . These persons have only to communicate to one another their views , arguments and decisions . That ends the matter . " " Is there , then , to be no understanding between nations ? Or can it be reached without personal contact ? " the young lawyer asked , rather eagerly . " The decisions of sovereign States are necessarily final , even though they may conflict , " retorted the Representative . " Take our own decisions , for example . Do you suppose that we are going to be influenced by what any man sent to Washington may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend them . We know how to make up our minds , and when we have made them up it makes no difference to us what anybody else may think . Everything we have to do with foreigners can be done by telegraph directly between the heads of the governments . " " And our diplomatic correspondence , " said the young man , " when published in the Red Book , would read something like this : " ' Emperor William , Berlin : You have too many ships in the Caribbean Sca . We request you to reduce the number. ? Wilson . ' " ' President Wilson , Washington : We run our navy from Berlin . Work on your canal. ? W. I. R. ' " ' King George , London : You need to teach your Canadians manners . Remember we have treaties about the Great Lakes. ? Wilson . ' " ' President Wilson , Washington : Our people are accountable to us alone. ? George R. ' " The majority of those present laughed heartily , but the Judge looked very grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any judicious formulation of it , that the Judge had begun to fear for the good humor of the company , and was about to arise and try to break up the gathering . It would never do to let the sharp but rather undisciplined intelligence of the Representative and the impertinent sarcasm of the young lawyer bring on a thunder-storm , which was evidently brewing ; for they both had that peculiar glitter of the eye that so much resembles the gleam which palpitates between two electric wires when a contact is almost complete . Happily , just at that moment , there entered the room a man of distinguished appearance , evidently a foreigner , although a well-known figure in Washington . It was Count Brysterand , the Ambassador of a great European power . All the gentlemen arose respectfully ; salutations were exchanged ; a comfortable arm-chair was offered , and the Judge said , promptly : " Your Excellency , we have been conversing on the subject of diplomatic relations between foreign countries , rather unprofitably , I fear , for none of us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your authority upon this subject is , and I am sure it would be a delight to all of us if you were kindly disposed to express your views . " The Ambassador took the seat that was offered him , smiled genially , and said : " You do me an honor in wishing to have my opinions ; and I shall be pleased , as far as my limited knowledge goes , to take part in your conversation . I always like to discuss matters with you Americans , you have such a faculty for getting to the point of things and seeing straight . " " We were speaking of the duties of ambassadors , Your Excellency , and we have only the vaguest idea of what they are . " " That depends upon what circum-stances make them , " said the Count . " Often they consist chiefly in accepting kindnesses and in trying to be pleasant in return . Diplomatists would be very happy if it were always like that , and weconsider that our greatest success is to maintain that condition . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked the Representative . " Certainly , it should . But things will happen , you know ; unexpected things , sometimes trivial things , which for a time threaten to upset relations . Then we have to explain , if we can , and it is not always easy . " " In our state of civilization , one would think , people would be disposed to be reasonable , and would understand that , even if unpleasant incidents occur , the whole nation is not to blame , " broke in the Representative . " Yes , but sometimes , unfortunately , whole nations become much agitated over small matters , not to speak of great misunderstandings . It is then often difficult to satisfy the public mind , but the ambassador is there for that purpose . I do nor need to cite instances , but you will all recall them . What is required in such circumstances is action ? prompt , cool , considerate , reassuring . It is well if it occurs simultaneously at both ends of the line . Diplomats , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least until matters have gone beyond diplomacy . An unfriendly diplomat must always be immediately recalled , and a more friendly one be at once sent in his place . If a vacancy thus created remains long unfilled , it is understood that the government so acting is offended . There are but three steps between international friendship and international hostility . They are : ( 1 ) the permanent recall of the head of the mission ; ( a ) the recall of the charg ? d'affaires ; and ( 3 ) the complete rupture of diplomatic relations , which is the immediate prelude of war . " The Representative started perceptibly in his seat . " Do you mean to say , " he asked , " that if we abolished our diplomatic service entirely it would give offense ? " The Ambassador looked at him a moment in surprise , as if struggling to catch his meaning . Then he said : " Certainly , no nation would do that without a reason . What reason could be suffi-cient ? " " Why , " said the Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected . My point is , what reason is there for having ambassadors , that is , always having ambassadors ? Why not wait until there is a trouble to smooth out , and then send a commission to fix it up ? " The Count looked for a moment as if he suspected that he was being trifled with ; but noticing the kind , sincere , and even earnest expression of the Representative , he replied with a pleasant little laugh : " Do you neglect to look after your automobile until you have had an accident ? It takes a great effort to convince an unfriendly person that what seemed an insult , or an injury , was not intended to be one ; but much is overlooked between friends . Your suggestion appears to be that something may be done to heal enmities , but that nothing need be done to prevent them , or to maintain friendship . The diplomatic body throughout the world is an expression of friendly relations , assumes that they exist , and tries to deepen and extend them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the shock produced by some unfortunate incident . To destroy that body universally would he to undo all the past and make no provision for the future . As between European governments , such a step would at once lead to a state of hostilities . The nations of the world form a society of states ? not too well organized , it is true ? but a real society . You know what it means to withdraw abruptly from a society without a reason ; and what reason could be given ? " " Economy , " said the Representative ; " that and the incompatibility between democratic ideas of doing things and monarchical ideas . You Europeans have your ways , and we Americans have ours . I mean no offense , but you have so many frills ; there is so much gold lace about it all , so much silk and diamonds , so much high living in marble halls ? you understand I do n't mean to be offensive . " The Ambassador looked somewhat amused , broke into a laugh , and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps right . All the world is coming to think that too much show and ceremony is undesirable . If you willpermit me to be as frank as I am sure you would like me to he , let me say that it is your own compatriots who are driving us a little in Europe just now , You have improved some of our hotels , but you have made them impossible to us Europeans . They have become too expensive for us . It is true , our courts have their ways ; but I know of no instance where they have been made really uncomfortable to your American representatives , when they have simply been themselves and exercised their good taste as American citizens ? and your women are always charming . " " Your Excellency flatters us , " said the Representative , blandly . " My trouble is fundamental . We Americans do not want to be unsocial or to give offense , and , above all , to seem in any respect mean . But the point is this : We want reasons for what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible people . If this society of States of which you speak is a real thing , we want to he in it . We Americans believe in peace , and want to help the cause of peace and good feeling in the world , but we do n't want merely to seem to do it . Now that we-have The Hague Tribunal , ca n't we settle all our differences there ? Why do we not all go on simply attending to our business ; and , if disagreements arise , keep on with our business , and let The Hague Court settle them ? " " A court , " said the Ambassador , " seems to me a very necessary institution , and it is pleasant to hear from a member of the Congress of the United States such noble sentiments as you have just expressed regarding the utility of The Hague Court ; but while I , too , believe in the usefulness of an international tribunal of justice , I have sometimes thought that the true nature of its highest utility may be very easily misapprehended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not frequent courts of justice ; that the best friends are not those that meet oftenest in the lawcourts ; and that it is the aim and endeavor of the most thoughtful people , as much as possible , to avoid going there altogether . You will , of course , recall that the convention which established The Hague Court provides only for the adjudication of such differences as it has not been found possible to settle by diplomatic negotiations . Judging by the small number of cases that have been brought before the Court , and of course excluding those racial conflicts which no court could prevent , it would seem as if diplomacy were not an entirely useless art . " " Now that is interesting ! " exclaimed the Judge . " It would save us judges a great deal of time and labor if private differences could be settled in that way , instead of crowding our court calendars . By the way , Your Excellency , what is it precisely that you mean by diplomacy ? " " Definitions are rarely satisfactory , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that diplomacy , in its narrow sense , is the spirit of conciliation in the transaction of international business . In its largest sense , it is the endeavor to accomplish our ends by intelligence rather than by force . " " That is , by deception and bluff , " remarked the advocate of the theory of political rewards . " No , not that ; deception and bluff may have had their day . They have had it in business as well as in international matters , but their time has passed . Public enlightenment has made mendacity as dangerous as it is dishonorable . Diplomacy , like every other art , has passed through many stages of development , and has reached a higher altitude than it has ever occupied before . " " Will not Your Excellency give us a little sketch , in a few words , of what it is that modern diplomacy aims to accomplish ? " asked the Judge . " I have just been reading a book by one of your American writers , in which that is so clearly stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew a scrap of paper from his inside coat-pocket . " Shall I read it ? " ' States are independent entities which , in their powers of mutual benefit and injury , and their attitudes of friendliness and hostility , are much like natural persons . They need , therefore , to recognize and maintain , as it were , social relations outside of their jural relations . These must be mediated through living persons , for good neighborhood can never be reduced to mere mechanism . There is required a constant interchangeof courtesies , of friendly communication , of reassurance , and of explanation . This is the function of diplomacy . ' " " But , " said the Representative , " so long as we get our rights from our neighbors , what is the use of all these socalled courtesies , which , after all , are mere bowings and scrapings . Ca n't people be friendly without always leaning over the fence to say so ? " " I think , " said the Count , " the writer I was quoting has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another paragraph ? " It is precisely in the sphere of interests that are not yet perfect rights that the diplomatist finds his chief field of usefulness . He represents interests far more than established rights . He frames and interprets treaties , which furnish a positive foundation for rights . He recalls their existence , sees that they are applied , and where they fall short seeks to extend them , or at least to see that the nations continue to be on speaking terms by furnishing in his person a channel through which reason , kindliness , and mutual comprehension may have free passage . " ' " It sounds very fine , " said the Representative , " but is this , after all , any more than some man 's idea of what diplomacy ought to be ? Does it represent any reality ? Has it ever done any-thing ? " " There are still a few words in the passage I have copied that seem to answer that question , " said the Ambassador . " ' Through a continuous intermediation , which can never judiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostentatious , interests are not only transformed into rights , but become mutually recognized as such . Whatever there is in the world to-day of International Law and of treaty obligations has been gradually brought into being by diplomacy ; and , together , in their aggregate , imperfect as they still are , these results constitute one of the finest and most precious fruits of civilization . " " Oh yes , " said the Representative , " such conferences as those held at The Hague advance the thought of the world by centuries , and even outrun the course of events . Such meetings once in a while may do good , but that is different from keeping it up all the time by having a lot of embassies and legations . " " You seem to think it may be a good thing to be religious on Sundays , but have your doubts about practising religion on week-days , " said the young lawyer , with a snap in his voice that somewhat irritated the Representative . " It seems to me , " said the Judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than register the progress already made in the theory and practice of the governments up to the time when those conferences were held . If it were otherwise , a single one would be as useful as a dozen ; for it could simply decree what was ideally right once and for all . As a matter of fact , however , each conference advances a little on the last , merely because public opinion and diplomatic practice have advanced . I believe the writer His Excellency has quoted is right when he traces the development of international law and treaty obligations to the continuous action of diplomatic intercourse . If that be so , it is of the highest importance that such action be made continuous . To interrupt it would be like cutting off the electric current and still expecting the light . " " Well , " said the Representative , " there may be something in all this of which I had not thought before , and I am very much obliged to the Ambassador for what he has said to us . If he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State as he is in what he has said to us to-night , I imagine he could get about anything we could afford to give him . But , as I have said , my trouble is fundamental . Somehow we in America do not seem to be fitted for diplomacy . A reader of our newspapers would certainly get the idea that it is all a good deal of a farce for us to take part in it . They guy our diplomats about their personal affairs , make scandals about their behavior , set the public mind agog about who will go here and who will go there , or what they will do or not do when they arrive at their posts . This is wearisome . It does not seem to happen in other countries . Will not Your Excellency kindly tell us why that is ? " " The subject is rather a delicate one for a foreigner , and especially a foreign diplomat , to touch , " said the Ambassador , " but I appreciate your interest in it , and I feel sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I frankly state to you my point of view . You will understand that it is purely personal , that my government would never dream of passing any criticism either upon your methods or their results , and would condemn me for doing so . Your question is , why do some annoying circumstances , which the Representative has mentioned , not attend changes in the diplomatic service of the European governments ? " The question is not difficult to answer . Our diplomatic service in Europe is as completely separated from party politics as the army and the navy . There is nothing in any respect casual or extemporized about it , because it is rigidly standardized on the basis of a strictly governmental representation , from which the merely personal element is absolutely eliminated . It is understood that an ambassador , whoever he may be , will live precisely as his government ordains ; that he will do a certain number of previously determined things ; that his personality will be absorbed in his office ; that he will do nothing of , or by , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct is minutely prescribed for him by the foreign office of his government . " " Is n't that bureaucracy ? " asked the clergyman , rather timidly . " Nor exactly , " was the reply . " It resembles the duty of a missionary to observe the ordinances of the church that sends him out and supports him in the performance of his work . The rules and requirements are not arbitrarily laid down by irresponsible persons . They are the result of careful study and deliberation in council by the highest authorities . " " What then does Your Excellency mean by ' standardizing ' a service ? " inquired the Representative " Just what I have described : providing by government action for everything necessary to the service beforehand ; determining in what kind of a house the ambassador shall live , how it shall be furnished , how and by whom it shall be cared for ; what he shall do officially in the way of entertainment : in fact , controlling the whole situation according to well-considered rules and principles . " " That seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " observed the Judge . " I doubt if our American ambassadors would submit to that . " " Of course , you understand , " observed the Count , " that I would not presume to make any suggestions regarding your country or your methods . I am only trying , and very inadequately , to describe what is usual in Europe . You know that our system positively excludes personality , as such , from any representation on its own account . Our diplomats are not permitted to do or claim anything as private persons . They represent the sovereign or the government , speak and act in their names , and claim their privileges accordingly . They are like officers of the army or the navy in their strict subjection to the State . ' " But , " remarked the Representative , " you seem to have a class of persons specially adapted to this kind of service : men of rank and of great wealth , who fit into such positions and can afford to hold them . " " As to rank , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rank except that of a royal prince is equal in Europe to that of an ambassador . Representing the sovereignty of a co-equal nation , he comes before all others in rank , except the members of the royal family . He gives the pas to no one else . " A look of astonishment was on every face . " What ? " said the clergyman , " does he outrank a bishop ? How strange some of our American representatives must feel ! Do they not recoil from this ? " The Count could not repress a hearty laugh , in which all joined . When mental equilibrium was restored , he proceeded : " So far as I have observed , they usually take to it very kindly ; and why should they not ? Do they not represent a sovereign power ? And , even more than that , are they not in your democratic theory themselves sovereigns ? " " But the uniforms , the gold lace , the cocked hats , the swords worn by the great functionaries , and by their own colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? feel strange and out of place ? " The Count smiled , but looked a little embarrassed . " In Europe , " he said , " members of the diplomatic corps wear uniforms partly to indicate their rank , like officers of the army and navy , but chiefly to mark their character as belonging to a particular branch of the public service . It is merely a matter of custom , and there is no invariable rule . Those countries which prefer to give their diplomatic officers more of a civil , and less of an official , character , and to place upon them the stamp of equality , do not prescribe uniforms . With certain European countries they are merely traditional . Originally , as you know , they were designed to signalize the fact that the wearer was a servant of the monarch . Those who are proud of this service are , naturally , proud to wear them . " " You have spoken of titles and dress , Excellency , but what of the means of keeping up the expense of embassies ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic officers of every rank are rarely men of great wealth , and usually contribute nothing to the maintenance of their embassies and legations . In former times monarchs often employed their wealthiest nobles for this service , partly to impress foreign peoples with their wealth and power , and partly to save the drafts on the royal treasury which a splendid representation required . They regarded these wealthy subjects as in some sense their own property , and used them accordingly . But now this is rare . The constitutional States ? and practically all , imitating your American example , have become constitutional ? do not exploit private wealth in that way . It would be contrary to the object they have in view , which is , to show by their missions the friendly feelings and intentions which the governments , as such , have for their neighbors . They wish it understood that it is the government , not an individual , that is represented ; and they therefore build embassy and legation buildings in one another 's capitals , and make liberal provisions for maintaining them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind if a war breaks out ? " asked the Judge . " The fact that such pledges of amity exist is a token that it is not expected that a war will break out . They are so many perpetual reminders of peace and good-will . If war does occur , there is a mutual interest in respecting these properties . When the fighting is over the diplomatists are the people who are to make peace , and the resumption of normal relations is facilitated by the existence of these buildings . The assumption of modern civilization is that war is an anomaly , and should be of the shortest possible duration . The normal relation of civilized nations is one of peace and good-will . " " Can a poor man ? that is , a man with- out a large private fortune rise to the highest position in the diplomatic service of a European nation , and sustain it ? " inquired the young lawyer . " The majority of our heads of missions are not rich men . They do not need to be , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public service . They are generally entitled to pensions at the end of their period of activity , according to their rank , and their widows also , and they not only accept , but frequently need them . " " But the cost of all this . It must be immense , the houses , the maintenance , the pensions . I should think the plain people would rebel , " remarked the Representative . " We do not seem to rebel at our pensions , " remarked the young lawyer . " There is no country in the world , " continued the Count , " whose property in this form would greatly exceed the cost of a single first-class battleship , or whose budget shows a greater net annual expenditure for the entire foreign service than one-half the cost of such a vessel . The best war-vessel ever built is regarded as fit for the scrap-heap after a few years of existence , but the value of all the embassy and legation properties owned by foreign governments in the different European capitals has increased since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does Your Excellency think , " inquired the Judge , " that if more attention were given to diplomacy it would he possible to discontinue military and naval appropriations ?

Wherever a dangerous enemy exists , means of defense are necessary , unless one is willing to he dictated to by a foreign power ; but the kind and amount of armament needed depend entirely upon the extent and distribution of territory to be defended . The power to act effectively often renders action unnecessary . The strong nation that is known to have peaceful intentions is not only safe , but respected . " " Well , Excellency , " said the Representative , " we seem to be somewhat behind the rest of the world in some of these matters . What would you advise us to do ?

Good night , gentlemen . " And , cordially shaking each one present by the hand , the Count withdrew . " He did n't seem disposed to give us any advice . " remarked the Representative . " I think , " said the young lawyer , " he meant to give you all the information he could ; but felt it would be unprofessional to venture upon advice to a legislator of the country to which he is accredited .
