txt While the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce was today considering the Fomerene bill , one of seven measures before Congress providing for Government operation of the coal mines , officials of the Government were sweeping off their feet with patriotic appeals the bituminous and anthracite coal operators of the country assembled in conference to agree to some voluntary pooling of their industry in the interest of the nation . The 400 operators present , representing the great fields of both bituminous and anthracite coal . pledged themselves to sell their product at a fair and reasonable price , to be fixed . with the approval of the National Defense Council 's Coal Committee , by special committees of seven producers from each coal  --  mining State . - - ... , These : ; pecial committees also are authorized to confer with the Defense Council 's committee " to the end that production be stimulated and plans be perfected to provide adequate means of distribution .

Fort of the Federal Trade Commission . and Assistant Attorney General Lewis . all of whom frankly warned the producers that . unless they themselves , established a fair selling price and proper regulation of the industry , their output would be taken over by the Government . Lane 's Stirring Appeal . Secretary of the Interior Lane struck the keynote of the gathering when he declared : " The success of the country in this great war rests on you , and you are responsible . just the same as the soldiers in the trenches , Pershing in France . or the President in the White House . You control the fundamental industry . How much vision have you ? Are you small or big , are you petty politicians or statesmen ? The country will not stand anything but a large policy from large men . " There mast be some new adjustment of the coal industry . When your boy and mine are going to the front is no time for you to leap an advantage . even when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is at stake , and there are greater things than making money . Ts there a man who will say to me , ' You can send your boy to France while 1 " stay here and coin his blood into dollars ? ' To he an American citizen is not merely to make ** but it is to uphold the arm of the man who is making the fight for his country . " The speech of Secretary Lane was followed by one equally vigorous by Commissioner Fort , who dramatically hold up in his hand the seven bills now before Congress aiming at Government operation of the mines . He appealed for patriotic co-operation between the operators and the Government . so that a reasonable profit . could he guaranteed to the operators for a period of five or more years , all discriminations in price could be abolished as between great and small buyers , and the industry could still remain in possession of the mine owners . Warning front Paniels . Secretary of the Navy Daniels warned : he operators that all coal and oil would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and begged them meanwhile .6 give up all selfish policy in meeting : he necessity for joint action to fix a ; eneral price . Van H. Manning of the Bureau of ? lines said to the operators : " You were called here to see whether - ou could help the Committee on Coal Production to stop if possi ? le the enactneat of the legislation proposed in Concress , such as has been mentioned here . want to nominate F. S. Peabody . the Thairman of that committee , to be the Joover of the coal situation . Hoover s to handle , the food problem ; let Peatody handle the coal problem . " Throughout the meeting , from the noment. ' that Secretary Lane made It lear that the country demanded coperation from.the coal producers , there vas evident enthusiasm for every stig.estion that , the operators themselves ould and should immediately merge heir interests and so serve the country ml at the same time protect themselves rora Government intervention . All hought of opposition seemed to have ' anished . Judgv H. B. Lindsay of Znoxville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It appears that an operation is bout to be performed ; it seems to me lat , we should ourselves put the patient a proper state of mind for that opertion . ? Fifty cents  --  a ton was suggested by - Governor Fort as a possible rate of refit to be fixed by agreement of the peratois with the agreement . to cover long period . The.total price was to ( elude all items of cost of production , eluding liberal estimates for labor , Dwd er , supplies of all kinds , office ex ? nse. freight , &c.; Mr. Fort said : " : Mott-have- not been making anything for ten years past ; 50 cents a ton is fc-ur Hines what most of you hate been making as n profit . " This sentiment was loudly applauded . Tile tided . Secretary Lane , in opening his address , after a reference to the success of the Red Cross fund and the Liberty Loan . and after declaring that the responsibility to " do big things in a big way like big men " rests upon those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply . said : Back 17p Root , Says Lane . " I do not believe that the coal industry can continue on the basis of profit which you had before the war . I want to see the industry stabilized . T want to see . your profits large . I believe in rewarding a man according to his enterprise , his daring , his imagination . But the time of national peril , the time of war , when all that we have is needed for the defense of liberty . Is no time for the making of great profits . When 1he nation 's life is at stake there are greater things than the making of money . If that- vision gets into your minds we can make this a short war ? for we can quickly mobilize this nation . " Elihu Root is in Russia , and the other day he spoke to an assemblage of 5.000 Russian peasants and workingmen . These men seventy-five years ago were in slavery . They have come up through that crust , seeking the light of freedom . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fighting for you ; we want you to fight for us . ' " What shall we say to Mr. Root ? is there a man here who would send him the message : ' 1 am staying here to make money ; let the others fight ; I am going *0 get the highest possible price for " If you have the foresight to prove to the working people of this country that you are not seeking unusual profits in this wet- , that this is a war in which advantage is not to be taken by you , there will be no question of the pa triotic response they will make . All will sacrifice on the altar of democracy . " Parcel Post as nn Example . When the applause at this appeal had ceased . Mr. Lane told of the failure of the railroad managers , some years ago , to meet the Interstate Commerce Commission half way in lowering the express rates on small packages . They were warned , in vain , that a parcel post and a legal reduction of express rates would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision . " said the Secretary . " They could not look into the minds of mankind . They were not statesmen . It is for you to show yourselves statesmen of Industry  --  to think for tomorrow rather than for today . And what sort of tomorrow will it be ? in honor , in opportunity . in freedom and security for us all ? if German autocracy is not defeated " If you do not see that the people of the United States are dissatisfied with the price of coal ? if you do not realize that the burden of readjustment rests upon you , and upon the railroads which should deliver the cars to you , then you are not statesmen . The man who works in the mine is patriotic . He will work as long hours as you . if the principles of faith underlying this hour of national crisis are understood . This thing must be done by faith , by faith that man is fitted for democracy and that democracy must triumph . To be an American citizen today is not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to live tip to the demands of the democratic ideal , and to sacrifice for it . " At Arlington , he said , lie the dead who fought for the preservation of the Union . " Make no mistake , he added , " within two years there will be a greater graveyard than that of Arlington along this coast . " He cited Washington , the richest business man in the South of that day , as having staked not merely his life and honor , but his fortune , in the fight for liberty , and asserted that the Father of His Country challenged by this example the business man of today . ? ' The best thing that you can do , " Mr. Lane went on , " is to put in the hands of one of your number or a small committee the authority to fix for you the price on coal , with a Government agency . Let him say to the Government : ' The coal mines of the United States are at your disposal . Let me operate them ; let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I will show that I can be No Anti-Trust Prosecution . The Secretary closed amid tumultuous cheering . Then Governor Fort presented the Federal Trade Commission 's attitude toward price-fixing , saying that it would make no attempt to prosecute the operators for combining to fix prices , so long as those prices were agreed upon with a Government agency . lie suggested that either the commission or Peabody 's Coal Production Committee might be that agency . " Government operation of the coal industry , " lie declared . " is perfectly certain to happen . if you do not do something very soon . Congress is considering one of the hills on that subject now . You can avoid It by being prompt and fair , and the Government will be more than fair ? it will be generous . Fifty cents a ton profit is four times what most of you have been making . " Both at the operators ' meeting and before the Senate Committee the solution of the greater production problem was declared to be more railroad cars . Car shortage was blamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators will be continued tomorrow . One of the things to be considered is a motion declaring " that it is the sense of this meeting that they earnestly request . every operator in the United States to join a coal operators ' association of his State . and in such State where there is no association to take immediate steps to organize one . so that reliable and accurate information regarding the coal industry ? can he furnished the ? Government whenever called for . " Representatives of each coal-producing State held meetings tonight to choose committees in accordance with the resolutions adopted , and will report tomorrow , 311nes Worked Eight Hours n Day . At the Senate committee hearing C. M. Moderwell , a Chicago ' coal operator , said fear of prosecution under the Sherman law prevented the operators from agreeing among themselves to bring down the price of coal . Chairman Newlands expressed the opinion that the Attorney General would not construe the Sherman law in that way . " I think if the Attorney General would tell us that the law would not be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly , " Mr. Moderwell replied . Ho added that the coal situation was In part caused by the feet that the mines operated only eight hours a day , while a majority of industries were in operation twenty-four hours a day . Capacity of the mines is about 40 per cent . more than present production , but he doubted if they would he able to reach maximum production for lack of railroad transportation . " What is the average Increase in the price of the coal to the consumer ? " asked Senator Pomereno . " It has been very large , " he replied . " I would say that it has been from 75 to 100 per cent. , but that is only an estimate . " How do you justify the increase ? " " Coal operators are Just as human as anybody else , and they have taken advantage of the conditions and the people . " Mr. Moderwell said that during the last fifteen years operators between the Alleghenies and the Rocky Mountains had not made more of a profit than 1 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 00 ; now , while the demand for coal is good , they are trying to recoup some of the losses of the previous years . Mr. Moderwell said that for years the railroads had bought coal at prices less than actual cost , making it necessary for operators to make up their loss from the small consumers . Miners Object to Government Control. , James Lewis of Springfield , Ill. , representing the United Mine Workers of America , said the miners ' union did not believe the time had come for the Government to take control of the coal industry . He said the miners believed questions of wages and working conditions could be st be worked out by representatives of the miners and operators , rather than through the Government arbitrarily fixing wages and other conditions . He declared as a coal miner he would seriously object to power being given to the Coal Production Committee to fix prices , wages , and conditions , because the members had not an intimate knowledge of the industry . " The transportation trouble is the biggest problem confronting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless to talk patriotism to the miners when they ' are compelled to remain idle owing to lack of cars to carry the coal they produce . " Barry N. Taylor of Kansas City , representing coal operators in Iowa , Missouri , Kansas . Arkansas , and Wyoming , said that abnormal prices prevailed only in the sections of Pennsylvania supplying New England , Central Ohio , and West Virginia . He did not think the time had come for fixing prices , as no unwillingness had been shown by the operators to co-operate with the Government . In discussing the profits which operators should make on coal , Senator Cummins pointed out that the Government regulated railroad rates . " Yes , and if the Government had permitted the railroads to make more money some years ago , so they could have . invested in more equipment , everybody would have plenty of coal and the present situation would not exist , " , replied Mr. Taylor .
