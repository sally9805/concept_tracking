txt // child would have been lost . Can you estimate , Pessimo , the depth of sorrow and the loss to society that this one incident reveals ? Mr. P. I 'm not convinced that . vaccination and the injection of poisons , are necessary and legitimate . You claim too much for them . Mr. 0 . That opinion is due to your prejudice and lack of knowledge . Let me cite you a few examples of the deadly ravages of smallpox . In 1721 an epidemic swept through Boston and afflicted fifty per cent of the population , thousands of whom died . In Iceland , a few years later , eighteen thousand people out of a total of fifty thousand died of smallpox . Up to a few years ago most of the people in Europe and Asia expected to have this disease some time during their lives . The Chinese in particular believed the evil to be inevitable . In order to have the malady at a convenient time , they learned how to induce the disease by inserting a pox scab in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination , and it would have been quite effective had they learned to select the vaccine from the lighter cases of the disease . Since Dr. Edward Jenner discovered the process of vaccination , in 1796 , millions of lives have been saved and the dread of the disease has almost disappeared . If strict rules of quarantine were observed , and hygienic and sanitary laws practised , smallpox might be banished from the earth . Mr. P. Optime , your name should be Credulity . Mr. 0 . During the Spanish-American War , as you claim , typhoid was more fatal to our soldiers than the THE DEATH OF DISEASE 1 U L bullets of the Spaniards . Since then a vaccine for the disease has been discovered and its use has practically abolished typhoid from the army . In the great world war in Europe the soldiers are almost free from this malady , owing to the protection given them through vaccination . What can you say , Pessimo , in face of such facts as these ? Mr. P. The claims you make are exaggerated . Disease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw so many yellow flags with the word measles inscribed across them that they nearly made me seasick . Mr. 0 . If they had given you the jaundice it would have been more appropriate . Two reasons explain the rapid spread of measles when it appears . One is the unfortunate fact that no serum or vaccine has been discovered to counteract its infection , and the second is that it is so exceptionally contagious that even hygienic care and surroundings seem helpless in its presence . Scarlet fever is in the same category ? it has not yet yielded the secret of its undoing . Some day , however , the method of control for both these maladies will be discovered , and they will be swept into oblivion and remembered only as disturbing dreams . Mr. P. You dream too much , Optime ; soon you will be seeing visions . Mr. 0 . " Without vision the people perish . " The trouble is , Pessimo , that people are too negligent and ignorant respecting the spread of disease . A couple of years ago typhoid fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and business of the town . No one had sense enough to investigate the source of contamination , ? hick could have been due only to the water or milk supply . An appeal for help brought . a health officer , who soon discovered that a sheep-herder afflicted with the di , ease had made his camp on the small stream that supplied the village with water . Twenty-three deaths and a financial loss of several hundred thousand dollars was the price this little community paid for its negligence and ignorance . They might have secured the services of an expert in the beginning and saved the trouble and expense . Mr. P. Yes , but doctors are so high-priced and selfish that the poor can hardly afford their services . They thrive on sickness and disease , and it is to their advantage to have these ills flourish . So long as we have doctors there will be sickness ; otherwise these leeches of society would " perish from off the earth . " Mr. 0 . Now , Pessimo , you are illogical and heartless ! Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany the practice of medicine . The medical profession as a rule is as benevolent and just as society will permit ; hundreds of its members have lost their lives in the service of humanity . If communities and the public in general were willing to co-operate in matters of health conservation , a reliable doctor could be employed for each village or suitable group of people , with the understanding that his sole duty would be to promote the health and to keep his particular group free from disease . Doctors generally would be glad to serve the public under such condiTIIE // tions , and they would be willing to have their compensation based largely on their ability to promote and protect the health of their patients . Mr. P. That would be an ideal condition , indeed ; but I have never known doctors who were philanthropic , or who would risk their lives to promote the welfare of society . They coin their money from the sufferings of humanity and like vultures flourish best in the midst of disease and pestilence . Mr. 0 . Nonsense ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Walter Reed and the army surgeons who delivered the death-blow to yellow fever ? One of the experimenters lost his life and all of them risked their lives in their efforts to discover the cause of this deadly scourge . Their investigations revealed the fact that a certain variety of mosquito is the carrier of the disease germs , and that insanitary surroundings are favorable to the disease becoming epidemic . As a result of the application of this knowledge this fatal malady has almost disappeared . As an example , in the city of Havana , according to statistics covering several hundred years , the death-rate from yellow fever alone averaged about five hundred annually . Since the city was cleaned up and made sanitary and the breeding places of mosquitoes destroyed scarcely a case of yellow fever has been found . Do you know , Pessimo , that the French failed to build the Panama Canal because of the fearful deathrate due to fever and malaria ? Dr. Gorgas , of the United States army , cleaned up the canal zone and // made it the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canal , and won for scientific achievement in the United States the profound respect and gratitude of the civilized world . Mr. P. These are isolated cases . I still believe that in remote times people were more healthful than they are to-day . Mr. O. Listen , then , to the testimony of history . You have heard of the bubonic plague , or black death . The historian Meeker calculated that in the fourteenth century this scourge , which originated in China , swept over Europe and destroyed twenty-five million people ? one-fourth of the total population . In England at the same time two-thirds of the people were stricken with death . Since then during every century the plague reappeared several times and claimed millions of victims . In 1664 ? 5 occurred the Great Plague in London , the horrors of which were marvellously described by Defoe . Not until the cause of the disease was discovered , near the middle of the nineteenth century , was there any respite from the terrible malady . Previous to this time the cause of the plague was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One favorite explanation regarded it as a punishment imposed by Divine Providence for the sins of the people . Another declared it was due to the machinations of the evil one . It remained for patient scientists to discover that the true cause is a micro-organism called the bacillus pestis , which first develops in rats and later infects human beings through the bite of the ratflea . Hence the simple rule : to prevent bubonic // plague , exterminate the rats . What do you think , Pessimo , of this triumph of science over disease ? Mr. P. I do n't know . I 'm really too ill to argue with you . ( Coughing . ) Mr. O. Poor old neighbor ! I have imposed upon you shamefully . Come along with me and we 'll find a doctor to chase the microbes out of your system . Soon you 'll be your own sweet , melancholy self again . CHAPTER . XV THE PASSING OF THE LOG CABIN Mr. Pessimo . Have you noticed , Optime , how reluctant young people are to assume the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before settling down to the business of life ? Why , when you and I got married we were happy if we had a straw bed in the corner of the cabin ; we did n't expect more comforts than our parents possessed 1 Mr. Optime . Yes , I admit there is such a tendency . Mr. P. And I suppose from the well of your boundless hope you can draw comfort even for this menace of the age ! Mr. 0 . The tendency is not necessarily destructive . It is due to many factors which when carefully examined will prevent unfavorable conclusions from being drawn . To my way of thinking the desire of young people for something better than their parents enjoyed is , on the whole , praiseworthy and in harmony with the natural progress of the times . Mr. P. You seem to agree with the fatalistic doctrine of the poet Pope , whose favorite maxim was : " Whatever is , is right . " I do believe that if mother nature should become indignant and sweep her children off the earth into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a barren rock singing with a lusty voice : 107 // " Count your many blessings , Name them one by one , And it will surprise you What the Lord hat ii done . " Mr. 0 . It is better to be cheerful than to meet trouble half-way . There are sufficient reasons why marriage is not entered into so quickly and reckkssly as it was when we were young men , and why more comforts arc now demanded than we could possibly expect . The present is a transitional stage in our history . It is charged with the tremendous task of bridging the period between the old authoritative , patriarchal type of family life and the modern free , democratic home . The disturbances you mention are incident to the changed conditions involved in this transition . We must discover the nature of the changes before we pass judgment . Mr. P. True enough ! But , while you hug the delusion that all is well , these disturbances are undermining the stability of the race and pointing the highroad to destruction ! The tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extract from the present all the ease and pleasure possible . A few generations of this practice will soften the moral fibre of the race and bring it to the condition of Imperial Rome , which fell prey to its own frivolity and degeneracy . Mr. 0 . Your conclusion is premature . You must give these transitional forces time to adjust themselves . Mr. P. There 's little use arguing with a foolish opTHE // timist who refuses to see evil when it completely surrounds him and for whom crime and degeneracy do not exist ! Mr. 0 . You ought to step into the sunlight and enjoy the warmth of heaven a little bit , instead of groping forever in darkness . So long as the heart of humanity beats true , we need fear no temporary epidemic . Mr. P. Oh , come down to earth and listen to some sobering facts . Statistics show that the number of children per family in the log-cabin epoch of New England averaged seven . Now , in the palace-mansion stage of her history , the number is only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the size of the family is noted . Ignorant foreigners and negroes are fast becoming the chief progenitors of the race . Mr. 0 . You overdraw the picture . Already the conscience of the nation is aroused to the danger of lowering the birth-rate and there is some evidence that the tendency is being checked . The good sense of the nation may be relied upon to counteract any evil that might otherwise result in disaster . Besides , in the past swarms of children were sometimes brought into the world by parents who neither sensed the responsibility nor were able to furnish the means and opportunities to train and educate their offspring . Multitudes of infants have died because of improper care and nurture end the want of healthful surroundings . Usually the mother was slave to the household , and her wishes in the matter of bearing children were never consulted . With the enlarged // freedom now accorded women , a breathing-spell is permitted , in which such vital questions as the following are being considered : What constitutes the true relationship of the sexes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as quantity ? Under adverse conditions , the bringing of a host of children into the world to suffer and die young , or to become paupers or criminals , is a positive crime ! Mr. P. You do not believe , then , in large families ? Mr. 0 . Assuredly I do , if quality is considered as well as quantity . Mr. P. And you do not desire a return to the simple , stable family relationship of the past ? Mr. 0 . Not at all ! And for two very good reasons . First , because it is impossible . The wheels of time move forward , never backward . There are no reversegears in the machinery of time . An event once past is gone forever . And , second , because we prefer the present , with its boundless hope and faith to anything the past could possibly offer . Mr. P. But listen to me ! When we were young men marriage was entered into early . It mattered little whether or not we had a roof over our heads . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . We were happy when a log house was raised for us near the homestead , and if in the course of time numerous children came to bless the union , all shared in the comforts and hardships of the entire family community . The latch-string hung outside for the ready touch of the stranger , and we were happy to share with a hungry neighbor the last grain of // hominy and slice of bacon . Pride , frivolity , and the itching for worldly prestige were far removed from our lives . Honestly , Optime , I hope and pray for the return of the log cabin and the simple life ! It gave to our country its heroes and its statesmen ? the immortal Lincoln came from such a home ! Mr. 0 . Your longing is in vain . The past is past ! No use to read into it the hopes and aspirations of the present while we refuse to remember the heartaches it carried . The truth is , Pessimo , that great souls come out of all conditions of life . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no particular environment that breeds the gifted men of the race . Washington was a product of the aristocracy of Virginia ; Edison burst forth from the chrysalis of mean surroundings ; and Woodrow Wilson was reared in an atmosphere of culture and refinement . Now and then a heroic soul struggles successfully with adverse surroundings and shines forth like a star of the first magnitude ; but for one such countless thousands fail in the effort , and fall into outer darkness and are forgotten . The years that have passed over our heads , Pessimo , should have left with us this touch of wisdom : given similar hereditary endowments , the larger the opportunities and educational advantages are the greater the number of people will be whose worth counts for something in the world . 1 Mr. P. Your argument neglects the fact that a complex life with its wider opportunities invites increased wickedness and crime . An extra-keen selfconsciousness tends to cut away all restraints and to // make selfishness the rule of action . This explains why license to-day has largely replaced the sway of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parenthood . Mr. 0 . Your exaggerations add to the difficulty of our controversy . It is true , of course , that a sudden bestowal of freedom sends the pendulum of effort swinging to the extreme , but the sudden jolt received tends to slow down the action and to produce a rational equilibrium . If given a reasonable length of time , enlarged opportunity will surely justify itself . Mr. P. You have not yet justified the passing of the log cabin and the simple life . Mr. 0 . When people lived in dugouts , the dugout was the fashion , and they were content so long as nothing better was offered ; but when the log cabin came into being the dugout was despised , and it was a disgrace to live underground . And so when the frame house appeared the log cabin was abandoned , and this in turn gave way to the brick cottage . Now a bungalow or a flat is the fashion , and woe to him who ignores the social imperative ! Have you heard the proverb : " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Yes , but it is not true , unless " to be a Roman is greater than a king . " It may be disgraceful to keep in step with the mob . When the tendency is wrong our duty is to be in conflict with the trend of events . It is mere arrogance and vanity that animate the youth of to-day ; they feel superior to their parents and demand everything fine and costly , but are unwilling to pay the price . It is a shame that the log // cabin is doomed ; no bungalow , modern flat , or apartment-house can ever take its place ! Mr. 0 . Come , now ; how do you justify that ? Mr. P. In a small village in the southern part of our State , remote from railroad or city , reposes a little two-roomed log cabin . It attracts the attention of the passer-by because of its neat appearance and beautiful surroundings . Vines cover much of the dwelling , and flowers and trees surround it . Everything about the place is sweet and clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving hearts . A nicely kept gravel walk leads from the gate to the door , and under some of the trees are rustic seats and a hammock . A strong desire is awakened in the traveller to enter this restful place to sit iii the shade and cool himself from the heat of the day . Within the cabin is an aged couple , watching the play of their grandchildren . Affection shines from the faces of these good people . They have reared successfully their own children , who in turn have gone forth to fulfil their duties to society ; and now in the evening of their lives they smile in contentment as they listen to the prattle and laughter of their children 's children . In this home is neither arrogance nor vanity ; jealousy has never entered here , and mad ambition has never made it a centre of storm and stress . While the dear souls have had a hard struggle then have never lacked the necessities of life ; tears have alternated with smiles , and sorrow with happiness , but through it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an abiding faith in their fellow men , and a profound reverA PRACTICAL SOCIOLOGY e for Deity . Heaven smiles on such homes as these . ; ouches me to the quick , Optime , to think that these nes are vanishing . What will the future be if they re passed away forever ? Mr. 0 . I salute such a home ! I had no idea , Peso , you could feel so intensely ! But do n't you ) w , 01 ( 1 neighbor , that " one might as well be dead ; o be out of nt.yle " ? And , much as we may regret ' lie log cabin , with its glow of fantasy and fable , is sing into the dim shadows of the night . or every ideal home such as you describe there are ozen miserable hovels that disgrace the face of na . Squalling , half-clad children infest these cheerabodes , and nagging , shiftless parents make them it lodging-places. , s a homestead in a new country the log cabin is in irony with its environment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates poverty and failure He , and too often it is the breeding-place of disease degeneracy . Mt , tell me ! What kind of homes do the parents these grandchildren occupy ? fr . P. One lives in a modern bungalow , the other neat brick cottage . Ir . 0 . Just as I imagined ! The strength of the on comes from modern , comfortable homes , inited by average , well-to-do people . Neither povnor riches count for much in the rearing of the Ire citizens of a democracy . CHAPTER XVI THE DECAY OF THE MANSION Mr. Pessimo . Do you know , Optime , that people who live in mansions are selfish ? Mr. Optime . What have you in mind ? Mr. P. I have observed that dwellers in mansions are more unsociable and self-centred than common people , and they are disposed to ignore responsibility for the future . Mr. 0 . You have the eyes of a lynx , Pessimo . What have you seen wrong with these people ? Mr. P. For one thing , they have fewer children than poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdened with children . Mr. 0 . This tendency is not so common or serious as you imagine . Mr. P. Do n't you think it is serious where intelligent people who can afford large families shirk the responsibility ? Is n't it a fatal tendency when mansions multiply and children disappear ? Mr. 0 . Mansions are not multiplying ; on the contrary , they are decreasing . They , not our children , are likely to disappear . Mr. P. How do you make that out ? Mr. 0 . In the first place , the democratic conscience is opposed to the mansion idea . Americans are not apt at aping the aristocracy of Europe . Besides , there 116 // is no place for the palace in our busy life . It does not fit in with our ideas nor harmonize with our environment . In the second place , it does n't suit our convenience . The trouble and expense of maintaining a mansion are too great for an ease-loving American . To have a mansion on his hands is to be fully employed , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. P. There are more aristocratic buildings in our country than you think , and more people copying European customs than you suppose . Mr. 0 . No , Pessimo , proof to the contrary is at hand . In this city of the Lake , where we sit and argue , a dozen pretentious dwellings were built a couple of generations ago . Do you know of a single mansion erected during the last decade ? Mr. P. Let me see ? the K. residence , perhaps , on First South ? Mr. 0 . No , that is n't in the mansion class . Mr. P. I ca n't recall any other just now . Mr. 0 . For the good reason that there is n't any . Suppose we discover how these old-time mansions are faring ? What use is made of the J. residence , near the depot ? Mr. P. It is used , I believe , as a sort of hospital for the cure of alcoholics . Mr. 0 . What is the status of the C. mansion , on South Temple ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember rightly . Mr. 0 . What of the elegant Mc. residence , on First North ? // Mr. P. It is vacant and carries the sign " For Sale . " Mr. 0 . And the A. palace , opposite the Beehive . Have you noticed any change in its condition ? Mr. P. It is to be torn down , I hear , to make room for a garage . Mr. 0 . Yes , Pcssimo ; these examples illustrate the common sense of the American . He would n't know what to do with a mansion if presented with one ; but if it were a department store , or a coal-mine , he 'd feel perfectly at ease . Are you acquainted with the magnificent mansion in the junction city north of us , built by a descendant of an old Virginian family ? Mr. P. Yes , I know it well . Mr. 0 . It was erected for the high purpose of keeping the children together , and providing for them and their descendants a happy dwelling-place for generations to come . Mr. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequel : none of the married children made it his home . Before the grim reaper gathered into his sheaf this planter of the family tree , the children had all fled from its protecting shadows . They did not take kindly to the mansion idea , or to the patriarchal type of family organization . Yet the children to-day are respected and successful citizens in the communities where they reside . It was a pathetic day for the old ones when the fledglings flew the nest . But tell me for what the noble building is used . Mr. P. I 'm ashamed to say that it is now used as a rooming-house. // Mr. 0 . And so , Pessimo , the mansion is hastening to decay . This seems to indicate that the current of American life is running strong and true , and that any aristocratic notion that attempts to stem the tide is doomed to suffer shipwreck . Mr. P. Yes , but this decay is due entirely to economic conditions , not to any moral uplift in our lives . There are still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typify the evils of which I complain . Mr. 0 . You arc dodging the issue , Pessimo . What do you mean ? Mr. P. On a prominent corner in the fashionable district of our city stands an elegant residence . It is imposing in appearance and its surroundings harmonize with its magnificence . Within is a well-groomed gentleman who has a flourishing business down-town , and his wife , who is the society leader of the social group in her set . She dresses elegantly , and is queenly and imperious in demeanor . Servants perform the work in this dwelling . Neither master nor wife ever soil their hands by labor ; and there i re no children in the household . Children would hamper the freedom of this couple , whose great ambition is to shine among their fellows , and to outdo them in elegance and display . Shame upon the inmates of this edifice ! They do not possess a home ; it is but a temporary abiding-place where they may put up overnight ; a place to endure when nothing more interesting offers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A PRACTICAL SOCIOLOGY patible and live in harmony during the infrequent moments which they spend together , though they may be proud of each other , and in ninny respects high-minded people who refrain from social vices or other excesses ? since they avoid fulfilling the chief function of the family ? the rearing of children they have failed in the first essential of life . Their dwelling-place is not a home , and it ought not to receive that honorable title . Now , Optime , under such conditions what hope is there for the ideal democratic home of which you dream ? Mr. 0 . Let me paint you the opposite picture . Near your own residence is another beautiful dwelling , situated on a corner overlooking the city . The site and the building lend themselves to the aristocratic idea which you have described , but instead a real American family makes it their home . There are eight children in the household and no servants . Each child has learned to share in the work that must be done . The boys can sweep and scrub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and each of the girls can ride a horse , crank an automobile , or drive a mowing-machine on her father 's summer ranch . There are two automobiles in the family , but these have n't corrupted the hearts of the children . Besides training up the children in the way they should go , the parents have time to share in the social and religious activities of the community . The children , except the youngest , have organized an orchestra , which is led by the mother . This is a constant source of entertainment both for the family and their neighbors. // There is no pomp or show in this household ; their lives are as simple and wholesome as those of the pioneers from whom they sprang . Never a meal is partaken of without first invoking a blessing upon it from the Giver of all gifts , and no one in this family is ashamed to pray . So long , Pessimo , as homes like this are plentiful , there is no danger of the decay of American ideals or institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such homes are increasing ? On the contrary , it seems to me that , while elegant homes are multiplying , children are decreasing , and our democratic ideals are hastening to decay . Mr. 0 . The exact facts are difficult to obtain . Statistics are silent in this matter . This , however , is certain ; the mansion idea with its pomp and pride is passing out of our lives , just as the log cabin has disappeared . Its place is being taken by more simple , sensible , and convenient habitations that harmonize with our scientific demands and our democratic ideals . The question of the childless dwelling is , I belie , working toward its solution . I can not believe that a vigorous nation with lofty ideals and a Christian conscience will countenance inhuman and destructive practices . At least this fact is patent : the selfish egoists who refuse to assume responsibility for the future , through consciously preventing the birth of children , are inviting the suicide of their hopes and are robbing themselves of the most certain form of immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds down the corridors of time , and no heavenly choir shall // sing their praises . The recording angel would blush to write their names in the book of life . They are lost in the abyss of nothingness , and are as though they never were . The energy consumed iii their fashioning must be charged to the loss account of creation . CHAPTER XVII THE APPEAL OF THE APARTMENT Mr. Pessimo . Have you considered , Optime , the menace of the apartment-house to the future of our national life ? Mr. Optime . Yes , it has given me much concern . Mr. P. It 's one of the gravest dangers threatening our existence ! In every city in the land there 's a mad rush for apartment-houses . Young married people no longer have the courage and patience to struggle for homes of their own . They are like the cowbird , which never builds a nest of its own , but is content to appropriate the nest of the house-finch . Any biped that 's too trifling to feather a nest of his own should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. Go on , Pessimo ; I like the sound of your voice this morning . Mr. P. Statistics point that in 1800 the proportion of people living in cities of ten thousand or over was four per cent , but the last census shows that the number in such cities has increased to thirty-seven per cent . If this ratio continues for a few more generations , the rural districts will be wildernesses and the cities seething centres of parasites preying upon one another . Mr. O. Now , neighbor , do n't you think you 're exaggerating a tiny bit ? 123 // Mr. P. There 's no need of it ? the facts are sufficiently execrable ! It seems to me the whole world is surging into tenements and apartments , and preparing to breed degeneracy and decay I Did you ever hear of a strong , fertile race developing from the spawn of a congested city ? Mr. 0 . You overwhelm me with your eloquence . Mr. P. When private dwellings disappear and cottages are unknown I wonder what sort of human rats the city slums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such calm assurance is in itself a crime , Pessimo . Do you know the natural punishment of a croaker ? Mr. P. No , I never heard of it . Mr. 0 . The croaker who eternally croaks is doomed to be a croaker . Mr. P. Oh , that 's funny , is n't it ! Mr. 0 . Come , then , let us consider the question soberly . I am inclined to believe that a hopeful side may be found if we look closely . Mr. P. Hopeful ! You must have a monstrous sweet tooth , Optime . I wonder if you know the taste of quinine ! Mr. 0 . Truly enough , the tendency of the times is toward comfort and happiness ? mankind has always sought this ideal . Why should he endure pain and hardship unless the outcome brings added satisfaction ? Do you think that the rush to city life will continue after the movement results in hunger and poverty ? Mr. P. Explain yourself . Mr. 0 . In a free country the swing of human enTHE // deavor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkers believe that calamity is certain a counter-swing sends the energy spinning in an opposite direction and so averts the catastrophe . A temporary equilibrium is thus established from which further ventures may be made ? some will be right , others wrong . We must rely on the intelligence and common sense of our nation to choose generally the right . Have n't you faith in a free people 's ability to avert fatality ? Mr. P. I 've stated the facts ; let them speak . Mr. 0 . Facts must be seen in their proper relationship ; an isolated event has no significance . Any fact or set of circumstances must be interpreted in relation to the whole situation ; otherwise wrong conclusions will be drawn . Time is fraught with such rapid changes in this fast age that reason itself is in a whirl and is utterly unable to interpret events before their significance has passed . Neither scientist nor priest is able , therefore , to predict the future . In such times as this an abiding faith in the " process of the ages " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding star to point us toward a brighter day . Things tend eventually to adjust themselves . Mr. P. It 's a fast age , I admit . Mr. 0 . Well ? Mr. P. You ought to be a minister , Optime . Mr. 0 . Why so ? Mr. P. When earthly considerations confound you you could fly away into heaven . Mr. 0 . The danger is remote , Pessimo . Let us // discover if we can the cause of this scamper to the city and the desire to coop up in apartments . What is the chief motive , do you suppose ? Mr. P. The desire for ease and comfort , to have a good time , and to avoid responsibility . Mr. O. Or , to state it somewhat differently , the desire , often quite unconscious , to satisfy as many of the wants of life as possible with the least expenditure of time and money . Mr. P. You speak like a philosopher . You are probably right . Mr. 0 . Economic conditions , then , are responsible chiefly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society to see to it that residences are made as comfortable as apartments . If cottages had as many conveniences as apartments they would be preferred to the latter . Mr. P. How do you make that out ? Mr. 0 . Married couples are like birds ? they have an instinct to nest alone . Free light , heat , hot water , gas , and electricity , however , are wonderfully persuasive ; and if , in addition , the equipment reduces the housework to a minimum , the lure of the apartment becomes irresistible . Mr. P. That 's a fine defense , but it is hardly convincing . What is the wife to do with her spare time ? Mr. 0 . She may employ it in the better rearing of her children and for her own advancement . Mr. P. But she probably wo n't have any children . Mr. 0 . Then she may accompany her husband to his labor , or conduct a business of her own . // Mr. P. That 's all very well , but the trouble is there is lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. 0 . There 's nothing immoral in obliterating the drudgery of housekeeping ; it 's no crime to desire conveniences . Mr. P. True , but when along with this love of ease there is a shirking of responsibility for the future ? a conscious effort to curtail or prevent the birth of children ? then what have you to say ? Mr. 0 . You have touched the heart of the problem , Pessimo . Go to it . Mr. P. The whole trend of the apartment idea is to discourage the birth of children and to make childless marriages the fashion . Recently a prominent stranger with his wife and three children came to this city and sought in vain for accommodations among the better apartment-houses ; none were to be had because of his children . The father met with so many rebuffs that he began to wonder whether or not he ought to be ashamed to have any children ; he had been oldfashioned enough heretofore to regard children as his most precious possessions . One proprietor after another made him this reply : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and our patrons prefer not to be disturbed by them . " I have you at last , Optime . You must admit that apartments are multiplying , and , so far as they are concerned , children are already extinct ! Mr. 0 . Pour out the vials of your wrath ; I 'm with you for once . // Mr. P. Think how impressionable young people are . They adopt extreme styles without the least compunction . Neither moral precept nor religious imperative stands the ghost of a show when pitted against the latest fashion . Is n't it a downright crime for intelligent people to attempt to make childless marriages the fashion ' ? Mr. O. Your anger is justifiable . The public conscience must be aroused to the gravity of this danger and counteracting tendencies must be set in motion . It may be possible that national legislation should be invoked to check the evil . I have faith in the good sense and the strength of the American conscience to correct this abuse . Mr. P. You 're good at apologizing , Optime , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is impending for this nation if apartments become fashionable and childless marriages the rule . CHAPTER XVIII THE PULL OF THE INTELLECT Mr. Pessimo . I 'm convinced , Optime , that much of our trouble in life is due to the pull of the intellect . Not only is intelligence so arrogant and swollen that it threatens to submerge consciousness , but it has so magnified our wants beyond the power of realization that we feel much like a starving man in the presence of food just beyond his grasp . Mr. Optime . I see nothing wrong with the intellect . Mr. P. Is n't it a serious matter for the knowing phase of mind to pull so far ahead of the rest of our nature that it opens a gap in consciousness ? All the elements of mind should work in harmony ; otherwise judgment becomes distorted and conduct erratic . If our intellectual wants are out of all proportion to other aspects of life , demoralization is certain to ensue . Mr. 0 . The development of intellect is our chief pride , Pessimo . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth shall make you free " ? And undoubtedly you have heard that " The glory of God is intelligence . " Mr. P. Yes , but that means intelligence guided by moral will and enriched by the religious conscience . It never contemplated a mind made greedy only for intellectual conquests. 129 // Mr. 0 . Would you condemn the intellect for being strong on the sole ground that other elements are weak ? Mr. P. Not at all . But we must remember that for centuries the intellect has been developed at the expense of other phases of life , and the result is not only a distorted notion of values but also an exaggerated desire for intellectual wants . To see a desired good without being able to grasp it is an aggravation . Mr. 0 . I see the drift of your thought . You hold that the multiplying of wants through increased intelligence is detrimental to our civilization . Mr. P. That 's my meaning . Mr. 0 . Your philosophy is playing you false . Without the increase of wants there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ; they constitute the essential quartet ? food , shelter , warmth , and love . But his wants are ever increasing . If he were content to dwell in a cave his thoughts and deeds would never rise above the savagery of the stone age . Man must be stung by the wasp of desire or his capacity for action soon runs down . Mr. P. That would keep him forever discontented and prevent his settling down to the enjoyment of happiness . Are n't you always prating about the right of man to the joys of life ? Mr. 0 . Have you ever read of the philosopher who remarked : " If truth were a bird and I held it in my hand , I would let it fly again just for the joy of pursuing it " ? Mr. P. I 've never heard of him . Mr. 0 . Well , he was a wise man , the kind you should // pattern after . It 's the constant striving for the things we have not that keeps the wheels of progress going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude to happiness ? Mr. P. I doubt it . Look where it leaves most of us ? floundering in the mud without hope of paradise ! The miraculous development of intelligence as seen in science and invention has mightily disturbed the fountains of life . The bubbles of our hope rise and burst before us only to be replaced by others which promise us the glory of heaven ! But we dream and dream , and the realization never comes true ! What is the use , Optime , of seeing before us the golden apple of content if we are refused forever the taste of it ? Mr. 0 . Why , you charming old Pessimo ! Your sentiments are so delightful that I can forgive your contradictions . Do n't you know that the joy of a beautiful dream is the dream itself ? Its realization might carry with it a hidden pain-point . So it is the too rapid development of science and invention that is giving you the heartache ? Mr. P. See how they have changed every condition of life ! The wildest dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the memory of a single individual the electric light , electric car , telephone , talking-machine , moving picture , wireless , automobile , and flying-machine have sprung into existence . Besides these a hundred labor-saving machines and devices have come to disturb the dreams of labor . The head of a large family is driven to distraction when the // time arrives for balancing accounts . The whole world is turned upside down and sanity of judgment is reduced to chaos . now can poor , puny man adjust himself to such mighty miracles ? Mr. 0 . Though we can not adjust ourselves to these marvels , the very knowledge of them should add to the zest of life . Mr. P. Not so ! They increase our torment . Think how they impose upon our emotions ! They strike the harp of life with such violence that every string of feeling is set vibrating . If length of life is to be measured in heart-throbs , then man now Iives a year in a day , and a single lifetime embraces more than the whole of recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Optime ; it disturbs me greatly to be so upset . Mr. 0 . Some day an earthquake will happen ; then how shall you feel ? The things of which you complain are the most glorious achievements of the ages . What matters it if we can not adjust ourselves all at once to these miracles ? Time has a long time to run . Mr. P. You make me feel like the great fish that swallowed Jonah . You persist in stuffing me with foolish arguments . Mr. 0 . No , Pessimo , I 'm in earnest . A multiplicity of wants , economic , intellectual , and sentimental , form the very basis of national advancement . So long as discontent remains normal and refrains from anarchy or crime , it is well for the race that its desires are many and that some of them are always unattainable . Mr. P. But tell me , is it well to multiply human wants a hundredfold while the capacity to satisfy them // remains the same ? Think of the disappointments that follow . Man craves more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his slender purse prevents the indulgence . He longs for the lamp of Aladdin to transform his shanty into a bungalow and his cart into an automobile , but the miracle refuses to work . No wonder he resents routine and the slow process which success requires ! He has to crawl when he longs to fly ; he must sweat money into his purse when he would fill it with the transmuted metal of the alchemist ! Surely he is right to be disgusted with the times . IIe 's justified in yearning for the simple life where desire and reality are twins who remain satisfied only in each other 's presence . Mr. 0 . Maladjustments will be righted and inequalities smoothed down , but I doubt that the world will ever be in complete harmony . Struggles will go on , ideals will be striven for , and the unattainable desired . Human endeavor will swing first in one direction , then in another , and throughout it all progress will be made ; but while the good old earth will become a happier dwelling-place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the pot of gold , on the crest of the rainbow , an ideal to be pursued but never attained . CHAPTER XIX THE DRAG OF MORALITY Mr. Pessimo . Do n't you think , Optime , that the chief danger threatening our national welfare is the drag of our moral conscience ? Mr. Optime . I thought you contended yesterday that the trouble is occasioned by the pull of the intellect ? Mr. P. That 's an evil sufficient unto itself ; but this is as a mountain compared with a mole-hill . Mr. O. Make yourself clear . Mr. P. Morality is a lazy jade . Her fettered feet have trudged so slowly down the calendar of time that she has but just now reached the abode of the caveman . To our shame , be it said , human conduct is on a par with the ethics of the savage ! Mr. 0 . You 've had another bad night , Pessimo . Conduct is not so evil as you think . Mr. P. Nearly all thinkers agree that the moral conscience is retarded . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality has bidden away like a planet in eclipse . All our conquests are achievements of the intellect ; morality has had no victories . Since the time of Christ there has been no renaissance of the moral life , but during this period knowledge has been reborn many times . And so intelligence and conduct are separated by generations of time ; they ought to travel together hand in hand . 135 // Mr. 0 . You astonish me , Pessimo . It 's impossible that intelligence could go so far without carrying morality some distance with it . Consciousness works as a unit , and one phase can not be active without affecting all the others . Any factor , of course , may be so exercised that it develops out of proportion to the others ; but there 's a limit to the inequality . The interdependence of mental factors prevents demoralization . Mr. P. Then you do not hold with such writers as Alfred Russel Wallace , who declares that our moral natures have made scarcely perceptible progress during the last five thousand years ? Mr. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our moral instincts are slow to change , it is true , but so are the social and religious instincts . Even our intellectual nature has been tardy in its response to stimulation . It 's only within the last century that the intellect has shone forth with a new lustre , and to-day there are thousands of people who never think . Mr. P. What are you driving at ? Mr. 0 . Simply this : it 's inconceivable that growth of common sense , increased knowledge , and keen judgment would not affect favorably the moral conscience . The factors of the mind are not shut in compartments isolated from one another . All are associated and , as we have said , a modification of one influences all the others . Mr. P. You seem to agree with the old-time fallacy of the philosopher who held that knowledge is virtue . // Mr. 0 . Not as Socrates meant . He had a hazy notion of the working of the mind , and assumed that since knowledge of the right led him to do right , knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not fully aware of the fickleness of human nature . He did not appreciate the moving power of motive in influencing conduct , nor did he understand that passion may sometimes sweep reason from its throne . Mr. P. Flow did you become so intimate with Socrates ? Mr. 0 . Never mind . Do you recall the syllogism in which he expressed his belief ? 1 . All men desire that which is good and would get it if they could . 2 . Knowledge would enable them to attain the good . 3 . Hence knowledge is goodness or virtue . Mr. P. That 's a silly thing , not a syllogism . Did n't he know that many criminals are intensely intellectual , and that it takes a smart man to be a rogue ? Mr. 0 . You may easily overdo that argument , Pessimo . Most criminals are abnormal and many have diseased intellects . They are smart only in a narrow field . They become cunning and even skilled in the particulars of their peculiar crimes , but their intellects , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see facts in their true relationship . There is nothing about the nature of intellect that smacks of crime or degeneracy . As intelligence becomes perfected we may discover that knowledge approaches closely to virtue . // Mr. P. It is knowledge , I suppose , that makes the Germans so virtuous in the present war ? Mr. 0 . Now , Pessinio , you 're like a boy on the 4th of July setting oil ' firecrackers . You think to blow up my argument . Mr. P. Well , I believe I 've lit the fuse . Mr. 0 . Come , be sensible . We can not help admiring German efficiency . Her application of science and invention compels our admiration . Had she displayed the same intelligence in dealing with external matters as she has in solving her internal problems , to-day she might be the most respected and powerful of nations . Mr. P. So you 're a defender of Germany ? Mr. 0 . Not by any means ! I am merely trying to do her justice . But let me ask : Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare that an international treaty is " a mere scrap of paper " ? Was it a display of intellect that guided her foreign policy , dictated her ruthless submarine piracy , and ordered the dropping of bombs on helpless women and chil-dren ? Mr. P. What else was it ? Mr. 0 . It was a total lack of judgment and of moral righteousness ! She had no idea that the world was so far advanced in matters of justice and sympathy that her conduct would be resented . She did not believe , for example , that any kind of insult or injury could force the United States into war . She misjudged even the capacity of the Oriental mind for primitive feelings of decency and fair play . No , Pes-4 // simo , it 's a lack of foresight and intelligence that has wrecked German honor and virtue . Mr. P. How do you account for her attitude ? Mr. 0 . A wrong philosophy put a twist in her intellect and a kink in her moral nature . Her leading thinkers teach that there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual conscience . The greatest virtue of the state is power , and the strength to enforce its will . No consideration whatsoever must bar the progress of the state . Hence Germany owes her dishonor to an utter lack of conscience in the state . Mr. P. But she has succeeded thus far . Mr. 0 . Yes , in arousing the enmity of the world and driving three-quarters of the people of the earth to take up arms against her . Tell me , Pessimo : should there be a divorce between the conscience of the individual and that of the state ? Mr. P. No , I think not . Mr. 0 . Do you know what the chief bond is that holds society together ? Mr. P. I 've never thought of it in that way . Mr. 0 . It is good faith . Individuals must keep faith with one another ; they must pay their debts and fulfil their obligations . Laws were instituted to enforce this purpose . Nations likewise must live in good faith with one another . In all their intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . Secret treaties and intrigues have resulted in disaster and destruction . They have no place in the diplomacy of nations . Broken words and treaties have always // let loose the horrors of rapine and bloodshed . Hereafter the world will see to it that intelligence and the principle of justice shall characterize the relationship of nations . Mr. P. You 're dreaming again , Optime . There is not sufficient righteousness on the earth to permit the realization of such fantastic ideals . Mr. 0 . You lack faith , Pessimo . Have you read President Wilson 's message to Congress ? Mr. P. I glanced at the headlines . Mr. 0 . Read that message and digest it . It will satisfy your doubts and remove the miasma from your mind . So far as America is concerned she drops forever the drag on the moral conscience and unites intelligence with " generosity and justice . " In the following extracts see if you can detect the deep breathing of the race and hear the voice of a new prophet calling unto righteousness : " You catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . They grow daily more audible , more articulate , more persuasive , and they come from the hearts of men , everywhere . They insist that the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind , that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished because the irresponsible rulers of a single country have themselves done deep and abominable wrong . . . . We shall be free to base peace on generosity and justice , to the exclusion of all claims to advantage even on the part of the victors . . . . " A supreme moment of history has come . The eyes of the people have been opened and they see . The hand of God is laid upon the nations . He will // show them favor , I devoutly believe , only if they rise to the clear heights of his own justice and mercy . " PERSONAL MORALITY VS . THE SOCIAL CONSCIENCE Mr. Pessimo . In spite of your mighty defense of the moral conscience yesterday , I 'm still of the opinn that much of our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Optime . You 're like a sinner , Pessimo , who o n't stay converted . What is disturbing you now ? Mr. P. There 's certainly a wide chasm between . rsonal conduct and the behavior of society . Individual morality is bad enough , but I 'm led to wonder hether society has any conscience at all . Mr. O. Do n't you believe that a majority of people sire to be moral and that they have a more or less finite standard to guide their conduct ? Mr. P. I doubt that a majority are moral . It 's a ue saying , it seems to me , that people are honest hen it pays them to be good . Mr. O. I 'm sure it pays to be honest ; but I 'm usually certain that when the average citizen performs moral act he has no thought of reward . It 's quite e fashion nowadays to behave decently . Mr. P. You 're bubbling over again , Optime . Is ere no way to dam your flow of confidence ? Mr. O. If it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // President Hadley corroborates this view when he says in substance that the typical American citizen , in private , bears an excellent character . He is courteous to the weak , respectful to the strong , and unselfish in the exercise of his power . He does not use brute strength to elbow his way through a crowd of women and children , nor does he employ cunning to overreach his neighbors . In great emergencies , like fire , flood , or railway accident , he freely risks his life to save his fellow men . This heroism in a crisis " is but a manifestation of the ordinary intentions and ideals of our American men and women , which they are showing in thousands of little acts of daily self-sacrifice of which we never hear . " Mr. P. You probably overlooked the expression " in private , " which you quoted . Had you gone a little farther you would have read the following : " With our public morals the case is different . In business and politics we have to record another story . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will nevertheless go to all lengths to hurt a weaker competitor for money or for office . A man who in private life would despise snobbishness and servility of every kind will , in business or politics , cringe to the stronger power for the sake of his own personal advantage . The instinct to serve others which we feel in our private relations gives place to serve ourselves in commercial or political ones . " How does that please you , Optime ? Does n't it tickle your fancy to know that the same hero whom you fondly believe might rise to the supreme heights // of self-sacrifice is capable in his dealing with society of falling to the lowest depths of deceit ? Mr. 0 . The comparison is startling . It reveals the fact that there is a distinct ion between the personal and the social conscience , but I believe you exaggerate the difference . Have n't you observed that the leaders in politics and industry who are the chief offenders socially are good people generally in their private lives ? M'r . P. I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same men probably are kind to their families , true to their friends , and quick to return an obligation to a neighbor . Mr. P. Yet such men , as Hadley declares , might not hesitate to tell a lie in politics or in business . How do you account for this contradiction ? Mr. 0 . Private morality is comparatively definite and organized , while public morality , or the social conscience , as we like to term it , is obscure and unorganized . Mr. P. I doubt that a social conscience really exists . Mr. 0 . You 're always doubting ! Note the difficulties in the way . Individual morality is concrete ; it deals with neighbors whom we see and with things that we can touch . Social morality , on the other hand , is usually abstract ; it deals with matters that are remote , and processes that are hidden . Private selfishness is easily seen and quickly punished , but selfishness in business is hard to discover and slow to be punished . Mr. P. That 's perfectly clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 // private obligations are as old as life itself , and deal with situations that are relatively fixed . On the contrary , our social duties have to do with a world that has been entirely remade during the last century . Industrial , commercial , and political systems are so new and strange that the social conscience is barely acquainted with them . No wonder that it has been unable to adjust itself to the new situations that have arisen . Mr. P. If we had sufficient good laws they would take care of our public interests , and we should n't need this mythical social conscience to force men in public life to be good . Mr. 0 . I 'm glad you said that . It 's a virtual surrender on your part . Do n't you know that law , especially if it deals with a moral question , is of no avail unless the public conscience is behind it ? A law is never valid or sacred unless the great majority of people see its wisdom and practise it without coercion . I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing when driving mules . How do you suppose it worked ? Mr. P. I once drove a span . I 'd rather not answer . Mr. 0 . In our State we have a law which provides in substance that weeds shall not be allowed to grow along public highways or private fences . Do you suppose this law prevents the weeds from growing ? Mr. P. Well , it ought to help free the country of weeds . Mr. 0 . Not unless public sentiment is behind it and its necessity is seen . No , Pessimo , if laws could // make us good , we should soon be angels . Think how lonesome I 'd be if you should fly away and leave me ! Mr. P. Well , you would n't need any wings the way you 're going . What are la s for if not to make people good , and to get things done that would otherwise be left undone ? Mr. 0 . Legislation must define public opinion rather than anticipate it . When the latter is attempted law usually becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of this joy variety . Mr. P. Do n't get ridiculous , Optime ! Mr. 0 . I was never more earnest in my life . Think of our legislature passing five hundred laws during one session ! What a capacious stomach the public would need to swallow so much nostrum ! What we need to-day is not so much law as more knowledge . The light of intelligence must illuminate the dark places of our economic and social life . Labor troubles must be studied , industrial problems considered , and social evils investigated . As a result , a clear-cut definition of social aims and duties may be obtained , following which laws may be enacted which will be respected and observed . The final solution , however , of all problems centring in social relationship is a highly socialized conscience . This can be brought about through a systematic publicity campaign along all lines of public interest . Do n't you recall how our slow-moving Congress was aroused to action in war legislation through an appeal to the country made by the President ? Graft was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 . Every one regarded it as a matter of course ? an inevitable accompaniment of popular government . But the slogan " a square deal " was echoed from one end of the country to another until at length it took possession of the social conscience , and now honesty in public officials is demanded and obtained . Education and publicity are the safeguards of a democracy . Mr. P. That 's practically a new doctrine to me , but it must not be pushed too far or it will result in a contempt for law . I 've always held that authority and law controlled everything . Mr. 0 . That 's because you have a medieval mind . What a fine thing it would be , Pessimo , if you could take the advice of the good Book and be born again ! Mr. P. If I could , I 'd come at a better time in the world 's history . Mr. 0 . Public opinion governs more in a free country than does the opinion expressed in creed or statutebook ; hence moral ideals must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In school the boy is controlled more by the public opinion of his fellows than by the rule of the teacher . The professional man obeys the code set up by his associates ; he would yield his life , and even his chance of eternal salvation , rather than forfeit the good opinion of his colleagues ! Once let public sentiment be clear and definite concerning any certain point and a man will enforce it against himself just as he does against others . Coffin declares : " We have already had enough experience to know that when the public conscience is // once aroused vested sin in any form whatever can not stand . " The bridging of the chasm between private and public morality rests , therefore , in publicity and the establishment of a highly socialized conscience . CHAPTER XXI THE RELIGIOUS IMPERATIVE Mr. Optime . It is my opinion , Pessimo , that mankind is more religious to-day than ever before . Mr. Pessimo . You astonish me . Neither the evidence of our senses nor the weight of authority bears out your belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary . There was never a time when irreligion flourished as it sloes to-day . Mr. O. But you Neill agree that there is a spirit of faith in man and an impelling desire for truth which are seeking forever to realize themselves . Surely this constant striving , together with the accumulation of spiritual values through the ages , must affect favorably the religious sentiments of the race . Mr. P. There is no evidence that mankind has profited by this accumulation of race experience . Mr. O. We have seen , however , that increased intelligence , as typified by the scientific spirit , has lifted man to a higher plane of existence . It would be strange indeed if the religious sentiments have not shared in the enlightenment . Mr. P. No necessary relationship exists between the two . Religion rests upon conversion and faith and a feeling of dependence upon a supreme Power in the universe . It seems to me that intensified knowledge may often block the way to spiritual experiences . 149 // It is certainly not a fact that the most intelligent people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pessimo , to defend this proposition ? The more ignorant men are the more susceptible they are to religious influences . Mr. P. Not without time for deliberation . Mr. 0 . Let its examine the question of faith a moment . You will agree , I am sure , that faith , like emotion , must have some object , or idea about which it gathers . We can not have faith in nothing . To be of value faith must have something of worth as its object ? something for the sake of which faith is precious . As in emotion the nature of the object usually determines the strength of the sentiment , so in faith , the more clearly defined the idea is or the greater its content in experience , the larger the possibilities for faith will it have . But it is the intellect which determines primarily the nature and importance of ideas in the mind ; hence intelligence determines the nature of the object of faith and is thus intimately related to its development . Mr. P. You are too philosophic for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little elementary psychology . My purpose is to prove to you that faith , like any other sentiment or attribute of the mind , can not be isolated from other elements of experience . The simplest mental fact respecting anything consists in feeling it , knowing it , and reacting toward it . We speak of these commonly as ( 1 ) feeling , or emotion , ( 2 ) knowing , or intellect , and ( 3 ) volition , or will . All three phases must be present in any mental experience // whatsoever . We know because we feel , we feel because we act , and so on round the circle . Faith is most closely related to the emotional phase of mind , but , like any other sentiment , it can not escape relationship to other phases of experience . It is evident , therefore , that faith must be invested with emotion in order to give it the feeling of hope and exaltation ; its object must be played upon by the intellect in order that it may be well defined and worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in an effort to translate its worth into service . But you are a Bible student , Pessimo . What is your idea of faith ? Mr. P. It is defined as " the substance ( assurance ) of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen . " Mr. 0 . Do n't you see that the definition embraces the intellectual factor ? Knowledge of law and a wide experience surely give an assurance of things , and form a background for evidence that satisfies the soul . Faith can not fly far unless winged by intelligence . Mr. P. Your theory sounds plausible , but the facts are that faith makes its home with the meek and the poor in spirit and refuses to enter the abode of the rich and the well-born . Mr. 0 . She enters wherever she is invited . Other things being equal , intelligence will welcome her more readily than ignorance . Mr. P. I doubt it . Mr. 0 . When man 's imperfect knowledge conceived the earth to be the centre of everything , and the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , // what chance had faith to believe in infinity ? How could the Creator be regarded as a Divine Personality whose intelligence permeates an orderly universe ? Mr. P. The answer is not evident . Mr. 0 . It 's an obtuse mind that seeks to isolate faith from the rest of experience . One might as well attempt to divorce faith and works . This ought to be sufficient proof that an enrichment of the values of life affects favorably the religious sentiments . Mr. P. The evidence is not clear . Religion seems to be asleep . Mr. 0 . You have sought for it in wrong places . Social writers from Spencer to Cooley point out that " religion is a need of human nature " arising out of the " craving to make life seem rational and good . " Man can not help being religious even if he would . No savage is so wild that he is not led to express himself in some form of worship , and no man so civilized that he can free himself from the religious imperative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance of spiritual values has accumulated . How could mankind help being influenced by these values ? Mr. P. But Coe , in The Spiritual Life , holds that there is an evident decay of the spirit of revival among people , that whole classes of the population ale withdrawing from the church , which is now attended largely by women . He claims that " organized religion has been powerless to suppress or seriously check organized vice and injustice . " When authorities disagree , Optime , who is to be the judge ? Mr. 0 . Coe 's contention may be admitted without // weakening our thesis . That religious revivals are not attended , and the average church not popular , may be an indication of religious sanity . It reveals the " widely felt need of reorganizing religious institutions , both in their spirit and methods , to conform to and express the democratic temper . " It is significant that the greatest critics of the church are within the church itself . They are dissatisfied with the fact that social vices and injustice flourish in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are demanding a spiritual awakening which shall embrace less subjection to the dead past and more regard for the living present ? a religion , in brief , that shall make alive the ideals of service , duty , patriotism , and social righteousness . Mr. P. You misinterpret the tendency . To my mind it indicates that a sort of dry-rot has fastened itself upon the churches , and that the microbes of degeneracy and decay are at work . Mr. 0 . Pessimo ! They 'll never admit you through the pearly gate . Mr. P. Why so ? Mr. 0 . Because your perversity would clog the machinery of heaven ! The facts arc that science and democracy are remaking our social institutions and religion can not escape the influence . And , as one writer remarks : " Religion must undergo reconstruction or perish . " But she is immortal and can not die ; hence she must be reborn . Mr. P. Then I was right about the degeneracy and decay ? // Mr. 0 . In the sense only that decay is a prelude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlook for the future of religion is most promising . Ames declares : " The rising , expanding life of the present era is gradually attaining a consciousness of social ideals and values that is genuinely religious . " It means breadth of sympathy , interaction of individuals , and co-operation of personal wills . It teaches that " most of the crime and misfortune of society is not due to conscious malicious intent , but to habits and environment which can be corrected only by modifying the conditions which lie beneath them . " Hence religion must adopt the new method which seeks to understand and remove causes instead of relying for aid so much as it has in the past on authority and the fear of punishment . Mr. P. I doubt that a great religion can thrive unless based upon absolute authority and complete subjection to divine power , even though at times the intellect may not be converted . Mr. 0 . That is an autocratic idea of religion in keeping with the " Gott mit uns " theory of the German Kaiser . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seemed to regard their tribal deity , Yahweh , as their exclusive God and themselves as his chosen people . According to this view , Yahweh cared nothing for the fate of other people , but guarded jealously his own . He required unquestioned obedience and punished every violation of his will . During the many wars which ensued he was the captain of hosts that led them in battle , and his was the right arm which wreaked vengeance on their foes . // Mr. P. Do you condemn this form of religion ? Mr. 0 . Most assuredly ! When transplanted " body and spirit " into the modern democratic world it becomes sacrilege . During a brief period , before experiences function in a child , it may be necessary for the will of the parent to impose itself and to compel even by force the observance of right habits of conduct . Otherwise disaster might result . The same is true with respect to the dealings of the Creator with a people in the childhood of their development . But this attitude of fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience develop , to mutual understanding and sympathy , which naturally terminate in reverence and love . Mr. P. Your words fly away with you , Optime . You have not shown how religion can survive except under the dominion of a strong centralized power . Mr. 0 . Be patient a moment . Contrast the later religious ideals of the Hebrews with the earlier ideas mentioned . In order to bring conduct into harmony with the higher conception of life , due largely to the accumulation of experience , the later prophets demanded of Israel that she reform her moral life in conformity with this higher standard . Morality is then applied to people outside of Israel , justice and mercy are emphasized as universal principles , and the tribal deity , Yahweh , becomes the God of all mankind , dealing with all in justice and requiring rightness of heart and life as the condition of his favor . In our own time we observe signs that point to still higher religious conceptions . They seem to be due // largely to the democratic spirit which has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from the view that emphasizes Deity as an imperial sovereignty to one that glorifies his fatherhood , and the other relates to the intimate relationship of all men to each other . The two are combined in this universal concept : " The fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men . " Mr. P. These high conceptions , however , do not seem to affect religion favorably . On the contrary , apostasy and spiritual bankruptcy appear to be epidemic . Mr. 0 . Social writers take the opposite view . Ames tells us that religion is as natural and necessary in a democratic and scientific age as it is in a monarchical era . Bryce declares that in America Christianity influences conduct more than in any other modern country , and far more than it did in the so-called ages of faith . Mr. P. But , in spite of all they say , the churches are empty . Mr. 0 . Yes , and there is a reason for it . Many spiritually minded people do not attend churches which continue to draw their ideas of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of princely favors which are bestowed upon men through grace and free gifts . " Do you not believe , Pessimo , that the principles of an enduring religion must spring from the hearts of men as well as from the mind of the Creator ? Mr. P. Why do you ask ? // Mr. 0 . Because otherwise there could be no mutual understanding and harmony . The relationship of father and children demands this sympathetic attitude . Children do right because it is right as well as pleasing to their father . He asks that his desires be carried out , not as arbitrary commands , but because they are wholesome and necessary to the welfare of all concerned . Children should be led to understand and sympathize with the laws they are to obey , and if possible participate in framing them . This would insure perfect understanding and harmony , and would result in co-operative effort and ready obedience . In most churches , Pessimo , the blessings they have to bestow are too far removed from the people . Rewards are held at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sacred gifts ; and usually so much red tape and mystery are required to secure them that simple men with democratic spirits turn elsewhere for comfort and inspiration . Mr. P. You hold , then , that religion does not descend full-winged from heaven as a gracious gift to erring men . Mr. 0 . I think not . How could it be understood ? It is more easy to believe that the inspirations of Divinity are met half-way by the rising aspirations of men , and that religion is the result of the mutual understanding that ensues . A religion which meets fully the needs of a great , democratic people ought to rest upon as intimate a relationship between Divinity and humanity as that which exists between the father and the other members of the family . // Moreover , a vital religion must be capable of growth and change . It may be likened to a living organism which is continually developing and throwing off waste matter . To the growth of this organism men should be expected forever to contribute the most fertile products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Optime , you picture a religion that would be so simple and natural as scarcely to deserve notice . It would never attract men ; they prefer the solemn , the sacred , and the mysterious . I doubt that men would , even if they could , participate in religion to the extent you suggest , and if they did what a common , every-day affair it would become ! Mr. 0 . You have answered the question , Pessimo , as to why the churches are empty . They are in a state of somnambulism , and are walking in the night of a past age . They dream of power , panoply , and display , and the pomp and circumstance of the days of chivalry . They travel the paths of authority and linger long before the shrine of the mysterious . Faith is pursued by them as a miraculous quality , which few can attain , and the kingdom of heaven is regarded as the happy dwelling-place of the elect . Mr. P. They do well to sleep . Optime , I like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are in error ! Unless they retrace their footsteps they are doomed to perish from off the earth . Mr. 0 . Why such foolishness ? Mr. P. Because men have become infidels at heart ! They care nothing for sacred things . They do not THE RELIGIOUS IMPERATIVE I , J revere authority , nor do the majority of them care a whit whether the church keeps or not . Mr. 0 . Now you are speaking through the inspiration of indigestion . I have never talked with any person who is an avowed atheist . Such individuals seem to be increasingly rare . Modern religion desires to be freed from the relics of worn-out creeds , from elaborate ceremonials and rituals , and from the superstitious and mystical . It requires for the most part that authority shall be delegated and not represent the arbitrary type with which , according to the mighty bard , " Men play such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep . " On the other hand , religion should be broad enough to include all of the social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . Above all , it should be based on that intimate , sympathetic , communing relationship between Father and children which was in the mind of Christ when he prayed : " Our Father , which art in heaven . " Mr. P. Optime , it can not be done . Mr. 0 . But it is being done . A sound of the movement of wheels is in the air . The machinery of the churches is in motion . Many churches are reducing the burdens which they have been carrying . Some are even bartering their goods and are exchanging formulas for principles and fiats for freedom of belief . Some churches now believe that they must include only that interpretation of the world which is truest and that adjustment of conduct which will yield to humanity the richest values . Consequently they are // utilizing the scientific spirit to help harmonize and rationalize religious belief and content . Mr. P. I hope you would not disturb religious faith through the introduction of criticism . Mr. 0 . Not for the sake of criticism , but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how else can man clarify his beliefs ? It should not be regarded as strange or menacing to utilize intelligence and scientific insight in our religion . The objection that religion is too sacred for investigation falsely assumes that free inquiry into the facts of the religious life would destroy that life itself . Such fear would be justified only in case religion were an illusion to be dispelled by clear knowledge of its nature and sources . No , indeed , Pessimo ! The scientific spirit is in essence religious ; hence from it religion has nothing to fear . Mr. P. The magic of your words is soothing my fears . I wonder , does any one else dream such dreams ? Mr. 0 . Listen to Everett , in the last paragraph of his Moral Values : " For the future , if religion is to assert its rightful power over serious and thoughtful minds , it must be ready to take up all that the long experience of humanity has won . It must recognize how largely its own nature has been transformed , and it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only by such a temper can religion maintain the sincerity that begets confidence . Further , if religion is deeply to pervade our lives , even the most humble acts by which we seek to create the world of THE RELIGIOUS IMI'IMPERITIVE Have you ever thought , Pessimo , that our great democratic nation ought to adopt a simple creed of religious principles ? Mr. P. I 've never dreamed of such a thing . Mr. 0 . We have seen that the religious spirit is struggling mightily to realize itself . Would it not be a move for righteousness , if it were made possible to train up the twenty million children in our schools in fundamental religious habits and concepts ? Pessimo , the religions imperative is upon us . Do n't you hear its impelling call ? values must be viewed as an expression of the divine order . Thus what morality requires religion reinterprets and inspires with its own quickening spirit . " CHAPTER XXII THE SCHOOL AND SOCIETY Mr. Pessimo . I have n't a very high opinion of school-teachers , Optime ; have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were rather decent folk . What 's on your mind this morning ? Mr. P. Well , in my judgment they are a simpleminded , negative sort of people . I 'm sure they will never set the world on fire . Mr. O. I hope not . Mr. P. No fear of it . It 's a rare thing for teachers to take a decided stand against anything outside the schoolroom . I have never known one of them to have life enough even to do anything desperate . Mr. 0 . I hope they are not so inert and lifeless as you think . Personally , under rare conditions , I have known teachers to commit crimes and misdemeanors much like common people . Mr. P. Yes , but such exceptions are so rare as to be negligible . The worst that I recall just now about a teacher is that once upon a time he secretly smoked a cigar , and when this was found out he was promptly dismissed from service . Two members of the school board smoked their pipes contentedly while passing sentence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drift of your argument . 163 // Mr. P. It is this : society seems to regard teachers much as it does preachers ? they are superangelic personages who ought not to mix up in the gross affairs of life ; teachers should confine themselves to the schoolroom heaven which they have been hired to inhabit . Mr. 0 . Now , Pessimo , are n't you overdoing the matter a trifle ? Mr. P. No , it ca n't be done . Just the other day one of our leading high-school principals lost his position because he expressed publicly his opinion in favor of prohibition . Another principal was officially notified by his board that he must no longer take part in the social affairs of his community . The board objected particularly to his supervising the amusements of the town and " acting as a police officer , " as they termed it , while assisting to conduct public dances . Mr. 0 . I am acquainted with most of the schoolboard members of our State . Not many of them are so narrow as you suggest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure , are broad-minded , progressive citizens . Mr. P. That may be true . I am using merely some incidents that actually occurred to illustrate the views of society in general respecting the duty of teachers . Mr. 0 . Get out of the mist , Pessimo , and state your case clearly . Mr. P. It 's your mind that is in a fog to-day . Ca n't you see that a world of confusion exists concerning the moral and social obligations of the teacher outside of the schoolroom ? Surely you have observed // the deep chasm that separates schoolroom morality from the low standard of conduct observed by society herself . You have objected strenuously heretofore to the double standard of sex morality . Why do n't you protest against the double standard of ethics held by the school and society ? Mr. 0 . I begin to see what you are angling for . Beep on ; you may catch something after a while . Mr. P. Listen to this : society expects the teacher to observe and to develop in his pupils the strictest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxicating liquors or smoke cigarettes . Except in prohibition States , however , society reserves the right to indulge in both of these vices ; and now , while the war is on , she takes the young men fresh from the schools , puts them into the trenches , and invites them to become cigarette fiends . Have I not read somewhere , Optime , " Consistency , thou art a jewel " ? Mr. 0 . The teacher is to be praised for observing and teaching abstinence with respect to these indulgences . If he moved only along the path of least resistance , which consistency too often travels , he would be idle much of his time . In matters of moral reform , Pessimo , the schools must be leaders , not followers . Mr. P. But in the meantime the teacher is held up to ridicule . Too often he is regarded as a goodygoody body and the adolescent youth smiles at him good-naturedly , then turns aside to follow after the man with the big cigar . Mr. 0 . You 've caught something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A PRACTICAL SOCIOLOGY trast is the same . Children in school must be meek and courteous . They must not use bad grammar nor give way to profanity ; but on the street the air is often heavy with corrupt expression and frequently charged with the brimstone of invective . Mr. 0 . You 're making progress . Mr. P. Regarding extravagance and style the story reads the same . The teacher impresses lessons of personal hygiene and economy , and succeeds at times in enticing the children to dress in appropriate clothing and to wear comfortable shoes ; but too often the vain mother steps in , or conscienceless society interferes , and instead of decent clothing flimsy gossamer is wrapped around the girl . She is boosted up on high stilts and sent limping on the way to perdition . Mr. 0 . All honor to the teacher for his heroic stand . Are you aware , Pessimo , that much of a teacher 's work rests on faith ? It is well for him that his reward is not carried home with his text-books . If he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd soon become a plutocrat . In spite of your gloomy forebodings , the good work of the teacher is functioning slowly in the life of society . On every side may be seen the bursting buds and blossoms of seeds that were planted by the teachers of yesterday ; and it is a faithless teacher indeed who can not see in vision the harvest of his planting hanging golden in the sun . Mr. P. Nevertheless , the teacher is to be pitied or despised . I do n't know which . Mr. 0 . Be careful . Your ill nature is asserting itTHE // self . Do n't you observe that society is becoming selfconscious ? At times she blushes crimson with the consciousness of the crimes committed in dealing with her children . Mr. P. With the contradictory demands of society on the one hand , and the unreasonable exactions of parents on the other , I wonder that the teacher has any sweetness left . Do you know , Optime , that I would rather be an angel than a teacher ! Mr. 0 . Ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the imps of Hades giggling for joy ! Mr. P. Oh , be quiet ! You would n't make even a respectable imp . In my opinion , the live teachers are dead , and the active ones have left the profession . Mr. 0 . You 're paradoxical . Who , then , are left ? Mr. P. Only the inert and lifeless . Those who do n't count . Mr. 0 . Now , Pessimo , do n't you remember what you said about consistency and the jewel ? You 'd better come over to the house and get a taste of honeycomb . You need a little sweetening . Why are you so bitter against the teacher ? Mr. P. Because teaching ought to be an honorable profession . It is a full-sized man 's job . Do you know that most of the men with red blood in their veins have quit the profession ? Soon there 'll be no one left but women and sissies . Mr. 0 . So you class women and sissies together . Mr. P. No , indeed ! I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . // Mr. 0 . You 're heartless and ridiculous , Pessimo 1 You do well to except the women from your spurt of ill temper , but you ought also to apologize to the men . Not only do the great majority of women , who are devoting their lives to teaching , deserve the gratitude of society , but the men merit even greater consideration . Most of them are teaching because they love the work and are willing to forego financial advancement for the sake of the profession . Not all people , Pessimo , are actuated by selfish motives . Mr. P. That may be true . But it makes me indignant to discover how everybody puts it over the teacher . We have seen how parents do their bit and society its full allotment . Politicians in particular make merry with the schools . Necessary school legislation is deferred from year to year , and an adequate revenue law is not assured until the millennium . Nor are the teachers themselves blameless . They are patient under chastisement and too ready to turn the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization to better their profession and to improve their own condition than they would think of asking for reserved seats in heaven . Mr. 0 . Your voice rings true again , Pessimo . The honeycomb did its work . The public demands efficiency in practically everything , and knows it must pay the price . Teaching , however , for some reason or other , has escaped this necessity . Schools are taken as a matter of course , and the teachers regarded as old-fashioned people who ought to be satisfied with old-fashioned wages . Do n't THE SCHOOL AND SOCIETY lliO you think , Pessimo , that the teachers should take up a publicity campaign ? Mr. P. For what purpose ? Mr. 0 . To awaken the public to the needs of education . Society must be shown that the scientific spirit is as essential to the schools as it is to the industries , and that the same necessity for experts exists in the one as in the other . It should be shown in detail how stingy society has been in providing an education for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be made clear that " The laborer is worthy of his hire . " It should be proved that in the matter of education , society is not ii- earnest , and has never taken seriously to heart the magnitude of free education in a democracy . Mr. P. I doubt that you can justify this swollen language . Mr. 0 . " All that a man hath will he give for his life . " If the worth of teaching may be estimated in terms of the price paid for it , then it is indeed an unworthy occupation . It ranks lower even than that of the least skilled class in the United States . You may not know that the average annual salary paid teachers in the United States during 1914 , according to the report of the Commissioner of Education , was five hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixty cents . Tell me , Pessimo , by what sort of miracle a teacher can subsist on such a wage . How could a standard family survive on such a pittance ? The Labor Bureau reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities of the United // States must be at least seven hundred and fifty dollars , in order that his family , embracing three children under fourteen years of age , may barely subsist . This estimate was made just before the war ; the income now should be increased about fifty per cent . Teachers ' salaries have scarcely been affected by the war . Show me , Pessimo , what hope there is for teachers to perpetuate their kind ? Mr. P. I told you the condition of the schools was hopeless . Now you agree with me . Mr. 0 . Not for the reason you suppose . I am trying to get at the cause of the trouble ; you merely attacked the teachers . Do you know that there is something which an American is forever pursuing , something he seeks with a fervor that knows no rest and which never acknowledges defeat ? Mr. P. I could n't venture a guess . Mr. 0 . He seeks the truth ! He is never satisfied with the mirage of things ; he must find the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by a child in chasing butterflies . He will not rest until he receives a satisfactory answer to his question . Subterfuge he despises and evasion he avoids even though it promises temporary happiness . He prefers the truth even when it hurts . Teachers have been too modest , Pessimo . They have n't had sufficient faith in the inherent justice and sympathy of the great American heart . Mr. P. Why this eloquence ? Mr. 0 . To find the truth and shout it to the skies . Every teacher should be a John the Baptist calling // sinners to repentance . It should be shown that the same energy used to conquer a harsh environment and to pluck the truth from the heart of nature must be employed to solve our educational problems . Point out the fact that in this boasted age one infant out of seven dies before it is a year old , largely from preventable causes . Show from the commissioner 's report that the average amount of schooling received by the American boy is but five years . Then ask them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat in unison : The child is " the pearl of great price , " the miracle of the ages . Mr. P. What good would this serve ? Mr. 0 . It would direct attention to the vital problem of education . Next to the home , the school is the great civilizing agency . Unfortunately religion sleeps , or concerns herself with medieval problems , and the home is quiescent because of internal troubles . Hence a double duty devolves upon the school . The teacher should seize Gabriel 's trumpet and blow upon it long and loud . This might arouse the public conscience to the gravity of the situation . Mr. P. That would be unique . I think I might venture to smile should I discover a teacher blowing his own horn . Mr. 0 . In thunderous blasts let him proclaim that as a nation we expend two and one-half times as much in the liquor traffic to damn the lives of men as we spend in education to save their souls . Shout forth the fact that tobacco and poisonous drugs are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOCIOLOGY tion of our boys and girls . Let the trumpet blow forth the announcement that we expend more for soft drinks , chewing-gum , and candy than we do for the salvation of our children . If this fails to convert the sinners , then overwhelm them with this blast : in your own community the automobile industry is probably several times more precious , measured in dollars and cents , than is the education of your sons and daughters . If through it all their ears are deaf and their eyes refuse to see , then stop your noise and sit down in quiet converse with this giant youth the public , and through the magic of figures and the sweetness of your eloquence try to convince this great , lubbering adolescent , with the thoughtless mind but prodigal heart , that we are expending as a nation ten times as much for ruinous and frivolous practices as we are for the education of our children . Would the magic work , Pessimo ? Mr. P. I doubt its adequacy . Of course the American people are proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact . They even love their school-teachers , but have never found it out . Mr. 0 . Let the teacher go forth with the zeal of a missionary , confident in the righteousness of his cause . In his vocabulary there should be " no such word as fail . " Supreme faith will win . Never was a just appeal made in vain to the " justice and generosity " of true Americans . The twentieth century is the child 's century . Let this be the motto : " The child and his birthright . " // Mr. P. You paint a rosy picture , Optime . But the millennium has not come . Mr. 0 . The teacher must make his own millennium . His star of hope is in the ascendant . Slowly its light is dispelling the mists which have obscured our vision and the road to progress stands revealed . The teacher is a true American . A generation ago he did his work so well that his pupils who are the men and women of to-day have withstood the supreme test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found wanting . The fiery furnace of war has tested the metal of their patriotism and found it to be pure gold . Thanks to his teaching , the children of to-day are more patriotic even than the adults . The nation in its extremity turns to the teacher and the schools , and , thank God , she does not appeal in vain ! The teacher , Pessimo , is the true patriot . Never more will the nation permit his light to be hidden . CHAPTER XXIII LOW WAGES AND POOR HOMES Mr. Optime . Good morning , Pessimo , I 'm glad to see you ! Since our last argument , I 've received some new light on our controversy . Mr. Pessimo . That 's interesting . I thought there was nothing new under the sun . Mr. 0 . I 've read a book or two since you were here , and thought the matter out , and I 've concluded that a serious economic menace threatens the welfare of our homes ! Mr. P. Well , that is something new ! I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope-box this morning ? Mr. 0 . Sit down . I want a sober talk with you . Mr. P. I thought we agreed that the chief difficulties were due to social vice and to the weakening of our moral and religious standards . Mr. 0 . I do n't recall reaching any agreement . Without minimizing the evils you mention , I believe it may be shown that a satisfactory family life can not exist except on an economic basis . Low wages and poor homes are twin evils that lodge together and refuse to be parted . They thrive on poor food , poor air , and insanitary surroundings . Vice is usually an outgrowth of unfortunate economic conditions , and morality and religion are often helpless in their presence . 175 // Mr. P. Now , Optime , you 're standing on your head . Is n't it the truth , rather , that it 's poor people who live in poor homes ? In a free country , where everybody has an equal chance , why should there be any poor homes except as the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out theory , Pessimo . Freedom is merely a relative term . None of us is actually free , and equality of opportunity is a myth . What sort of freedom has a child born in the slums compared with an infant reared in a modern home ? Mr. P. That 's merely an exception , not the rule . Children in the slums frequently rise above their environment . I hold to the theory that man is the maker of his own destiny . If he has industry and a strong will he can accomplish anything . Mr. 0 . Such as becoming an Edison , I suppose , or a President of the United States . Have you never read the saying that " if wishes were horses , beggars might ride " ? Mr. P. Do not ambition , energy , and will-power count for something ? Mr. 0 . Surely . But ca n't you understand , on the other hand , that thousands of individuals with real ability are like the " flowers that waste their sweetness on the desert air . " They never amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . Mr. P. I 'll grant , of course , that some opportunity must be provided . Mr. 0 . Instead of relying so much as we have on // equality and religion to make us good , and to reform our homes and society generally , would it not be well to help the process through a careful scientific inquiry into the causes of the trouble ? Mr. P. There 's no objection , of course , but what good would it do ? Depraved people love to revel in dirt and vice , like a porker in his mire . Mr. 0 . You 're absolutely incorrigible this morning , Pessimo ! Why should people prefer filth and vice and degeneracy , if something better were offered ? Do n't you believe that insanitary surroundings , with the consequent loss of health and the probable accompaniment of disease have much to do with poverty and crime ? Mr. P. These evils are chiefly the results of crime and degeneracy . Depraved people naturally seek a bad environment , and so tend to foster and perpetuate evil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are much like the old lady in prayermeeting who said : " Yes , I believe in total depravity ; it is such a comfortable doctrine . " Mr. P. Nevertheless , the common opinion of the street is that human depravity is a normal condition . It is backed up by the authority of Holy Writ : " Man is born to trouble , as the sparks fly upward . " Mr. 0 . Trouble and evil , however , are not synonymous . Your contention is contradicted by every scientific investigation made thus far . The conclusion reached is that the average man is moral , and possesses at least a minimum of latent capacity which , when opportunity offers , will develop into achievement . // Mr. P. It is n't opportunity that men Iack , it is disposition . The submerged tenth loves to be inundated . Mr. 0 . Statistics prove the opposite . Dr. Devine , in Misery caul Its Causes , shows that ignorance of all that goes to make up life is the prune cause of poverty ; that crowded conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are largely responsible for immorality and degeneracy . A careful investigation of the principal causes of disability in five thousand dependent families in New York City revealed the fact that overcrowding was the direct cause of forty-four per cent , widowhood of twenty-nine per cent , and chronic physical ailments of twenty-seven per cent . Practically all of the causes were external ? objective , not the fault , but the misfortune of the individual . Mr. P. Now , Optime , is n't it true that intemperance , bad habits , viciousness , and vice are largely responsible for disability ? I can not believe that improved environment would help some people . Mr. 0 . In the five thousand families mentioned only sixteen per cent were intemperate , and fewer than ten per cent had serious defects of character ; hence the maladjustments were due primarily to economic and social causes . Dr. Devine declares that all of the old explanations of the cause of poverty and maladjustment , such as vice , intemperance , criminal tendencies , and depravity , are disproved by scientific investigation . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are shiftless and immoral , because they drink and steal , because they have superfluous children , and because of personal depravity , or whether they are poverty-stricken because of economic pressure ? because our social institutions are at fault ? is answered by the fact that personal depravity is as foreign to the question as is witchcraft or being possessed of devils . The troubles " are economic , social , traditional , measurable , manageable . " Mr. P. If human nature is not in need of regeneration , how then are the evils to be remedied ? Mr. 0 . The problem is one that society is responsible for , and which she must face . The exact facts must be learned first ; these mist be made a part of the social conscience , after which remediable legislation may be undertaken . Unquestionably , when the facts are known , society will stand amazed that such barbarous conditions exist ? little children starving , wives in terror and want , disease epidemic and " sweeping away multitudes as autumn frost sweeps away summer insects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad as you suggest . Mr. 0 . In 1908 the Chicago Board of Education investigated underfeeding in the Chicago school-children . It found that five thousand children that attended were habitually hungry , ten thousand did not have sufficient food , and many more were underfed . Besides , many lacked shoes and clothing , others had no beds to sleep in and had to cuddle together on hard floors . Many of the poorer children lived in damp , // unclean , overcrowded homes that lacked every comfort and sanitary necessity . In many of the damp , ill-smelling basements the only thing regarded cheaper than rent was the life of the child . A large number of children had only bread saturated with water for breakfast . At noon they had bread or bananas , or occasionally the luxury of soup made from bones . Some children were found who subsisted largely by begging for dead fowl from crates or for decayed fruit , and searching for scraps of food in garbage-cans . Mr. P. That 's merely an isolated case . Mr. 0 . Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York City schools . He discovered that from sixty thousand to seventy thousand children go to school hungry and for that reason were unable to do the required work . In every large city in the United States conditions are similar . It reveals a pathetic condition , and proves that many families are receiving wages that are entirely inadequate for bare sustenance . Have you ever gone without food for a day or two , Pessimo , until you knew how it feels to be desperately hungry ? Mr. P. The parents themselves are largely to blame . These conditions are due to the craze people have of rushing to cities . In 1800 only one person in thirty lived in cities of over eight thousand population ; in 1900 one person out of three lived in such cities . The fools bring calamity on their own heads . Why do n't they remain in the country ? Mr. 0 . How you slip away from the argument ! Must I follow you ? The instinct for people to come // together is partly responsible for the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing immoral or criminal in the phenomenon . That New York City is large is inevitable . It has a superb harbor , and its natural geographic location attracts most of the commerce of the country . This causes industries to arise which require innumerable laborers . Then , too , the social and educational advantages , as well as the opportunity for amusements , far surpass those in the country . Is it any wonder that cities flourish under such conditions ? Mr. P. Probably not . But while cities grow men decay . Mr. 0 . Yes , to some extent ; at least until the public conscience is aroused to the actual conditions and remedies are provided . All the evils incident to urban life may be swept away , once the social conscience is aroused to the necessity . Mr. P. Oh , Optime ! Under what star were you born ? Mr. 0 . Coming back to our problem , investigations by the Russell Sage Foundation have determined that what is termed a standard family , which consists of five persons , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained in New York City at a proper standard of physical efficiency on an income less than eight hundred dollars to nixie hundred dollars yearly . In other American cities the amount required is from seven hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars per annum . This means three dollars per day in New York City , and two dollars and fifty cents in smaller // cities . The Bureau of Labor indicates that the wages in American cities generally are not sufficient to enable a man with a wife and three children to maintain a decent standard of living . " Nowhere are such wages paid to common labor . " The entire problem of labor and wages , however , has been revolutionized by the war . Mr. P. Do n't you think , Optime , that the shiftlessness and inefficiency of the common working man are largely responsible for this condition ? Society can not make up for lack of brains nor pay for lack of skill . Mr. 0 . You 're exasperating , Pessimo . We have already argued that matter . Society cheats itself when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . It robs children of their birthright , and undermines the effectiveness of the laborer himself . But it may be shown that the laborer is frequently helpless in the matter of wages . Mr. P. I ca n't see that . He does n't have to work if he does n't want to . Mr. 0 . You forget about the hunger . A man will work rather than see his babies starve . The trouble lies elsewhere . The standard of wages in the United States for unskilled labor is the " single-man " standard , but industry is organized , as it ought to be , on the " married-man " basis . The single-man standard is maintained in the United States largely because of the immense supply of immigrants from low-standard European countries . The number is about a million a year , three-fourths of whom are men . These immigrants accept low wages and live on low standards // without realizing the results of their action . They think in terms of Europe , and accept wages far below the standard needed to maintain family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of foreigners offered their services to a firm in Pittsburg at the rate of one dollar and twenty cents a day . When the superintendent heard it he remarked : " My God , what is the country coming to ? How can a man live on one dollar and twenty cents in Pittsburg ? " The foreman replied : " Give them rye bread and a herring and a mug of beer , and they are all right . " Now , Pessimo , tell me how the laboring mini with a family can survive under such conditions . Mr. P. What remedies are proposed ? Mr. O. Social writers agree generally that the following remedies for low wages and standards should be vigorously applied : Extension of labor-unions . Establishment of minimum-wage laws . Restriction of immigration . Education . Of these remedies the most fundamental is education . Accompanying it , of course , should be publicity for the purpose of arousing the social conscience to the gravity of the situation . The practical good sense and the inherent love of justice of the typical American will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very vitals of democracy . Mr. P. Be careful , Optime , or we 'll be exchanging bungalows . For once you are exaggerating . Economic conditions are not so serious as you imagine . // Mr. 0 . It is true that adjustments are coming rapidly . The present war has upset the relationship of capital and labor , and workmen are now regarded as human beings . I Boil t. that the old antagonism will return . The extension of education is arousing the public conscience , and not only will remedial legislation follow but it will be recognized that an organic relationship exists among the vital elements of industry , as it does in life , and that the welfare of one is dependent absolutely upon the perfect functioning of each of the others . Mr. P. Your voice sounds natural again , Optime . But you must pardon me . I 've remained too long with you this morning . CHAPTER XXIV ' 1 ' 1lE IDEAL HOME Mr. Oplime . Do n't you think , old neighbor , that as a result of our discussion we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal home ? Mr. Pessimo . There is n't such a thing , Optime . Model homes disappeared with the passing of the ideal family relationship , based upon authority and religion . Mr. 0 . Come , be reasonable , Pessimo . I leave for the coast in the morning . Let 's make this interview worth while . It may be the last for many a day . Mr. P. I 'm perfectly willing . Mr. 0 . We agreed , I believe , that authority in a free country must come from within ; it can not be imposed from without . As for religion , did n't we conclude that in a broad sense people are more religious to-day than ever before ? Mr. P. In a broad way , perhaps . " For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat . " " Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life ; and few there be that find it . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. 0 . That passage probably referred to the fact that few pagans of that day accepted the teachings of the Master . You surely do not hold that it is true 186 // fo all time , and that a majority of mankind is doomed to destruction ? Mr. P. I take the Bible as it reads and refuse to accept fantastic interpretations . Mr. 0 . Have you never read in effect that no doctrine is so villainous that proof can not be found in Sacred Writ to give it holy sanction ? Mr. P. The burden of proof is with you , Optime . But I intend to listen this morning . What is an ideal home ? Mr. O. An ideal home Pessimo , is one iii which the family relationship is ideal . ' I'lie external and internal factors are related much the same as the body and spirit are united to form a living soul . It is unfortunate , indeed , that the absence or improper functioning of a single element , may disrupt the harmony of family life . Mr. P. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that all t he elements essential to the home must be present and harmoniously adjusted . The absence or neglect of any one factor may be fatal to the whole , just as a diseased heart or cancer of the stomach may produce death even when all other organs are in perfect condition . Have you never read the striking passage in 1 Corinthians , chapter 12 , verses 12 to 27 ? Mr. P. Yes , I 'm familiar with it . Mr. O. The external factors of a happy home embrace favorable surroundings acid a suitable dwelling . The home should be neither a hovel nor a mansion , but a modern building , suited to the income of the // family and provided with all the conveniences in t e shape of water , light , heat , and equipment that scien.:e makes available and the location of the home possible . Salvation is promised the housewife now that it is possible so to arrange the kitchen and dining-room that the work of preparing meals may be a pleasure instead of a drudgery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the home of our neighbor Jones . He fastened a speedometer to his wife 's ankle , you remember , and found during the day that she trudged over seventeen miles without once leaving the kitchen . He spends most of his time now bragging about the athletic achievements of his wife . Mr. 0 . That 's because his kitchen , like many others , is modelled after a barn ; its chief characteristic is space . If his wife were not an angel with wings to help her along , she would have run herself to death long ago . Mr. P. You never run out of excuses , do you ? Mr. 0 . A model dwelling should be attractive even though it may not be costly . A little paint improves a house ever so much , and it 's a mark of refinement and proof positive that sweet dispositions dwell within when flowers are found blooming about the premises . Mr. P. You 're too idealistic , Optime . Look at the homes in the average town and note the number of unfinished houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers ; but behold instead how weeds and pigs and prickly shrubs lend barbaric splendor to the scene ; then tell me what hope there is for ideal homes l // Mr. 0 . But , thank goodness , there are more people beginning to realize that they are entitled to the best the earth has to offer ; hence they are dissatisfied with the ugly and the inconvenient . There is one town in our State wherein scarcely a house stands unpainted or without a fence surrounding it . Not a weed is permitted to grow on street or sidewalk . Civic pride has made the village clean , sweet-smelling , and attractive . Good people live in this town . They believe in good schools , good roads , and in observing the laws of quarantine . They own their water system and electric power , and believe that water is good for the body . The inhabitants of the town sleep well , their dreams are inspiring , and they have little trouble with their consciences . " Cleanliness is next to godliness . " Mr. P. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Enoch . For every town such as you describe there are a thousand ill-smelling , ramble-shackle villages , where disease and decay run riot . The sole ambition of the dwellers therein may be summed up in the desire to eat , sleep , propagate , and die . Mr. 0 . In the model home the family income must be sufficient , as we have seen , to insure a physical-efficiency standard . This is so vital to the welfare of the home , and therefore to the good of society , that it should be made a matter of national concern . No nation can advance if the standard of its homes is running down . If one-half the money and energy expended to destroy society through the traffic in liquor and injurious drugs were devoted to the improvement of // homes , no family would need to go unhoused or be compelled to listen to the cry of hungry children . Mr. P. You 're almost convincing , Optime . Mr. 0 . The internal elements of the home refer to the spiritual gifts of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence . To these must be added also tire satisfaction and joy that come through the development of the intellect and the cultivation of the moral and aesthetic sentiments . Love especially must preside over the family altar . It is a holy bond that makes husband and wife one , and unites them to their children in perfect sympathy and understanding . Without love there can be no ideal home . Mr. P. You 're not simple enough , I hope , to believe that love is anything more usually than a silly sentiment which is used by soft fools to cheat themselves . Life is a stern reality ; it requires practical common sense , not sentimentality , to succeed . What is more sickly than two sentimental lovers who think they see in each other 's eyes the glory of heaven and sense in each other 's embrace the pleasures of immortality ? Mr. 0 . You must have been crossed in love yourself , Pessimo ; you seem to know all about it . Aside from silly affection , which is not the real emotion , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most unselfish attribute of the soul . All genuine self-sacrifice is based upon it , and it is at the bottom of that fierce resolution that enables a martyr to suffer death for the sake of a principle , or a mother to yield her life for the love of her child . Christ himself was crucified for the love of the world .
