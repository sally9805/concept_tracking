txt In an etfort to ascertain what became of $2 , - 700,000 which apparently vanished , as far as book records are concerned , in the course of financial transactions of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company under its old management , the Interstate Commerce Commission to-day ran up against a stone wall of opposition on the part of the Hillard Company , one of the concerns that had to do with New Haven finances . Witnesses summoned by the commission to produce the books of the - Billard Company and tell of its transactions with the New Haven , declined to answer questions on advice of counsel . At the end of a day devoted to practically useless questioning , the commission 's hearing was adjourned indefinitely . Joseph W. Folk , chief counsel for the commission , announced that he would apply to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a mandamus to compel the unwilling witnesses to produce the books of the Billard Company . It is not likely the investigation will be resumed until after the District Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the witnesses called to give testimony in regard to the Billard Company transactions was first demonstrated when Henry V. Whipple of New Haven , former treasurer of the Billard Company , declined to furnish any information in response to questions from - 0'n Commission 's counsel as to when he severed his connection with - the Hillard Company , or how and when he disposed of - his stock holdings in it . Judge Henry Stoddard of New Haven , counsel for Mr. Whipple , interrupted the testimony to explain the position of his client . " We challenge the right of the Commission , " said Judge Stoddard , " to inquire into the affairs of the Billard Company , and I have advised my clients not to answer questions relating to their personal transactions , or those of the Billard Company . I should like to get this question in such shape that it may be judicially determined as to the powers of the Commission and their extent in this connection . " The Commission 's investigation Is being conducted in accordance with a resolution adopted by the Senate on Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Senator Norris of Nebraska directs the Commission to inquire into the disposition of funds of the New Haven invested in certain corporations , and is intended to supplement the investigation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the operation of the New Haven system and its financial transactions . Contests Congress ' Power . When Judge Stoddard was informed by counsel for the commission that the commission 's authority to make the investigation was derived from a resolution of Congress he challenged the right of Congress to exercise such power . From that time on the counsel for the commission made no headway in the examination of witnesses . All those who were called to testify concerning their connection with the Billard Company or knowledge of its transactions , refused to answer by advice of counsel . It came out in the testimony that the counsel for all the witnesses was Judge Stoddard . Charles S. Mellen , former President of the . New Haven , was present at the hearing under subpoena and expected to testify . At the conclusion of the hearing counsel for the commission announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mellen or J. L. Billard on the stand in view of the absence of General Counsel Robbins of the New Haven and H. M. Kochersperger ; former t Ice President in charge of the New Haven 's finances and accounts . Physicians ' certificates that both men were ill were presented to the commission . Mr. Kochersperger 's physician certified that his patient was in a state of nervous collapse . The proceedings were conducted at the New Willard Hotel before Commissioner McChord of the Interstate Commerce Commission . The commission was represented by Messrs . Folk , Doherty , and Gartner as counsel . Among others present were Walker D. Hines of Boston , general attorney for the present management of the New Haven ; C. J. Rich , general counsel for the Boston er . Maine ; John W. H. Crimm , personal counsel for Mr. Mellen , and Homer S. Cummins , Democratic National Committeeman for Connecticut , counsel for two of the witnesses connected with the Hillard Company . What was called " the Dillard Transaction " was gone into at some length by the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the New Haven system . Acting through its subsidiary , the New England Navigation Company , the New Haven acquired 100,498 shares of Boston &; Maine stock . When the Supreme Court of Massa , chusetts and the Legislature of that ' State took action against New Haven mergers , the railroad decided to dispose of the Boston &; Maine stock held by the Navigation Company . According to the report of the Commission this-stock was marked up from $116 to $125 per Ishare , and in June , 1008 , the Naviga- , tion Company sold all this stock to J. L. Billard at its book value , receiving therefor $11,000,000 in cash and the notes of Billard for $2.743,500 . Subsequently , according to the Commission 's report , the New Haven , desiring to regain possession of the Boston Maine stock , bought it back from iMr . Billard , but paid him $150 per share . In payment the New Haven Company paid Mr. Billard 's note for the $11,000 , - , 000 with interest and commission and the Navigation Company transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $16 , - 12a0,000 with interest of $121,000 , and in addition made a cash payment of about $120,000 . Says Millions Were Given Away . After that time , according to the re , port of the Commission , further transactions involving this Boston and Maryland stock became exceedingly involved , and in its report the Interstate Commerce Commission put in the record " the New Haven Company has given away of the funds of that company to Mr. Billard and his associates or to the stockholders of the Billard Company , whatever that may be , between $2 , Z00,000 and $3,000,000 of the property of the New Haven Company . " What became of this money , why it seemed to have been given away , and what was or is the Billard Company . were the things that the Commission 's counsel set out to ascertain to-day , and met with no success . Efforts on the part of Mr. Gartner for the commission to find out something about the Billard Company were unsuccessful . Mr. Whipple declined to answer all questions . Samuel Hemingway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billard Company , and formerly its treasurer , was as unwilling a witness as Mr. 1Vhipple , and was finally excused after he had refused to answer questions . Attorney Cummings made a statement that Mr. Hemingway was acting under his advice . He declared that the commission had no power to inquire into the affairs of the Billard Company . This was met by a declaration from Mr. Folk , for the commission , that what was being attempted was to show that the Billard Company was the old New Haven Railroad Company acting through dummy Directors . Had Keys to New Haven 's Vaults . Counsel Gartner tried ? to find out througn Mr. Hemingway whether it was true " that the private papers of the Billard Company were kept in the vaults of the New Haven Railroad to which you had a key . " This produced nothing , but later in the day it was - admitted that Billard Company officers had keys to the New Haven 's security vaults , and had taken documents from them . A. S. May of Bridgeport , Treasurer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock of the New England Navigation Company and that one or the other of these companies owned stock in the Boston Railroad Holding Company . Mr. May said he could not give in detail the obligations of the Billard Company held by the New Haven or the New England Navigation Company , but it was true that various financial transactions existed between them . Mr. Hines thereupon announced that the present management of the New Haven would be pleased to furnish any information contained in the company 's books . Mr. May said that since last month all financial relations between the Billard Company and the New Haven and the Navigation Company had ceased . The Navigation Company , he said . held S10. - 400.000 gold notes of the Billard Company , presumably guaranteed by the New Haven , which were exchanged for New England debentures . This was the transaction that terminated the relations of the companies . Mr. Kochersperger. who resigned the Vice Presidency on April 1 , issued the order for Mr. May to turn over to Treasurer Hemingway of the Billard Company the duplicate keys to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Billard often accompanied him to the vaults . Mr. Billard was then a Director of the New Haven Company . The Billard Company ceased using this vault when the securites were removed , about two months ago . A series of questions asked by counsel for the commission were Intended to show that the New Haven and the Billard Company ceased relations after the present investigation was begun and that Mr. May had been instructed by Genera ' . Counsel Robbins of the New Haven to permit the removal of the Hillard securities . To a question by Counsel Doherty , of the commission . as to whether It was true that Mr. Billard made $2,700,000 in the Boston &; Maine stock transaction , Mr. May said that he knew nothing about it , as he had simply carried out the orders of his superiors without ask-. - in g questions . He recollected clearly that the Billard stock , 19,980 Shares , had been in the hands of Charles S. Mellen and had never been in the possession of anybody outside the New Haven . As far as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any corporation except the New Haven and its subsidiaries . The New Haven , he s had often furnished cash to the Hillard Company in return for its notes . Counsel Doherty alleged that in one of these transactions the amount was $2,004.000 . Mr. May said he could not estimate losses of the New Haven through its dealings with the Billard Company and with Mr. Billard individually , nor could he say what constituted the present business of the Billard Company . In reply to Attorney Cummings Mr. May said that the full story of the re lations between the Billard Company and the New Haven was told in detail in the books of the New Haven and its allies , which had long been at the disposal of the commission . Denies Books Show All . Counsel Gartner challenged this state ' ment . He asserted that certain transactions such as that by which Mr. Billard or somebody else was supposed to have made a profit of $2,700,000 could not be disclosed by the perfunctory entries on the books . J. W. Bowman , Assistant Treasurer of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the compartment in which . the New Haven 's securities were kept . Under direction of the New Haven 's Treasurer he had let Samuel C. Morehouse , one of the Directors of the Billard Company , have access to the vaults . Mr. Morehouse. he said , had a key that Billard and Hemingway formerly possessed . About March 1 , 1914 , Mr. Morehouse had taken several packages out of the vault , but Mr. Bowman did not know what was contained in them , and had no knowledge that anybody had checked off the securities thus taken away . Edward E. Field of New Haven , exPresident of the Hillard Company , declined on advice of his counsel , Judge Stoddard , to say whether he was connected with the Hillard Company . He would not say even whether he knew there was a Hillard Company , and he declined to tell whether he had ever put up any money for stock of the company . Mr. Gartner asked Mr. Field to produce the books of the Billard Company in accordance with the subpoena duces tecum served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must refuse on advice of counsel . " Commissioner McChord then ruled that the witness be required to produce the books . Judge Stoddard repeated what he had said to the effect that he denied the Jurisdiction of the commission over the Billard Company . Mr. Morehouse , who said he lived in New Haven and was attorney for the Billard Company , admitted that lie had removed debenture bonds aggregating $10,400,000 of the New Haven Debenture &; Securities Company from the New Haven vault . The Commission , he said , had jurisdiction with relation to such a matter because it involved the New Haven , but had no jurisdiction in relation to other matters embraced in the inquiry . Mr. Morehouse declined to tell what was the business of the Billard Company , who its officers were , or to give any information of its stockholdings . He said , however , that the Billard Company owned no securities of New England Debenture Security Com : pany and he knew of no contract that the Billard Company had with the New Haven Company or the New England Navigation Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven , " asked Mr. Gartner , " that the Billard Company did have contracts that it did not want the public to know about ? " " That is not a fair way to state it , " Mr. Morehouse - answered . " I did say the Billard Company had contracts but not that it did not want the public to know about them . I 'm willing to state all I know of the relations between the Billard Company and the New Haven and the New England Navigation Company and any . of its subsidiaries , but nothing about its other relations . " Attorney Hines made the statement that earnest efforts had been made by Chairman Elliott . President Hadley of Yale , Morefield Storey , and himself to procure the production of the " Hillard Company books . The hearing concluded with a statement by Counsel Gartner as to what the commission 's counsel expected to show from the books of the Hillard Company . They expected to show , he said . the real transactions that went on between the New England Navigation Company , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , and between the New Haven and the Billard Company . They also expected to show whether there was any connection be1 tween the Hillard Company and the New Haven that brought profit to those concerned , and also whether the persons ! who profited should be compelled to pay back the money thus obtained . NEW HAVEN 'S BOOKS OPEN . Every Facility for Investigation Given , Says Chairman Elliott , Chairman Howard Elliott of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company said last evening before leavinp-for Boston : The Billard company matters , which are now under investigation by the Commerce Commission , relate to happenings several years ago . before I was connected with the New Haven company . Every facility has been given by the New Haven company to the investigators of the Commerce Commission for the purpose of obtaining information about any transactions with the Billard company . The New Haven company does not in any way control the Billard company nor has it control of the books and papers of that company . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
