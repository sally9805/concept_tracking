" Mr. Choate , notwithstanding his advanced years , had taken an energetic part in the entertainment of the'French and British war envoys , and these activitles unquestionably hastened his death .

Ile had been a sufferer of angina pectoris , but not an acute sufferer , and his sudden death last night was in a way unexpected  --  how unexpected may be surmised by the fact that there was no physician in attendance . Mr. Choate made his last public appearance . with Mr. Balfour , . head of the British Commission , on Sunday at special services in the Cathedral of ** ? John the Divine . Joseph II . Choate , Jr. , who was at Mount iiisce , was apprised of his father 's illness during the evening , but , though he rushed to New York by motor , he arrived after Mr. Choate had ex-pirleids ; Miss Choate , notwithstanding her grief , was able to make a brief statement at 3 o'clock this morning .

" A telephone mesage was sent at once to Dr. Draper . At 10:30 o'clock last night Mr. Choate was sitting up in bed , but gradually his condition . became worse , until he sank into a coma . The family hastily telephoned to a number of physicians . Dr. Draper , the first to arrive , said that . Mr. Choate had passed away . Mr. Choate was scheduled to deliver an address at Columbia University today , and talked over the prospect with his wife and daughter , Miss Choate said . fie spoke feelingly of his interest in the university .

Dr. Draper immediately turned his attention to her and staid in attendance on her for the rest of the night . Miss Choate said that her mother 's condition was serious . Mr. Choate 's Career . Joseph Hodges Choate was for many years the most prominent figure in the legal profession of this country . and when he retired in January , 1809 , to accept the appointment tendered to him by President , of Ambassador to the Court of St. James  --  the most prized of the diplomatic posts  --  he had long been , recognized as the leader of the American bar . To Mr. Choate , then G7 years old , the Ambassadorship opened up a new field in which to win distinction , and it has often been said that he and much to cement the kindly feeling between this country and Great Britain . Ilia retirement was the source of uni-. versal regret in both nations . Later , as head of the delegation from the : United Staten . to the Tdce Confer-. ence at The Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and genius , again loomed up as a commanding figure . His addresses were quoted widely as among the most brilliant delivered . Mr. Choate had always ranked as one of the noted orators of his day , and his speeches , whether grave or wittee-and few excelled him as a wit  --  always atMeted attention . On several occasions Mr. Choate used ' his remarkable talents and oratory in political battles and when he did his opponems suffered keenly . The part he played as a member of the " Committee of Seventy " in 1871 . In smashing the Tweed ring holds an important place In the political history of this State . Later attacks he made upon Richard Croker will long be remembered . A comprehensive account of all of the important legal battles in which Mr. Choate figured would fill many volumes ; the anecdotes related about him many volumes more . his Father a Skilled Physician . Mr. Choate was born at Salem , Mass. , on Jan. 24 , 1832 , the son of George and Margaret Manning ( Hodges ) Choate . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a native of Salem and a graduate of Harvard , was widely known as a skilled physician and represented Salem in the general court for a period of several years . His mother was a daughter of Gamaliel Hodges of Salem . By both lines Mr. Choate was descended from old Coloniat sten and was related directly and collaterally with some of the most memorable characters in the history of New England . John Choate , a native of Groton , Rexford , Colchester , England , was the original American representative of the Choate family . He emigrated to Massachusetts in 1643 and settled at a town now known as Ipswich . His son , Thomas Choate , was the first of the family to live upon the ancestral estate , Choate Island , and he was the representative of Ipswich in the general court for four years . His son , Francis Choate , was born in 1701 and died in 1777 . He was ' a farmer and church elder . William Choate , eon of Francis Choate , was born in 1730 and died in 1785 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . His son , George Choate , was the representative for Ipswich from 1814 ? to 1817 , and for Essex in 1813 . He married Susanna , daughter of Judge Stephen Choate of Ipswich . Their son , George Choate , was the father of Joseph H. Choate . One of the most prominent Of the line was Rufus Choate , a cousin of Mr. Choate 's father , the noted orator and lawyer . Of Rufus Choate , it was said , more than forty years after his death , that he held a name and place at tile American bar to which none had succeeded . The same inograpner said : " Two characteristics , which seem to descend from generation to generation in this family , are great scope and concentration of mind and ettectiee oratorical pewee and this appears in several of the line who lay no other claim to lasting remembrance . " The Hodges ' family traces descent from a representative of ' the family who came from England and settled in Bristol County , Mass. , about 1630 . Graduated From Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public schools of Salem and was graduated from : Harvard in 185:2 , ranking fourth in a class of which his eider brother , William Gardiner Choate , was the first , lie thee entered the study of law in the Harvard Law School and was graduated in ISA . After an additional year of reading and practice in the office of Leverett Saito/easel , in Boston , he was admitted to me Bar of Massachusetts ' in 15e5 . In tile same year tie made his home in this city . . Mr. Choate 's first connection in New York was with the firm of Scudder &; Carter . He had come to New York armed with a letter of introduction from Rufus Choate to William M. Everts , and in 1650 he was invited to enter tile firm of Butler , Everts &; Soutnmayd . In this connection it is interesting to note that Mr. Choate once said of Rufus Choate that " to his example anti inspiration , to his sympathy and his helping hand " he owed more of Ms own success than " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cnoate was admitted to Mr. Evarts 's firm which then became known as Everts , Southmayd &; Choate . This firm , in turn , became , ' in 1884 , Evarts , Choate &; Beaman . It was always an association of remarkable men and was reputed to be , for years , the foremost legal firm in the country . Of Mr. Choate , in 1899 , a biographer wrote : " As a trial lawyer Mr. Choate has few , if any , rivals . His deep knowledge d human nature , wonderful ability in discerning situations and combining facts and perfect self-possession before a court . render him formidable as an examiner of witnesses , while his ready wit and great eloquence give him unusual influence with juries . " The feeling is current in New York that a case placed in Mr. Choate  --  s hanus is as nearly certain of a successful outcome as is possible . He is more sought after to represent important interests and argue test cases than perhaps any other lawyer in America . His vermeilite and ability are exhibited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional employment , from patent and admiralty causes and courts martial , through will contests and breach of promise - cages , to those involving the greatest constitutional and international questions , and whether called into play ip consultation or before jury or before an appellate tribunal , at all times and in all places he is equally at home and at his ease . F'ew men can be named who have possessed this marked ' quality and characteristic , which make , in the language of the profession , the recognized allaround lawyer . " He is regarded as representative in training , culture , and refinement of the very best there is in the Anglo-Saxon race . Unknown to the world at large , his broad , catholic , and benevolent spirit is constantly manifested in works of charity , and , notwithstanding the drafts upon his professional time , his services as a lawyer are repeatedly given gratuitously to some public cause or to clients too poor to pay a fee ; and for them his skill is employed even more persistently and earnestly than in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exceptionally hard worker , with great powers of concentration and application , sparing himself neither night nor day during nine months of the year . " Ex-President American liar Assoeilion . Mr. Choate was a member arid former President of the American Bar Association , the New York State Bar Association , the Bar Association of the City of New York , and the Harvard Law School Association , a Trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and a Governor of New York Hospital . Be was a member and former President Of the Union League and Harvard Clubs and a member of the Metropolitan , University , New York Athletic , Downtown . Century , Riding , Alpha Delta Phi , Barnard , and City Clubs , and he was an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple , London , England . He was ten times a Doctor of Laws . A Harvard man of the class of 1852 in arts , of 1854 In the law school , he was first made an LL . D. by Amherst in 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Williams in Abroad he received the degree from Edinburgh and from Cambridge in Dote from Oxford in 1902 , ( this university made him a Doctor of Civil Law , ) from St. Andrew 's in 1902 , and from Glasgow in 1904 .. The University of Pennsylvania made him an LL.D . ' in 1908 . Of Ml- . Choate 's appearance in legal cases much has been written , but there is one tribute which stands forth . A writer in The London Outlook , while Mr. Choate was Ambassador in England , said : " A case was not a case unless Choate appeared in it , " and then added : " It was more than a case when he did appear in it . " Some of Dix Famous Cases . Prominent among the cases with which Mr. Choate was associated was that of Gen. Fitz-Hugh Porter , who had been deprived of his rank it i the attny owing to charges brought against him In ' connection with his conduct at the Battle of Bull Run : Gen. Porter demanded reinstatement , rind Choate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles but the minute details . of a long , confused and momentous campaign . In addition there Wes the state of public feeling to be considered end the prejudices of the military men who had takes part in the campaign and lined up for or against Porter . Mr. Choate made his fight in 1879 before . a commission appointed by President Hayes and he not only established Gen. Porter 's innocence but brought about the restoration of his rank . Mr. Choate 's versatility was further - displayed in his presentation of the case for the defendant before the naval court-martial appointed to try Commander Bowman H. McCalla for alleged breaches of naval regulations , and still further illustration of that quality may be found in his genial diplomatic conduct of the unprecedented investigation undertaken by the New York Yacht Club of the Vigilant-Valkyrie controversy upon charges made be Lord DUDraven as to the conduct of the International yacht race between those boats . In the famous case against Russell Sage , which for years was much talked about by the legal profession , Mr. Choate appeared as counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. , baniters . Mr. Laidlaw was in Mr. Sage 's office on Dec. " 4 , 1891 , when a lunatic , afterward identified as Henry I. , . Norcross , demanded $1,200,000 from the financier , and being curtly put aside threw a bomb at him . Norcross and Mr. Sage 's secretary , B. F. Norton , were killed , and Mr. Sage and others in the office injured . Mr. Choate built his case on the allegation that Mr. Sage had placed his hand on Laidlaw 's shoulder , and , swinging him atounte. interposed his body as a shield . He asked for $30,1100 damages and got $25,000 . The case was appealed and a new trial ordered , which resulted in a verdict Of e43,009 for Laidlaiv . It was again set aside on appeal and was , never brought tip again . The cross-examination of Mr. Sage , conducted by Mr. Choate , wag long a topic of discussion among lawyers and others Who attended the trial . Mr. Choate himself once referred to it as " skinning an intellectual eel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public office , although he gave muoh of his time and energy to the people , not only as a member and chief counsel of the " Committee of Seventy , " which brought the reign of Boss Tweed to an end but in other anti-Tammany fights . In 1894 he was President of the State Constitutional Convention , rendering valuable service to the State . In 1897 Mt . Choate gave his support to the candidacy of Seth Low for Mayor , and in the State catnpaign of 1898 delivered a number of effective addresses for the Republican candidate , for Governor . fie 1897 Mr. Choate was a candidate for United States Senator . but was defeated by Thomas C. Platt . Mr. Choate 's candidacy was urged by the Union League Club , which sent a large committee to Albany to appeal to the members of the Legislature to vote for him , At the caucus of the Republican members of the Legislature on the evening of Jan. 14 , 1S97 , however , Mr. Platt received the votes of thirty-two . and 110 Assemblymen , while t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators ana four Assemblymen : His opinion of Richard Croker was freely expressed by Mr. Choate in addresses in the State campaign of 1898 .. At a meeting in Chickering Hall , in replying to an attack by Croker , he ' said , I must say I regerd it as the highestcompliment for any respectable citizen to be abused by him . " At the same meeting he said : ' Well , this audience looks to me like a good , old-fashioned audience who remember things they have read In the Bible . Croker 's speech and why he spoke recall to my mind the familiar story of Balaam 's ass . And in two or three points Mr. Croker reminds us of that very celebrated . beast of burden . In the first ph e , until the ass spoke . nobody in the world imagined what a perfect ass he was . if he had not spoken he would have passed into history as an average , ordinary , silent ass who carried Balaam on his way ; but when he spoke he was distinguished over all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St .. Tstmests. to the Court of St. James 's on Jan. 11 , to the Court of St. James on Jan , 11 , 1599 , to succeed John , Hay , who returned to this country to enter President 's Cabinet . He served in that capacity until 1905 , and no one ever better acquitted himself . An idea of the esteem in-which he was held in . England was given by EV comment made by The London Outiobk when he left that country . It said : " Even for a Man who has tasted , as he has , happiness ell his life , Who has mounted froth Within to triumph , and who would have to let his memory skip at least a generation to recall the tithe when he was not distinguished , the period of his . Ambassadorship at the Court of St. James 's must in retrospect appear like the Abundant harvest and culmination ' of all that , gone before . " When Mr. Choate was at The . HaguePeace Conference in 1907 ' he attracted much attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Choate at The Hague was more enjoyed than that of Comte de Saint Maurice , the political editor of Gil Blas , who , on Oct. 5 of that year , had this to say : " Ile IS the enfant terrible of the conference . He seems aware neither of the grandeur of the mission intrusted to the delegates nor of the personal majesty of their excellencies . He is barely a diplomat . Ile it is who , with an air of innocence , inserts into a discussion a few cold words which effectively shatter the grandiloquent bubbles of his colleagues . He it is who unsmilingly emphasizes some imposing puerility . It is he , always he , whose brief logic brings back to earth again discussions which have drifted into the pacific ether . What superb ' balloons he has thus pricked ' What pretentious aeronauts has lie brought to earthly realities . " Criticisms and Famous Addresses . There have been many anecdotes told about air . Choate . Two of his utterances became famous . At a dinner of The Pilgrims many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , then . Women  --  the better half of the Yankee world  --  at whose tender sutninon " s even the stern Pilgrims were ever ready to spring to arms , and without whose aid they never could have achieved the historic title of the Pilgrim Fathers . The Pilgrim Mothers were more devoted martyrs than Were the Pilgrim Fathers , because they not only had to bear the same hardships that the Pilgrim Fathers suffered but they had to bear ' with the Pilgrim Fathers besides . " Another fatuous address was his tribute to Roscoe Comelier ; during the ease of Stewart against Huntington . " However we May differ , " said Choate , . " one from another or all of us from Win , we owe the Senator one debt of gratitude for standing always steadfast and incorruptible in the halls of corruption . Shadracn . Meshech , and Abednego won immortal glory for passing one day in the fiery furnace , hut he has been twenty years there , and has come out without even a smell of smoke upon his garrhents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made over a private dinner table at which he and Mrs. Choate were guests . Some one inquired of him who he , would like to be if he could not be Itimself . He paused a few seconds , as if thinking over the list of the world 's celebrities , and then his eye reeled upon his wife . " If . " he answered , ' e I could not be myself , I should like to be Mrs. Choattee second husband . " Mr. Choate frequently crossed swords with Chauncey M. Depew at formal and impromptu dinners ; in fact they were often brought together for the very reason thet a brilliant exchange of wit was sure to follow . ? Once in delivering the opening address on his pet theme , " Forefathers Day , " Mr. Choate said " One day last week I was waited upon by a representative of one of our great metropolitan dailies with a polite request that I should rurmsh him with a copy of the ? speech I was to deliver this evening , in order that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning for publication to-morrow , ' God bless you , said I , ' I have no copy to give you . How can I make an afterdinner speech until I have made sure of my ' dinner ? ' " Nell , he seemed a little crestfallen . but , prOceeded to argue the matter , ' Why , ' said he , ' we 've got all the rest . ' ' Surely , ' said I , ' you have . not got Mr. Depew 's ? ' Oh , yes , ' . said he , ' we have got him in cold type . ' " A roar of laughter followed at the expense of Mr. Delny ' . After a while it was his turn . " The reverter who called on me for my speech , " he remarked , " said ' to ins as he said to Choate ; ' I have them all , ' but also added , ' Have you any poetry in yours ? ' Said I , ' no , ' ' Well , ' sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I came to the conclusion that he must have written it himself . ' Another of Mr. Choate 's much quoted addresses was delivered at a dinner of the American Bar Association in Chicago several years ago . Speaking on the topic , " Our Profession , " he said : We love the law because among all the learned professions it is the only one that involves the study and the pursuit of a stable and exact science . " Theology was once ' considered an immutable science , but hoer it has changed from age to age ! " And then as to medicine , how its practice and its theories succeed . each other in rapid revolution , so that what were good methods and healing doses and saving prescriptions a generation ago are now condemned , and all the past is adjudged to be empirical ! " Meanwhile , common law , like a milting father , makes void the part where the fault Is and preserves the rest , as it has been doing for centuries . - ' ' So long as the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor of out ' liberties end of our Government ; so long as the public credit and good faith of this great nation are in peril : ' so long as the right of property . which lies at the root of ? all civil Government , is scouted and the three inalienable rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , which the Declaration of Independence proclaimed and the Constitution ? has guaranteed alike against the action of Congress and of the States , are in jeopardy , so long Will great public service be demanded of the bar . ' Some of His Noted Cases. ? A brief review of some important cases in which he figured is necessary to give an idea of Mr. Choate 's truly remarkable activity in his profession . Among them was the case of Feuthelent against di Cesnola , In which Me . Choate , fn a trial lasting for many months , successfully defended the e.enumeness of the Cypriote antiquities In the Metropolitan Museum of Art . To accomplish that end he vas obliged at short notice to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobilier case , involving the contract for the construction of the Union . Pacific Railroad ; the ease of Stewart against Huntington , to recovet ; a large sum of money alleged to be due on a contract for the purchase of stock and involving the operations  --  of the . b.ailders:d.the Gentral.PacifieRailroad ; . the cases - of Hutchinson against the ! slew York Stoic Exchange , and of Lobbat against the Union Club , in each of which Mr. Choate was successful in securing the reinstatement of the plaintiff to membership in the defendant association , and the case of Hunt against the executors of Paran Stevens , in Which Mr. Choate represented the plaintiff , Richard M. HUM , the architect . Others were the famous Maynard , New York election fraud cases in 1891 and 1892 , many eases in the Admiralty Courts , many ? in different jurisdictions involving attacks upon the validity of the Standard Oil Trust and the Tobacco Trust , in which millions of dollars were involved ; the Cruger , Vanderbilt , Tilden , Stewart , Hoyt , Drake , and Hopkins-Searles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Mr. Choate was successful was one before the Interstate Commerce Commission in which he secured against the railroads centring in this city a reduction and graduation in freight rates on milk which the railroads had refused to change for mane years . Authority on Constitutional Law . Before the United States Supreme Court Mr. Choate also argued many important cases . Ile gained fame as an authority on constitutional law . Among the notable cases he argued before the court was the famous income tax case in which Mr. Choate succeeded in proving the unconstitutionality of the income tax law of 1894 and another was the Texas trust law cage involving the constitutionality of the anti-trust jaw of the State of Texas , Mr. Choate was always a strong champion of the bar ' as agaihst aggresshins or slights from the bench . One of the best illustrations of ' his defense of the rights of lawyers was his presentation in 1903 of the case of John W , Goff , now a Supreme Court Justice , as against the charges of contempt of court preferred from the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a story has often been told of hOw Mr. Choate once rehtihed Judge Van Brunt . The latter had a habit very distressful to advocates pleading befete him of talking to his associates on the bench While the lawyers were delivering their addresses . This became at times most exasperating , but every one hesitated to make any fuss about it , being overawed by the Judge 's auss aboUte to sum up in an e eh Choate important case . Forty minutes had been allotted to him for doing it . He had scarcely begun when the Judge wheeled about in his chair and began a discus- ? sion with one of his colleagues . Choate  --  he was a very young Man then  --  stopped speaking , folded his arms and gazed steadily at Judge Van Brunt . A hush felt upon the courtroom . The Judge , noting it , turned around to meet the Teoyieisr honor , 1 1 esillyottiimeee latter , 1% , htiee just forty ' minutes in which to make my final argument . Not only shall I need every second of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need your undivided attention .... " And you shall have it , " replied the Judge , a faint flush on big cheeks .
