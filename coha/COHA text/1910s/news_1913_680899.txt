txt Mayor-elect John Purroy Mitchel , speaking to some ar30 guests at the twenty-eighth annual dinner of the Southern Society at the Waldorf last night , announced that while he was very much interested as a Democrat and as a citizen in the reorganization of the Democratic Party in this city , he would not , as Mayor , take any part in the reorganization or upbuilding of that or any other political party . His pre-election promise of non-partisan Government in the city administration , he felt , made it impossible for him to take part in any such movement . Mr. Mitchel asserted also that he would appoint no man to office who intended to use his place to reorganize the Democratic Party , and that he would remove from office any man who , after appointment violated his wishes in this respect . The assembled Southerners cheered Mr. Mitchel 's announcement warmly , and no one was more enthusiastic in his applause than Dudley Field Malone , Collector of the Port of New York .

Mr. McCorkle proposed a toast to the health of the President of the United States , " the first Southern-born man in nearly half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He reminded his hearers that President Wilson , before he became President , had announced at a dinner of the Southern Society that he intended to borrow many a Southern man to help him carry out his policies of government later on , and , the speaker said , the President " had made good . " After a speech by Dr. Finley , Mr. Mitchel was introduced as a grandson of Virginia , " because so many of us voted for him in the recent election . " He told the Southerners that he had another and clearer , claim to the title , inasmuch as his grandfather , a resident of Virginia at the opening of the civil war , enlisted with his three sons in the army of the Confederacy . Mr. Mitchel said he found it embarrassing to decide what to speak about at the dinners to which he had been invited between now and Jan. 1 . " You do not want to hear from me my programme for the new city administration , " he said , " for that was told to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for discussing that programme is when we are actually ? engaged in fulfilling it , and when we can ask you whether we are fulfilling our promises . Then we shall discuss them together very fully , I promise you . Another subject of Inter est to many of you and of burning interest I know to the press , is that of appointments I shall make to the various departments of the City Government . For obvious reasons that subject is not open to me for discussion now . It will be very much discussed , no doubt . by you after the appointments have been made . One thing I will say , " said Mr. Mitchel . " I have noticed that there has been much discussion concerning plans for the reorganization of the Democratic Party or the unbuilding of a more genuine Democratic Party , and much speculation has been indulged in as to whether the newly elected Mayor of*New York will take an active part in that reorganization . " Pernaps It Is unnecessary for me to repeat that , as a Democrat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am interested in seeing here a representative and creditable Democratic Party in which we can all take pride . As a citizen and as a Democrat I never surrender my right to take part in any Political movement which I approve . Rut as an official of the city administration . as Mayor of New York , I stand pledged by every promise made by me in the recent campaign not to use the - power of that office or my influence as Mayor for the furtherance of any political movement or the reorganization or upbuilding of any party or faction or group . " Moreover , no man will be appointed to office by me simply because he supported me in my candidacy for office . Nor will any man be appointed by me for the purpose of the unbuilding of any party in New York City , and no man Will be retained by me who develops such a purpose after he has been appointed to office : This administration is going to be strictly and absolutely nonpartisan . We were elected to do the work of no particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under State or . national political parties ; But we Were elected by the citizens of New York to give them a business administration without regard to any political party . and that , as Mayor of the City of New York , I propose to do . " Prof. Raleigh C. Minor of the law department of the University of Virginia was the next speaker . He said he deplored the tendeneies of the time that had led to the campaign for the initiative and ? referendum ; the popular , election of Senators , the recall of public officials , and especially of Judges and judicial dc-tisions . Collector Malone , who followed him , said : " The venerable professor on my left is sincerely fearful of a growing democracy in the United States of America . He has not lived in New York City , or he would thank God for a growing democracy in the United States . There is far less danger from the abuse of power by the people than from the abuse of Power by a few great interests and their representatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a non-partisan Mayor . I tell you that 1 am just as much a nonpartisan Collector of the Port of the City of New York . I am not interested merely in reform which only contemplates one campaign ; because the gentlemen we battle with , who are also nonpartisan in public , devote themselves 3115 days in the year to the furthering of their own interests .
