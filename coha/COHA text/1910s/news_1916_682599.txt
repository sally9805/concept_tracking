txt Banking circles learned yesterday that , while the British Government had shipped into tills country approximately $200,000.000 in gold since the first week of May , the movement had by no means reached its climax . According to information obtained by bankers , an average daily consignment of : $3,000,000 may be expected to come across the border from Ottawa for an Indefinite period , which may continue as long as . s.111 months . This gold will come to New York . and will be in addition to shipments to the Philadelphia mint from the same source , which have been averaging 0,550,000 s day Tor some time . The definite plan for $3,000,000 of imports each week day was put into operation last week . From Tuesday to Saturday , five days . a toal of $15.000,000 was deposited at the Assay Office to the account of J. P. Morgan &; Co . Then came word to the banking house : hat a consignment of ** was on its way . from Halifax , direct from London . and Ottawa transfers were temporarily checked because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution if more of the metal had been laid down on top of the big shipment from London. ? It is believed that further substantial receipts will be received from Europe direct , but these will be additional to the scheduled Ottawa shipments . If the plan is carried out as prepared , it is clear that a truly enormous amount of the precious metal will find its way to these shores by Jan. 1 , 1911 . Counting twenty-six days to the month , the fulfillment of the program would shift into American vaults from Ottawa alone considerably more than $400,000 , - 000 of gold which is now owned abroad .

It is supposed that the gold received in bullion form from Africa , Australia . and the Canadian mines has been remelted at the mint , and this belief has given rise to the supposition that Russian gold has , or will , play a prominent part in the Allies ' financial plans on this continent . A recent report of operations of the Russian Treasury showed that something like $25,000.000 had been withdrawn in a period of a few weeks . The purpose has not been made public . It would not be a difficult matter for large transfers to take place between Vladivostok and Vancouver , The British and Canadian officials , however . have given no intimation that their Eastern allies are helping , and conjecture has to find stimulation in the fact that Russia 's gold holdings before the war began were second only to those of the United States . The tremendous movement of gold to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important influence in strengthening the credit of the alliefl nations here . The heavy borrowings by the various nations have been bolstered up by the gold reserve concentrated here , and continued shipments make ' slier the process of placing other loans . LINER BRINGS $20,000,000 . Securities from London Consigned to J. P. Morgan and Others . Another lot of securities , said to be worth $20,000,000 , consigned to J. P. Morgan &; Co. and other New York bankers , arrived last night from Liverpool on the Cunarder Saxonia in charge of Captain Alfred Mees of , the Bank of England .
