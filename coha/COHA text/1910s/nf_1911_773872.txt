txt 6o Music and Musical Criticism infelicitous gibes . Even our own greatest musician had to pay the penalty for daring to be original . The account of Prometheus in the Musical Times of October 1877 , the account of Judith in the Musical Standards of December 1888 , are standing examples of the way not to criticise . In the latter case the reviewer fell foul of the libretto , with what success the readers of his article will still remember . It is a little imprudent to select passages as unworthy of the book of Judith unless one has the Apocrypha at hand , so as to make sure that they are not in it . These arc the men in whom we are expected to put our trust . They are not the sharpshooters and skirmishers : they are accredited captains of the host , who claim on some ground of knowledge or experience that we should recognise their supremacy and follow where they lead .

Here then is an obvious defect to remedy . The necessary laws of Music are few and // simple . We can easily acquire the rudiments of harmony , counterpoint , and form , and when we possess them we shall learn more from hearing the great Composers than from all the lectures and analyses in Christendom . To obtain a mastery over the practical application of these laws involves , no doubt , the work of a lifetime ; but this is not what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , and our object demands more of the charity that edifieth than of the knowledge that puffeth up . When we call a Beethoven sonata beautiful ' we do not use the term in any sense generically different from that in which it is applied to a ballad . One is complex , the other simple , but both are derived from the same laws and contain the same elements . If , then , we can love a ballad we can love a sonata . We only need to see our way through the more complicated work , to know the reason of its form and the interrelation of its melodies , and for this we have already the capacity , which is waiting to be actualised by study and experience . The distinctions between men are slighter than we think . One can not understand Beethoven , another can understand Beethoven but not Schumann , another finds the difficulties gather when he approaches Brahms or Wagner ; all , if they would confess it , are occasionally puzzled by some deeper utterance of genius . But when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage patiently and generously , not throw it aside with the arrogant inference that an effect is at fault because it is unfamiliar . The first and most imperative necessity in the matter is that we should free our minds as far as possible of all cant and fetish worship and prejudice . // It is only by clearing away these weeds that we can hope to sow any seed of true appreciation . It is only by taking stock frankly and unreservedly of our present position that we can discover the lines along which advance is desirable . Suppose we find ourselves out of sympathy with some acknowledged masterpiece , some work which has stood the lapse of time and the flux of fashions and generations . We may assume at once that we are in the wrong , and that the cause of our mistake lies either in inadequate performance or in conditions which rendered attention difficult , or , lastly , in our own deficiencies of musical knowledge . In any case it is remediable , and if we remedy it we have clearly added a new item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is childish to denounce a work which we have never properly comprehended ; it is worse than childish to simulate an admiration which we do not really feel . If we demand sincerity in the artist he has an equal right to look for the same quality in us . What we require in England is a more manly and straightforward attitude towards artistic questions . In Music , apparently , we have allowed generations of foreign influence to obliterate our own national style , with the result that the heart of the people has been left untouched , and that criticism has too often been entrusted to careless or mercenary hands . Music can never flourish as an exotic . If it is to grow into a fair and stately tree it must be planted in a national soil . We owe our best gratitude to Germany for the great works that she has put forward for our education , but in order to appreciate them at all we must have the root of the matter in ourselves . Much more // if England is to return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own lines , she must deliver her own message . It is false to say that we are unmusical . No unmusical nation could have pro-duced Sumer is i-cumen in , or the Triumphs of Oriana , or King Arthur , no unmusical nation could have filled its churches with the strength of Tallis or the sweetness of Farrant . At least we have the traditions of a past in which our Composers had no need to borrow from their foreign neighbours . It was a conspicuous piece of bad fortune that the great monodic movement , which originated in Florence , should have spread northward at a time when England was too much occupied with political disturbances to make full use of the occasion . Then came calamity after calamity . Charles II . overran the country with French influence , George I. invaded it with German , until at last it became a recognised fact that in all the more important branches of the Art England should import her music from abroad . Add to this John Bull 's unreasoning contempt for the foreigner , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded into a mere echo . Apart from the small school of Glee writers , whose whole history falls within the lifetime of one man , the last English Composer before the present generation was Henry Purcell . The record of our national Music , once among the most glorious in the world , has been virtually in abeyance for the past two centuries . Even the Composers of that period who most nearly attain to the first rank , such as S. S. Wesley and Sterndale Bennett , are too obviously affected by a foreign system to count as exceptions . The voice of our English song , even if // it was not silenced altogether , was yet so faint and intermittent that it had no power to cope with the magnificent outburst of German Art . Once there was no musical form to which England did not contribute her share of development . To the growth of the symphony , the quartett , and the sonata she contributed virtually nothing . Hence all the false taste and the false criticism of those barren years . Music was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external thing to be bought with money and to be estimated in proportion to its price . Our own musicians either threw themselves down under the eyes of the groundlings , ' or if they were too conscientious for that , borrowed their method from the fashionable style . Pierson , who might have done something under more favourable auspices , was driven to Germany by the apathetic indifference of his own countrymen ; other composers and virtuosi bid for success by adopting names of German or Italian sound . The whole system became false , heartless insincere , fatal alike to true judgment and true production . En ; ; land was abrogating her position as a workshop of Art , and was becoming instead the bazaar at which it was retailed . Now , at last , the period of our decadence is ended . There has arisen among us a Composer who is capable of restoring our national Music to its true place in the art of Europe . Under his guidance , and by his example , it is still possible that we may rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and show ourselves once more the worthy comrade and rival of the great nations oversea . Already there are signs that our land is awakening // from its long inactivity . We have a means of musical education which can hold its own against the Con-servatoires of Paris , or Lcipsic , or Vienna . We have a growing and extending interest in musical science . If only the work can be turned into a right direc-tion , if only it can follow the broad , healthy utterance of our national melodies , instead of diverging to copy the phraseology of an alien tongue , if only it will be true and honest and single-hearted , then there is no reason why it should not recover the glory that it has attained in past days . We do not want over-tures that imitate Parsifal , or cantatas that pile into an incongruous heap the cadences of Grieg and Dvorak . We want to realise once again that dis-tinctive National Art of which the capacity is still latent in the heart of our country . There is little presumption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the I ) e I'rafundis , and the English Symphony . Grant that all future Music , our own with the rest , roust be to some extent affected by the work of Bach and Beethoven , of Schumann and Brahms , yet there is room for a national use even of the inheritance that has been left us by the great German Composers . We may learn in their school without being overpowered by their methods . Milton was steeped in the Classics , yet no poet is more English than he . Addison knew the Latin writers from Lucretius to Claudian , yet the Spectator remains the purest example of our national prose . And in like manner our musicians may treat the great Masters as instructors , not as models , and may be influenced by them only in the sense in which Morley was influenced by Marenzio , or Purcell by Lulli. // It is for us listeners to determine whether we will aid this movement or retard it . We may discourage our true Composers by letting their message fall upon inattentive ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing-room or the last vulgarity of the music hall , but in so doing we range ourselves of deliberate choice among the antagonists of progress . The day of England 's Music is near at hand . Even now the first blow has been struck , the first victory achieved . Let us shake off the mental indolence which shrinks from the trouble of a decision ; let us form our judgment by a study of the great Masters , and apply it to a generous appreciation of the Art of our own day ; let us find our pleasure where it is purest and most enduring , and it will be added to our reward that we should share in the winning of a national cause . Hector Berlioz AND THE FRENCH ROMANTIC MOVEMENT . I STUDENT DAYS 183o saw more than one revolution in Paris . The storm that broke in thunder on the July barricades only gave direction and impetus to an electrical force that had heel ' gathering over the whole field of national life . In Art , as in Politics , the days of Legitimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Mcduse ; Hugo had declared war in the preface to Cromwell , and had just emerged victorious from the famous forty days ' of Hernani ; Alfred de Vigny , the most conservative of conspirators , had struck his blow with Cinq Mars : everywhere France had declared for freedom , and Charles X. and his censors were in full flight . It is interesting to notice the manner in which the different movements converged . In earlier days the artist has usually held aloof from political disturbance , or at most has bidden it lift not its spear against the Muses ' bower . ' But in the present century it is the fashion for genius to be in revolt . Wagner was banished from Saxony , Tourguenieff and Dos-71 // toieffsky from Russia , Shelley challenged the Castlereagh Government at his Spezian villa , Byron ended the noblest episode of his life at Missolonghi . So in 1830 some of the Romanticists took the opportunity of a new and picturesque experience . The excited mob that battered down the gates of the Louvre found itself reinforced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a neighbouring museum , and hacking at the palace with the same vigour that had lately ' demolished Racine . ' Away beyond the Palais Royal , in the Rue Vivienne , rose the ominous strains of the ' Marseillaise , ' led by a gaunt student of the Conservatoire , with a keen aquiline face and a mass of unmanageable red hair . Art and Politics had joined hands and were fighting in the same cause . Berlioz , indeed , even more than Dumas , found the atmosphere of Revolution congenial . He was always in opposition ? first to his parents , then to his teachers , later to Fetis and his critics ? and it is appropriate enough that he should have won his first musical victory with a cantata finished while the bullets were rattling round his window and flung aside that he might join the Sainte Canaille in the streets . In his extraordinarily complex nature were many of the qualities of a popular leader ? restless energy , indomitable courage , unquestioning intolerance of prescriptive right , and , above all , entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , may be set a keen though rather intermittent sense of humour , a touch of petulance , and a sensitiveness so exquisite that his record of it sounds occasionally morbid and unreal . In short , his character like his career was an alternation of extremes . The turbulent annals of the // Romantic movement can scarcely show a more representative hero than the young musician who on that summer afternoon taught the mob to shout its song of liberty , and fainted from pure pleasure as the great tune came surging and echoing about his ears . He was born at La Cote St Andre , near Grenoble , on December 11 , 1803 . His father , Louis Berlioz , was a country doctor with a wide reputation and a large practice ; something of an author , too , and an intelligent , cultivated man , who rather prided himself on having no enthush sms and no prejudices . Madame Berlioz , on the other hand , seems to have been a typical woman of the mountains , ardent , affectionate , narrow-minded , devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great world and its unknown temptations . The one looked upon an artistic career as a risk which no sensible person would think of incurring , the other saw a vision of cabarets and green-rooms , of billets-dar/X on the table and bailiffs at the door , and shrank in horror from the idea of a life so little in accord with the traditions of respectability . Never , perhaps , was there a more unfortunate milieu for a man of genius . Handel , who was also a doctor 's son , found one staunch supporter at home ; Schumann after a long struggle succeeded in conciliating his mother 's antagonism ; but Berlioz had both battles to fight at the same time . No opportune ally came to carry him off , as Frankh carried off Haydn ; no Crown Prince surrounded his early efforts with the splendours of imperial patronage : alone and unaided he had to scale an immovable earthwork of argument under a galling fire of appeal and invective . The very tolerance which Dr Berlioz showed to Music as a pastime only accentuated his // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Madame Berlioz bore to her son only strengthened her voice to testify against his pursuits . From the moment when the boy was old enough to think for himself he found that his foes were those of his own household . However , the difficulty did not arise at once , and the early years passed happily enough . We have many pleasant vignettes of the child-life : the sunny slopes of St Andre , the Isere winding through its rich golden fertile plain , ' the first Communion in the Convent of the Ursulines , the Virgil lesson where the boy broke into a passion of sobs over llido 's lament , and his father , with a kindly tact , closed the book , saying , That will do for to-day , I am tired . ' Before he was twelve years old Berlioz had fallen hopelessly in love with a Mdlle . Estelle Gautier , a tall , slight girl of eighteen , with splendid shining eyes , a mass of hair that might have waved on the casque of Achilles , ' and , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what was the matter with me , ' he continues , but I suffered acutely , and spent my nights in sleepless anguish . In the daytime I crept away like a wounded bird and hid myself in the maize fields and the orchards . I suffered agonies when any man approached my idol , and it makes me shudder even now when I recall the ring of my uncle 's spurs as he danced with her . ' There is a tone of sincerity about this which saves it from being altogether grotesque ; and we may add that the impression was never effaced . Forty-nine years after Berlioz made a pilgrimage to see his Estelle , and nearly broke down during the interview . Meantime Music was beginning to assert itself . // The boy found a flageolet in a neglected drawer , and made such dire noises on it that his father in self-defence taught him to play . To this succeeded the flute , and later on the guitar , after which practical instruction came to a standstill . It is noticeable that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the piano . Wagner , indeed , could play a little , though he was not in any sense a pianist , but Berlioz 's attainments never rose higher than crashing out a few chords , ' and he re-mained to the end of his life rather out of sympathy with the instrument . During his Russian visit in 1847 this disability was nearly proving serious . ' Harmony was learned , after a fashion , from the treatises of Rarneau and Catel , and the first result ap-peared in the composition of a sestett and two quin-tetts for flute and strings . These were afterwards destroyed by their author , who criticised his own works almost as rigorously as Mendelssohn himself , and the same destiny awaited the next production ? a set of songs from Florian 's Estelle . It must have cost Berlioz something of a pang to burn these scraps of autobiography . However , one of the quin-tetts furnished him with a theme which he afterwards turned to account in the overture to the Francs Juges , and the most lugubrious of the songs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important still is the fact that he came across some musical biographies and some fragments of Gluck 's Orfeo in his father 's library . The former roused his enthusiasm , the latter carried it to fever heat . He fell upon the music as Cowley fell upon Senseror Wagner upon Beethoven . It was the // first time that he had ever seen work which combined perfect melody with real dramatic force , and we can well understand that when he compared it with the obscure scintillations of Pleyel 's quartetts and Drouet 's concerti he must have felt Like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken . Dr Berlioz observed these symptoms with growing concern . Music was all very well in its way , but where was that Interest in medicine which ought to be manifesting itself ? Again the time was drawing near for the choice of a profession . Something must be ( lone at once or it would be too late . And so the good doctor , remembering the schoolmaster in Horace , who promises his pupils a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his study , showed him Munro 's Anatomy , and said , Here is your work . Persevere at it and you shall have a beautiful flute , with all the new keys , from Lyons . ' It was , of course , a very short-sighted policy , but for the time it triu , nphed . Berlioz set himself reluctantly to master the structures of mesentery and oesophagus , and in spite of repeated failures contrived by the time he was nineteen to learn all that his father could teach him . The situation was natural enough . It is not everyone who can foresee the stateliness of the swan in the awkward movements of the ugly duckling . To piece out Maribrouk ' imperfectly on an old flageolet does not necessarily give promise of a Symphonie Fantastique or a Damnation de Faust . And meanwhile the doctor 's gig stands at the door ; the doctor 's patients are waiting throughout the country-side ; there is an old-established practice , a reputable // name , a certainty of competence and comfort ? what more reasonable than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an occupation where he will make his living and do some good to his neighbour ? He need not repress his music altogether . It will be a pleasant relaxation for him when his day 's work is done . But business first : let him learn to do something useful and he may spend his leisure moments as he likes . Accordingly , in 1822 , he set out for Paris with his cousin Robert , bound for the Medical School , and feeling , no doubt , rather like a condemned criminal on his way to the galleys . But the first day in the dissecting-room was too much for him . He gave one glance round the accumulated horrors , leapt from the window , and fled home , declaring that he would rather ( lie than return to that charnel house . ' It a little spoils the story to add that , under considerable pressure from Robert , he ultimately did return ; but although he liked some of his lecturers ? notably Atnusat , Thenaud , and Gay-Lussac ? he never felt for medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , as he says , he went on stoically , and might have added another to the long list of bad doctors if he had not paid a visit to the Academie de Musique . Ibi omnis effusus labor . They were playing Salieri 's Danaides , an opera written under Gluck 's direct supervision , and it struck home . Back came all the reminiscences of Orfeo ; back came all the old ambitions and enthusiasms ; away flew all the prospects of a medical career . After a short struggle , the conclusion of which was foregone from the first , he threw down the scalpel , established himself in the // public library of the Conservatoire , and began to devour Gluck 's scores with an appetite sharpened by long abstinence . He read and re-read them , copied them out , learned them by heart , talked about them day and night , and at last wrote off to his father to announce that the die was cast , and that come what may he would be a musician . Dr Berlioz argued , commanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the letters in the intervals of composition , but showed no sign of returning to obedience . The ugly duckling was outside the gate , and not all the clatter of the farmyard could call him bay k . It was in the Conservatoire library that he first met Cherubini . The new director had signalised his accession to office by some stringent disciplinary laws , and , among others , had issued an edict that men and women were to enter the building from opposite sides . Berlioz , of course , did n't see the notice . ' He presented himself at the wrong door , brushed by the servant who tried to stop him , and in a few minutes had drowned all memory of the incident in the depths of Alceste . Presently steps approached , and a voice said , Here he is . ' He looked up . IIottin the porter was standing at his elbow , and beside IIottin was a thin , cadaverous figure , with a pale face , tumbled hair , and fierce gleaming eyes , that glared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene that followed has been dramatised once for all in the Memoires . Cherubini began by scolding , continued by forbidding Berlioz the use of the library , which he had no right to do since it was public , and finished by commanding I Iottin to seize the rebel and carry him oft to prison . ' // Then , before the eyes of the astonished readers , began a vigorous chase , which only ended when Berlioz reached the door and flung back a Parthian shaft to the effect that he was soon coming back to study Gluck again . ' It may be presumed that on the next occasion he entered from the Faubourg Poissoniere : but one would rather like to know what Hottin said to him when he let him in . The next thing was to find a master , since it is easier to copy Gluck 's scores than to imitate them . So one morning Berlioz presented himself at Lesueur 's door armed with a letter of introduction , a cantata , and a canon for three voices ? a rather pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a better choice . Lesueur , who was then Professor of Composition at the Conservatoire , had been all his life a supporter of the dramatic Ideal in Music , and had even suffered some persecution in the cause . Ile gave his visitor a kindly reception , read the cantata through , and said , There is a good deal of power in your work , but you do n't yet know how to write , and your harmony is one mass of blunders . Gerono will teach you the principles of harmony , and when you have mastered them sufficiently to follow me I shall be glad to receive you as a pupil . ' In a few weeks Berlioz was ready , and the lessons began in earnest . Meantime the pupil was working hard on his own account . He set Florian 's Estelle , dramatised by his friend Gerono , and inspired , no doubt , by a vision of pink shoes . He wrote a blustering ' bass song on words from Saurin 's Beverley , and finally he accepted a commission from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chance . He was to have an So Hector Berlioz orchestra of a hundred picked musicians ; a still larger choir ; Valentino the leader at the Opera to conduct ; the work was to be performed on Innocent 's day , when the church would be crowded ; fame and fortune were sure to come , and La Cote St Andre would be convinced . Alas ! for the moment La Cote St Andre triumphed . On the day of the full rehearsal there appeared a chorus of thirty-two , a band consisting of nine violins , a viola , an oboe , a horn , and a bassoon , and a set of copies so full of mistakes that the whole performance broke down . To make matters worse , the next letter from honk commented on the failure , ' and drew some very pointed moral lessons on the subject of self-will and obstinacy . But Berlioz was undaunted . Ile rewrote the whole work , copied it himself , borrowed 1200 francs from his friend Pons , invaded St Roch once more , and scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well deserved . The music he describes , with his usual candour , as ' a bad copy of Lesucur 's style , with the same casual inequality of colour ' ; and it is worth adding that when he heard it for the second time , three years later , he incontinently burgled it , in company with Beverley , Estelle , and a Latin oratorio on the Passage of the Red Sea . Towards the end of 1823 Lesueur got him into the Conservatoire . Fortunately this step did not necessitate a personal interview with the director , and Berlioz was firmly established in his place before he was officially introduced to the dread potentate who had chased him round the library table a year before . They were predestined to antagonism : the one cold , liulnal , severe , a living model of the ancien regime Hector Berlioz 8 1 in Music ; the other violent , enthusiastic , and as revolutionary as Mirabeau . Cherubini , too , had a touch of malice , a sting which his insubordinate pupil was never tired of irritating ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into a rather sordid account of petty tyranny and contemptuous defiance . Even after the Conservatoire days there was never more than a hollow truce between them , and Berlioz is always happiest when he can tell a story at his old master 's expense . It may be admitted at once that the whole right did not lie on the younger man 's side . Many of the faults which his masters found in his work were real defects ? defects which he never entirely erased ? and he might undoubtedly have written better if he had not regarded Lesueur 's harmony as antediluvian ' and Reicha 's counterpoint as barbarous . ' At the same time it is difficult to avoid thinking of Beckmcsscr and Walther von Stolzing when we read that , on presenting himself for his first Conservatoire examination , he was promptly and ignominiously plucked . This brought matters to a climax at La Cote St Andre . Ilere was an unanswerable argument at last . A musician who failed to answer a few rudimentary questions in the grammar of his own art ? why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dr Berlioz wrote off a peremptory note to say that supplies would be stopped unless the prodigal returned at once . Lesueur ? good , easy man ? tried to act as mediator , and of course made matters worse . There was nothing for it but that Berlioz should go home and plead his cause in person . His reception was chilling enough , until , after a few days of dumb despair , his father , who was a kind-hearted man with F // all his sternness , relented at the sight of the boy 's misery , and gave him one more chance . If after that you fail , ' he said , you will , I am sure , acknowledge that I have done right , and you will choose some other career . You know what I think of second-rate poets : second-rate artists are no better , and it would be a deep and lasting sorrow to me to see you numbered among the useless members of society . " Certainly the doctor came well out of this interview ; but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always shown to her s , 11 's profe , , sion was not likely to be mitigated by his ill success ; ; the voice which she had raised in prowhile his chances still hung in the balance grew more vehement now that the scale had apparently turned against him . Ilis utmost entreaties were not strong enough to win over her consent , and at last , after a most painful scene of tears and recriminations , she dismissed him in open anger . When he left his home a few hours afterwards she would not see him to say farewell . He had set his will against hers , and the very love which she bore him only intensified her jealousy towards her rival . Berlioz went back to Paris with a heavy heart , His allowance of 120 francs a month was none too large , and he owed Pons 1200 francs for the concert expenses at St Koch . But he lived in a garret , he dined off bread and dates , he taught anyone who would learn of him , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his debt . Then came misfortune . His kindly creditor found out his privations , and wrote to tell Dr Berlioz , incidentally mentioning that there were still 600 francs to Come , and that his son would certainly starve if he // tried to pay them by the same means . It was a re-markable instance of the effect of indiscriminate benevolence . Dr Berlioz paid Pons ? and stopped the allowance altogether . He felt , no doubt , rather annoyed that the first result of the hard-given per-mission should present itself in the form of a dun . But it is ill trying to expel nature with a fork . Berlioz worked day and night , attended all his classes , took all his pupils , wrote an opera on Les Francs , u es , which was immediately refused , and finally , on the brink of starvation , secured a place as chorus singer at the Theatre de Nouveautes . His competitors were a weaver , a blacksmith , a broken-down actor , and a chorister from St Eustache , so that his victory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , and that was some-thing . He found a compatriot as poor as himself , and they set up house together , like a couple of Murgcr 's Bohemians , rich through all their poverty in the two most splendid of human possessions-youth and freedom . About this time he began to study Walter Scott , and wrote an overture to Waverley , a fine breezy composition , somewhat open to criticism in its structure , but stronger and simpler than his more famous works , and showing already that mar-vellous intuition of orchestral effect which has made his name proverbial . There must have been some-thing Irish in his blood . The harmony , counterpoint , and form which he learned from the best teachers in Paris are very frequently defective , while his most indisputable title to immortality lies in the orchestra-tion , for which he had no master at all . Spring came round again . Berlioz passed his preliminary examination and entered for the Prix // do Rome . This admirable institution , the core and centre of the Paris Conservatoire , is a travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two to be spent in the hrench Academy at Rome , the third in Germany , and the two last in Paris . Unfortunately the conditions were rather academic in 1826 . The selected candidates were locked up in separate rooms , with a piano , a pile of music paper , and a Classical ' poem , and set to write a lyrical scena for one or two voices and orchestra . On the completion of the work , for which twenty-two days were allowed , the composi-tions were submitted to the professors , and after their ballot to a onrpletc jury of the AcadCmie des Meaux Arts ' painters , sculptors , architects , engravers , etchers , not excluding even the six musicians . To : rid their decision the scena was rapidly played over , but the only accompanying instrument allowed was the piano , and the compositions were criticised accord-ing to a trzbulaztur of the most rigorous formal rules . The subject for this year was the death of Orpheus , and it is needless to say that when Berlioz got among the Bacchanals he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His work was declared unplayable , and he was excluded from the competition . Nothing in the whole matter seems to have angered him so much as this mutila-tion of his orchestral effects . By destroying them , ' as he says , with pardonable exaggeration , the piano at once reduces all Composers to the same level , and places the clever , profound , ingenious instrumentalist on the same platform with the ignorant dunce who knows nothing of this branch of his art . The piano is a guillotine , and severs the head of noble or of churl with the same impartial indifference . ' // French opera was at this time in a most deplorable condition . Rossini had just finished his term of engagement at the Theatre Italien , and the whole direction was in the hands of his successor Gerard , Krcutzcr of the Academic de Musique , and Castil-Blaze of the Odeon , three operatic showmen who treated masterpieces as gypsies treat stolen children . ' Not only did they correct Cluck 's instrumentation , like our modern Composers who write additional accompaniments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner , but they remodelled and travestied whole works by way of adapting them to the taste of the Parisian populace . Zauberflote appeared as Les Mysteres d'Isis , by Mozart and Lacnith , ' Freisclaiitz was voted too classical for the boulevards , except in the mutilated form of Robin des Bois ; even Rossini 's ' melodious cynicism ' and Gretry 's delicate humour were hacked and disfigured with the same remorseless cruelty . It is only fair to add that England was not much better . The bills of Covent Garden during the same period are a lasting shame and reproach even to Philistia . Indeed there seems to have been no limit to the presmuption of editors and impresarii during the early part of this century . Nageli corrected ' one of Beethoven 's sonatas . Habe-neck and Fetis did the same with his symphonies . Ilaslinger altered the key of Schubert 's so-called Ele'gie Impromptu from G-flat to G. Fancy a picture dealer who should commission his assistants to repaint Titian 's inappropriate ' backgrounds or secularise Angelico 's monastic ' colouring . Against this vandalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat in the pit and avenged the wronged great soul of an // Ancient Master ' with the most trenchant criticism , delivered in the most stentorian voice . It is a wonder that he was not turned out , as Dumas was on a famous occasion , but somehow he kept his place , and established a reign of terror over performers and audience alike . This , it may be remarked , was not the most politic way of furthering his fortunes . The authorities naturally thought that their pupil would be better occupied in studying counterpoint at home than in preaching insubordination at the opera-house ; and they expressed their opinion by rejecting him with ignominy when for the second time he presented himself as it candidate for the Prix de Rome . They were not going to waste good money on an idle scapegrace while there was so much docile mediocrity waiting ; to be rewaucicd . In September 1827 an English company came over to the Odeon to play Shakespeare . It included Liston , Abbott , Charles Kemble , and above all Miss Smithson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ophclia and Juliet at once took the theatre by storm . Paris was growing a little weary of the trim close-cropped Versailles garden in which , ever since the reaction against Hardy , the French drama had been content to move . ' Le froid petit Racine ' had for the moment lost his hold on the hearts of his countrymen , and England and English freedom were in vogue . Letourneur 's translation was in everybody 's hands : plays had been adapted out of Othello and Macbeth , the Debats had published article after article in praise of le grand Shakespeare , ' and at last came the chance of seeing in their original form dramas that stood to Le Cid and Athalie as the ocean to a lake or the open heath to a square-cut lawn . // Berlioz only witnessed two performances ; but they were enough . He raved of Shakespeare . He followed Miss Smithson about with gaunt and hungry eyes , until she thought he was mad , and asked her friends for protection . IIe spent nights of sleepless misery wandering through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forgot his ambition , he forgot Cherubini and the Prix de Rome , everything except his hopeless passion and his most beautified Ophelia . ' At last he roused himself to the resolve that he would give a concert of his own works , in the sole hope that she might hear of it . I will show her , ' he said , that I too am an artist . ' There was something heroic about it all . He worked sixteen hours a day to copy his parts ; he half-starved himself to save the money for his chorus ; he bearded Larochefoucault , the Secretary of Fine Arts , and obtained his consent . . . . and then Cherubini put his foot down . The only available concert hall could not be used without his leave , and this he absolutely and peremptorily refused to give . And when Berlioz , armed with a new injunction from the Minister , rode over the director 's opposition , Bloc turned out to be an entirely inadequate conductor , the Mort d'Orpleee broke down at rehearsal and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the acme of misfortune , Miss Smithson never heard of the concert at all . Thus does the most fickle god in Olympus reward his faithful votaries . Fortunately a distraction was at hand . Beethoven 's symphonies , which Paris had hitherto known only in mutilated fragments , began to make their appearance at the concerts of the Conservatoire . Like Corneille 's play , they were condemned by the magistrates , ac88 Hector Berlioz quitted by the people . ' Berton , Baer , Kreutzer , Cheru-bini I held obstinately aloof , while the public listened with the same bewildered enthusiasm which it had lately shown towards the creator of Romeo and I ! mulct . Berlioz was on fire at once . He even dragged out l , esucur to hear the C minor , and narrates with a pleasure that is wholly free from malice the effect In minced on his old master by that greatest of all instrumental works . About the same time Humbert remind , who had written him the libretto of the francs JI'e 's , gave him a place on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to eke out his scanty income by an occasional article on musical subjects . So in spite of all his troubles he contrived to live , and even to nerve himself for a third attempt at the CO eted I'rix de Rome . The subject for 1828 was taken from Tasso 's Jerusalem , the story where Herminia escapes in dis-guise from the beleaguered city and goes to cure Tancred of his wound . Berlioz , as usual , followed his own judgment , wrote a song andante which the programme said should be agitato , and con-sequently missed the prize by two votes , one of them being the director 's . Ile obtained the second prize , a laurel wreath , a gold medal , and a free pass to the opera-house . It seems , somehow , to accentuate the irony . 1829 was in many ways an eventful year . In the first place , he came across Goethe 's Faust in a French translation , devoured it with his accustomed voracity , ; Intl immediately set eight of the lyrics , and published them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled and destroyed , l brought him a kind letter of encouragement from Marx of Berlin , and afforded some material which he used in Le Dam-nation de Faust seventeen years after . A more im-portant result of his admiration for Goethe was the composition of the Sympkonie Fantastique , which he at once offered to the Theatre de Nouveautes . This time the performance broke down because there were not enough desks for the orchestra . The directors had not known that a symphony necessitated such elabo-rate preparations . Still , two movements , Le Bal and Le Marche au Supplice , were attempted at rehearsal and even in their imperfect form created a furore among the players . Next came a Fantasie Drama-tique on Shakespeare 's Tempest , a curious unequal piece of work , for five-part chorus and orchestra , with a rather lame Italian libretto and some very effective scoring . It was composed for Gerard , whence no doubt the choice of language , but the resources of the Theatre Italien were inadequate to meet Berlioz 's extensive demands , and he transferred his music to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his next programme . This time the blind forces of nature entered into competition . Berlioz 's Tempest was nothing to the thunderstorm which burst over the streets of Paris on the night of the concert . The Fantasie was performed to an audience of under two hundred , and the most unfortunate of all Composers resigned himself to another defeat . But the Prix de Rome would have made amends . As winner of the second prize in the preceding year // Berlioz had a sort of lien on success , and he worked away vigorously enough at the ' death of Cleopatra , ' which had been chosen as subject of the scena i He spared no pains to conciliate his judges . He prefaced his score with a quotation from Romeo and J ? l/e 1 , and they disapproved of Shakespeare . He based his principal song on a syncopated rhythm , and they liked their music ' soothing . ' He employed a harmonic progression which is only to be found in so recondite a work as Mozart 's sonatas , and they ' could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In one word , he did his best , and as 13otcldicu candidly admitted , they found his best too good . ' So this year the prize was not awarded at all . There is no defending ? this piece of extreme in-justice . Berlioz was in actual want . He was doing the work of two men on a pittance so small that it is a wonder how he escaped starvation . His exercise was of exceptional merit . On the jury 's own showing he distanced all competitors . In repute , in ability , in achievement he was fully entitled to a prize , which would have meant five years ' freedom from poverty and its attendant worries . He had kept every condition which officialism could impose , every rule N+hich pedantry could formulate , and he lost his reward , not because his work was open to blame , but because there was not one of his critics who had enough knowledge to understand it . All this time his passion for the fair Ophelia ' was steadily burning . He wrote her assiduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' did repel ; ' he // got one of his overtures performed at a benefit where she was to play , that he might see his name beside hers in the programme ' ; finally , he took lodgings opposite her house , only to find that she was leaving Paris in a few hours . In despair he sought out his friend Hiller , then a boy of eighteen , with a hand-some Jewish face and bright eyes , to gain that con-solation which disappointed lovers always find in talking of their misfortunes . IIiller listened , sympa-thised , and told the whole story to an inamorata of his own , Mdlle . Mooke 3 the pianist . Unfortunately he added that he was not likely to be jealous , ' and his fickle mistress at once undertook to convince him that the unlikely is that which happens . She transferred her affections to the newcomer , rallied , comforted , encouraged , made appointments , and the result may easily be divined . It was like the situa-tion in Heine 's ballad , only , as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the Revolution , and on its turbid flood Berlioz at last sailed in to victory . The Mort de Cleepatre had taught him a lesson . With diplomatic astuteness he wrote his new cantata , Sardanapalus , in the stiffest , most academic style of which he was capable , and left out altogether the con-flagration scene , on which the artistic value of the work depended . The professors were overjoyed . Kreutzer , red with the blood of Beethoven 's sym-phonies , recognised the hand of a fellow-adapter ; Boieldieu realised , with a sigh of relief , that the harmonies were such as a plain man could under-stand ; Catel left his roses to vote for music as inno-cent as they ; even Cherubini 's rigorous patriotism // could discover no trace of German influence in the composition . Berlioz won the prize , and immediately completed the cantata to his own satisfaction . Even now Fortune had one more shot in the locker . The Conservatoire gave a public performance of the successful work on the prize day , and the whole of Paris came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all ; the audience was on tiptoe with expectation ; a few habitues who had been admitted to the last rehearsal whispered to their neighbours that ' these early numbers were all very well , but there was something corning which would make you jump . ' There was a moment of breathless anticipation ? a feeble tremolo from the violins ? a wild cry ' from the conductor ? a book went spinning across the desks ? and that was all . The horns had miscounted their bars , and the explosion flashed in the pan . But Berlioz remembered St Roch . He was not easily beaten , and he determined that his Sardanapalus should get a hearing before he left for Italy . Accordingly he organised another concert at the Conservatoire , with a programme consisting of the prize cantata and the Sympbonie Fantastique , mended his score , interviewed his horns , and at last secured an adequate interpretation of the two works . The symphony aroused a good deal of criticism , some of which was well deserved , but on the whole the concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student life . It must have been a proud moment when he ' looked through all the roaring and the wreaths ' and saw Franz Liszt , not ' patient in his stall , ' but applauding with that generous appreciation which the great pianist showed to all his contemporaries . // Having won the Prix de Rome Berlioz character-istically discovered that he did not want to leave Paris , and even petitioned the Minister of the Interior to let him off his Italian journey . This , of course was impossible , so he took an affectionate farewell of Mdlle . Mooke , with many protestations of eternal constancy and frequent correspondence , stopped to receive the congratulations of his parents at La Cote St Andre , and set out from Marseilles in the ap-propriate company of a batch of Modenese con-spirators . On arrival in Rome he presented him-self to Horace Vernet , the director , and took his place in the noisy , light-hearted , idle colony of the Villa Medici . It was an easy time . Beyond the necessity of sending home an occasional piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wander in the Borghese gardens , to watch the carriages on the Pincian , to go for long rambles to Frascati or Ostia , and , above all , to compose what he pleased with no fear of academic supervision . II THE SIEGE OF PARIS THE day after his arrival Berlioz was introduced to Mendelssohn , then in his twenty-second year , and already known in as one of the first Composers in Enrol ) , .. In order to understand the curious onesided relation between them it is necessary to realise that Mcndelssohn numbered among his existing compositions the Octett , the Reformation Symphony , and the Midsummer Nig-lat 's Dream , that he was keenly sensitive to perfection of form , and that his musical sympathies were as narrow as they were intense . A critic who could speak of Schubert 's greatest quartett as schlechte musik ' was not likely to have much in common with the author of the Symphonie Fantastique . And at the first interview , when Berlioz modestly expressed his dissatisfaction with the opening allegro in Sardanapalus , Mendelssohn took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , I 'm so glad . I was afraid you liked it . ' Still , in spite of an entire incongruity of aim , the two became good friends , and almost constant companions . The kindliness and geniality of the one robbed his criticisms of their sting , and added warmth to his rare approbation ; the bolsterHector // ous spirits of the other broke out in schoolboy tricks that were never malicious and often amusing . It was not until the publication of Mendelssohn 's letters that Berlioz learned how low his abilities were rated by the man whose esteem he valued so cordially . ' Meantime news from Paris had been growing more and more intermittent . Berlioz became anxious , im-patient , miserable , and at last set out for France , in defiance of all academic rule , to discover the reason of this mysterious silence . At Florence he was detained by an attack of quinsy , and on the first day of convalescence 2 received a curt note from Madame Mooke announcing her daughter 's marriage . The fair comforter ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no emergency , however unexpected , can baffle a strong character . Without a moment 's hesitation the disappointed lover determined to proceed to Paris and kill everybody concerned . He loaded a double-barrelled pistol which he had with him . He put two phials of poison into his pocket . He went to a dressmaker 's on the Lung ' Arno and bought the costume of a lady's-maid , in which astonishing dis-guise he proposed to exhibit himself at Madame Mooke 's door . He was so preoccupied with his plan of revenge that he left his dress in the coach and had to get another at Genoa . He looked so desperate that the police , in terror for their country , // refused to let him pass Turin , and sent him round by the Riviera instead . And then came reflection . After all it was no use burning his ships . The pro-ject might fail in spite of all precautions ; it was had strategy to cut off every chance of retreat . So he wrote to Vernet ' asking that his name might be provisionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait at Nice till he got his answer . As the days passed his scheme looked less inevitable . Ile began to realise that the sun was shining , that it was pleasant to lie all day among the orange trees and sleep out at night on the slopes of the Ville-franche hills , In less than a week he had relented , and another of his most cherished creations had ' brolen down at rehearsal . ' As if to add the finishing touch to this remarkable story , Berlioz declares that the time he spent at Nice was ' the happiest in his life . ' He completely recovered his spirits , bathed , rambled , played billiards with the officers of the garrison , and wrote the overture to King Lear , one of the freshest and most original of his compositions . Indeed he might have taken up permanent quarters at the Villa Cherici had not the local Dogberry arraigned him on suspicion of sketch-ing the fortifications and sent him back to Rome . At Rome he fell in with the influenza , and for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most disheartening malady . Indeed , apart from this , the country was growing more and more antipathetic to him . He had no sense of toler-ance , no feeling for the careless facility of Italian life , no recognition of the value which even superficial // beauty may possess ; and his letters during the rest of his stay recall Ovid 's complaints from Tomi , or Heine 's from England . IIe tells a characteristic story of his rushing into a musicseller 's and de-manding some piece of Weber 's which he wanted to see . Never heard of Weber , ' said the shopman , ' but here are II Pirata , La Straniera , I Montecchi e Capuletti , La Vest . . ' Basta , basta ! ' roared Berlioz . ' Non avete dunque vergogna ? Corpo di Dio That was his verdict . He was always calling upon Italy to be ashamed of itself ; of the rough horseplay of its Carnival , of the Church music , ' only fit for Silenus and his crew ' ; of the opera , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was played by a woman , as Figaro sometimes is at the present day . Even the scenery of this ' garden peopled with monkeys ' was not to be compared with Dauphiny . The wine was a ' thick oily drug , ' and the populace a collection of thieves and vaga-bonds , who had not even the merit of looking picturesque . Clearly we can not lay very much stress on judgments delivered in so injudicial a temper . Of course he did little or no work . By the terms of his prize he was compelled to offer one piece of music per annum to the Conservatoire , so he sent the Resurrexit from his old St Roch mass , and narrates with great glee that the professors failed to recognise it , and returned him some academic compliments on the progress that it displayed . Beside this he re-vised the Symphonic Fantastique , wrote its sequel , Lelio , which is almost entirely . a pasticcio of earlier compositionsand sketched an overture to Rob // Roy , which he afterwards completed and destroyed ? Among shorter compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on words translated from Moore , a few choruses , and last , but greatest , a setting of Victor Hugo 's La Captive , ' which he wrote on a walking tour at Subiaco . It is without doubt the finest of his songs , and turns to a nobler use that feeling of melancholy which was steadily embittering his daily life . The fact was that he had grown home-sick , not for France but for Paris . Musical Italy was entirely given over to that little shrimp 13ellini , ' while at home they were performing ; Beethoven 's Choral Symphony , and 1'aganini was giving concerts , and opera meant something vertebrate . The struggle was of short duration . After eighteen months he could stand it no longer , and petitioned to be let off the rest of his travelling time . The petition was granted , and in May 1832 he started to leave Italy with as light a heart as most people feel on enter-ing it . The first news that greeted him on his return was the intelligence that Miss Smithson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay through the winter to fulfil another theatrical engagement . It was an odd coincidence , for Berlioz had returned to produce a work in which direct reference was made to her , and had taken as his lodging the room which she had vacated on the previous day . He accepted the omen . In spite of his inconstancy he had never lost the memory of his old passion , and he now took up the thread at the exact point where the Fates had // cut it short two years before . But , with a character-istic division of allegiance , he determined to give his concert before he visited the theatre , of which she was directress , for fear that he might again become unmanned by seeing her . It must be re-membered that all this time he had not even made her acquaintance , and that she only knew of him by a report that was not altogether favourable . Further , she was far too busy to think of attending concerts , and Berlioz for his part was most anxious that she should stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majeure . Berlioz was over-persuaded into sending her a ticket ; she was over-persuaded into accepting it ; the allusion to Ophelia was too plain to be misunderstood : in a few days she received a wild letter begging for an interview , and by the end of the year they had plighted troth . As usual the clouds began to gather at once . Dr Berlioz disapproved of the marriage , and Miss Smith-son 's relations were furious . The former refused his consent , the latter filled the air with unscrupulous reports of madness and epilepsy . Then came the failure of the English Theatre ; and as culminating misfortune Miss Smithson broke her leg in stepping from her carriage , ' and had to give up all thought of her profession . As soon as she recovered Berlioz made the preparations for a civil marriage , only to see the wedding contract torn up before his eyes in the notary 's office . At last , in October 1833 , they were married by banns , and the stormiest year of all this stormy life passed away into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was no hope zoo Hector Berlioz of assistance from either family ; but she was mine , ' says Berlioz , and I defied the world . ' So the little menage went on happily enough in spite of circumstances . Madame Berlioz was a frank , fearless woman , who loved her husband and cared little for hardships . Berlioz was devoted to his wife , and had an absolute faith in the ultimate success of his work . And somehow or other there was always enough to cat , and a roof to keep out the weather , and Liszt was lodging close by , and would come in late at night to recompense their day 's labour with the II'aldrtein or the ! ' atkc7ique . Once Madame Berlioz attempted to make a reappearance at the theatre ; but the public had forgotten her , there was e new favourite , and the attempt was not repeated . Towards the end of December Berlioz gave another concert of his own works , under the direction of Gerard . was afraid to conduct in person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? a curious admission from a man whose whole work was orchestral . At the end of the performance the Composer stayed behind to chat with the band as they packed up their instruments , and on turning round to the door found himself confronted by the strangest figure he had ever seen . Imagine a long , lean , bloodless face , with a large nose , little brilliant eyes , and black hair that fell curling and clustering upon the shoulders , a body so thin and gaunt that it seemed literally composed of skin and bone , a hand and arm like a white handkerchief on the end of a stick , ' and you have Paganini . IIe came forward , stammering in broken French his admiration for the music that he had just heard , took Berlioz 's address , and in a short time called upon him with a commission . r // I have a wonderful viola , ' he said , a real Stradi-varius , and should greatly like to play it in public . Would you write me a solo for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Berlioz was in special sympathy . He nearly always gave it a prominent part in his scores , and one of the wisest of his proposed reforms in the Conservatoire was to rescue it from the broken-down violinists to whom it was usually entrusted. , After a little demur ( for Paganini was himself a composer , and had to be treated with deference ) he accepted the commission and started upon the Childe Harold symphony , originally intended as a fantasia in two movements , and afterwards enlarged to the orthodox four . Paganini stayed to see the opening allegro , com-plained that there were too many bars rest for the solo instrument ( a criticism typical of all virtuosi in every age and clime ) , and then left for Nice under doctor 's orders . Thus the first performance of the work ( November 23 , 1834 ) took place in the absence of the man for whom it was written . The audience applauded with some cordiality , and even encored the Pilgrims ' March , but the critics , led by Fetis ( whom Berlioz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) , were fierce in denunciation . There is no doubt a great deal in the work to which exception may justly be taken , but like so many of its Com-poser 's creations it began by being arraigned for its defects , and ended by being condemned for its virtues . By 1835 the musical arena was pretty full , and all Paris was looking at the spectacle with keen interest . // Berlioz had joined four papers ? the Renovateur , the Monde Dramatique , the Gazette Musicale , and the Decbats ? from which he hurled invective and defiance at the retrogrades , while Fetis the younger retaliated with abuse . La Caricature published a satire on Le Musicicn Incompris , ' and Arnal burlesqued the Syrnphon e 1%antastique with his Episode de la vie d'un joueur . ' From the second repetition of the first allegro , ' says the actor gravely , I wish you to understand how my hero ties his cravat , ' a gibe which , however ill-expressed , contains a very fair parody of Berlioz 's interminable programmes . One does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music is Intended to express , and Sonate , clue veux-tu ? ' is not by any means the criticism of a Philistine . Unfortunately Berlioz hated feuillcton writing , and would readily have let his theories fight their own battle had not the birth of his son Louis brought a new mouth to feed into the little establishment of the hue Ncuve St Marc . But the work was gladly undertaken and abundantly repaid . Nothing in all Berlioz 's life is more bright and serene than the continued relation of love and confidence that subsisted between him and his son . Apart from one angry letter ? and that written under stress of great mental worry ? there was never the shadow of a misunderstanding between them . They were companions almost from the first , and when the boy grew up and entered the navy it is very touching to see how wistfully his father bore the parting , and with what anxiety and pride he watched the successful career to its premature close . The compositions of the year are neither very numerous nor very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon , began a funeral cantata ' a la memoire des hommes illustres de la France , ' and worked off and on at his opera of Benvenuto Cellini , but it is quite clear that journalism was leaving him very little time for other pursuits . Once , ' he says , remained shut up in my room for three whole days trying to write a feuilleton on the Opera Comique and not able even to begin it . Sometimes I remained with my elbows on the table , holding my head with both hands . Some-times I strode up and down like a soldier on guard in a frost twenty-five degrees below zero . I went to the window looking out on the neighbouring gardens , the heights of Montmartre , the setting sun . . . . and immediately my thoughts carried me a thousand leagues away from that accursed Opera Comique . And when on turning round my eye fell on the accursed title inscribed at the head of the accursed sheet of paper , so blank , and so obstinately waiting for the other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply overcome with despair . There was a guitar standing against the table : with one kick I smashed it in the centre . . . . On my chimney two pistols were looking at me with their round eyes . . . . I watched them for a long time . . . . I went so far as to bang my head with my fist . At last , like a schoolboy who can not do his lesson , I tore my hair and wept with furious indignation . ' ' This is like the ' drangvolle Umstande ' amid which Beet-hoven sometimes wrote , with the additional misery of an entirely uncongenial occupation . Still , on October zd , he tells Ferrand that Cellini is nearly finished , and on December 16th that it has been accepted // ( incomplete ) by Duponchel . It was not actually ready for performance till 1837 . Meanwhile the post of director of the Gymnase Musicale fell vacant . Berlioz applied for it , and lost it through the influence of M. Thiers , who apparently pi eternal King Log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government commissioned the unsuccessful candidate to write a Requiem for the victims of the Fieschi conspiracy . For the work they offered the munificent sum of 4000 francs , but on Berlioz replying that he would require 500 musicians they repented of their generosity and cast about for some diplomatic meals ; to delay the performance . Then followed stormy interviews , fierce visits to Government offices , clerks with their eternal ' Ca nest pas nn , n affiaire , ' a dishevelled applicant thundering and gesticulating in the Minister 's sanctum , till , towards the end of 1837 , news came that General Damremont had perished under the walls of Constantine , and Berlioz was told that his Requiem would be wanted after all . Accordingly , the gigantic work was performed in the Church of the 1 nvalides , and nearly broke down owing to the incompetence ( or perhaps malevolence ) of Habeneck , who had some prescriptive right to conduct . Berlioz himself took up the baton at the critical moment and saved his forces from rout . Four thousand francs are soon spent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public showed some reluctance to purchase compositions which it could neither play nor sing . The Professorship of I iarnwny at the Conservatoire fell vacant , but Cherubini was still director , and Berlioz soon found that his application was so much waste paper . We can not , ' // said Cherubini , give a post of this nature to a man who is not a pianist , ' a reply which is almost impudent in its dishonesty , seeing that the great Master himself only used his piano as an aid to composition , and that Bienaime , on whom the post was finally bestowed , was no more of a virtuoso than Berlioz . Trouble followed trouble . ilenvenuto Cellini had been accepted at the Opera , but there were vexatious delays before it could be taken in hand , and when the rehearsals did begin they were not very satisfactory . Berlioz was not allowed to conduct the work himself and Habeneck could not be induced to learn the tempi ; the band grew insubordinate and behaved as it does in the Soirees de l'Orckestre ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest , and supplemented it with some practical jokes of their own ; and , worst of all , Duprez was a failure . In his Souvenirs d'un Chanteur ' the great tenor expresses his opinion of the We with some freedom ; in any case he was out of sympathy with the music , and did not sing his best until the sestett in the last act . The result was that the opera met with a fate that is probably unique in the history of dramatic art . The overture was encored , and the rest of the work hissed with admirable energy and unanimity . ' After three days of it Duprez threw up his part , and the work disappeared from the bills . So far the story has been tragic enough , for there is no tragedy darker than the continued failure of high aims . No doubt Berlioz 's reach often exceeded his grasp ; no doubt there were faults of immaturity and one-sidedness in his productions , but the fact remains that he was the greatest French composer of his time , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hector Berlioz he wrote his best . We of these latter days , with all the heritage of the Romantic school behind us , are less likely to condemn ideas because of their novelty , or to restrict our judgment to an unthinking defence of prescriptive tradition . Indeed some of us are inclined to err in the opposite direction , and permit Music to be ugly provided it succeeds in being new . It is the necessary outcome of a lack of scientific principle that criticism should be either invertebrate or ossified , awl in both cases the man of genius suffers . But from the failure of llenvenuto Cellini opens a new chapter , in which triumph succeeds defeat . Not that Paris relented , for she remained obdurate until the end , but the prr plc ? t who was so little honoured in his own country began to find adequate recognition and homage abroad . It started with Paganini . That eccentric genius heard the Harold symphony at a Conservatoire concert , rushed on to the stage at the conclusion of the performance , knelt in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him a complimentary letter and a cheque for 20,000 francs . It is said , on Rossini 's authority , that the gift really came from Bertin the editor of the Debats , and that Paganini was merely the channel through which it was bestowed . ' l'lis is so exceedingly improbable that it may possibly be true ; in any case it does not touch the main issue of the story or colour the streak of dawn that was beginning to show on the horizon . Of course the episode was the talk of Paris , and equally of course it provided hostility with a new weapon . But Berlioz was too happy to fight . He paid off his debts , threw up his journalist work , and started at once on his so-called Romeo and Juliet Hector Berlioz io7 symphony . To it succeeded the Syanphonie 1+unebre et Triomphale for the fete of the July Column , and the brilliant , light-hearted Carnaval Remain overture , founded on a saltarello which he had already used in his unfortunate opera . It is needless to say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hooting and derision , so at the end of 184o Berlioz shook the dust of Paris off his feet and started to try his fortunes elsewhere . There is in human affairs a strange law of com-pensation by which if a man have two supreme interests he is almost certain to succeed in the one and fail in the other . For the past seven years Berlioz had found at home the solace which gave him strength to fight his wearisome battles in the world of Music . Now he was on the frontier of his triumph , but in order to enter it he had to step across the grave of his married life . Where the fault lay it is impossible to determine . Madame Berlioz grew jealous and morose , her husband began to give cause for both , and the climax was reached when she abso-lutely refused to hear of his leaving Paris on his proposed journey . There was no open quarrel , but the breach grew wider and wider , until an amicable separation was inevitable , and towards the end of 184o it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that after the separation they often met on terms of friendship , and that the most touch-ing and genuine of all Berlioz 's letters is the one in which he speaks of her death fourteen years later . After a short preliminary flight to Brussels ( where we first hear of Mdlle . Recio , une cantatrice assez mediocre , ' who afterwards became his wife ) , Berlioz returned to Paris , organised a colossal concert by // way of leave-taking , had the usual disturbance over it , and then set out in good earnest to conquer Germany . He travelled from Cologne to Berlin , from Zurich to Copenhagen , gave concerts in all the musical centres , and established a firm reputa-tion throughout a country which Schumann 's Neue Zeitschrift articles 1 had already predisposed to give him welcome . Mendelssohn offered him every facility for producing his work at Leipsic , exchanged batons with him in token of amity , and even praised the treatment of the double-basses in the Requiem , just as he afterwards told Wagner that a canonic answer in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was always a little touch of Atticus in Mendclssolin 's relations to his fellow-composers . Schumann broke out of his usual taciturnity to praise the Ofertoriitm , with its chorus on two notes ; the King of Prussia regulated his royal engagements so as to hear Romeo and Juliet at Potsdam ; Stuttgart , Weimar , Frankfort , Dresden , Hamburg , opened their gates in turn , until the campaign became one long triumphal procession . Berlioz himself describes the adventures of his travels in a series of letters written to friends at home ? Liszt , Heller , Ernst , Heine , even Habeneck , whom the conqueror seems to have included in a general amnesty . And the burden of all the letters is the same : I am successful ? let them know it in Paris . ' It is rather pathetic to see how constantly his thoughts reverted to the great , brilliant , unsym-pathetic city that had treated him so ill . By the middle of 1843 he was back in France and hard at work on a new opera , La Nonne Sanglante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period belongs La Tour de Nice , a remarkable work , interspersed , ' as ' But at the first performance so much of the hissing was provided by the audience that the Composer withdrew the piece and destroyed it . One would like to know whether he really intended it seriously , or whether it belongs to the same category as Rossini 's famous practical joke , I due Bruschini . A short time before M. Billet , director of the Opera , had proposed to give a performance of Freischiitz , supplemented by recitatives in place of the spoken dialogue , and by the addition of a ballet , without which there would be little hope of any audience . This was better than Castil-Blaze and Robin des Bois , but it was profanation enough , and we read with some surprise that Berlioz consented to write the one and to score the Invitation a la Valse ' for the other . If I do n't , ' he said , with logic as irresistible as that of Cowper 's schoolboy , someone else will . ' It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most admirable pieces of workmanship that have ever been turned out , but none the less the principle of adaptation is a bad one , and no one knew this better than the offender himself . ' And , oddly enough , Berlioz violated his own principles in an even more flagrant manner at his next concert , by giving the scherzo and finale of Beethoven 's C f r o Hector Berlioz minor symphony without the rest . Worse than all , the two movements were sandwiched in between the prayer from Masaniello and that from Mose in l , ritto . It almost seemed as though his nature were growing demoralised by continually catering for a Philistine public . However the summer 's work knocked him up , and he was sent off to convalesce in the south of France , remembering , as he says , another conval escence through which he had passed in the same district thirteen years before . He gives in the Grotesques de la Musique a delightful account of his holiday . The cabman who drove him about Mar seilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is only one of a whole gallery of sketches ; the harpist at Lyons , whose part con sisted of two notes , and who , to make sure of getting them right , removed the rest of the strings from his instrument ; the aggrieved stranger who sent Berlioz an anonymous letter made up of the following aphorisms the autograph collector who stole his hat ( r it was such a bad one , ' he says modestly , that I ca n't ascribe the theft to any other motive ' ) , and a host of others , all described with the same gaiety and good humour . Once restored to health Berlioz began to yearn for new conquests , and in 1845 he set out on a tour through Austria . He began with Vienna , where , of all people in the world , Donizetti was Kapellmeister , Hector Berlioz I i I and it is interesting to reflect on the welcome accorded to the Composer of Lelio by the Composer of La Favorita . Beside Donizetti there were several musicians of European celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , among whom Berlioz was very soon at home . His concerts were well attended and cordially received , he was feted by the artists and applauded by the populace , he even succeeded in getting an introduction to Prince Metternich and talking music to that versatile diplomatist . One of the compliments that he won was characteristic enough . He was standing in the Salle des Redoutes listening to the delicate waltz-rhythms of Strauss ' orchestra when a stranger rushed up , seized his left hand , and burst out , Sir , you are French and I am Irish , so there is no national amour-propre in my opinion . I beg your permission to grasp the hand that wrote Romeo . Ah ! sir , you understand Shakespeare ! ' Certainly , ' said Berlioz ; but you are mistaken in the hand . I always write with this one . ' From Vienna he went on to Pesth , suffering a good deal on the way from bad roads and copious inundations . He took with him a new weapon in the shape of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Viennese amateur as an appeal to Hungarian nationalism . Politically speaking it was rather a perilous achievement , for Deak was then at the height of his influence , and there was plenty of inflammable material lying ready to hand . Artistically it was one of the greatest successes of the tour , and roused the whole room to a fever of delight and enthusiasm . It is difficult for even a cold-blooded English audience to hear that electrical music unI // moved , and we may well imagine what effect it pro . duced upon the emotional , impressionable crowd , with whom its very name was sacred . After Pesth came Prague , where he was received by Liszt and Ambros , and after Prague Breslau , where he was mistaken for De Beriot and entreated to give violin lessons . All this time he was working at the cantata on which his English reputation chiefly rests , Le Damnation de Faust . He made his own libretto , borrowing now and then a hint from Gerard Nerval 's translation of Goethe , and set it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the Introduction , one of the best numbers in the whole work ; ut Vicuna the Elbe scene , Mephistophiles ' song , ' Voici des Roses , ' the Sylphs ' Ballet , and the Rakucky March ; at Pesth the Ronde des Paysans ; at Prague the main part of Marguerite 's Apotheosis ; and at Breslau the rather dull Chorus of Students . The rest was completed in Paris , where the first representation was given in November 1846 to a scanty and apathetic audience . It was a cruel disappointment to him . After all his successes abroad he had reason to hope that his countrymen would receive him with some show of cordiality , and he found that they had profited by his absence to forget him altogether . ' Noes avons un grand malheur en France , ' says M. " Thomas , Woos sommcs refracta-res a F admiration . ' Once more Berlioz turned his eyes to the frontier . Like Napoleon after Jena he realised that there were only two more powers to subjugate ? Russia and England ? and accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forces to St Petersburg , stopping at Berlin on the way to get some letters of introduction from the King of Prussia . // he did not much enjoy the journey , since his courier proved to be a brother artist , who used to delay the carriage at the post-houses in order to jot down some wretched dance tune , which he would at once hand on to his patron to harmonise . It is said that there have been some prosperous composers in England who have adopted similar tactics . The concerts at St Petersburg were most successful , except for the Carnaeal Remain overture , which for some reason the Russians did not like ; but at Moscow occurred a hitch in the arrangements which very nearly prevented Berlioz from getting a hearing at all . The Nobles ' Assembly room was the only available concert hall , and the Grand Marshal 's permission was necessary before it could be used . Berlioz called upon him . What instrument do you play ? ' asked the Marshal . None , ' said Berlioz . In that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To have my compositions performed and conduct the orchestra . ' ' Ha ! , That is an original idea . I never heard of a concert like that . You are aware that if permission is given the artists who make use of it are obliged in return to perform at one of the private gatherings of the nobility ? ' No , ' said Berlioz blankly , I did n't know that . ' If you are unable to fulfil this condition , I regret that I have to refuse you , but I can not do otherwise . ' Next day Berlioz came back , interviewed the Marshal and the Marshal 's wife , offered to play the tambourine at their next at home , if they did n't H rr4 Hector Berlioz mind his playing it badly ( he was always the most audacious of applicants ) , and finally got the inexorable rule waived for one occasion . But he could not give a second concert , and had to return to the Capital with the feeling , to which travellers in Russia are not unaccustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a short stay at St Petersburg he returned home through Prussia ( dining with the King at Sans Souci ) , spent a week with his father at La Cote St Andre , and then went on to Paris , where his friends had so far recollected his existence as to be plotting against him . Mention has already been made of La Nonne Sang/ante , an opera which Berlioz had begun in 1843 on a libretto borrowed by Scribe from Monk Lewis . At the present moment Berlioz wanted two things , one to get his opera finished and accepted by Rodueplan , the other to obtain some official post iu the opera house . Roqueplan , who owed his position a good deal to Berlioz 's influence , played off these two wishes against each other . ' It would n't do , ' he said , ' for your work to be performed if you are officially connected with the place , so if we are going to appoint you the best thing you can do will be to let us have your libretto , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the coast clear . ' The logic is perhaps less clear . In any case Berlioz , in a fit of disgust , allowed himself to be fleeced by this confidence - trick , gave up his opera , and of course heard no more of the appointment . The libretto was offered to Hal6vy , Verdi , and Grisar , and finally accepted by Gounod . However owever there came at the same time ( October Hector Berlioz i 15 1847 ) an offer which , as he says , with pardonable irony , allowed him to exchange la belle France for la perfide Albion . Jullien , the potentate of English Music , was in sore need of a new sensation at Drury Lane , and invited Berlioz over to conduct a season of Grand opera . The terms were handsome enough ? on paper ; io , 000 francs for the conductorship , another 10,000 for the expenses of four concerts , and a commission to write a three act opera for the second season . He accepted with alacrity . Art in France is dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go where it still lives . ' In less than a week he was established in Harley Street and hard at work on his new duties . The result was a fiasco beside which the Parisian disasters were trivial . Jullien , as might be expected from his compositions , had not a very high ideal in Music ; and so , while the executive resources of the English Opera were above praise , the repertoire was confined to Balfe 's Maid of Honour and Donizetti 's Lucia di Lammermoor . Even these failed to pay expenses , and when Berlioz put on Gluck 's Iphigenie en Tauride , and met with another defeat , the treacherous impresario started off on a foraging expedition in the provinces , and left an unpaid conductor to conciliate an unpaid chorus . Before the spring of 1848 the whole establishment was bankrupt , then came the Chartists and the French Revolution , and by the middle of the summer Berlioz was sitting on the ruins of the Faubourg St Antoine moralising over the instability of human fortunes and the difference between promise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1851 he came over as a member of the jury at the great Exhibition , and wrote an admirably z 1 6 Hector Berlioz fair and lucid report on the merits of the competing instruments ; in 1852 and 1855 he was engaged as conductor of the new Philharmonic Society , and pro-duced at Exeter I-Iall his Romeo symphony and some selections from his Faust . But these short periods of expatriation only intensified his love for Paris . He was ( lever at his ease away from the boulevards , and found even the hospitality of London colder than the neglect of his own countrymen . Still , he was in closer sympathy with our methods than any other great artist of his time , and it is worth noting that one of the deal est : and most convincing of his criti-cal essays is devoted almost entirely to a review of English musical institutions . ' In July 12+48 1 ) r Berlioz died , to the great grief of his son . Since the birth of Louis the two had been entirely reconciled , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cote St Andre , where father and son talked over old troubles and new successes with entire sympathy and confidence . It speaks highly for both that the one could admit his mistake and the other find justification for it : the Doctor frankly rejoiced that his prognostics had not been fulfilled ; the Composer recognised the affection that had underlain repression and antagonism , and recalled the past without a word of complaint or a thought of bitterness . Indeed in some respects the opposition to his wishes had been of real service to him . Had he been allowed to follow his natural bent from the first he might possibly have paid for the greater case by some sacrifice of originality . It was the sense of revolt which sharpened his faculties to their utmostand drove him in the sheer despair of Hector Berlioz I I 7 rebellion , to trust to his own resources and develop his own methods . There is little fear of compromise if one knows beforehand that nothing will be accepted short of an unconditional surrender . And , by this time , the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained but a memory of loving care and kindly companionship . Among the productions of the year may be mentioned the Treatise on Instrumentation , which is , oddly enough , numbered among the compositions as Op. 10,1 and the Chceur des Bergers , afterwards included in the Enfance du Christ . The story of the latter is well known , but will bear repeating . One evening there was a card-party at the house of a friend . Berlioz , who felt as far out of his element as Herr Teufelsdrockh at an " Esthetic Tea , ' was sitting apart , bored and unoccupied , when an idea struck him . He called for pencil and paper , ruled lines , and began to sketch out a simple chorus , rather after the style of a Christmas carol . When it was finished he proposed to put his friend Duc 's name at the bottom , was dissuaded , and finally invented a 17th century Maitre de Chapelle , by name Pierre Ducre , and had the work performed as his . All Paris fell into the trap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know better , led the chorus of praise , critic after critic applauded the antique severity of the style , and the public even went so far as to declare that M. Berlioz could never write a work like that . ' The most curious part of the story is that , although there are some slight traces of Gluck 's influence in the harmoniesthe composition is entirely modern in t 18 Hector Berlioz spirit and could no more have been written in the 17th century than in the 1st . When the appro-bation was at its height Berlioz acknowleged the authorship , to the intense disgust of his opponents , and proceeded to extend the work to the Fuite en E.ify t , and afterwards to the Sacred Trilogy , which stands as his one effort at oratorio ) With the death of Dr Berlioz the Ne ; noires ( written in 1848 ) come practically to an end , and the materials for biography during the next twenty years ate confined to a few supplementary chapters , a handful of letters , and the records of external incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of ltrrlioz 's life seems less eventful than the rarlier . IIc had grown tired of writing a diary which was ' as wearisome as a feuilleton , ' and he was never a very methodical correspondent . The war still continued , but he found less pleasure in recounting its triumphs or railing at its reverses . His life , too , was growing very lonely . He was separated from his wife , his son was away on foreign service , and his father 's death was followed in a short time by that of his favourite sister Nanci . There was only l " errand left . Isis visits to England in 1851-2 seem to have been fairly prosl , eroUS , and his concerts at Exeter Hall were well attended by the public and well received by the press . But on his return to Paris the old troubles recommenced . Scudo attacked him and the other critics followed suit ; the concert room of the Conservatoire was closed to him by a ministerial in-trigue ; news of the success of Benvenuto Cain ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlioz 1 1 9 Garden ; and it is not surprising that , under all these difficulties , he grew daily more morose and suspicious , and began to find indifference in everyone who was not an enthusiast , and hostility in everyone who was not a partisan . The death of his wife at the beginning of 1854 roused him for a moment from the sordid troubles of his career . There is something bracing in a great sorrow , at any rate when it supervenes on a number of petty cares ; and we can have no doubt that in spite of everything Berlioz was deeply attached to his Ophelia , and felt her loss keenly . After the separation , which had been mainly forced on him by her manner of life , he had often pinched himself to supply her wants ; and he once narrates with pathetic simplicity that he threw aside a symphony on which he was working because she was ill and he could earn more for her by journalism . On the other hand , it is true that for the past fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recio , and that the first use he made of his freedom was to marry her . ' It is a tangled story , which biographers of the present day may well be content to leave unexplained . Unfor-tunately the second venture was more disastrous than the first . Mdlle . Recio was a singer of small capacity and high ambition , who frequently imperilled the success of her husband 's work by insisting on the prima donna 's part in its performance . It was a ready judgment on his infidelity that after closing his home to one of the greatest artists in France he should have opened it to one who was only worthy of figuring in Daudet 's collection of Fenemet d'Artistes . I20 Hector Perlioz In 1855 came the Paris Exhibition , and Berlioz was commissioned to write a Te Deum for its opening and a cantata , L'Imperiale , for its close . The latter disappeared into the void the day after its production , but the former , at which he had been working on his own account ever since 1849 , may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even more colossal in its scale and more exacting in its requirements . Among the subscribers to its publication were the Czar , the Kings of Prussia , Saxony , I I:uiover , and 13elgiuin , and Queen Victoria . Possibly this blaze of royal patronage did something to clear the myopic vision of the Second Empire , for in the next year Berlioz won the greatest distinction which an artist call obtain in France ? a fauteuil in the Academy . He had already received the ribbon of the Legion of Honour , and a short time after this his list of public rewards closed with his appointment as Librarian to the Conservatoire . There is no doubt some fitness in his ending his days as the authorised custodian of those very scores from which in the beginning he had been hounded by an irate director . I t appears to be the custom in France , if an institution is unsuccessful or inadequate , not to reform it but to set up a substitute in its place . Consequently the comparative failure of the opera house encouraged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the banks of the Seine , with M. Carvalho as manager . Berlioz , to whom every event was an opportunity , watched the new erection with anxious eyes , and set about the composition of an opera which he intended should be his masterpiece and its talisman . From earliest boyhood he had been a // passionate admirer of Virgil ; he knew much of the . Eneid by heart , and had often solaced his solitary rambles among the Apennines with its noble pathos and the flow of its matchless verse . Accordingly he chose Les Trayens as his subject , wrote a libretto , which was read and approved in the Hotels Rambouillet of the day , and began with his usual rapid enthusiasm to set it to music . The work was in two parts , one on the fall of Troy , one on the episode at Carthage ; and the enormous canvas soon filled with colossal figures of Anchises and IEneas , of Cassandra and Dido . But it is one thing to write an opera and another to get it performed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out entire and replaced by the short prologue which now appears at the beginning of Les Troyens a Carthage ; then followed vexatious delays , hope deferred , suspicions of treachery and intrigue , and all the weary round which Berlioz had trodden so often . At last a culminating blow fell when , in 1861 , the theatre , which had declared its resources inadequate to his requirements , put on Wagner 's Tannhauser by order of Napoleon . TannJzauser failed dismally , owing to the organised opposition of Parisian Chauvinism , and Berlioz was furious enough to triumph over its downfall . ' Ah dieu de ciel ; quelle representation ! ' he wrote next day to Madame Massart , ' Quels eclats de rire ! Le Parisien s'est montre hier sous un jour tout nouveau ; it a ri du mauvais style musical ; it a ri des polissonneries d'une orchestration bouffonne , it a ri des naivetes d'un hautbois : enfin it comprend donc qu'il y a un style en musique . Quart aux horreurs i1 les a sifflees splendidement . ' ' Ah ! je @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week later . I 2 2 Hector Berlioz Revenge , however , is a double - edged weapon . When Les Troyens did at last come before the public it was treated with as scant ceremony as its rival , and Chain produced a very popular caricature in which 7annluiuser is represented as a baby asking to see his little brother . The ' masterpiece ' only ran for three weeks , and then disappeared from the theatre , the fortune of which it was intended to secure . Berlioz never recovered the shock of its failure He realised that he had shot his last bolt , and that it had missed its mark . At one of the performances there was a fair house ( including Meyerbeer , who attended every time ) , and his friends tried to cheer hint I ) y saying , ' Eh bier ) ! les voila qui viennent . ' ' Uui i ! s vienncnt , ' said the Composer sadly , ' mais moi je in'cn vain . ' Two happier incidents lightened the close of this troubled career . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera of Beatrice et Benedict , which in 1862 was produced under his direction at Weimar , and met with a great and well deserved success . Again , in 1867 , after refusing an offer of Ioo , 000 francs to go to New York , he accepted an Imperial invitation to Russia , and was welcomed with even greater cordiality than had been shown him on his previous visit . But the death of his wife , and still more of his son Louis , severed the last ties that bound him to the world ; he was attacked by a severe nervous malady , struggled down to the south of France , and there for the third time found convalescence . It was from life 's fitful fever that he was suffering , and there was only one cure possible . At his own wish they carried him back to die in // Paris . He had loved the splendid city with an intensity which not all its heartlessness could diminish : his only thought had been for its service , his only hope for its applause : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but one more plea for recognition at home : even his suspicions of cabal and intrigue have something pathetic in them , for he could not believe that his own people were alien from him at heart . He died on March 8 , 1869 , and was buried in the cemetery at Montmartre , Gounod and Ambroise Thomas being among the pall-bearers . The Academy sent a deputation of honour , on the bier were wreaths from Italy , Hungary , and Russia , and the procession was headed by the band of the National Guard playing the funeral march from the Syrnphonie Funebre et Triomphale . It is , perhaps , not fantastic to find in that work an epitome of its Composer 's life : the tragic power of the first movement , with the flashes of brilliance that only deepen the gloom on either hand ; the pause by the grave side , and the solemn words spoken over the dead ; and , lastly , the song of triumph , which , in spite of the complaints of a dilettante pessimism , is the certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III ESTIMATES AND APPRECIATIONS I N criticising the works of a great composer there are only two questions which it is of any moment to consider . We may ask what was his power of itnal ; ination , we may ask what was his command of technical resource , and there inquiry must stop . Nothing is gained by a comparison of styles , for the critic is bound to accept all ; nothing is gained by an expression of sympathy for one ideal rather than another , for there are only two possible ideals in Music , and both are equally worthy of regard . It would be as great an error of judgment to condemn the Romantic school in the light of Classical tradition as to decry the masterpieces of Bach and Palestrina because they lack the passion and fervour which belong to a later development of musical feeling . If , therefore , we wish to estimate Berlioz fairly we must take him on his own ground , find out what it was that he intended to express , and then see how far he was successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the postscript to the Mt moires , a manifesto which puts his case in the clearest possible words . Generally speaking , ' he says , ' my style is very bold , but it has not the // slightest tendency to subvert any of the constituent elements of Art . On the contrary , it is my endeavour to add to their number . I never dreamed of making music without melody as so many in France are found to say .... The value of my melodies , their distinction , novelty , and charm , may of course be disputed . It is not for me to estimate them , but to deny their existence is unfair and absurd . ' And again : The prevailing characteristics of my music are passionate expression , intense ardour , rhythmical animation , and unexpected effects . When I say passionate expression I mean an expression determined on enforcing the inner meaning of its subject , even when the feeling to be expressed is gentle and tender or even profoundly calm . This is the sort of expression that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ciel scene of the Damnation de Faust , and in the Sanctus of the Requiem . ' Here , then , we can see Berlioz 's mission as he himself conceived it ? not to establish a new kingdom but to enlarge , the boundaries of the old ; not to supersede existing forms but to animate them with fresh life ; and , above all , to make Music a language for the communication of definite poetical ideas and impressions . No doubt he often used his axe with considerable vigour ? j'aime tant a faire craquer les barrieres , ' as he said ? but the fact remains that he enrolled himself in the army of Gluck and Beethoven , and fought to extend their territory , not to conquer it . And now we may apply the two tests formulated above , the test of inspiration and the test of skill . There can be no two opinions as to the existence of great imaginative power in his work . The very pace at which he often composed is in itself sufficient i t 2 6 Hector Berlioz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ; the Pilgrim 's March in Harold improvised in a couple of hours ; the Elegie , one of the wildest and most complicated songs in existence , was created in a single flash , while for the Lacrymosa in his Requiem he had to invent a system of shorthand in order to embody the ideas that came too fast for ordinary notation . And it must be remembered that this rapid production is not like the facility of a Hasse or a Gyrowetz , flowing with a diluted repetition of current commonplace ; the thought here is absolutely new , and is presented with a fulness of detail which none but a master could have conceived . There may he in the earlier compositions some traces of Beethoven 's influence , and even some echoes of Gluck , and perhaps Spontini ; but every artist must be the child of his circumstances in the initial stages of his work . Beethoven himself begins under the shadow of Mozart , and nevertheless did he emerge later into the free light and air of an artistic person ality . Indeed we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of Music who has more claim to originality than Berlioz , not one who has more right to say with Corneille On the other hand we must confess , unwillingly enough , that the purity of his imagination was not on a level with its force , and that he wholly lacked that sense of reticence and repression which should be its necessary complement . His thought is some-times impaired and degraded by that touch of defile nuent which pathologists note as a possible symptom of insanity ; and he never seems to have reflected Hector Berlioz i 27 that , even in the spiritualised language of Music , there are some things which it is better not to say . Two stories will make this clear . During his stay at Rome he conceived the plan of a grand opera ( fortunately never carried out ) in which an impious and licentious potentate should organise a bur lesque Last Judgment , as a mockery to the prophets who denounced him , and find , as the curtain fell , that his pigmy trumpets were silenced by the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during his second visit to London he attended the children 's service at St Paul 's , was immensely impressed by its beauty , as Haydn had been before him , and on leaving the cathedral fancied that he saw the whole scene travestied in Pandemonium . It is to this unwholesome morbid element in his nature that we owe the orgies in Harold , the Chorus of Devils in Faust , and worse than either , the horrible Ronde du Sabbat in the Symphonie Fantastique . And as an inevitable consequence , he is almost entirely wanting in the real epic touch , the white Alpine sublimity of Beethoven 's Mass in D or Brahms ' Sclaicksalslied . He can inspire wonder but not awe , terror but not reverence , and much of the work which he intended to be most impressive resolves itself into a series of scenes which some-times rise to the level of the Inferno , and oftener sink to that of the Musee Wiertz . One region , then , and that the highest , must be regarded as closed to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether as the Missa Pape Marcelli , or the Messiah , or the C minor sym phony . He comes near the line in the Sanctus of // his Requiem , and perhaps the final chorus of the Enfance du Christ . But as a general rule his attempts to express pure religious emotion are either dull , like the Easter Hymn in Faust , or pre-occupied , like the Pilgrims ' March in Harold . Still there is much opportunity for noble achievement in lower fields of poetry , and of this he has made abundant use . Like Ben Jonson , in Mr Swinburne 's estimate , if he does not belong to the Gods of melody , at any rate he may be numbered among the Titans . In the first place he has a complete mastery over the whole gamut of fear and pain . The stupendous crashing force of the Tuba Illirum , the Lacrymosa , echoing with the agony of a panic-stricken world , the fude.r Ctederis from the Te Daum , which reiterates higher and higher the expectation of the Great Judge and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scale , and carried out with an unerring certainty of effect to which we shall hardly find a parallel . Berlioz 's music , ' says Heine in his Lutece , has generally something primitive or primeval about it . It makes inc think of vast mammoths or other extinct animals , of fabulous empires filled with fabul-ous crimes , and other enormous impossibilities . He is a magician , and he calls up Babylon , the hanging gardens of Semiramis , the marvels of Nineveh , and the vast temples of Mizraim . ' On a lower level , but not less remarkable in execution , is the ride to the Abyss , where Faust and Mephistopheles gallop through a pestilential air , filled with horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy , ' till the end comes , and the most tragic figure in all dramatic poetry sinks with a despairing cry to meet his doom . To say that these things are not worth portraying is // simply to remove the landmarks of artistic expres-sion . Everything is worth portraying which is not essentially foul or obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dignity of treatment . No doubt the story of Faust is intrinsi-cally horrible , anal Berlioz has fixed upon its least sympathetic aspect . But it is not until we come to the hideous chorus of gibbering fiends that we feel that the legitimate bound is exceeded and that horror passes into loathing . A second noticeable point is his treatment of the passion of love . There is , perhaps , no form of inspira-tion in which the Composers of the Romantic school have more displayed their individuality . Chopin , the Musset of Music , is keen , delicate , sensitive , sometimes marring his thought with the querulous-ness of an invalid ; Schumann is strong and manly , loving so much because he loves honour more ; Brahms is a poet , intent on weaving a network of beautiful thoughts around his ideal ; and the diapason closes full in the perfect , glorious passion , pure and irresistible as flame , of Wagner 's Tristan . Among all these Berlioz holds ' an independent place . Apart from the Symplzonie Fantastique , to which further allusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faust and the exquisite adagio in the Romeo and Juliet symphony to sound the note of an emotion which knows that it is true and tries to cheat itself into the belief that it may be happy . For there is always an undercurrent of melancholy in his love-music , a sense of present pain , or an apprehension of coming trouble , till tragedy reaches its limit in the heart-broken Elegie , and the vindictive despair of Les Troyens . Pathos and humour are proverbially near akin , d 1 30 Hector Berlioz and we need feel no surprise that the Composer of La Captive should also have written the fencing scene in Benvenuto Cellini and Somarone 's delightful wedding cantata ' in Beatrice et Benedict . There is plenty of rough fun , too , in the Auerbach 's Keller episode of Faust , and above all in the rollicking Carnaval Remain overture . But as a rule Berlioz wrote his music seriously and kept his jokes for his feuilletons . He did not , perhaps , altogether realise the opportunities for comedy which can be turned to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy chances which have given us Papageno and Ileckinesser , La Belle Ifclene and the Mikado . Indeed , if there is any matter for astonishment at all it is that a man who possessed so keen a sense of the ludicrous should not have given it fuller expression in the art which draws as readily from the springs of laughter as it does from the fount of tears . There remains to be considered one class of poetical ideas which may be called the Spectacular : those in which the music is intended to call up some scenic display , religious , chivalrous , martial , or what not , which it presents to us in repose , with no direct appeal to emotion and little exhibition of present activity . Such , for instance , is the intermezzo in Les Troyens , which represents a forest during a hunting scene ; such is the Hymne a la France , with its stately chorus , such the strong march movement of the Menace des Francs , and the sturdy industrialism of the Chant des Ouvriers , and such undoubtedly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote picture of a cathedral interior , with dim lights and white - robed priests and a hanging cloud of incense . Under this category may come the concert // overtures , where Berlioz for once abandons his programme , and is content to indicate rather than prescribe ; and at its extreme verge may be placed the Symphonie Funebre et Triomphale , which brings us back again to the world of actual drama . So far we have examined Berlioz 's imaginative power in the light of his own principle : that Music is a definite language capable of communicating definite ideas . It is in defence of this principle that he prefaces so many of his instrumental works with a scheme or programme describing in set words the emotion which his melodies are expected to arouse , or the scene which they are intended to portray . Even the little violin solo which he wrote for Art &t; has one of these elaborate analyses on its title page , and accounts for every phrase and every modulation with the most remorseless assiduity . This principle is not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present century at any rate , Music is something more than a concourse of sweet sounds , ' that it can rouse genuine emotion in the hearer , that it can , under certain circumstances , aid in completing a picture which he already has before his eyes . But , with very few exceptions , it is not true that any given melody can be tied down to any given meaning , or that Music can by itself convey a pictorial idea with any clearness of outline . It is an inarticulate language , and lacks that purely rational element which all nomenclature implies . There is , for instance , no question about the general landscape effect of Beethoven 's Pastoral symphony , but who can tell what is meant by the allegretto of the seventh or the opening movement of the ninth ? They are equally romantic , but the ideas which they suggest are too subtle for // the clumsy embodiment of any descriptive phrase . The hearer may make a picture for himself . He may see the Love-tragedy ' in Chopin 's B-flat minor sonata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symphony , but the effect is purely subjective , and he has no word to answer to his neighbour who does n't see it . ' No doubt most dance tunes are merry , and most funeral marches are sad , and a movement entitled Storm ' may be trusted to tell its own story , but beyond these and a few similar exceptions there is no possibility of a convincing interpretation . In the theatre it is different . There we have the scene in front of us , and the music acts as an accessory , and brings our emotional nature into harmony with its surroundings . The overture to Rheingold , which is absolutely meaningless in a concert room , grows full of significance when we see the glimmer of the green water as it answers to the ripple of the strings . The Schmiedelied in Siegfried produces double the effect upon us when we hear the music rising and falling as the flames dance and leap and sink back upon the furnace . But except in opera , and within definite limits in oratorio and song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words , and still more of scenery and action , it can sometimes present clear pictorial effects : without them , never . There are two other reasons why the Programme ' in instrumental music represents a false ideal . In the first place it leaves nothing to the imagination of the hearer , and thus paralyses the one faculty which it ought most directly to stimulate . L'art d'ennuyer c'est tout dire , ' and the audience has as much right to resent the composer 's interference in this matter as // sightseers to cashier an officious guide who bores them with explanations when they want to sit still and admire . In the second place , it is painfully open to burlesque . The scherzo in Romeo and Juliet was meant by its Composer to express the delicate flight of Queen Mab and her fairy train : the critics compared it to the squeaking of an ill-greased syringe . ' The ponderous double-bass chords in the King of Thule ' ballad were written to emphasise the tragic gloom of the story ; but all thought of tragedy flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy table across the floor . ' And such parodies are only the natural outcome of a perfectly legitimate impatience . We do not want to be told what the music means : we prefer to find out for ourselves . Let the Composer write , if he will , with some clear poetical thought in his mind ? though it may be doubted whether the greatest Masters have done so ? but let him not seek to impose it upon our acquiescence . If he does , we simply turn upon his work and exclaim , with M. Bourget 's artist , ' Sois belle et tais-toi . ' This position may fairly be illustrated by an examination of Berlioz 's most uncompromising piece of Programme Music ' ? the Symplaonie Fantastique . In his letter to Ferrand ( April i6 , 183o ) the Composer tells the story which the work is intended to express with a fulness of detail which at least shows that he has the courage of his opinions . The opening adagio presents a young artist , with a lively imagination and a sensitive temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the besoin d'aimer . ' In the allegro which follows he meets his fate , the woman who realises the ideal r 34 Hector Berlioz of beauty and charm for which his heart has yearned , and gives himself up to the passion which she inspires . His love is typified by a rather sentimental melody given in full at the opening of the movement and repeated in various thematic forms throughout the whole work . The second movement proper is an adagio , in which the artist wanders alone through the fields , listening to the shepherd 's pipe and the mutterings of a distant storm , and dreaming of the newborn hope that has come to sweeten his solitude Next comes a ballroom scene , in which he stands apart , silent and preoccupied , watching the dancers with a listless , careless gaze , and cherishing in his heart the persistcut melody . In a fit of despair he poisons himself with opium , but the narcotic instead of killing him produces a horrible vision , in which he imagines that he has killed his mistress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the march to the scene of execution , a long , grim proces-sion , winding up with the idee fxe and the sharp flash of the guillotine . Last comes the Pensee d'une tete coupee ' : a hideous orgy of witches and demons who dance round the coffin , performs a burlesque Dies 1rae ' for its funeral rite , and welcome with diabolic glee a brutalised and degraded version of the original subject . And so the symphony ends with an inde-scribable scene of chaos and fury , of fiendish mockery and insult , a delirium of passion , mad , riotous , and unrestrained . Not a very noble or exalted romance it may be , but this is not the point at issue . The only question is how far Berlioz has succeeded in expressing it through the medium employed , and , with all recogni-tion of his marvellous ingenuity of w // must admit that he has failed . It is inconceivable that any hearer should write down the story from the music unless he had already some knowledge of its outline , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of vague indeterminate forms are being unduly specialised . The recurrent melody may , no doubt , symbolise a white woman 's robe , ' as Heine said , but it could equally well symbolise a hundred other things . The vigour and rush of the opening allegro no doubt suggests agitation , but it may be any one of its various forms . The ball scene , with its exceedingly beautiful waltz tune , contains no necessary thought of despair ? much less such despair as would lead to suicide . The Marche au Supplice is fierce and gloomy enough , but it might be a battlehymn or the funeral march of a warrior , and so with the other movements . They all suggest some generic form under which the particular idea may be classified , but they do not indicate the particular idea itself . And this is not through any inadequacy on the part of the composer , for Berlioz has employed all the resources of a vivid imagination to give shape and colour to his idea ; it is simply because he has tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nature it will always be incapable . There is a great deal of fine and noble work in the Symphonie Fantastique , notably in the three middle movements , but it pleases in spite of the programme , not in consequence of it . The same is the case with the Harold symphony , where the scenes are as loosely strung together as they are in Montgomery 's Omnipresence of the Deity , ' and still more with the Reverie et Caprice for Violin . It is a short fantasia in two movements , adagio and // allegro vivace ( the first being repeated entire in the middle of the second ) , pleasantly and melodiously written , though without anything fit in itself for much blame or much praise , ' unless one should censure it for some deficiencies in form . Turn to the title page and you find that everything has an inner meaning , that F-sharp minor implies despair , that a semiquaver figure is meant to symbolise doubt or agitation , and that voluptes fougueuses ' are embodied in a most innocent looking melody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Arnal and his travesties at the Bal d'Opera . But it is a pleasanter task to turn and consider the second of the two points for discussion ? the estimate of Berlioz as a musician pure and simple . After all his belief in Programmes is nothing worse than an aberration of genius , which does not really impair the intrinsic value of the work that it interprets ; and the contention has been , not that he is lacking in dramatic power , for he possesses it in a very high degree , but that its action is restricted by the necessary limits of the Art to which it belongs . So far as inspiration is concerned , his claim to immortality is incontestable ; and it only remains to examine the ability that he displayed in dealing with the various modes of musical expression . These may be enumerated under four main heads : Melody , which is roughly analogous to the drawing in a picture ; Harmonisation , by which substance and solidity are given to the melodic outline ; Form , which so groups the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible relation to each other ; and finally , le coloris de la Musique , ' Instrumentation . Under these , again , may be placed certain // subdivisions , symmetry of phrase , rhythm , modulation , contrapuntal skill , all of which fall into one or other of the above-mentioned classes . Melody , for instance , includes symmetry and rhythm as well as the actual curve ' which is presented by its succession of tones ; counterpoint and its descendant polyphony are clearly subordinate to the general principle of harmonisation , and so with the rest . Thus it will be seen that the modes of expression are themselves complex , and contain too many constituent elements to be considered from a single point of view . Now , there can be no question that Berlioz has left us some tunes of very high worth . La Captive is a complete and final answer to the critics who have regarded its Composer as unmelodious ; the love scene in Romeo is as beautiful as an adagio of Schubert ; the great septett in Les Troyens , the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero 's song , Je vais le voir ' in Beatrice at Benedict , the Sanctus in the Requiem , are only random instances of work which places him uncontrovertibly in the first rank of musicians . Equally successful , though expressive of a more easily attainable ideal , are Mephistopheles ' serenade in Faust , the ball scene in the Symphonie Fantastique , and the Aubade ' from the Feuillets d'Album . The Harold motif , too , with its curious reminiscence of the opening allegro in Beethoven 's seventh symphony , is full of a noble melancholy , while the famous idea fixe , though certainly of less value , has nevertheless a marked expression and character of its own . But every man , as George Sand said , has the defects of his qualities . Berlioz was one of the greatest masters of rhythm and modulation that the world has ever seen , and he frequently ruins his // effects in consequence . He varies his metres till he destroys the homogeneity of his stanza , he changes his key with a forcible wrench that surprises without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monotony that he often falls into restlessness . The Villanelle in the Nuits d'Etd begins in A major , and after two or three bars is thrown over the wall into B-flat ; the Pilgrims ' March in Harold , which opens with a magnificent phrase , is similarly spoiled by a cadence at the end of the fourth line ; on many occasions a good idea is abandoned where it ought to be developed , simplicity is sacrificed for epigram , directness for ingenuity , until the whole result is as depressing as a jest book . ' This is where so many young composers fail , ' writes Ilaydii in one of his letters ; they string together a number of fragments , they break off almost as soon as they have begun , and so at the end the listener carries away no definite impression . ' And yet how fine his rhythms are ! Look at the opening phrase in the King Lear overture , at the accompaniment figure in the Lacrymosa , at the fascinating tune of the Sylphs ' Ballet in Faust , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred others . Modulation is a lesser gift , for anyone can learn how to modulate , but only a genius of the highest order could have devised a metrical system of such variety and extent . And it must be remembered that devices which seem to us familiar , like the persistent figure of the Chceur des Ombres in Lelio , or the alteration of tempo in the various presentations of the idle fixe , were comparatively or entirely new in Berlioz 's day . Rhythm was then , as he says , in A Travers Chants ' the least developed of all modes of musical expression , and we may well forgive him if he sometimes // lost control of a pioneer 's enthusiasm and treated as an end in itself the power which his predecessors had under-estimated even as a means . Melody and Harmony are so closely interconnected in modern Music , that it may perhaps seem unnecessary to give the latter any detailed criticism . But , as a matter of fact , every great Composer has his own special manner of harmonisation , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastery of form or his power of melodic invention . In this respect Berlioz does not show to such advantage as in some other of the details of his Art . His harmony is rarely rich , except where it is used as the vehicle of a remote or recondite modulation , and it does not often atone for its commonplace character by any real strength or solidity . Like Gluck he is fond of massing the tenor and bass at the bottom of the chord and separating them from the treble and alto by a wide interval , witness the Pilgrims ' March in Harold and the Shepherds ' Chorus in the Enfance du Christ , but this device , though often successful on the strings , produces an unequal , knotty ' effect when used for voices . No doubt he writes his parts with extreme rhythmic independence . Many of his choral works read like operatic ensembles , in which each voice has a character and personality to itself , but even this result can sometimes be compatible with a small minimum of variety in the harmonic progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except of course when he used it for purposes of burlesque . When he attempted it seriously , as in the first chorus of the Te Deum , he usually betrayed a want of mastery , which is intelligible enough if we realise the immense
