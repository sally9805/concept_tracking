 | Those who followed the athletic contests in the big colleges twenty years ago will remember " Charley " Gill , who rowed on the crew for Yale and captained the football team when the blue was victorious over all rivals . In the fierce , hard play of those old massed elevens , just as in the gruelling four miles of the New London course , the grit and dash and sheer strength of Gill made him the dependence and glory of a generation of Yale athletes . Son of a manufacturer and the mayor of an Eastern city , with an inviting business career open before him , there was surprize when Gill matriculated at Union Theological Seminary , and still more when he determined to become a missionary in China . When personal reasons compelled him to return , some of his friends expected him to change to a rational career , but Gill disappointed them , and disappeared into the most backward and godless town he could find in Vermont . There had been no church there for twenty years . Decent people had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose fathers no one knew . Gill built a church there ? got out the lumber with his own hands . He attacked the bad morals of that town as he used to plunge into a Harvard line , and he won his game . The place is now a summer resort , where city folk bring their children for the clean and wholesome environment of the country . All about him , in communities priding themselves on their history and traditions , Gill saw churches which were steadily losing their influence and power . Buildings erected for hundreds contained scanty congregations of thirty or forty . Hamlets unable to support one minister worthily were starving two or three . Revivals had played out , and nothing was done to take their place . Churches gave their energy to keeping themselves alive and did nothing to stir ambition and arouse civic spirit in the communities . The domestic missionary societies had no sense of their responsibility to promote the general welfare , but doled out starving pittances to keep their denominations represented wherever they had once been planted . Padded church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place if he once got his name there and did not die in the town , prevented knowledge of the real situation . When anybody suggested reform and vigorous endeavor , he was scorned as a false prophet and a pessimist . Gill determined to find out the facts . He selected one county in Vermont , not the worst , but fairly representative in alternation of mountain and valley , containing the town of greatest average wealth in the state . A main line of railway traverses it from north to south , and other lines cross the corners . In proportion to its population it has furnished more names to " Who 's Who in America " than any other county in the United States . Gill got the tax lists of twenty years ago from the town clerk 's offices . Since Vermont makes every man pay a poll tax , this gave him a list of every family in the county . Then , with incredible patience , taking three years for the task , he found out the church-going habits of every family at intervals twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three townships , some of them mere mountain hamlets , with fifty-three churches , the county containing over thirty thousand people ! But Gill was determined to know . He tested his method in over a score of churches in which records of attendance had been kept , and he found that his results were conservative . Then he applied the same method to the county in New York in which Cornell University is located . The result is that while in Vermont and on Cayuga Lake , if anywhere , " The day 's at the spring , The heaven 's dew-pearled , The lark 's on the wing , " the blindest optimist can not maintain that all 's right with the old-time churches in these rural regions . Gill found that church attendance had diminished 31 per cent in the Vermont county and 33 per cent in the New York county  | in the last twenty years . He listed town after town in which the loss was 40 per cent , 50 per cent , and even as high as 76 per cent . The places are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book he has just published on The Country Church. * The smaller the town and the greater the number of the churches in proportion to the people , the greater has been the loss . Indeed , if Gill had not included the villages , but had confined his figures to the churches in farming places alone , the decline would have amounted to 40 per cent in New York and 53 per cent in Vermont . In membership the results are not so alarming , since the Vermont churches report an increase in the period of 4 per cent and the New York churches 2 per cent . How much weight should be given to these figures is shown by one church Gill reports , which had an average attendance of 75 , an enrollment of 271 , of whom only 186 were found to be living , in Vermont or elsewhere . Evidently the country churches should employ certified accountants . The Yale football man has cast a disquieting suspicion over the large figures of church adherents and increases in membership which Dr. Carroll has put out year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they to be discounted when estimating actual attendants as seriously as Gill has shown to be necessary in the two counties which he has investigated ? Harvard College was established in order that the churches of the new country might not be without an educated ministry when those who came with the colonists should lie in the dust . But despite Harvard and some twenty-five other colleges in the present New England , it appears that an educated ministry in the country churches is fast becoming a tradition of the past . Gill found only one minister out of four in the Vermont county with a college and seminary training , and fully one-third deficient in educational equipment by any sort of a reasonable standard . These ministers are less well supported than twenty years ago , one-fourth of them receiving $600 a year or less , the average for the county being $814 . The " templed hills " of New England are part of the patriotism of America . If they lapse into practical paganism and moral degeneracy , the nation will have lost the shrine at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step in the prevention of the disaster is the discovery of the exact facts and their candid publication . The honor of doing this belongs to the football man from Yale . He believes the decline can be arrested and that life can be restored to the dormant churches of the hill towns of New England . For the remedy he quotes with optimistic approval the platform of the Inter-Church Federation of Vermont . Middlebury College is holding a conference this summer to launch this program , which may well be taken as a guide wherever similar effort is needed , and we suspect it is called for in large sections both West and East . This program is as follows : 1 . We propose to take for our first endeavor the economic , social , intellectual and religious , improvement of the small towns of the state . 2 . We pledge our help to communities of this kind , especially in securing for them an efficient religious leadership : ( a ) By the promotion of summer conferences for instruction and inspiration for religious work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including correspondence courses in the country church , and in modern agriculture . 3 . We agree to outline plans for the uplift of certain districts , to assume the task thru a common effort to be made under the leadership of a committee to be chosen under the separate churches of that district , and further requesting that these churches become responsible for the special field assigned , and labor for its uplift by all possible means , but including : ( a ) The approach of the people on the side of the work whereby they earn their daily bread , and the endeavor to stimulate better farming and better living , so that Vermont boys may realize that they have a chance in Vermont . ( b ) The organization of towns for recreation and common social amusement to cure the ills of isolation and neighborhood jealousy . 4 . We believe that each religious body represented in Vermont should work first for the welfare of Vermont , and should subordinate its own promotion to that end . 5 . We promise to lay to heart the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insufficient books and supplies , inadequate buildings and grounds ? and we pledge our cooperation in any movement looking to the equalizing of educational advantages between country and city children .
