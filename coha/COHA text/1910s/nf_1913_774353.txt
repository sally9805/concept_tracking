When " foreigners " take jobs away from native workers the latter at once flare up with prejudice . Prejudice is an adverse feeling reaction that is caused by loss or the fear of losing something that one holds valuable and that is directed against the person who takes away or threatens to take away that which one considers of value to him . Prejudice is to be sharply distinguished from antipathy , which is an adverse feeling reaction arising from unpleasant sensory impressions . Race antagonism , for example , may take the form of either prejudice or antipathy . Since these reactions are entirely different in origin the processes of their development are unlike .

Conflict is that form of competition in which there is an intensification of " attention and effort . " Conflict is the most striking form of interaction : a clash of social forces . A conflict may be overt , as in the case of two fist fighters . Persons in conflict may fight viciously in broad daylight and feel no compunctions about it . Conflict may be subtle , as when opponents contend surreptitiously against each other , seeking by calumny and chicanery to undermine one another . In the neighborhood group , families may gossip about each other to the destruction of each other 's reputation . In politics whispering campaigns may be inaugurated to defeat a rival . In business , competitors may resort to pernicious underselling , and to steamroller methods of crushing one another . Nations likewise may resort to trickery in diplomacy .

Conflict that is equal ( primary conflict ) is usually a give-and-take process in which each side learns something from the other . Even tolerance may result , and later co-operation . Unequal ( secondary ) conflict occurs between unequal forces and means that the stronger force swallows up or rides roughshod over the weaker , without learning anything or acquiring new skills . The weaker contestants do not gain , for they are crushed . Neither do the stronger , for they are not stimulated sufficiently . Equal conflict might be illustrated by a game between two championship football teams , while a contest between a college team and a kindergarten team would represent an extreme form of unequal conflict which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social processes centers in co-operation . Co-operation is a mutual working together for the attainment of a common goal . People may co-operate for selfcentered gain , or for self-protection , or to do good to others . Groups , likewise , may co-operate for self-advancement , as in the case of a monopoly ; or for mutual protection , as , for in-stance , in the alliance of England and France ; or for the welfare of all groups . Persons who co-operate may generate unbounded enthusiasm . There is almost no limit to the achievements of a thoroughly co-operating group . Co-operation not only stim- ulates morale but promulgates efficiency . In order that specialization may operate constructively there must be cooperation among the specialists . Mutual aid is a special name for co-operation . Kropotkin developed the theory that mutual aid has made evolution possible . Mutual aid is a powerful survival trait . Animals destroy one another through fighting and conflict , but they survive and grow in numbers through mutual aid .

Overorganization is a deadening form of co-operation . So standardized are the " social " wasps , bees , and ants that they can hardly be said to have any social life at all . They are almost robots . Overorganization means that there are too many groups . Student bodies are often overorganized . Modern city life may be so organized that many persons spend their entire time in going from committee meeting to committee meeting . Social life may become organized to the point where life is a matter of going to one bridge party after another until the devotees suffer a " nervous breakdown " and must " go away for a rest .

Accommodation is the process of friendly give and take ? of conscious adjustment by toleration , arbitration , and compromise . After contending for a time with few gains , each  | side in a conflict learns to tolerate the other and perhaps to recede from earlier demands . It is the only feasible social process where both contending parties represent a worthy measure of truth and justice . Passive accommodation is a process in which the environment makes over the individual . " Active accommodation , on the other hand , is the transforming of the environment by the individual . Some persons have played dominant roles in transforming their physical or cultural or social environments , or all three . Often the representatives of long-established classes fail to compromise and go down in defeat . The leaders of economic , political , and other groups must be alert to social changes , and be willing to accommodate themselves to human needs .

To block it leads to revolution . Accommodation may make assimilation and amalgamation possible . Assimilation is a process whereby the attitudes of many persons are united , producing a unified group . It is the process of being conditioned to think as a unit . It is the integration of dissimilar attitudes and values , and it usually takes place without the knowledge of those most affected . Amalgamation is the process of making a new race out of various races . It is race mixture , or miscegenation . It is an exceedingly slow process , for it can not be forced very well . When assimilation has occurred , amalgamation naturally follows . Without assimilation the amalgamation of races mark- edly different from each other is opposed strenuously and penalized by exhibitions of prejudice and ostracism .

In the early years of life the narrow and egoistic impulses dominate ; in some cases they control throughout life . In fact their inherited force is so strong that life becomes a process of controlling and socializing them . In a sense discipline is a system of controlling the self-assertive impulses . Clarence M. Case analyzes what he calls " social age " in three main levels of development . " The first and earliest is that of " social awareness , " the second is that of " social enjoyment , " and the third that of " social responsibility .

While deeply grounded in inherited tendencies , both social nature and self-centered nature are developed in and through group life . Environmental stimuli often determine whether the social or the self-centered forces will become supreme . As a person matures , as he faces one harsh experience after another , as he sometimes loses that which he values highly , he grows more sympathetic and wholesomely interested in the  | welfare of others . Providing it be not overwhelming , suffering socializes . As a rule a person 's socialized nature is likely to include few persons only . With an increase in far-reaching experiences a person may come to identify himself with a whole university , a community , or a nation .

How many men , for example , join a national fraternal organization , a church , a golf club , in order to secure clients or customers . A person may be socialized toward certain groups but not toward others . He may be a kind and sacrificial husband and father , but anti-social in dealing with employees , in his racial contacts , or wherever his prejudices may direct . On the other hand , some persons are arbitrary and unjust in the family circle , or toward certain neighbors , but at the same time they treat clients or customers with fine consideration . In one sense socialization is participation ; it may be identification without any expectation of reward . It participates but does not ask : " What am I going to gain ?

If both  | are unwritten rules or public opinion , and written rules or law . Social control operates through public opinion or , in a more local sense , group opinion . Public opinion may be general and may express the unthinking and general feeling reactions of a group . Public opinion may consist of a majority opinion and more than one minority opinion . Discussion is followed by a vote , and the majority and minority results are the differentiated pro and con reactions of the members of a group after discussion has brought hidden points to the surface . The majority opinion is often called public opinion , but it should not be confused with that public opinion which is general opinion . A consensus opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each member has contributed to a truth-seeking counsel . It is quite superior to the argumentative discussion in which each participant tries to win for his side . It seeks not to win but to get at the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . Social control has strong support in written laws . A law is a rule laid down officially by a group for its members to observe . It is adjudged to contribute to the welfare of the group . By forceful , objective means it brings group standards before the attention of careless or anti-social members . By compelling the individual to live according to regulation , the group is protected and the individual may learn to develop behavior patterns built upon group welfare . The process is often painful to the individual and costly to the group . Laws begin as unwritten rules operating as group opinion . Preliterate groups lived largely by unwritten rules or laws . Among civilized people a written law may begin as an unwritten rule among a minority . It later achieves a majority recognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support is more important for a law than its written or unwritten form , although of course written laws are usually more precise than unwritten laws . Social control is directed from vantage points known as social institutions . A social institution is a standardized set of rules , including the machinery and authority for putting  | the rules into action . A social institution tends to become inflexible and rigid , and to rule with an iron hand . It is slow to adopt new methods and hence sometimes rules with a " dead hand . " As an agent of social pressure it easily becomes a tool of social repression . Undue and prolonged institutional pressure causes a virile group to remonstrate and to start a revolution . Because of the authority that social control invests in social institutions they tend to become vested interests . A vested interest is any authority-endowed social procedure or organized set of procedures , such as institutions , which rules by falling back on its past glories or its present prestige rather than on its current ability to meet human needs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social control , for it grows haughty with power and age , and permits little reform within itself . Robert M. Maclver defines an institution as a " definite organization pursuing some specific interest or pursuing general interests in a specific way . " 42 It is a means that is created by a group for carrying out its specific and general purposes . To Maclver the family is a group or association possessing a number of institutions for putting its purposes into action . Likewise a religious group or association has a number of institutions of worship which enable it to carry forward its aims . The leading social groups today which have developed institutional authority are the family , the community ( including the city and nation ) , occupational groups , play groups , educational and school groups , religious and church groups , and racial groups . In and through these the social processes function . In and through these control operates . These groups are objective integrations of personal attitudes . They hold persons steady , sometimes too steady . They furnish stimuli or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and arouse it to creative insight ..  | The psycho-social approach to the study of groups takes us into the very heart of group life . It lays bare the nature , development , and problems of personality . It furnishes the keys for understanding social problems . It points toward the prediction of human behavior.  | THE family is a small social group , composed of a father , a mother , and one or more children , in which affection is mutually shared and the children are reared to become selfcontrolled and socially motivated persons . Disagreements occur and losses are suffered , yet the family goes on . The basic psycho-social element is the fellowship which comes from the sharing of problems by a father and a mother in mutual love . Of all human groups the family is in many ways the most important . From its initial units , the father and mother , the child receives his physical inheritance , that is , a strong or weak mental and physical organism . " To be well-born is to possess the greatest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world can afford that will be adequate compensation for the lack of a good heredity . " ' In the family the child learns the meaning of social responsibility , the importance of sportsmanship , and the necessity for co-operation . The family is the outstanding primary group , for in it a child develops his basic attitudes , patterns , ideals , and style or configuration of life . When a child grows to adulthood he leaves one family group in order to establish another . After the experiences of courtship and romantic love he marries , having chosen thoughtfully or thoughtlessly a potential mother for his children that may be born into the new family group . A young  | woman , possessing a mental and physical inheritance and having received a social heritage and training from her parental family , likewise marries , having chosen thoughtfully or thoughtlessly a young man to be the father of the children she may bear . The two young people , the product of two different family groups , establish through the social institution of marriage their own family group . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an irresponsible daughter who sometimes have remonstrated against parental direction , they now play the role of responsible father and mother , training , disciplining , and worrying about their children . Thus family groups break up , new ones are established , and the process of personal growth and group change goes on . One may gain an understanding of the significance of the family group by considering its early history and development . Elemental forms of the family go back to the higher types of animal life . The mother and her brood or flock are everywhere evident from the domestic barnyard in America to the wilds of Africa . Here and there the father stands guard . Occasionally father and mother have effected a division of labor . Here and there the same mating lasts season after season , " till death do us part . " If the family has existed a million years , dating back to the early history of higher animals , it must be a highly significant type of social group . If it sprang up in response to need without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If nature prior to the advent of man instituted the family we may well treat it seriously . If it has continued in one form or other in an unbroken history since its first advent , we may ask : What is this marvellous institution ? Among some primitive peoples , the mother and child are the stable units of the family group . In this type of situation the father roamed far and wide , coming home irregularly ,  | and staying away for periods of time . The helplessness of the infant compelled the mother to lead a home life . The irregularity of the father 's habits made it necessary for the mother to gather fruit , to plant seeds , to develop hoe-culture . Engaged in the hunt and chase , the father led a more exciting life , made more social contacts , and enjoyed a wider variety of new experiences ? In some early human families the mother rather than the father was the leader a great deal of the time . She stayed " on the job . " Hence , this special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , " named after the mother . " The child took the mother 's name ? the father was not always known . Property was sometimes transferred through the mother , since she was the stable member of the parental group . The metronymic family was developed to a degree , for example , among some North American Indian tribes . The Iroquois Indians have been pronounced a metronymic people , for the government of the clans was to some extent in the hands of matrons as women councillors , elected by the males of the given clans . Where the pastoral form of life existed and where flocks and herds flourished , the father was the chief factor in the family group . Since the grazing of flocks and herds required considerable territory , the people moved about in small groups widely separated from each other . The wife and mother was removed from the influence and authority of her kindred . The husband 's power over her by virtue of her isolation was supreme . Under pastoral conditions , men owned and controlled the flocks . The owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children took the father 's name and inherited  | property through him . The eldest living son usually succeeded to the rulership of the family group . Warfare gave men increased influence over women . The women captured in war were held as slaves and wives by their captors . The form of the family with the father at the head , possessing authority over if not ownership of the wife and children , is known as the patronymic ( named after the father ) . It is the most common and best known type . The patronymic family of the early Hebrews has become world famous . The Old Testament affords many descriptions of patriarchal families , such as those of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . The ancient Hebrew family is noted for the attention and care given the children . " Honor thy father and thy mother ; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee . " Here is a fundamental principle which the Hebrew family bequeathed to the world , and which when observed but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity . Where children have not learned to respect their parents , the lasting qualities of the larger society have been rudely shaken . As a result of the unity and fidelity of the Hebrew family , the Hebrews have maintained a remarkable longevity as a people . It has been claimed that because of the unity of the Hebrew family the Hebrews , although national orphans , have survived through the centuries . Without a homeland of their own and forced to maintain themselves within other nations , often surrounded by hostile races , their family organization and their religious loyalty have been their salvation . Let their family life break down and their religion be discarded and they as a people will probably disappear . The terms patriarchal and matriarchal are to be distinguished from " patronymic " and " metronymic . " The difference is more than one of emphasis , for patriarchal or matriarchal refer to forms of control by father or mother . They suggest something of a hierarchical arrangement , with authority exercised from the top downward .  | Out of the early emphasis upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian religions . The role of the patriarchal father seems to have suggested the concept of the Fatherhood of God . The social responsibility developed within the Hebrew family is the apparent antecedent of the ideal of brotherhood of man . An overemphasis upon parental control leads to ancestor worship . According to this pattern the welfare of the living depends upon the good will of the departed . In order to insure his happiness , a man 's first duty is to rear a family that will continue the ancestral line unbroken . It has often been said that China 's emphasis upon family stability and ancestor worship explains in part her long life as a people . When we turn to the early Roman family of the seventh century B.C. , we find that it was patriarchal . It maintained itself partly on the religious basis of ancestor worship . The family group was built around the ancestral gods , and the habitation in which the family group lived was virtually a temple , with the patriarchal head possessing the power of a god over the women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the members of the family . However , he could not always act arbitrarily , for he was controlled by what he believed was the will of the ancestors . Property was held by the eldest living male member of the family ; it was held in trust for the good of the entire family . In early Roman times , this eldest living male member or house father could not make a will . At his death the property passed automatically to the oldest living son . At that time marriage was practically indissoluble and divorce unknown . It is said that for five centuries after the founding of Rome , the town had no divorces . This Roman family group possessed great stability . Although the family life was patriarchal and women and children were subjects of the patriarchal head , the family reached a higher order than that of other ancient peoples save the Hebrews . It fell considerably below Hebrew family life , however , when the latter is considered at its best .  | In the course of time the pendulum swung to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this disintegration reached an extreme , Rome herself disintegrated . It would be an interesting problem to find out how far the breakdown of family life was responsible for the downfall of Rome . To turn the problem around : If a high level of family life had been maintained , would Rome have fallen ? The disintegration of the family group was accompanied by several interesting phenomena . ( 1 ) The family began to lose its religious significance . When marriage was viewed merely as a civil contract , the family was viewed lightly . ( 2 ) The authority of the father was broken . The right to make a will was established . The father was given first the right to divide his property among his children , and then to bequeath it to whom he pleased . When the family property was thus broken up in units , and scattered , the family as an institution lost prestige . ( 3 ) Women were given the right to hold property , and in the second century B.C. the right to divorce their husbands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and were at liberty to do as they saw fir . The personal liberty of many men and women became personal license . Personal liberty overthrew personal control of sexual impulses . Marriages were made and broken freely ; temporary marriages were common ; sexual relations were loose ; and sexual immorality flaunted itself . Companionate marriages were experimented with widely . ( 5 ) The changes in economic conditions , such as the expansion of commerce and manufacture and the growth of cities , tended to destroy the social situations in which the family had been the fundamental unit . ' The decay of religious sanctions of the family , the growth of individual liberty , and the habits of vice , particularly sexual vice , which were common among Roman young men and winked at by young women , combined to change the family from a strong primary social group into a loose agreement of two individuals temporarily combined for sensual pleasures . In swinging  | from extreme to extreme the pendulum bore first the fruits of suppression and rigidity and then of inefficiency and decay . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family group to stop at no position of balanced integration . Neither domination nor license was satisfactory . Balanced integration was rarely reached . Christianity was the next influence that vitally affected the nature of the family group . Upon its Western invasion it promptly began to reconstruct family life in Europe . It arrived when the Roman family was at a low ebb , with vice rampant . It immediately attempted to reform the Roman family , and it succeeded in building an improved family life in Europe , somewhat like the old Hebrew patriarchal type , with the following emphases : ( 1 ) Christianity brought the support of religion to the family again . It recognized marriage as a sacrament and opposed the idea that marriage is simply a civil contract . It ascribed to marriage a religious nature and thus gave it stability once more . ( 2 ) Christianity exalted the position of women and children . Women were treated in part as the equals of men . The welfare of children began to receive attention . It was not a strict patriarchalism but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity . The husband and father was still supreme but not wholly so . ( 3 ) Christianity opposed divorce . When the church came into power in Western Europe , it discredited divorce as a legal institution . In the place of divorce legal separation was recognized . The church took a strict attitude against divorce and built up a type of stable , inflexible family life . The early Christian family , strict and stable , persisted in Western civilization until the latter part of the nineteenth century . In reconstructing the family in the early centuries of the Christian Era , even on semi-patriarchal lines , Christianity appears to have performed an inestimable social service .  | The stable , rigid family of Christianity , like the family of the Hebrews and of the early Romans , ultimately found itself under attack . As a result of its formal rigidity it was bound sooner or later to be shaken up . A reorganization , and a partial disintegration , of the Christian family began with the Renaissance . Many factors developed during the following centuries to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement of the family and with others bringing about its destruction . ( 1 ) With the Renaissance came the separation of church and state and the consequent weakening of the authority of the church . Hence the family again began to lose its significance as a religious institution . When marriage once more came to be regarded by many persons solely as a civil contract , the way was open for divorces , which immediately mounted upward . Where religious sentiments , beliefs , and attitudes have become disassociated from the family , many persons have gone to the other extreme of regarding marriage as a matter of personal convenience . If the religious control of the family has been too rigid , then without religion the family has often been wrecked on the rocks of personal pleasure . ( 2 ) By the beginning of the nineteenth century the movement known as individualism had reached a remarkable growth , especially in those countries in which pioneer conditions obtained . The rise of individualism was accompanied by the decline of authority in social life . The patriarchal family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either party to the marriage vows could break these vows according to his or her individual desires . An exaggerated spirit of individualism leads a person to find the guide to his actions in his own wishes , whims , or caprices . It gives him an attitude of carelessness toward the family as a social institution . This spirit , so often expressed in irresponsibility , has tended to make all social institutions  | unstable , and especially the family , for the family thrives only on attitudes of personal responsibility . ( 3 ) Economic changes at the beginning of the nineteenth century seriously affected the status of the family . Under the domestic system of industry which reached its height in the eighteenth century , the family was the industrial as well as the social unit . All manufacture was carried on in the home , and all members of the family group as well as the employed help worked together on the same footing and ate at the same table . The discovery of steam power , the invention of steamdriven machinery , and the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up the economic unity of the family . Members of the family left the home for the factory as the place of work . With the breakdown of the economic unity of the family , there came also the social distintegration of countless families . From primitive days until about a century ago the home was the center of manufacture . The use of steam-driven machinery was too expensive a procedure to be furthered in the family circle . The workers thus were called out of the home to labor in places where machinery had been set up , that is , in factories . The modern family manufactures scarcely anything at all . Even the immediate preparation of foods is likely to disappear and the kitchen to shrink into its primitive state of a few shelves and a cupboard . ( 4 ) The emancipation of women and opening of a large number of new industrial occupations to women brought a marked change in the position of women , making her to a degree economically independent of family relationships . Further , this movement has taken many married women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes have become simply dormitories . To tie woman up in the home is to make home a prison ; to remove her entirely is the opposite extreme and makes the home a mere pretense . The employment in factories and shops of married women with small children has brought about the isolation and neg- lect of children , who have roamed the streets , acquired questionable habits , and fallen into delinquency . Married women with small children arc unable to be real mothers if they must labor long hours in industry . When the mother goes out day after day , whether to work or to play bridge , the home may go to pieces and children may go astray . Through the development of opportunities to work in factories and stores , many young married women have failed to learn the domestic arts and to receive training in homemaking . In fact , they may get the idea that they are above such things . Therefore , when they come to the position of wife and mother they are unprepared and uninterested . Through lack of knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miserable . ( 5 ) Another influence affecting the family in Western civilization during the past century was the enormous growth of wealth . The possession of wealth and the acquisition of the resultant social power has emancipated people from fear and stimulated them to defy many social rules . In other words , the growth of wealth has favored a loosening of moral standards and of family bonds . ( 6 ) The growth of science , of knowledge , of a belief in a mechanistic universe , of the theory of behaviorism , has favored a view of the family as " merely another institution " and as " a device to be repudiated freely . " Scientific data pertaining to sex and to birth prevention have made far-reaching inroads upon the belief in " the sanctity of marriage . " ( 7 ) The nineteenth century was also one of increasing social unrest . The family felt the effects of this unrest seriously , and found itself at the dawn of the twentieth century in the midst of change and confusion . People ranged in their attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a divine institution made in Heaven " to those who felt that it was a device to be accepted or put aside according to personal desires . ( 8 ) The proportion of American families that are giving up their homes for " the cheerless existence in a boarding house or  | hotel " is disturbing . What does it mean , that a rapidly increasing part of the population finds the boarding house preferable to the home ? Is the burden of housekeeping becoming too irksome to compensate for the maintenance of a home ? It is asked frequently : What is to compensate for the giving up of home life by that increasing host of young married people who are living a superficial boarding house or hotel ex-istence ? ( q ) The growth of tenement districts , high rents , and even depression at times , have operated against sound family life . It has been frequently declared that a normal home can scarcely exist in many of the crowded areas of the large cities . When a family group of three or four members , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , normal family life is impossible . ( io ) At the other extreme is the fact that the high social standards of living required in certain sections of the large cities are a cause of family instability . Many persons exhibit luxurious standards of living in order to maintain social status , but this is often done at the expense of family happiness . They are so wearied by going to bridge parties , teas , dinners , and " keeping up with the Joneses , " that the family group disintegrates . To try to maintain standards that are out of all proportion to income is a cause of family breakdown . A late age of marriage is sometimes another disturbing factor . In the professions nowadays it is hardly wise for a young man to marry much earlier than the early thirties . At any rate , an independent income in the professions is not often possible before that age . A person who marries after thirty sometimes finds difficulty in becoming adjusted to the habits of his ( or her ) mate ; the maladjustments may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living which a young woman of wealthy parents may require of a young man who is getting started in a profession often means that he must either postpone marriage or face marital unhappiness .  | Courtship is the interesting pathway to the family . An exciting volume could be written on the history of courtship . Higher animal life is replete with courtship antics in the mating season . Primitive people recognized courtship and built its maneuvers into song and dance which sometimes degenerated into sexual orgies and at other times reached levels of chivalric human relationships . Sometimes the family has had its origins in virtual force . A young man would take to himself a wife , one of a group of maidens captured in war . Considerable race mixture has occurred in this way . The family also has had origins in purchase . The purchase price was demanded by the parents on the theory that the rearing of the girl had been an expense to her parents and that since she had not yet had time to repay her parents the young man should recompense them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob paid for Rachel by working for her parents seven years , and then for seven years more . The origins of the family reach the level of courtship with the method of securing parental consent . Some parents have insisted that they themselves should evaluate the merits of all who came courting their daughters . The suitor thus found it wise to concentrate on courting the parents rather than the young woman . The latter 's wishes were often ignored , denying to her the suitor of her choice and forcing upon her one whom she may have despised but whose status and wealth was such that the marriage would add greatly to the status of the parents and the family . The parents and elders had experience to guide them but were often moved by their own caprices and personal desires for prestige in " marrying off their daughters well . " Courtship reached a climax in the procedure of securing personal consent . Here the young man directs all kinds of artifices toward the inexperienced subject of his desires .

He courts her directly ; she courts him indirectly . Courtship is still evolving . The next stage may be that in which the advantages of securing the help and counsel of elders and of science are combined with the advantages of mutual thought and consent . Eugenic knowledge plus a mutually thoughtful decision by all the parties concerned is a goal beneficial to the race but not easily obtained . Stable family life involves education of children regarding its purposes . When these purposes are given a permanent setting , as for example in the teachings of the Latter Day Saints , they achieve special importance . Instead of performing marriages in terms of " until death do us part , " the Latter Day Saints emphasize that marriage is for eternity , for the future life as well as for the present . The engagement period before marriage is a trial-and-error institution . With engagement a couple passes from formal to informal courtship . They are much in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger if not an allinclusive claim upon the other 's time and attention . A short engagement period of a few days is valueless ; a long one of several years is abnormal . A year , perhaps , gives the engagement institution a real opportunity to demonstrate the worth or the weakness of the proposed marriage . Extreme attitudes are found toward engagements . Some persons have regarded an engagement as binding as marriage . Others have treated it flippantly , believing that several engagements are desirable and not hesitating to obligate themselves to more than one person of the opposite sex at a time . Very few young people have fully appreciated the personal values to be found in engagements and the ways in which engagements are defenses against the evils of hasty marriages . A person furnishes half of the heredity of his offspring and chooses the other half . It is of vast importance whom a person chooses as his mate , for in so doing he may be selecting  | strong or weak hereditary traits for his children . In the choice that he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two together are selecting not one-half but the whole of the heredity for their children . Unfortunately a great deal of this choosing of mates , that is , of parents for future children , is done blindly . The usual procedure is that of " falling in love , " which as a rule does not give consideration to sound principles of eugenics . Moreover , if two persons who fall in love marry almost immediately , with no engagement period , they ordinarily put themselves at a tremendous disadvantage . By lack of method , foresight , and common sense nearly everything is left to chance . Love often is a tumultuous god who takes delight in freak matings . While elopement is not as important a subject as newspaper reports and gossip would have people believe , yet it is socially significant . Popenoe has reported on the reasons for elopement ' His analysis of 738 elopements reveals four major sets of complex causes . ( 1 ) Parental objections vary greatly . Sometimes the parents object to a suitor , sometimes one or the other parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter to wait until she has finished school , sometimes they want the daughter to have a " career . " ( 2 ) Avoidance of publicity accounts for many elopements . Some school teachers would lose their positions if it were known that they were married . Students in some schools would be expelled if their marriage were publicized . Some persons who are recently divorced do not want publicity regarding a new marriage . On the other hand , Popenoe points out that a few persons , publicity seekers , elope in order to get into the headlines on the front page . They elope and then advertise the elopement , or rather themselves . ( 3 ) Economy may lead to elopement , which is a means of avoiding expensive weddings . Elopement is more convenient than the big wedding which some parents wish to .  | give their daughters ? in order to gain publicity for themselves . Elopement avoids the fuss and flutter attendant upon a wedding . Some persons elope in order to escape " the more or less infantile and asinine customs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with sixty-three per cent successful , make the best showing of all . " 7 ( 4 ) One other cause of elopement stands out from among a long list of causal factors . Some elopements are due to the necessity of forced marriages because of pregnancy . " Secrecy has the advantage of allowing the date of the marriage to be misrepresented later . " Elopements of this type are the least successful in terms of happy marriage . Other elopements occur on the basis of " the impulse of the moment " or under the influence of liquor . The desire to " spite someone " is a cause . In all such cases a federal law requiring that three to five or more days must intervene between obtaining a license and getting married will fulfil a genuine need . It is unfortunate that certain states have such a law and that others do not ; a federal law applicable to all is a minimum requirement . Courses on marriage and the family have been suggested for the junior or senior year in high school . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls are being formed . W. G. Mather , Jr. , of Cornell University , has attempted to secure answers to the question : " What sort of girl does a boy like to go with , and what sort of boy does a girl like to go with ? " He obtained unsigned data from 869 high school students , about evenly divided between boys and girls , and about evenly distributed between tenth , eleventh , and twelfth grade levels . The 443 girls rated the most desirable traits in a boy in the following order : ( 1 ) real brains , ( 2 ) cleanliness , ( 3 ) good health , ( 4 ) dependability , ( 5 ) cheerfulness , ( 6 ) sex purity , ( 7 ) considerateness , ( 8 ) liked by one 's parents , ( 9 ) hard worker , and ( 10 ) good conversationalist . Taken as a whole this is a splendid showing . The 426 boys rated the most desirable traits in a girl in the fol- lowing order : ( 1 ) real brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good looks , ( 4 ) cleanliness , ( 5 ) cheerfulness , ( 6 ) dependability , ( 7 ) sex purity , ( 8 ) hard worker , ( 9 ) goes to church , and ( 10 ) liked by one 's parents . Notice the slight differences of ratings in these two lists . ' Other factors that were put lower than tenth in either list were : prominent in sports , good dancer , stylish clothes , and clever " line , " while spending money freely , smoking , and drinking were usually placed at or near the bottom of a total of twenty-five traits . The process of selecting standards for a mate has never been carefully studied . Probably the process develops without conscious thought about it . Youths develop many of their standards for a mate from indirect suggestions that come from their peers and from elders . Intelligent group discussions of such standards for marriage would doubtless aid them in making wiser marriages than many would do otherwise . Marriage is an institution admitting men and women to family life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of husband and wife for the primary purpose of begetting and rearing children . This institution has social approbation and religious sanction . It has had an interesting and varied history . In certain parts of the earth polyandry has long existed . Polyandry is a form of marriage in which one woman has more than one husband at a given time . It is found , for example , in sections of Tibet , where the conditions of social life are harsh and where presumably the efforts of two or more men are needed in order that a family may be supported . It is a relatively rare type of marriage and exists only under peculiar and extreme conditions . Another form of marriage is polygyny , in which one man has two or more wives at a time . It should be noted here that polygamy is a general term that includes both polyandry and polygyny . It is more exact to use either one or both of  | the specific terms than the general term . Polygyny is closely related to the institution of slavery . Women captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their captor . A concubine is a kind of second-rate slave-wife . Under polygyny purchase is also common . For example , a chieftain may purchase a dozen women for wives , in the same manner that he would buy more personal property . The number of wives of one man occasionally reached a high figure , in some cases several hundred . Polygyny did not develop much until human groups had accumulated some degree of wealth ? at least an economic surplus to enable one man to support several families . Hence , even in countries where polygyny has been legal , only a small proportion of the people , namely , the wealthier , practice it . Polygyny is based in part on the lower impulses of the male sex , partly on the desire to leave many descendants , and partly on the desire for that status which has been attached to the practice . It exists as a sacrifice to the development of the highest affections . Under it , a woman may early lose the affections of her husband when younger and more attractive wives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents often suffer neglect . Monogamy , the marriage of one man to one woman at a time , has been and is the leading type of marriage . In Western civilization , the advantages of monogamy are now well recognized ; they have been stated by many writers and scientific observers . ( 1 ) Monogamy secures the superior care of children . Under it , both father and mother unite their efforts in behalf of their children . A greater and better degree of attention can be given to the training of children by both parents under monogamy than under any other expression of marriage relationship . ( 2 ) The monogamic family alone produces the highest type of affection , of altruistic love , of tolerant devotion . Under polygyny , the father can not devote himself fully to  | his children individually , or to each of his several wives , because there are too many of them . He is in reality the head of several households , and fatherhood in a real personal sense does not exist . Much jealousy exists between wives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monogamy , on the other hand , both father and mother commonly sacrifice much in the mutual care of children . ( 3 ) Monogamy creates more definite and stronger family ties than any other form of marriage . Affection between parents , between parents and children , and between children themselves is more wholesome . Legal relationships and blood relationships are simpler , less entangled , and less frequently the cause of permanent and annoying frictions . The cohesive power of the family is greater . As a result , it is probable that monogamic families tend to increase the unity and cohesiveness of society itself . ( 4 ) Monogamy favors not only the preservation of the lives of the children but of the parents . It is only under monogamy that aged parents are cared for to any great extent by their children . Under polygyny the wife who has grown old is discarded for a younger woman , and hence she usually " ends her days in bitterness . " The father is rarely cared for by his children , because the polygynous household does not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and his numerous offspring . Under monogamy aged parents are likely to receive the favoring care of children ; under polygyny they are commonly compelled to face a friendless old age . The advantages of monogamy are thus many and farreaching . Monogamy at its best presents superior opportunities for social interaction , and seems better fitted than any other type of marriage to produce the highest qualities of love and to lay the foundations for the finest forms of societary life . Companionate marriage is the marriage of two persons on the understanding that as long as there are no children the marriage may be dissolved simply by mutual consent . Judge  | Ben B. Lindsey , whose name has been connected frequently with the companionate marriage plan , held that this system is much better than free love or trial marriage as such , for it starts off with an official marriage and assumes that marriage is to be based on mutual responsibility . ' The knowledge that divorce may be obtained freely in case there are no children , he claimed , will make for more wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages are to be as binding as now . The opponents of companionate marriage hold that the plan makes it easy for persons to marry on the basis of sex alone , and to remarry from time to time on the same urge . They believe that the scheme has an unfortunate quick-married and quick-divorced trend that is in keeping with a speeded-up civilization ; that it fosters hasty marriages ; and that it irreparably cheapens marriage . In a large city there are several different family-type areas . In some communities of a city the majority of families are of one type , but in other parts of the same city another type of family life is common . These family-type areas have been classified by Mowrer into five varieties.10 ( 1 ) The non-family areas may be placed first . These are called one-sex areas . The male sex predominates in these areas , which are found in the downtown business and adjoining districts . ( 2 ) The emancipated family areas are largely " the rooming-house areas , the residential-hotel areas . " Children are missing . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they " eat out . " No neighborhood relations are maintained . ( 3 ) Paternal family areas are represented by the districts where immigrant families and proletarian families live . There are many children and the wives remain close at home . ( 4 ) The equalitarian family areas are found where the middle and professional classes live . Families are small ; wives come and go .  | ( 5 ) The maternal family areas are those chiefly of the bourgeoisie who live in suburbs . The men commute and are gone most of the daytime . The wives run the home and may take some interest in the affairs of the neighborhood . Of course , this fivefold classification is not to be taken too literally . However , the general pattern holds true , with the one-sex areas found at the center of the large city , then the wide circles of emancipated , paternal , equalitarian , and finally maternal family areas . Wide variations occur within each area . But why is a city divided in this way ? Many factors doubtless operate . Specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or lack of them , are partially responsible . A certain pattern gets started , and then it acquires momentum . Another question is : What do these different kinds of family areas do to family life ? The one-sex areas and the emancipated-family areas vary or stray farthest from normal family life . Paternal family areas have the most desertion . Maternal family areas are abnormal but fairly well organized . Equalitarian families represent considerable freedom , a reasonable degree of successful adjustment , and the main lines of hope for the family as a social institution . The family life process can not be understood unless the type of area and its influence are taken into consideration . Monogamic marriage has fallen far below its possibilities in many households and lands . Not all the evils attendant upon monogamic marriage today can necessarily be charged to the type of marriage itself . Many are doubtless the result of the misuse and abuse of a worthy system by incompetent and untrained persons who thoughtlessly rush headlong and blindly into marriage . The institution of the family , particularly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many marriages being legally dissolved by divorce as now ; never were there  | so many desertions . When maladjustments develop among the wealthy , divorce is resorted to ; among the poor , desertion is more common . Divorce is often a sign that a third party has entered into and wrecked a marriage . Desertion frequently means that the father has found many children a burden and economic support unfeasible , and so he disappears , leaving the wife and mother to carry on as best she may , and satisfying his conscience by asserting that public or private charity " will not let the kids starve . " For many decades the United States has held the unenviable position of leading European and American countries in the number of divorces granted . In 1906 it was found that there were 20,000 more marriages legally dissolved annually in the United States than in all the rest of the civilized world combined . At that time in France one marriage was legally dissolved to every 30 ceremonies performed ; in Germany , only one marriage was legally dissolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was legally dissolved to every 400 marriage ceremonies performed ; but in the United States the proportion was one to twelve , and in some cities the proportion was one to six or five . In 1916 another survey was made , which showed that there were six counties in five states of the United States in which in a given year divorces actually exceeded marriages . " The entire state of Nevada showed one divorce to 1.54 marriages ; while Indiana , the tenth state from the top of the list of high divorce rates , listed one divorce to every 5.94 marriages . The statistics , however , need to be further interpreted . People migrate temporarily to a city such as Reno , Nevada , within a few weeks secure a divorce , and then return " home . " In this way a community may acquire an enormous divorce rate that is entirely misrepresentative of the local situation . In 1921 estimates indicated that the increase in the divorce  | rate had not slowed down . In the United States as a whole , one divorce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate in the United States had passed that of Japan , putting the United States in the position of leading the world . Interestingly enough , the divorce rate in Japan has been declining during recent decades ' 2 In the United States as a whole in 1930 there was one divorce to each 5.9 marriages . While the depression has cut down both the marriage and divorce rates , marriages have decreased more than have divorces and hence the proportionate divorce rate has been boosted still higher . To compare the total number of divorces with the total number of marriages in a given year in a given country , such as the United States , may also be misleading . By contrast , suppose we think of comparing the number of divorces in a given year in a given country with the total number of marriages intact at the end of that year . The number of divorces granted in a given year should be compared with the total number of marriages in effect and not merely with the number of marriages that were performed in the particular year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do marriage failures ? by contrasting the number of marriages with the number of divorces in a given year . If we were to compare the number of bank failures in a single year with the number of banks organized during the same year , I suspect that we should find that there were ten or perhaps twenty-five times as many bank failures as there were banks organized during that year . ... Divorces occur from all previous marriages , not from the number of marriages that take place in the same year only . The figures of the federal marriage and divorce reports show that one marriage in 125 is dissolved by divorce annually  | Not only does the United States lead the world in the number of legally dissolved marriages annually , but these dissolutions are increasing faster than the population . If this tendency is maintained , it will not be many decades before the family as a permanent union between husband and wife will no longer be common . If the United States should reach the place where one-half of all marriages are dissolved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conditions when Rome started on her decadent days . As a reaction against the tradition that " marriages are made in Heaven , " an increasing number of people have gone to the opposite extreme and say that " marriages are for personal convenience . " This self-centered view means that marriages may be short-lived , even though there are children . The rate at which marriages are legally dissolved is higher as a rule in cities and industrial centers than in rural districts . Life is more personal , simpler , less keyed up , less sophisticated in the country , and in consequence young persons are better acquainted at the time of marriage and have less disconcerting factors to contend with after marriage . As the country becomes urbanized , the difference in divorce rates doubtless will tend to disappear . The divorce rate is from two to four times as high among childless couples as among those who have children , which is to be expected . Parental duties and privileges help to prevent a break in the marriage relation . The divorce rate varies according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , next lowest among Jews , next among Protestants , and highest among persons of no religious faith . Religious controls have been powerful in preventing a severance of the marriage ties , even though the parties to a given marriage have grown widely apart and become mutually antagonistic . Again we have two extremes . One regards a marriage as an iron-clad bond , no matter how one party or the other may have been victimized or subjected to a living death . The other extreme is to divorce marriage from religion completely and to regard it in no way as sacred .  | Approximately two-thirds of the marriages dissolved in the United States in recent decades have been broken at the request of the wife . This tendency indicates that women are becoming " emancipated " ; that they are not submitting to abuses from their husbands as many women did formerly . Some arc becoming perhaps too emancipated , developing too self-centered lives to meet the responsibilities of a family . Another conclusion is that men are more guilty than women of infidelity . In the system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " select a wife or a husband , as the case may be , the aim is to give youth the advantage of the experience of maturity and to protect youth from its own inexperience . Careful attention is given to securing a " suitable " mate in the sense of family worth and background . These gains , however , are offset by the fact that love is supposed to begin with marriage , not earlier . The grounds that are given in the courts for dissolving marriages are often misleading or insufficient . Desertion is frequently cited , but the question at once arises : What brought about the desertion ? Incompatibility is more specific , but even then , one would like to know what led to the incompatibility . Neglect or mental cruelty likewise raises the question who is the more responsible . Sexual immorality , another common cause , usually brings in " other women " with a train of complicating circumstances . To an appreciable extent the legal breaking up of families is a symptom of more serious evils . Marriage itself is being viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In certain classes of society , namely , the wealthiest and the poorest , there is a noticeable decay of the social values upon which the family rests . Family life requires sacrificial living , personal chastity , and the assumption of social responsibility . An increasing knowledge of the laws regarding divorce and an increasing laxity of these laws have furthered family instability . A few centuries ago the law was resorted to  | only by the wealthy or the socially powerful . Many people would not have thought of divorce three or four decades ago , but similar people today know the laws concerning divorce and marry with the expectation of resorting freely to these laws if occasion arises . The laws concerning the legal dissolution of marriage are freer in the United States than in almost any other so-called Christian nation . The administration of these laws is also freer , being made a joke at times . Certain " divorce " judges seem to take pride in the number of divorces that they grant , although here and there is one who specializes in reuniting separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the divorce rate is increasing in the United States , the marriage rate is also increasing . As E. A. Ross has suggested , the people of the United States are more married than ever before . Barring the recent depression years , the number of persons who are married per 1000 of the population has shown a somewhat steady increase over several decades . People are both marrying and divorcing more than formerly . Moreover , " the number of persons per 1000 population who got married and did not get a divorce has shown an increase " during the period from 1887 to 1927 . The increase in the percentage of those who marry allows for both an increase in the divorce rate and in the stable marriage age . For example , in 1887 the marriage rate in the United States per thousand population was 8.67 and the divorce rate was .47 . In 1927 , forty years later , the marriage rate was l0.12 and the divorce rate was 1.62 . In other words , in 1887 the stable marriage rate was 8.20 and in 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no worse than the instability in other phases of our current social life . An optimistic note may be found in the following observation .  | In fact , I suspect that if we consider the matter broadly , we shall find that the family is really rather less disturbed than any of the others phases of social life . Certainly there is at present less stability in the domain of economics , of politics , of religion , or morals , and of education , than in the American family . Our industrial situation is much more perturbed than is our family life . To take it concretely the proportion of failures in business during this interval of depression is far larger than the proportion of failures in marriage 16 Hotel family life is now receiving serious attention . The hotel or , earlier , the tavern or inn , was merely a stopping place overnight . Now , not only individuals but thousands of families live in hotels of one type or other . Today a hotel guest who stays a month or more is regarded as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more common in the large cities . Many children who are brought up in hotels tend to grow up urbane and sophisticated . Their play life is greatly distorted . It is a life which involves " all but sleeping in public . " I lotel families gain freedom and release from boresome work ; they obtain detachment from many home duties ; but they pay a considerable price in loneliness and in lack of organized life . But , as Dr. Hayner suggests , perhaps hotel life is an indication of the direction that urban life in general is taking . Annulments are marriages that are declared illegal and hence made null and void by the courts . In a study made in Douglas County , Nebraska , in which Omaha is located , Sullenger and Fischer found that annulments are about one-third as numerous as divorces , that over 61 per cent were brought before the courts by the wife and her relatives or friends , and that 38 per cent plus were brought by the husband and his relatives or friends . About 70 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the petitions  | granted were approved by the courts on the grounds of bigamy . That is to say , one party or the other had another husband of wife living and undivorced at the time . Nonage was the leading factor in the annulments in 35 per cent of the cases granted . " The period of time that elapses before an annulment suit is instituted varies greatly . In nonage suits the proceedings are usually begun immediately . In cases of bigamy a longer time elapses . In the shortest period found by Sullenger and Fischer both parties " were intoxicated at the time of the ceremony . " Sound family life depends on a single or the same standard of morals for both men and women . The double standard , or one standard for women and another for men , breaks down at the points of personal happiness and social value . Sexual chastity is essential to a true democracy of husband and wife . Unfortunately the discussion of sex values has been much avoided . It has been neglected by parents , treated inadequately by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral relations between the sexes have existed in all ages . The difficulties in the way of socially controlling the sex impulses have been and are almost insurmountable . When uncontrolled the sex impulses produce vice , " dirty " thinking , sterility , and obnoxious diseases , preventing a normal family life . They have taken thousands of girls and women in the larger countries of the world as an annual sacrifice . The virtues and bodies of girls and women have been commercialized , annually returning millions of dollars to evilminded procurers and managers in every large country of the world , with the small countries not immune . The segregation of sexually depraved girls and women in special districts has been and is an alarming blotch upon civilization , testifying that men and women have sunk lower in the control of sex passions than animals . In those countries where the so-called " red-light districts " have been done away with by law , the evil has persisted in a limited way , being diffused ,  | with certain hotels and rooming houses serving under cover as centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so subtle in their nature that years after cures have been announced they may again break forth , contaminating virtuous wives and helpless babies , and destroying happy home life . " The busiest specialty of medicine " is said to be that connected with venereal diseases . Disabilities , untold suffering , surgical operations , premature deaths follow in their wake . They " populate asylums and hospitals with human wrecks . " Perhaps the most revolting phase of these deep-seated infections is the way in which many men , having sown " wild oats " in pre-marriage days , are guilty of transmitting a dangerous venereal disease to helpless wives and of foisting misery upon innocent children 1 ? Unchastity may be defined as maintaining sexual relations outside of marriage , particularly by a married party with a person or persons other than his married partner . Ten causes of unchastity , an enemy of sound family life , have been noted . ( 1 ) Love for another person outside the marriage relationship is often an important factor . ( 2 ) Uncontrolled sex desires ranks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some girls and women of excusing their brothers or sons or sweethearts in being " a little wild " is another leading factor . To condone in such cases may be popular , but destructive of later human happiness . ( 4 ) The countenancing of a double standard of sex morals operates disastrously against the family . A woman who succumbs once to her sex nature becomes a social outcast , but in that same community a man who violates sex , and whose repeated illegitimate sexual practices are known , may remain a " social lion " and be received with open arms by women in " polite society . " ( 5 ) The  | feminine weakness for male adulation and flattery , and for the luxuries that some men offer to delude women , is a significant element . The desire to " rate " may lead to the destruction of vital social values . ( 6 ) Closely packed populations in congested urban districts furnish breeding centers for sexual immorality. ( " 7 ) Some men and many women owe their initial sex debauch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . ( 8 ) A double standard of medical regulations is also a factor . At present in certain countries , cases of smallpox must be reported to the health department but venereal diseases , which may be as virulent as smallpox , need not be reported , for the reason that such reporting might incriminate men of standing in the community . Furthermore , public measures are not developed to prevent the spread of these diseases to the innocent . ( 9 ) Poverty leads many a girl to her sex downfall . She is enticed by the lure of expensive clothes and a so-called " easy life " which ordinary work and wages do not provide , and she gives in to a quick but demoralizing means of securing the lure . In times of economic depression many women succumb to sex in order to keep from starving . ( 10 ) A lack of adequate personality organization , of moral stamina , and religious idealism exists to a greater or less degree in nearly all cases of sex depravity . From an extended study of 526 married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married not less than one year nor more than six ? Burgess and Cottrell tentatively conclude that " the higher the educational level at the time of marriage , the greater the chances are that the marriage adjustment score will be high . " 21 About half of the people studied had one or more years of college education . They also stated cautiously " that persons with proclivities for joining organized social groups are better risks for marriage adjustment than those who lack such tendencies . " 22 These  | authors go one step further and offer a definition of a welladjusted marriage . Their studies lead them to say that such a marriage is one " in which the attitudes and actions of each of the partners produce an environment which is highly favorable to the proper functioning of the personality structures of each partner , particularly in the sphere of primary relationships . " 23 In other words , the creation of a pleasant atmosphere is a responsibility of both . In such an atmosphere most needed adjustments can be made . As soon as one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . " What are the essentials of a successful home ? " was asked of 344 individuals , regarded as competent to answer , by Chase G. Woodhouse . She received 2208 " essentials " in the replies . Over one-half related to " the attitudes , personal traits and relationships between the members of a family . " The next important set of items is related to the economic situation and includes sufficient income , household management , and financial system . The third group of items includes the general ideals in the home , such as ethical and religious ideals . Fourth come elements such as community contacts and planned recreation.2h In reply to the query , " What valuable training and experience helped you most in these home adjustments ? " the replies ran as follows : ( 1 ) experience in other fields such as would give breadth of view , ( 2 ) training in one 's childhood home , ( 3 ) education in psychology , psychiatry , and child nature , ( 4 ) trial and error , ( 5 ) experiences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that much more attention is given to the training of girls for motherhood than to the training of girls for wifehood or of boys to be husbands . The factors that hinder success in the family are : ( 1 ) financial , ( 2 ) wife 's mother , ( 3 ) lack of help in the care of  | the house and the children , ( 4 ) husband 's family , and ( 5 ) sickness in family . " The question asked of husbands , " What is an ideal wife ? " brought the answer : an affectionate , companionable person . A " good mind " ranks high and a " sterling character " is also vital . In discussing the ideal husband , the wives put emphasis on companionability . Other requirements are fondness for children , good mind , broad-minded , socially-minded , strong personality , happy disposition , and sterling character.2 " With the increasing knowledge of the laws of heredity , variation , and evolution , certain persons have acquired a highly developed knowledge of plant and animal heredity 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of inheritance within the human realm and to improve the human race . This new movement is known as eugenics , a science which was inaugurated in England during the closing years of the nineteenth century by Francis Galton As the term " eugenics " implies , the science aims to  | work out a program whereby every child may be well born . It concentrates on applying the principles of heredity and variation to human life , chiefly through the family . One eugenic method is to discourage by education and legal means the marriage of persons who are unfit physically or mentally . The aim is to prevent unworthy parenthood . It is planned to segregate feeble-minded men and women by sexes in public institutions and thus to prevent them from reproducing their kind . It is also planned to forbid the marriage of those persons whose health is constitutionally or organically below a certain standard . In line with this idea a movement has been inaugurated whereby only those persons who produce health certificates from a reputable physician shall be allowed to marry . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to raise by degrees the standards of health demanded of those who desire a license to marry . Thus the eugenist hopes to encourage the growth of a more healthy race of men and women . The eugenist has to contend , however , with the problem of illegitimate parentage . To pass laws forbidding certain types of persons to marry does not hinder the birth of children outside of wedlock . In fact , to make marriage laws more strict than public opinion will support is indirectly to increase the number of children born out of wedlock . Hence the eugenist can not wisely act too far in advance of public opinion . A second and more constructive eugenic method is to establish a public opinion favorable to new and higher personal standards regarding mating . At present , attractions such as wealth or title or social position frequently determine who may marry . If a marriageable person is wealthy he is considered highly desirable ? irrespective of a possible unfit condition or absence of sex standards . The eugenist urges that  | a sound physique and heredity be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all else . He holds that wealth without health , or rank without a sound heredity are false marriage guides . He subscribes to the old idea that " blood will tell . " Thus a strong hereditary stock , high vitality , and excellent health are emphasized as more fundamental marriage attractions than titles or gold . The eugenist asks that young people shall be trained from childhood to regard high vitality and dependable health as first essentials in an ideal man or woman . If this belief were to become accepted in a large social group it would influence personal fancy and " falling in love . " However , the aim of eugenics is not to eliminate falling in love but to put it upon a superior level of vitality , heredity , and health . Thus would the eugenist strengthen every social group and help to build a superior human race . Preventive eugenics refers to measures to protect parenthood from " racial poisons . " Alcohol has been called a poison which seems to affect the generative organs and even the germ cells . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial poison . Narcotics is another racial poison . Tubercle bacilli , by undermining the human organism , are weakening in their effects upon germ cell strength . Venereal diseases directly attack the generative organs of women , causing both sterility and untold suffering , and hence may be regarded as racially disastrous . Disharmonic types are deplored by eugenists . When a pair of parents are widely different in traits , their children may show disharmonic traits . Disharmonic physical types are more easily observed than any other . A large heavy-set person may inherit a small heart , or vice versa . Thus , a person may have strong urges in opposite directions and must continually shift back and forth between his own lively tendencies . Disharmony in psychical traits may be produced in the offspring of two parents widely divergent in psychical natures . The result is an undue proportion of deep-seated  | mental conflicts ; a person who might achieve is forever torn asunder by contending forces within him . Disharmonic characteristics may be related to ambivalence . This is a mental situation in which a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , person , or action at the same time . As a result he may act inconsistently on different occasions . Such contradictory behavior may cause him a great deal of suffering . Inbreeding is an opposite tendency . The mating of persons who are closely related or who are too much alike may result in deficient or weak offspring . The eugenist contends against such practices , whether found among the illiterate backwoodsmen or royalty . Blue blood dies out . The eugenist favors racial admixture but sets limits against inbreeding and outbreeding . The former increases deficiency and the latter disharmony . Dysgenics refers to the factors which hinder or prevent the birth of physically and mentally perfect individuals . Factors which cut down the birth rate unduly or which undermine physical parenthood are also dysgenic . Poverty or alcoholism arc generally considered to be dysgenic . Eugenics strikes at such a characteristic as mental defectiveness because of its relation to many social ills . While poverty and delinquency are not inherited , mental defectiveness , which is inherited , leads to poverty , pauperism , delinquency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead to poverty , while the inheritance of feeble-mindedness and an energetic temperament is likely to result in delinquency or crime . In the case of longevity , or long life , traits such as high vital resistance and sound organic reactions have inherited bases . Of those persons who are ordinarily considered well born , a large percentage possess some inherited defects which sooner or later are manifested in low vital resistance , weak lungs , weak kidneys , a weak digestive system , a weak heart . Under the stress of modern speed , these defects grow into serious problems . Hence , to the extent that eugenic measures  | can safeguard individuals against inheriting such defects , it is rendering a valuable social service . A weakness that is sometimes charged against eugenics is its apparent belief that a sound body and mind are sufficient to guarantee a sound citizen . By its nature it does not deal with human character , spiritual values , social responsibility , social or anti-social attitudes . Moreover it often overlooks the importance of environment . However , in its field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Human beings may be divided into three vitality classes . " ( i ) Low vitality classes include those persons , as a rule , whose birth rate and death rate are both high , whose physical and mental defectiveness is relatively high , whose vital resistance is low , and whose knowledge of eugenic and hygienic principles is meager . They are represented among the poorer peasants of remote areas and in the overcrowded districts of large cities . ( 2 ) Medium vitality people are those whose birth rate and death rate are both low , whose intelligence is high , whose vital resistance is not equal to the countless demands of a speeded-up urban pace , and who do not live out the normal span . ( 3 ) High vitality people are those who have been well born ; who are without mental and physical defects ; who have a substantial birth rate and a low death rate ; and who live under a favorable environment . The higher culture groups among the rural landowning classes will serve as illustrations . An optimum population is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social goal . It varies greatly . A high birth rate and large numbers of people constitute an optimum population for war purposes . They also comprise an optimum population from the standpoint of " saving as many souls as possible . " From an economic viewpoint an optimum popu- lation is a large one when there are many natural resources to be exploited , but a small one when resources are scarce . What would be an optimum population in prosperous times would be a surplus population when unemployment and starvation stalk the land . Capitalism often asks for a large population so that an excess labor supply will keep wages low , while social workers and taxpayers protest because of the heavy expense upon public and private charity when " times are hard " and millions are thrown out of employment . A large population is desired by real estate promotors , for land values rise with every addition to the population in good times . A city of one million would be increased to a city of two million or five million by real estate " sharks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the kind of housing and living conditions under which many of the proposed two or five million will live . The " boosters " are inclined to ignore if not to defy all the sound principles of eugenics . Eugenics would shift the emphasis from quantity to quality of population ; sociology , from plenty of people to plenty of opportunity and of creative stimuli . I listory supports eugenics in its contention for a sound and a limited population . Population authorities stand with the eugenists . In the early part of the nineteenth century an English scholar by the name of Thomas Malthus wrote an important essay on population and developed what has since been called the Malthusian doctrine , in which he asserted that population increases faster than food supply , and that poverty and misery may be expected to result unless something is done to check the birth rate . It is pointed out that by deliberately holding the birth rate down , a nation can prevent poverty and attendant misery . On the other hand , if such a preventive check is not utilized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Malthus . These include famine , pestilence , war . The preventive checks and the positive ones hold an inverse rela- rionship to each other . When the positive checks are operating strongly , the preventive ones are quiescent . When the preventive ones are holding down the birth rate , the positive arc likely to be inoperative . When a country is new , eugenics is likely to receive little consideration , and the Malthusian law is defied . A new country is often reckless in developing or exploiting its natural resources , and likewise may be careless regarding the birth rate and the heredity of its people . As it grows older , and its people grow more educated , the birth rate may decline but not so fast as the economic resources . Surplus populations seem to call for territorial expansion and to justify wars of aggression . Some of the followers of Malthus have been known as NeoMalthusians . They have urged birth control , or the use of artificial measures for the regulation of births . Birth control measures were first adopted somewhat spontaneously by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged by reformers for the protection of women of lower economic and less educated levels from being burdened continuously by childbearing . Eugenists have favored the birth control movement in order to protect society from an increase in morons and feeble-minded , for these types reproduce their kind extensively . Birth control is urged also by those who wish to protect the unskilled classes from becoming so numerous that wages for them will be kept at starvation levels . Birth control advocates appear to be gaining in numbers . The opponents of birth control have claimed that the people who use it most are the ones best able and fit to have socially acceptable children . It is pointed out that birth control has been adopted by the wealthy , the educated , and by society women in order to escape childbearing . It is used as a means of shirking a distinct duty to society . The educated and financially independent cut their birth rate so low that they do not keep up their numbers , and thus society must rely on the lower cultural groups to replenish itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it " interferes with the will of God , " and cuts down the number of souls that may be saved . If church people practice it , then church adherents are depleted . Church people who oppose birth control usually do so on strictly ecclesiastical grounds , or because it is a poor substitute for that moral control by which people regulate the number of their children " by will power " and by keeping sex impulses well subordinated . " ' Birth control is opposed by some militarists , nationalists , large-scale employers , and real estate " boosters , " under the captions of " victory , " " patriotism , " " prosperity . " Nearly all of these contentions are the products of wishful thinking on the part of self-centered interests . The majority of social workers favor some form of birth control for they are working with many people who are lacking in " moral control , " or who are the victims of exploitation . Internationalists in general favor birth control for they fear " population pressure " as a leading cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " standing room only , " and the latter to misery and war . The control of birth control in some quarters is becoming a problem . In certain European countries the birth rate has been declining faster than the death rate ; hence , if this ratio continues , the peoples of France , England , and Holland , for example , as they are now known , will pass away 3 " It is also argued that birth control makes promiscuous sexual relations safe and that it is undermining marriage and normal family life and happiness . No control of birth control greatly increases self-centered existence on the part of many people . In a larger way the lack of international control of birth control is fast becoming a problem . The fact that birth rates are low in France and England and high in India and China is  | upsetting ; it creates fear and military preparedness among certain low birth rate countries . The widespread interest in technocracy has given birth control strong support . The relationship is indirect , but the figures of automatic machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries has indirectly played into the hands of the advocates of a widespread control and selection of populations . A world depression likewise supports the eugenic program of careful se= lection . Eugenics has its best friend in education , for through education persons may learn what they can do in order to develop themselves toward high vitality , and at the same time guarantee a splendid physical start in life to the next generation . By education , a necessary improvement in environmental conditions may be made so that a eugenic racial stock may be built up , safeguarded , stimulated , and enabled to reach its full fruition . Through eugenics individuals and social groups alike may grow in stature and in mental and social worth . Of the many problems that have always accompanied the family , not the least has been housing . Ever since the family and the race began , the problem of housing has been baffling to the majority of people . It was pointed out by John Ruskin that after 6000 years of human history we still find that a majority of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous progress in many material directions , but in one essential particular , namely , of housing the human family properly , the major problems are still unsolved for millions of people not only in uncivilized countries but in civilized as well . The housing of the family is becoming more and more a social problem . Wage-earners desire to live near their work and yet can not afford to pay rents which mount upward as cities increase in size . The wealthy overhouse themselves .  | The poor are underhoused . The middle class shifts back and forth between renting and buying , trying in the latter case to escape the evil of high rents , and in the former , the evil of high taxes and special assessments . The earliest family groups were very crudely housed . Cave houses and tree houses prevailed . The invention of the hall house , rectangular in shape , containing one room with the fireplace in the center , with no windows and perhaps no chimney for the fireplace , but accommodating several families , was a distinct achievement . From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in variety , including many that are indescribably elegant . Despite this development , millions are forced to live in houses of the worst sort , in shacks and inhuman tenements , not much better than the houses of preliterate man . Moreover , millions of laboring persons desirous of modest homes find the ownership of these impossible because of forbidding prices . The housing problem develops when more than one family try to live in a dwelling scarcely large enough for a single family . Each city in the United States , for example , has its housing problem , namely , how shall it house its people from a healthy and human welfare viewpoint ? " Although New York City alone in the United States has a tenement house problem , all other large cities are tending toward tenement house conditions . While overcrowding does not exist in country districts , yet poor sanitation and lack of hygienic conditions spell bad housing for whole regions . Ignorance and carelessness create bad housing in the country as well as in the city . Thus , housing the family is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may begin with overcrowding . Overcrowding is of two types , land overcrowding and room overcrowding 40 The first is an overcrowding of limited areas of land with an undue population , in such a way that a fair level of living standards can not be maintained . Under specific conditions a thousand people might be housed satisfactorily in a single well-built and well-equipped apartment house , whereas one-tenth that number living in shacks scattered over a considerable area " down by the river " might be ill-housed . Room overcrowding means that too many persons are occupying a given number of rooms , especially sleeping rooms . In many cities there has been a standard of at least 400 or 500 cubic feet of air per adult per room . More important , however , than air space is the amount and kind of ventilation . Also important is the amount of light , particularly sunlight , that reaches in the daytime into sleeping rooms 41 ( 2 ) Closely related to overcrowding is the lack of health facilities . In addition to ventilation , light , and sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of garbage , and cleanliness . It is surprising how anyone who continually breathes the foul air of the tenement can keep healthy . In the dark , damp rooms of the poor , the germs of disease live and multiply ; sunshine and fresh air are not present to destroy them . Typhoid sweeps away its thousands because of impure water and lack of drainage , while tuberculosis takes a larger toll because of bad air and infected rooms . ( 3 ) The rent problem is caused in part by a competitive economic system bent on obtaining as large profits as possible . As a result , people huddle together in close and mean quarters . With every increase in population or migration in times of prosperity rents and land values go up . In the months and years of depression , unemployment hinders or prevents the  | payment of high rents . Overcrowding and the breakdown of family morale follow . Land speculation forces land prices up unduly high and makes housing conditions harsher for the poor . Housing speculation also results disastrously for the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Prices in large cities have reached levels where it is impossible for a majority of the people to own their own homes , no matter how thrifty and industrious they may be . With land near certain traffic centers in large cities priced at a thousand dollars a front foot and with tenements rearing their sooty heads half a hundred feet high , with a housing problem so chronic that whole sections of a population live and die under the shabbiest of living conditions , it is high time that housing the family should be considered a question of national and world importance . Is it not strange that with all of our boasted scientific development , technological efficiency , and business acumen , a third of the nation 's families are not decently housed ? Civilized and uncivilized country , Christian country or not , housing is yet , after several thousand years of human history , a major social problem . When 60 per cent of the people of a country such as the United States , with its three million square miles of land and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own their own homes , and live all their days on other people 's land , a social situation has arisen that demands earnest attention . Moreover , when thousands on thousands who began adulthood expecting to own a home are giving up all such hope and resigning themselves to disillusionment and " a bare boarding-house existence , " national welfare is at stake . Then , what about those families who live in transient camps ? With more than 95 per cent of the people of New York city living in " hired habitations , " and with other millions of the industrial classes being " homeless " in the sense of being renters and tenants , the family group is defeated almost at its start in developing a real home , and in creating the social values which sound homes require . If individualism and cap- italism were wise , they would modify the present economic system so that home ownership would be possible to all who desired it . The own-your-own apartment plan has made some progress , but has not yet been adjusted to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not yield sufficient returns to enable a young man with slight means and with a family to pay for a home . An increasing degree of renting is a main factor in the social restlessness of the times . ( 4 ) The taking in of lodgers is usually found along with overcrowding and high rents . With unemployment , or with an increase in land values and rents , a lodger or two may be added to the family group , so that housing and home expenses may be met . The social effects of taking in lodgers in families already living in one or two rooms are serious . ( 5 ) Lack of play space for children is the rule where habitations are congested . Hallways , dark stairways , side-alleys , and rear-alleys are the only places about the home where numerous children may play . Dark alleys foster not sound recreation but vice and delinquency . The housing problem , then , is seen to arise , first , out of too much individualism , which is expressed vividly in a system of greedy profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to sacrifice the health and welfare of relatively helpless people . Many care little whether tenants as a class live or die , as long as financial returns are netted from property . Even when the need for municipal and national action is clear , caution must be shown lest private enterprise take offense and raise the cry of socialism . Note the following statements taken from an Associated Press dispatch under date of September 3 , 1933 : Outlining the administration 's objective in financing lowcost housing projects from public works funds , Secretary Ickes said today the program is designed to fill a gap caused by private capital 's failure at slum clearance . The public works administrator in a formal statement denied the proposed construction will compete with private  | enterprise . He said it is intended first to create jobs , and secondly , to furnish satisfactory housing at a low cost . Asserting private initiative has failed to provide the type of housing contemplated by the public works administration , Ickes said " nothing could be further from the truth " than the suggestion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of poor housing is ignorance and lack of responsibility on the part of poor people . There is ignorance concerning the nature of health , sanitation , and minimum living standards . Many people in large cities have never had the opportunity of learning about recent advances in sanitary science and household economics , despite the adult education movement . Whole sections of urban populations are still living in the Dark Ages . When they do obtain the needed knowledge they are unable or unwilling to put it into effect . A third factor is the ignorance and lack of responsibility of the public regarding housing conditions . One-half of a city does not know or does not care how the other half lives . When bad housing conditions arc known to exist , the failure of many citizens to take an effective interest in rectifying untoward situations is a startling commentary on a lack of welfare attitudes . These three causal factors 42 of bad housing , therefore , boil down to two psycho-social factors , namely , ignorance and lack of welfare attitudes . In many countries voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National I lousing Association was established in the United States in 1910 . But these efforts , fine as they have been , are scarcely able to do more than scratch the surface of the problems . Several different methods of controlling the housing of the family may be noted : ( 1 ) A laissez-faire reliance on private capital and on the law of supply and demand for houses encourages private building initiative , but does not meet the needs of families for well- built homes and does not prevent harmful speculation in a necessity of life . Better sanitary and health measures for regulating the activities of private builders are necessary . However , they do not hinder rents from rising in times of prosperity or overcrowding from becoming common during a depression . ( 2 ) The building of model tenements by individuals sets a fine example , but does not provide adequate housing for more than a fraction of those needing homes . It is estimated that 10,000,000 families in the United States alone live in sub-standard dwellings . If 50,000 new dwellings a year were constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuming no dwelling fell back into the " slum " classification . As Carol Aronovici points out , the real problem , however , is not so much the elimination of slums as " the salvaging of the human lives which now must live in slums. " 43 The bold challenge has been made : Take the people out of the slums and " the slums will be cleared in less time than it will take the government to clear them by subsidies . " 44 But how can this be done ? ( 3 ) Government owned and operated tenements have been a success in Germany , Austria , and Great Britain . Their development on a large scale in the United States has been delayed because of a deep-seated antagonism to anything socialistic and because of the inefficiency and political graft in municipal governments . Among the Western European countries , England , for instance , has been working under governmental authority at attempts to improve the housing conditions of the working classes . Two million houses have been constructed for poor people since 1918 , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion expresses itself time after time in behalf of slum clearance and respectable housing . Unfortunately , public opinion does not know what  | to do about the problem ; nevertheless , it does sense the fact that " the child who grows up in overcrowded conditions has no real chance . The child is the test . " " In England the slum clearance or anti-slum campaign has made headway slowly . More important , according to E. D. Simon , once Lord Mayor of Manchester and for the past several years a leading housing expert in England , is the plan to build a house for every family in England , at suitable rents " The building of new houses must take place on the outskirts of the present cities until land values are brought down in central urban areas that are zoned for housing to a reasonable level . " For housing the poorer families , private enterprise has not proven equal to the task and hence local city governments must continue and increase their home-building activities ; in the same way that public money is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school buildings , so must public money be used to secure adequate housing , especially in view of the widespread breakdown of private enterprise as evidenced by the slums . Such is an English view after years of experimenting with the housing problem.18 After many years ' delay the United States , through its NRA program , announced in 1933 a federal policy of slum clearance . Politics of the unsavory sort and economic greed will do everything possible to block slum clearance , yet why should not all slums be removed and why should not all the citizens of a country such as the United States be entitled to decent homes no matter how humble ? Since the time when the Public Works Housing Corpora- tion was established in November , 1933 , the Federal Government has played an increasing role in helping to house the people in the lower income brackets . The first of fifty demonstration projects carried on in thirty-five cities in the United States was completed in 1936 . The Techwood Homes project , in Atlanta , Georgia , contained 604 family units . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional , heat , hot water , and electricity for cooking and lighting were included . The fifty projects , completed in 1937 , provided 22,574 family units . A few noted slums in the cities of the United States have disappeared , at least in part , as a result of the government 's housing activities . Examples are the " Greasy Plank " area in Memphis , and " Beaver Slide " and " Whiskey Island " in Cleveland . Government plans include reduction in mortgage rates , the insurance of mortgages upon low-cost housing , and the modernization of houses . One culmination of these and related plans came with the lending of government money at rates as low as 3 per cent to persons needing money with which to build their own houses . With the passage of the WagnerSteagall Housing Act in 1937 the United States Housing Authority was created and was given power " to lend to public housing agencies , for developing , acquiring , or administering low-rent housing for the clearance of slums up to ninetenths of the cost of the property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . It is recognized that slums can not be cleared without expense to the communities that have been harboring them . ( 4 ) The establishment of garden cities is praiseworthy , but meets the needs of only a small percentage of the people . The garden city is foreshadowed in a way by Plato in his discussion of ideal communities . As developed in England , Letchworth , for example , the garden city has the advantages of both country and city . Each family is to have a plot of ground and at the same time the advantages of urban life . The garden city is designed to protect working people and their children from  | the unwholesome conditions of overcrowded tenement areas . Occasionally an expensive residential suburb has been called a garden city , but this is an incorrect usage of the term . The United States has even entered upon building garden cities , for example , Greenbelt , Maryland , where a new and beautiful community is developing under government support . The needs of its residents are being met by co-operative enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments . ( 5 ) Rapid transportation at low rates gives the working classes a chance to house themselves well . Many people , however , prefer to live near their work . Rapid transit , moreover , affords only temporary relief unless terminals are continually extended , and people are encouraged to move farther and farther away from their work . The subways of a city like New York carry people fast and far , but in a sense are dehumanizing . Like moles , people rush into these underground caverns . They travel at tremendous speed , then come up into the open for air , and then dash into one of thousands of office buildings , only to spend most of endless days away from the sunlight and nature . ( 6 ) The co-operative apartment , so-called , has made considerable progress . It has usually been built by private enterprise for profit . Each unit is sold to a given purchaser , who can re-sell or lease providing the prospective newcomer is satisfactory to all the other tenant-owners in the building . ( 7 ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long term lease , but the title is held by the co-operative society . The owner buys membership shares equal to the value of his apartment and pays for them as a rule over a term of years . If he must sell , the society buys his shares back at par or for the exact amount that he paid on them . ( 8 ) Constant , persistent education of the public concerning housing conditions is essential . In order to secure needed economic improvements , adequate housing laws , and proper administration of these laws , public opinion must give steady  | and intelligent support to socially-minded legislators , administrators , and social welfare leaders . If the chief end of life is to live helpfully , then it is a matter of prime importance that all the people live in houses which are conducive to health , safety , and morality . Adequate housing is so related to proper " homing " that it becomes a matter too serious to be left in the field of private speculation . It can be handled well only through wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undoubtedly in a transitional stage . The patriarchal family which has prevailed widely was good for its time and place , and still possesses meritorious features . Individualism has made inroads upon the older types of the family by emancipating women and sometimes by making children little autocrats , by challenging marriage , and even by advocating free love and state-controlled institutions for training all children . The patriarchal family has been too rigid ; individualistic attitudes toward the family , too loose . Perhaps there is a happy medium . A democratic family would be built on respect for age and experience , on consideration for the personalities of children , and on co-operation all around . To change the family from one in which autocracy and ignorance predominate to one in which a rational and mutual give-and-take rule applies , requires education in democratic relationships , sex relationships , parent-child relationships , and in an appreciation of the family group as a training center for social life . In discussing the question , " Can the family have two heads ? " Dr. Paul Popenoe 49 reports upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups as follows : ( 1 ) man-dominant , ( 2 ) woman-dominant , and ( 3 ) " 50-50 . " " He found that in the 2596 families , 35 per cent were man- dominant , 28 per cent were woman-dominant , and 37 per cent were " 50 ? 50 , " or approximately democratic . The answer to his question appears to be that in more than onethird of the families studied the family not only can but actually does have two heads . But Dr. Popenoe at once asks : " Why is it that nearly two-thirds of the marriages in question have failed to reach a democratic basis at the present time ? " Analyzing the data further , he found that happy marriages were distributed among the three groups as follows : Of the man-dominated marriages , 61 per cent are happy and 24 per cent are unhappy . Of the woman-dominated marriages , 47 per cent are happy and 31 per cent are unhappy . Of the " 50 ? 50 " marriages , 87 per cent are happy and only 7 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages of the type studied , a democratic copartnership is associated with the greatest happiness ; that man-dominated marriages come next in this respect ; and that marriages dominated by the wife show a definitely smaller percentage of happiness than do the other two.51 The democratic family is one in which the husband and wife share the authority more or less equally and according to a prearranged division of labor . It is a group whose life is based not primarily on the fear and force of authority , but on the drawing power of mutual respect and affection . Rational love rules . A democratic family rests on the principle of mutual selfsacrifice . In its sacrificial nature is its greatest strength as a social training center . If children do not learn to make sacrifices for the common good within the family , they have no adequate substitute , for large institutions become formal by their nature . If parents can be trained in the principles of democratic parenthood , and youth in principles of rational marriages , then society will probably keep the family group as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no child has a home if he can not  | find it in the attitudes of a co-operative and companionable father and mother . He may have a kind guardian or a thoughtful father , or a loving mother , but the essence of a real home is found only in the attitudes of two parents united in genuine affection for each other . The family group was " the first human school . " Despite its weaknesses it has often been the best school . The most effective teaching is being done in and through the family . The informal education of every person normally begins in the family ; the child 's most important educational period , informal though it be , is spent in the family . The education of children in the principles of health and sex hygiene may be given best by parents . There is no better place than the home in which a child can learn obedience , discipline , and socially sound behavior . Training in ethical behavior has fine possibilities in the home . The family may become the greatest socializing influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals may acquire early and effectively the idea that marriage and the family have superior possibilities as social institutions . It is here that the social significance of fatherhood may be taught . Girls , and boys also , learn here that motherhood represents the most important social service which a woman can perform , and that next in importance is the service that men may render as fathers . Better marriages make an excellent starting point for improving the family . On the other hand , poor marriages are perhaps the chief cause of family instability , divorce , and desertion.52 Since many persons assume that marriage is not a serious affair , they make hasty and ill-advised marriages and think that they can easily extricate themselves . The easier divorce is made , the wider will be the assumption that marriage is unimportant and the more careless the attitudes regarding it . Marriage on short acquaintance too often proves a delusion . The time element is necessary in order that young people may  | determine whether what seems to be love is real and lasting affection , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a period of time , consideration of temperaments , consideration of cultural backgrounds , the advice of sympathetic and understanding elders , are helpful if not essential in making one of the most fundamental choices of life , that of a husband or a wife . Tentative statements of democratic marriage ideals would include a disapproval of the marriage of persons of widely different cultural and racial backgrounds , of persons of widely different ages , of any persons who have tendencies to mental defectiveness , or of persons with venereal diseases . The practice of requiring a health certificate from a reputable physician is intended to protect the innocent against hidden diseases . The requirement that a certain length of time should elapse between the securing of a marriage license and marriage is designed to protect society and persons alike from hasty and illadvised marriages . If a person is required by law to go through a long period of training involving years before entering a profession , is it unreasonable to ask that persons give at least a few days ' thought to entering the marriage relationship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family are not supported by public opinion , then legislation can not improve matters . Marriage needs to be viewed by public opinion not as an expression of purely individualist impulses but as a social safeguard . The family needs to be considered not lightly but as an institution socially necessary and sacred ; not as a temporary contract to be assumed carelessly but as involving human feelings and intimate relationships that are to be treated as lifelong in their effects upon personality . Lax family life rests in part on lax marriage attitudes , and lax marriages rest on lax public opinion . More knowledge about the means of securing sound marriages and stable family groups , and a wide distribution of such knowledge would produce a more wholesome social life . Although the people of Canada and of England are similar in culture and institutions to the people of the United States ,  | their divorce rate is relatively very low . This situation is partially explained by the fact that attitudes and laws in Canada and England toward marriage and the family are of a different order from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern family may go from bad to worse until a nation such as the United States hits the rocks , even as Rome decayed ; or it may be met by new and constructive attitudes . While many factors , economic and otherwise , are vital to national morale , the outcome depends to a considerable extent on the attitudes toward marriage and the family that persons and groups elect to encourage . The destruction or reconstruction of the family lies within the realms of human attitudes . The main function of the family is to train children to become worthy parents , neighbors , and citizens . So far the family has fallen considerably below its possibilities . Child guidance clinics report that a high percentage , sometimes as high as 85 per cent , turn out to be parental guidance cases . Parents as a class have been woefully untrained for parenthood . Fortunately there are many new developments in parental education.53 For example , in the United States the National Parent-Teacher Association , with thousands of chapters and over a million members , is promoting child study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating back to 1888 , is a leader in the development of parental education conferences . The United States Children 's Bureau entered the field of parental education in 1924 . Colleges and universities are now establishing courses and even divisions of parental education . Religious bodies are also beginning to give attention to this vital theme . Adult education classes for the training of parents are spreading in public evening schools in the United States . Marriage guidance and family relations clinics are beginning to develop . They advise couples about to be married , and assist the married in meeting troublesome conflicts . They  | grown , she has full opportunity for development , usefulness , and status in the later years of life . Sometimes it is feasible for one who has entered upon a career before marriage to keep up some of the career activities during the child-raising stages of marriage . At least she can keep up to date and in touch with the new developments in her career . When the children are grown and her time is freer , she can continue with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily , if not to achieve renown . History , however , reveals important reasons for marriage irrespective of careers . Mead has shown how the Arapesh people view marriage as training in co-operative activities . " In the words of Johnson , the function of marriage " is primarily to promote the pattern of co-operative living . " " 7 Careful examination , moreover , shows that most marriages at any culture level produce some worth-while results in cooperative living , and that many marriages may be credited with a widespread and relatively permanent harvest in cooperative spirit and method . Not merely to raise more children , but " to increase the warm family circle within which one 's descendants may then live even more safely than one has lived oneself " is an aspect of marriage that merits attention . " The Chinese , of course , went one step further by increasing the ancestral circle and keeping its memories warm and active through their family system . At the other side of the picture was the Russian emphasis at the beginning of the Soviet regime , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also this idea has strong support . Experimentation , however , is still going on throughout the world . After thousands of years of human history , nothing superior to or as good as the educated , democratic family has been found for the training of children . Marriage and the family  | determine the heredity of nearly all children ; they convey cultural backgrounds ; they furnish the primary stimuli for personality growth . Although it be built of logs and possess humble appointments , the home may still function as " an informal school room of the human race and the noblest center of human affections . " Why is the family an important social institution ?  | EVERY person is born not only into a family but also into a community . At first he is not made aware of the community . But neighbors " run in " and he begins to make the acquaintance of some of the people who reside in the neighborhood . When he learns to walk , and then to play in the dooryard ( if there be one ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seek him out . Presently he is allowed to visit some of the neighborhood children , whereupon he begins to get a notion of his community as a primary group . As a child 's acquaintance with his neighborhood increases , the larger community in some of its rural or urban aspects is taken for granted . Its influence plays upon him in innumerable ways . Now and then he hears the larger community , the state , mentioned , and he learns of the duties of citizenship . Other races , peoples , nations are discussed in his hearing , and even the world as a concept is occasionally depicted for him . Thus , his ideas of the community begin with the neighborhood , but ultimately his thinking about community reaches out to include sections of the world group . A community is a social group with some degree of " we feeling " and living in a given area . To develop a real community of spirit it is necessary for all the members of a community to participate and to acquire a sense of belonging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may extend to all who commune together in the fellowship of similar attitudes and values . A community has been defined as  | " a group of people living in a contiguous geographic area , having common centers of interests and activities , and functioning together in the chief concerns of life . " Community organization is the basic way in which people react concerning the various phases of life . The older Chinese have a family-clan-village community organization . The older Japanese have a feudal-bureaucratic type . In the United States an **26;169;TOOLONG form of community organization has prevailed . In the family-clan-village organization nationalism is slow to develop and China still suffers from being a house divided into many parts . A bureaucratic organization makes the individual an automaton , while an industrial type makes him a slave to the day 's tasks . Community organization also has an administrative aspect . A community may organize itself to meet many of its needs . To be specific , a local community may be organized for recreation and pageant purposes , to send local representatives to a city council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reasonable water or transit rates , to take care of its own needy persons ; and in so doing it may develop a genuine community spirit . Communities are becoming commonalities , that is , a grouping together of persons with common attitudes and values , but spatially scattered . ' The closely knit community of a few decades ago in the United States is being supplanted by psycho-social unities of people possessing a wide spatial " scatter . " This situation suggests that a type of association , supplementary to neighborhood or community , is being developed , which is located wherever the means of transportation can carry the person ; which is defined in social contacts not limited spatially ; and which may be called the communality . The communality is a social grouping for carrying on an activity , whose members are drawn together on the basis of the common  | interest or interests subserved . Neither the communality itself nor its total membership is specifically related to any local area . It is an activity-circle . It is functional and not spatial . ' As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through family participation with a few persons living near by , and through family conversation , often uncomplimentary , about other persons living in the vicinity . In large cities today the neighborhood is largely a group of " nighdwellers " ; it is a group characterized chiefly by the fact that the members live within a certain geographic area . In a rural neighborhood people may live somewhat apart although within a specific area , but they know each other well . A village neighborhood involves persons living closely together and well acquainted with each other . An immigrant neighborhood includes people from a foreign country and their children , who are mutually acquainted , who live in close proximity to each other , and who possess a common group loyalty . The neighborhood is a loose integration of several family groups . Most people like to live near other people even though they do not have much to do with the nigh-dwellers . Children and women feel the neighborhood appeal more than do men . Social bonds , however , are rarely organized , except when a neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A neighborhood often has no specific form of group control except unorganized group opinion and gossip . Its lack of organized social aims explains its main weakness as a group phenomenon . The neighborhood feud is common , spectacular , and lasting . Since the neighborhood is composed of family groups living in close proximity and experiencing personal contacts of all sorts , conflict is likely to arise at any time . As a result of the highly personal nature of the neighborhood , people easily take sides . The neighborhood feud usually begins with a disagreement between two families over a boundary line between property ,  | over live stock , over children , or over a disparaging remark that one person is reported to have made about some member of another person 's family . The imagination works feverishly , tongues wag freely , and an alleged wrong is multiplied . Gossip arouses ill will , and a neighborhood becomes divided into opposing camps . The feud illustrates the neighborhood group in its worst behavior . It may run for years . In remote mountain districts it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacGregors have been killed , and all but one of the thirty-three Mclntoshes , leaving only one McIntosh alive and thus demonstrating to a disinterested world that the Mclntoshes have won . In the modern large city the neighborhood is losing its former entity , as is evidenced by the fact that nearly everyone can stand in his front door and behold the homes of a number of his neighbors whose names he does not know . Many people do not wish to " neighbor " with their neighbors . Old time neighbors are giving way to nigh-dwellers , while people " neighbor " with persons " living all over town . " I do n't know anything about the neighborhood . I do n't like it and take no interest in it . We have been here a year and bought only for investment . We have nothing whatsoever to do with my neighbors . I do n't even know their names or know them to speak to . My best friends live in the city but by no means in this neighborhood . We belong to no clubs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto riding , visiting , and up town to the theaters . ' We are renting and have been here six years . . . . We like to live here because of the conveniences , the local shops , and the junior high school . I do n't want to neighbor and I do not know how people neighbor . . . . I know nothing about the neighborhood and I never did have anything to do with my neighbors . I lived in the N. apartments in S. for ten years and never spoke to a neighbor in the house . I find it best not to , you are much safer . Then no one knows your business and I do n't care to know any one else's. '  | Human society began in rural groups , developed to the level of civilization in rural groups and in cities supported by a rural hinterland . Human society has been cradled in the rural group . Primitive groups evolved a crude form of village life , from which the men went out at first on the hunt and chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first women stayed at home , but when soil cultivation became extensive and arduous the women folks were also taken along to assist in the harvesting tasks . Today in many regions people live in villages from which they go out , perhaps a considerable distance , to the land that is often divided in strips and cultivated intensively . The rural group remained basic even after the rise of military strongholds , the establishment of special shrines or places of worship , and the creation of trading posts . In the Middle Ages when commercial centers surrounded themselves by walls , and included congested populations living by commerce and trade , rural influences were still dominant . With the rise of the modern metropolitan city , the urban group began to dominate civilization . The American farmer has been referred to as " the forgotten nun except at election times . " Despite urbanization it is still true that the population of the world is largely rural , that urban life is still dependent on the farm and what it produces , and that in times of widespread depression the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is walking the streets , the unemployed rural man can at least raise his own food supply , meet his needs for shelter , and partially provide his clothing needs . " Where two years ago there were countless empty houses and abandoned farms all over the Quincy area in Illinois , Missouri , and Iowa , now every available house is occupied and there are no unoccupied farms . "  | The force of depression produces what is probably only a temporary migration from city to country . While no permanency can be guaranteed to this population transfer , it is nevertheless an interesting social phenomenon . With a million people in a year transferring their allegiance even for a time from urban to rural life , something worth studying is taking place . A gain of more than 1,000,000 persons was registered in the nation 's farm population during 1932 , the Agriculture Department announced today . This evidence of the back-to-the-land movement was accompanied by a report showing that the vacant habitable dwellings in rural sections have been " largely reoccupied " and city families are experiencing increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a special survey conducted in 1938 , the U. S. Bureau of Census reports that the back-to-the-farm movement still continues . " One in every nine of the 3000 farms enumerated reported persons who had not resided upon a farm five years previously . " In a discussion of " oneacre farmers , " Pauline V. Young points out how some of the city people who are going back to the farm are attempting to combine " part-time industrial employment with part-time agriculture . " " Supplemental farming " on this urban-rural combination is a new occupational pattern . The question is raised : Will not these people who have been rebuffed by city life , and who are now having a real struggle in attempting to make even a supplemental living , " eventually become a sort of American peasantry " ? The rural group is built around the family . The country is a relatively safe place in which to rear children , although lacking in urban advantages . There are fewer false attractions in the country than in the city . The rural family lives together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works together , and goes together on picnics .  | The long hours and hard work of the farmer represent the exceptional day 's work , instead of the regular routine as in the case of the steel worker , the miner , or factory employee . Moreover , the farmer is in a way master of his own time . The introduction of labor-saving machinery has shortened farm hours , decreased the difficulty of labor , and increased the amount of leisure time . The rural school is undergoing transformations . Through the consolidated school and the rural high school , a new day for rural life may be expected . The rural school with adequate educational and playground equipment , with a permanent residence for the principal and his family , with a teaching staff that is somewhat continuous from year to year , and with a community and civic center program , is creating a new type of rural life . In many regions the rural church has been unable to meet the situation . There has been overchurching , and also sectarian conflicts . Many small rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where one strong church would have been better . Near-by city churches with their high-salaried ministers , chorus choirs , and well-organized church activities guided by energetic leaders have drawn rural people away from rural churches . Rural young people especially have felt this pull . " A specially trained rural religious leadership could transform rural life and make religion a truly dynamic force . The rural pastor is in a strategic leadership position . In addition to a modern religious training , he needs to be well versed in sociology , that is , in a knowledge of the laws of personality growth , group development , and social processes . He needs to understand the technique of making community surveys and  | community case histories ; he should be trained in methods for making the church a leader among rural institutions . He must be as interested in community reorganization as in personal regeneration . The rural church has lost a large part of the function as a social center that it once exercised . Decades ago in the United States the meeting house was the only place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rapid transit lines , the rural church is no longer the chief place at which people can meet for social interaction ll If the rural school , the rural church , and other rural institutions would co-operate toward dynamic community ends , they could make the country so attractive that the ablest young people , who now flock to the cities , would stay and add their abilites to the process of redeeming and magnifying rural group life . The rural community is a kind of enlarged primary group . Rural people are subject to the influences of face-to-face relationships . A great many of the mores of the people of the United States have been rural-born and rural-nurtured . Hence , when the rural community becomes urbanized and loses some of its primary group nature , the mores break down . Our problem becomes that of developing a secondary-group morale and new secondary-group mores that will be effective in an increasingly impersonal world . Many farmers are reconstructing their farm dwellings and grounds artistically . A small lawn with an attractive arrangement of shrubs and trees and driveways creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rural community of such homes gives rise to a great deal of group pride . With the passing of the unattractive , barren , and drudgery features of the farm home , there comes a new  | appreciation of the deeper rural values . Rural groups may yet develop many of the advantages of urban groups without acquiring many of the latter 's disadvantages . In many countries today the rural mind is closely circumscribed . It represents a great deal of mental inbreeding . In most countries of the world the rural mind is essentially an undeveloped mind ; it has not been fully or freely stimulated ; it flares up occasionally in feuds ; it has strong opinions , prejudices , and faiths . " The farmer , alert to sudden weather changes , destructive frosts or storms , and sometimes losing the gains of a year because of fruit or grain pests , or cattle plagues , develops attitudes of reserve and of independence . These attitudes are based not on social laws but on nature 's laws . The farmer enjoys standing upon a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his day 's work and even a year 's work to suit his own ideas . He pities city people who must work according to orders given by other persons . He reacts against the endless committee meetings , " the clatter and clash , the rush and pandemonium of sound " in the midst of which the city man is doomed to spend his best days . Rural life is not stilted or formal , except when people attempt to ape the city . It does not lead to an enslaving night life . Rural people are frank , open , and genuine ; they scorn the artificiality of many phases of city life . The rural mind is built on sturdy strength , physical endurance , continuous physical activity , freedom from nerve-destroying speed , and that fast living which turns night into day . With the development of scientific agriculture , the farmer is becoming increasingly independent of climatic changes and insect pests , but he is still subject to the manipulations of a Wall Street and of unscrupulous politicians . With the introduction of free mail service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , the rural group mind has enjoyed expansion . While the farmer has little chance of becoming a millionaire , he usually can make a comfortable livelihood . He is not obliged to live upon an imported food supply , as is the city man . He has plenty of room in which to live ; he is not forced to live as a cave man on the sixth floor of a dingy tenement , or to spend his savings as a slave to fashion 's dictatorship . The farmer has the satisfaction of being a direct producer of the necessities of life . He generally becomes a representative of the middle classes ; he rarely is an exploiter or grafter ; neither does he devote his life to financial speculation . His opportunities to develop an intellectual life have been slight . His reading centers in the intensely practical farm journals and also in the daily newspapers , although in many rural areas of the world these publications are unknown . Rural life does not offer many inducements for intellectual study , although wherever labor-saving machinery is being introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Many studies have been made of rural community groups which show that considerable progress is under way despite great difficulties . In the United States the ideal unit for rural social organization appears to be an area varying from thirty to fifty square miles . This area is represented in certain regions by the consolidated school district . It usually contains one or more trade centers , one or more religious centers , a community hall or two , and four or five neighborhoods ranging from twenty to fifty families each . The scientific study of rural groups is known as rural sociology . This science , which has been developing rapidly in the United States , points the way to a new era , not only for rural groups but also for the national group of which rural groups constitute a vital part .  | Five special rural problems will now be stated . ( 1 ) It is difficult to maintain upon farms in the United States persons of superior ability , for most of them have their eyes upon the city and move to the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They " retire " to the cities , leaving the rural community at the time when they might be free to render much community aid . ( 2 ) Closely related is the problem created by the young people of initiative and education who leave the farms for the cities . Energetic rural leadership is thus depleted . ( 3 ) In the United States rural people are characterized by a degree of isolation that is not found in rural Europe with its many village aggregations . Farm houses are separated in the United States and life is less associative . ( 4 ) Tenant farming is on the increase in the United States . It is becoming more and more difficult for a young man without means to marry , rear a family , and pay for a farm . ( S ) A related problem is that of land speculation . If in times of depression a young man can not buy a farm because farm produce sells too cheaply , then in times of prosperity prices of land are raised too high . The rise of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the concentration of landownership in the hands of a small percentage of the population . This system of " absentee landlords " rarely works well from the larger social viewpoint . The evils are so serious that it may be necessary to limit the amount of land that one person or a group of persons may own , and to regulate rentals . Either speculation in land or depression prices for farm produce works untold hardship on young people who have initiative and character but who possess no economic advantages . In its methods of social control of land a nation may well encourage rather than penalize young men and women who wish to establish homes on rural acreages of their own . Migrant farmers represent a new class produced by de-.  | pressions and by natural catastrophes . Migrant farm laborers have constituted an economic phenomenon , but migrant farm families are a part of the " new peasantry . " Many social problems have arisen in connection with the increasing numbers of farm migrants . ( 1 ) Family life and conditions lack stability . ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children , poor food for the children , the development of delinquency naturally follow where family life is subnormal. ( 3 ) Housing and sanitary and health conditions are often unfit for human beings . ( 4 ) Incomes are very low , social security legislation is lacking , and insecurity prevails . ( 5 ) Ostracism of the migrant farm family by regular farm families , segregation in temporary quarters , and lack of status are very disorganizing factors . ( 6 ) Social unrest mounts and a " bolshevistic " spirit becomes rampant . The transient rural family has become a national problem . Within recent years large-scale farming has been developing in the United States . Small farms have been joined together and mechanized farming using the latest machinery has developed . In consequence , adequate acreages for stranded farmers have been difficult to secure in many parts of the United States . Relief for farm families reached striking proportions in the United States in 1932 and succeeding years . Relief in money had a disorganizing effect . Work relief was not wholly appreciated . The Resettlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural people in need , thus enabling them to maintain status and at the same time to get started on a self-sufficiency course again . The Farm Security Administration was organized in 1935 . It was established to meet the needs of farmers who were suffering from debt , from exorbitant interest rates , from lack of agricultural skills , from unreasonable tenancy conditions , and from dust-bowl or exhausted soils . It stepped into the breach  | between hopelessness and inability to get help from private money-lending agencies . The FSA gives tenants a chance to own farms by lending them money at 3 per cent interest on time-periods as long as 40 years . It makes shorter loans to farmers who need seeds and tools and livestock . In these cases 5 per cent interest has been charged over a period of from one to five years . The farmer 's note secured by a mortgage on personal property , as distinguished from real estate , is accepted . The FSA has established a number of homestead projects providing on the average for 70 families each . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining areas . Plans are made available for the building of comfortable fourroom houses for as low as $ i 000 or $1200 . The FSA is also helping tenant farmers to obtain improved leasing arrangements whereby longer term leases at more reasonable rates can be secured . In this way tenants are encouraged to engage in soil conservation on the farms that they rent . Free instructions are available to tenants according to the varying conditions that are found in different parts of the United States . Where catastrophe occurs and property and crops are suddenly destroyed by wind , floods , or dry spells , short-term loans are immediately made . This emergency loan is usually supplanted by a standard loan on a longer term basis . In either case the farmer receives free aid in farm management . The FSA has lent a helping hand to the farm-owner who is burdened by a mortgage on his land . It has helped farmers to refinance their loans according to their abilities to pay . It has called together farmer and money-lender and effected readjustments in the terms of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers are protected from foreclosure and loss of their farms and creditors are saved from losses . Group loans have been made by the FSA , which have enabled a group of farmers to join together in buying supplies . Extensive electrification and other co-operative services also  | have been aided . Group health programs have been set up by farmers with government aid . Thus illness and heavy sickness bills have been reduced . Of the millions of dollars lent in these several ways to farmers , over one-fourth has been paid back already to the Government , even though the program has been in operation but a short while . Hence the Government has come to the rescue of rural people in need , making it unnecessary for hundreds of thousands to go on relief and otherwise to become dependents . More than one million families have received this type of self-sustaining help from their government . It has been pointed out that the depression which began in 1929 brought the following benefits to rural areas : ( I ) The subsistence values of rural life increased ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land for food , fuel and shelter , and all sorts of homemade goods . " ( 2 ) The soil conservation movement has been speeded up . ( 3 ) Rural social work has forged ahead . ( 4 ) Increased attention has been given to the status of tenants . ( S ) The importance of regionalism as a basis for rural programs has been recognized , as well as the need for a national agricultural policy that will integrate the opposing interests of different regions . The village has been in many countries a real neighborhood , the local point of all social life as well as of civilization . It has avoided the evils of both isolation and congestion . For the majority of mankind it has been the center of group life , but in the United States the village as a social nucleus has degenerated . The deadening life of the village is unfortunate but real . People move away from their isolated farm dwellings , pass by the village , and locate in the large city . The village , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , isolated farm dwelling is common . It possesses all the potential advantages of urban neighborhoods and affords expression for the gregarious impulses of  | people living a half mile or more from neighbors . It is or may be large enough to maintain nearly all the advantages of the city , and yet avoid the hustle , the superficiality , the soot , the squalor , and the homelessness of the large city . The village might become a happy medium between isolated farm living and congested urban living . The urban group is a loose organization of people living compactly in a limited area and possessing a relatively high degree of intercommunication . Industrial and business pursuits and social life comprise the main activities . Inasmuch as the people are removed from agricultural enterprise and from direct contact with nature , they live in a somewhat artificial , man-made world . They are subject to a superficiality which leads them to assume to be what they are not . Urban society is notorious for its haughtiness , its cocksureness , its " high life , " its wastefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , frugality , and satisfaction in work well done which is essential to national welfare . Urban groups are the products of complex social forces . They have often originated in trade centers , such as those located at " breaks " in transportation lines or near the centers of agriculture or mining . Sometimes they are the products chiefly of population momentum ; again , they have been produced by modern industrial and commercial enterprise . Nearly all cities have profited greatly by an immigration of rural people whose ambitious eyes have been caught by the flash of urban opportunities . In 1790 in the United States only about 3 per cent of the population lived in urban groups of 8000 or more people . Today over one-half of the population is congregated directly under urban group influence . In i 800 there were only five cities in the United States which had a population of r o , 000 or over ; in 1900 , a century later , there were 447 such cities . Every large city is the center of a constellation of smaller centers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the large center . We must consider a large city , therefore , not so much in terms of population as in terms of its " sphere of influence . " Every large city becomes a powerful super community . The development of the urban group is due to many factors . ( 1 ) As it grows the city gives increasing status to its inhabitants . The social contacts in cities are numerous and compelling . The ordinary person is afforded pleasure simply by being one of a large group , even if he does not know more than a few persons . ( 2 ) The invention of machinery , the increasing use of steam power , and the application of capital in commercial and industrial enterprises have created gigantic manufacturing plants . For the sake of working with others and of high wages men will forego the more independent forms of rural work . Thus , large-scale production has furthered the growth of cities . ( 3 ) The development in methods of transportation and communication , the increased desire for communication , and the facilities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain urban growth . The compactness of a city , its telephones , and its rapid transit system greatly facilitate interstimulation. ( q . ) There is more opportunity for personal advancement in cities than in rural districts . Munificent salaries are found only in the large city . Modern business and commerce draw young men to the cities , offering the chance to " get rich quick . " Religious leaders achieve high rank in cities ; educational leaders receive special recognition . In all lines of activity the urban possibilities of achievement far eclipse the opportunities for power and honor in the country . ( 5 ) The city offers superior educational advantages . Until recently all high schools were in cities . Elementary schools are better equipped and developed than in the country ; most .  | normal schools , colleges , trade schools are urban . Prominent national leaders give lectures and addresses in urban centers . Most large libraries are located in cities . Operas and art galleries are urban . ( 6 ) Amusement and recreational agencies in cities are drawing cards . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By making appeals in every conceivable way to the feelings , sentiments , play impulses of children and adults alike , commercialized amusements are powerful magnets . Thorndike and Woodyard have analyzed some of the individual differences in American cities . The cities that were studied differed greatly in wealth , income , health , educational opportunities , home ownership , and so on . A rough index of " goodness " was computed from the value of public property used for hospitals , for schools , for libraries , for museums , for parks , and so forth . However , in these cities there was " but little or no excess in eminent men or men of science . " Moreover , " the distribution of income in these good ' cities appears to be only a trifle more equal . ' " Between the large metropolitan city and the small towns there is what M. H. Leiffer calls " Mediopolis , " or the mediumsized city . As noted in an earlier chapter , Leiffer classifies the medium-sized city into five categories , and gives interesting case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ( 1 ) the commercial city , such as Des Moines , Duluth , Montgomery ; ( 2 ) the industrial city , or " Mediopolis in overalls , " such as Altoona , Scranton , Evansville ; ( 3 ) the industrial suburb , like Dearborn , Gary , Lynn , Paterson ; ( q. ) the residential suburb , or " the parlor of the metropolis , " as found in Cleveland Heights , Evanston , East Orange , Newton , Pasadena ; and ( 5 ) the resort city , " the playtown of the nation , " namely , Atlantic City , Miami , San Diego .  | Cities may be classified according to various standards . The " principal activity " as a test has been suggested by Muntz.2 ? According to this test , however , one activity or purpose may stand out , but several other activities will also be functioning . ( 1 ) Defense cities were all built with walls around them . A few centuries ago most of the world 's cities were walled . You can see them today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cartagena ( Colombia ) . Sometimes they had a moat as well ? for example , Dinkelspiel , near Munich . Mexico City was originally built in a lake for defense purposes . ( 2 ) Commercial cities arc well known . They usually began as seaport towns and were built where " breaks " in transportation came . Santos , Brazil , where coffee is loaded on ships and sent to the four corners of the world , illustrates the type well . London and New York are of course the leading commercial centers of the world . ( 3 ) Manufacturing or industrial cities are of modern growth . Fall River , Massachusetts , is noted for its manufacturing activities ; Pittsburgh for its steel plants , likewise Gary , Indiana ; Detroit for its automobile industry . Here labor problems are most acute , the smoke problem is aggravating , and there are large railroad yards . ( 4 ) Political cities are those in which governmental activities are centered . Washington , D. C. , and Ottawa , Canada , are busy places when Congress or Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hum of political activity and the excitement attendant upon formal state affairs obscure business and manufacturing activities . ( 5 ) Religious centers do not make a city religious but tend to define its reputation . Jerusalem commands more religious interest than any other in its general region . The Vatican City has been called a " shrine city . " ( 6 ) Educational cities are those that have grown up around or in connection with a great university . Oxford and Cam- bridge , England , are best known because of their universities ; so are Princeton and Ann Arbor in this country . As a rule they continue somewhat remote from the whirl of metropolitan life . ( 7 ) Resort cities are the product of wealth and of the search for relief from the overwork as well as the ennui attendant upon metropolitan life . Sometimes a Monte Carlo is the result , and sometimes a health resort with its quiet sort of life developed to meet specific health needs . This classification indicates variety in the functions of a city . Aside from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it is considered that every city is really a center of not one but four or five of these activities , its complexity and contradictory functions and resultant problems are evident . New functions are in process of development and some cities of tomorrow will doubtless be dominated by purposes concerning whose nature we can only guess . Modifying the analysis of urban growth as described by Patrick Geddes , Mumford has suggested six stages 21 Three represent growth and three decline . ( 1 ) The first is called eopolis . It refers to the rise of the village community , with its origins dating back to the Neolithic Age in human development . It is " the most enduring of collective forms . " Now and again it springs into a city . The city , however , may pass away , but the village goes on forever . ( 2 ) The second stage is represented by the polis or " an association of villages or blood-groups . " By this association the villages may defend themselves better " against depredation . " Rural customs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The metropolis or big city developed next . A city occupying a strategic topographical position takes a sudden spurt and outgrows its neighboring cities . Its very growth  | attracts newcomers . It becomes a regional city or a city that dominates a whole region . Size , bigness , speed , mechanization are characteristics of the metropolis . The arts reach a new high level . Rationalization grows systematic . A maximum release of cultural energy occurs . Metropolitanism means that " a specific population center controls the welfare and destiny of a group of outlying municipalities and other types of settlements . " " It is a powerful form of subtle social control . It exercises economic power over the millions who live within each metropolitan area . Also , it wields vast social power through its ability to confer status . ( 4 ) The fourth stage is called meglopolis . Decline results from an overemphasis on bigness . " Education becomes quantitative . " Exploitation of the proletariat occurs , resulting in " occasional outbursts of savage repression . " Speculators develop into a rabble and looting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth stage . Parasitism by some of the wealthy is fastened upon the poor . Political exploitation dominates the city . Armed thugs demand protection money . Population increase declines . Suicides mount and creative work ceases . The city is ruled by " gangsterdictators " and the cults of savagery again flourish . ( 6 ) The last stage is nekropolis . The city becomes but a " clumsy caricature " of its former self . It turns into a tomb ; sands creep over what were once magnificent structures ; flesh becomes ashes ; and Babylons and Ninevehs are no more . But this logic in urban events does not always occur . It need not occur , for culture has deep roots and social forces may surge forward again , even in the downward trend of urban change . Moreover , as Mumford emphasizes , even dead cities may experience a renewal of life ? for example , Rome . Nobility of purpose struck low may rise again . Urban groups have a reputation for namelessness . Their citizens meet and speak without knowing each other 's names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not know personally half the people whose homes are located in the same city block . Extensive secondary group relationships take the place of primary group ones . Homelessness is another disturbing characteristic of cities . Boarding-house life and hotel life do not permit the development of real homes . An automobile first and a home afterward or perhaps never is frequently an urban goal . To give to children a genuine home life on the sixth floor of a flat with hallways and flights of stairs as the only play space is almost impossible . A husband and wife with a pet dog can rent comfortable quarters with ease , but not so if they possess sons . The city environment often puts a premium on childlessness . Class extremes characterize the city . The worst racketeering and the best forms of ethical behavior are both to be found in cities . The direst poverty often exists in the shadow of the most elegant mansions , while superior creativeness and chronic unemployment are alike urban characteristics . Energy and speed are traits of the American city . Young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Stimulation and interstimulation are endless , but generally on superficial planes . The pace soon exceeds the ability of the human organism to maintain it ; it is " the pace that kills . " Hence cities have been called consumers of population . They stimulate persons to almost inconceivable efforts , but often at tremendous sacrifices . One of the most searching and revealing criticisms of the big city is given by Robert Sinclair . While he uses London , his home city , as the central theme , he is in reality holding the mirror up to the Big City in any country . The Big City to him is an illusion . Ordinarily conceived of in terms of " prosperity , power , and progress , " it gives people a false belief in its cultural and its leadership values . He deflates the Big City by claiming that one in every three  | Londoners dies in the poorhouse . He calls London a " field of adventure , child of Wren , mother of nations ? liar , oppressor , gaudy pauper , and provincial-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the large urban community , a sociologist concludes : " Evidently , men have not yet learned how to plan and control such huge aggregations . " 26 On the other hand , they are not going to give them up . The only solution is in more study of the large city , in a better administration , and in a more socially-minded citizenry . City planning has been made necessary by the confusion into which cities fall when the different interests develop , each according to its own notions . Belated city planning of this kind involves tearing down and building over , tearing down and widening streets , moving and removing . At its best city planning is the laying out of new plans for growth and expansion . Occasionally a city starts out from a carefully considered plan . A city in point is Washington , D. C. , for which a plan at the beginning was laid out by Pierre L'Enfant . An important aspect of city planning is zoning . Zoning has been defined as " public regulation of the utilization of privately owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates the uses to which land may be put . It permits certain uses , for example , for business , for apartment houses , or for parks and boulevards . It protects certain residence areas against the invasion of business . It standardizes the growth of a city . It makes the best use of land in the light of the total welfare , instead of allowing special interests to exploit urban advantages for their private gain . It helps a city to grow symmetrically . A " blighted area " is a district of a city that is on the way toward becoming a slum . It is an area that is no longer growing . In standing still it is falling backwards . Its buildings  | are not being kept up ; or if maintained in repair , no new structures are being erected ; or if some new buildings are constructed , the district is a jumble of old and new . The entrance of business into a residential district starts the blighting process . When permission to zone for business is given , the adjoining region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for residence " is a blighting factor . Nothing in group life is more pitiable than a dying residential area . A blighted area has been defined as a district in a city " which is chronically unable to pay its share of the municipal services essential to its existence , and unable by reason of its economic status to pay for its own renovation and repair . " Because of their poverty " all working class neighborhoods " are blighted . Moreover , cities tend unwittingly to standardize their blighted areas . Mumford suggests that tenement-house laws , for example , tend to establish " a standardization of blight . " In attempting to prevent the development of slums , blight is made permanent . But let no one be fooled , for " regulated blight is an outward order and decency , " while the content is not changed much . " The rural group furnishes deeply genuine attitudes , nerve stability , indifference to luxury , and vast undeveloped ability ; the urban group offers social stimulation , chances for personal advancement , opportunities for superior creative efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rural life reflects in a large measure the life-giving and health-restoring advantages of an outdoor existence . The city tears down nerves and wears people out , while giving them superior opportunities in countless directions . The history of mankind seems to indicate that any people which is chiefly rural or chiefly urban is at a disadvantage . In the first instance the people are understimulated and subject to inertia ; in the second , they are in danger of being smoth- ered by numbers , of being overstimulated , or of being exhausted nervously . A nation somewhat equally representative of healthy rural and healthy urban groups is likely to prove in the long run to be the strongest . The suburban group lives at the edge of the urban group . It is essentially a part of the urban group enjoying favorable living conditions . The suburban group has its occupations in the city but by virtue of the automobile or of commuting is able to live where light and air and space for homes are plentiful and in the main reasonable in price . Somewhat related is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , sometimes as an industrial center . When a large factory moves out from a city into an adjoining unsettled area , a small city tends to develop at that point . Its proximity to a large city and the original low values of the land involved are its outstanding features . The rurban group , a term coined by C. J. Galpin , refers to that phase of rural life which is becoming urbanized in certain particulars but which retains various rural features . The rurban group is a rural group in a state of urbanization . It has numerous urban advantages due to rapid transit , the telephone , daily newspaper , and the like ; yet it still retains its rural setting and some of its rural customs and traditions . It is in transition from rural to urban . It represents the extreme disadvantages of neither rural nor urban groups , but many of the substantial advantages of both . Another important social unit is the regional area . It usually combines rural and urban communities into one unit , but several regional communities are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from sectionalism . The former implies an integral relationship with a larger whole , while the latter suggests  | separation , segregation , and isolation . Sectionalism is a narrow loyalty to local interests and historic sentiments . Regionalism involves a cultural wholeness . There is a certain similarity in the culture traits of a region . A region has a culture history of its own . However , the attitudes of its people arc not all set toward the past nor are they all turned inward . The people of a region have attitudes that look toward a larger unit for stimulation , relationship , and growth . Regionalism is subordinate to nationalism . Regionalism includes unity in economic and social functioning . If necessity required , it would be possible for the region to become economically self-sufficient . Socially , also , It could live to itself alone . As an economic and a social unit , a region requires broad-gauge leadership , lest it sink into Sectionalism . Five kinds of regions have been distinguished by Odum and Moore . ( 1 ) A physical region is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large river valley surrounded by highlands and mountains is a well-known type of physical region . Far-flung tablelands would illustrate another type . ( 2 ) A metropolitan region includes a large city , its suburbs , and all the surrounding area whose trading activities center in the metropolis . The metropolitan region has a system of transportation and communication that radiates from the central large city . The major circulation of a metropolitan newspaper usually extends to the boundaries of the metropolitan area . ( 3 ) The sectional region is one in which a peculiar set of folkways prevails . Provincialism is a chief characteristic of a sectional region . Ruralism is likely to dominate . ( 4 ) The administrative region is governed by political boundaries . These boundaries have been determined by convenience or by accident or by political planning .  | usually possesses physical similarity , population homogeneity , and a number of cultural uniformities . Using this concept of regionalism , but at the same time keeping in mind the criteria of the other types of regions , Odum and Moore have marked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are : ( 1 ) The Middle States region , which contains more character traits that are usually identified as " American " than does any other region . The Middle States region includes the states from Iowa to Ohio and from Minnesota to Missouri . ( 2 ) The Northeast region may lay claim to being the " most American " because of its " priority of development . " It includes the New England states , and in addition , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and West Virginia . ( 3 ) The Southeast or " Old South " may be viewed as the " most American " because it maintains more of the " early Americanisms " than does any other region . ( 4 ) The Far West is " an indescribable American empire of contrasts and paradoxes , of miraculous transformations , and of a new composite America . " California , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington are grouped together in the Far West region . ( 5 ) The Northwest with its extensive plains is " most American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been attached in the public mind with America . It reaches from North Dakota to Idaho , from North Dakota to Kansas , and from Kansas to Utah . ( 6 ) The Southwest ( including Texas ) is pronounced the least American of the six regions . The Spanish and Indian influences figure extensively in the life of Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , and Oklahoma . Perhaps no two persons would agree entirely on a regional division of the United States . However , for many purposes , federal legislation could meet various needs better by regional provisions than by blanket regulations for the whole nation . A great gain would result if the economic distributive processes and the consumption processes alike could be treated on regional bases . The differences between the needs of one state in the Union and another are often not great  | enough to justify a separate administrative and legislative set-up . A regional basis would be much more fitting . Efficiency in the nation , however , is often defeated because of bigness . A Southerner in the President 's cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise , a Cabinet member from the Southwest might be quite blind to the . needs of the Northwest . However , as Odum and Moore contend , a fundamental aspect of regionalism is " national reintegration . " Each region needs to see its total perspective in the changing drama of national life . Each region must function not only as a unity in itself , but also as an integral phase of the social reality of the nation as a whole . The national group is composed of rural and urban groups , . of neighborhood , community and regional groups united by a commonly accepted set of collective representations or symbols . The national group is a social control group with its activities centered in an organized government . When danger of attack from outside forces is greatest , the national group is likely to be strongest . The national group originated in the need for protection . Individuals who live under a group organization survive , while others perish . In the presence of a common enemy , . primitive peoples developed a keen sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horde was the group organization in which the modern state had its origin . It was a sort of temporary oligarchy based on respect for those whose personal prowess enabled the group to meet attack successfully . The horde may be distinguished from the clan or an organization of families ; from the household or a group organization for economic purposes ; and from the phratry or a group organization for social , recreational , and religious ends . The horde possessed three of the fundamental elements of the modern nation . It had ( 1 ) the idea of the authority of  | the leaders ; ( 2 ) a notion of law , in the obedience given to the commands of the chieftain , and in the customs governing the group while fighting and hunting ; and ( 3 ) an extensive unity , since all members combine for a general purpose . Under the protection of a group organization , such as the horde , primitive people acquired occupational stability and inaugurated social advance . Here also were found the origins of private property . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of protection from the antagonistic world . In the tribal group , which was an advance over the horde , the need of protection stands out prominently . As in the case of the horde , the ties of blood relationship functioned as a bond of union . The common descent of members from a fictitious ancestor was postulated , and the ruler or king was invested with the absolute authority of a father . Religion , especially in the form of ancestor worship , also rendered important service in developing the habit of obedience . It enforced with supernatural sanctions the customs , political and otherwise , of the past . The tribal group was based on the need for protection , on ties of blood relationships , and on the strength of a common religion . The city state was in part an outgrowth of tribal group life . The need for protection was greater than ever , as opposing groups increased in size . The ties of blood relationship were still strong . Religion was an affair of the state and a bond of political strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular in its exercise , than that of the tribal group . The city state developed an elaborate administrative machinery , promoted art and education at times , and achieved considerable recognition and historical significance . The feudal state was no longer an enlarged family as was the tribal group . It was " more like an army . " The government of the feudal state was semi-military . In theory the  | king owned the whole feudal group . He parceled out the land to his nobles , who in turn distributed it among their subordinates . The members did not live so much for the feudal group as for the ruler . Everything was concentrated in the monarch . Personal allegiance to the king overshadowed other loyalties . The absolute monarchical group was an overgrown feudal organization . For centuries in many lands the monarchs treated their respective states as their private property ; concessions were secured from them with the greatest difficulty . The absolute monarch was a dictator . Any limitation of the authority of the monarch was rarely obtained except at the cost of bloodshed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret organizations . In Russia , for example , political parties existed largely as secret organizations until 1917 . In fascist countries today , a reversion to secret political groups naturally occurs . The constitutional monarchical group afforded some privileges to the constituency . The people slowly but surely obtained certain rights from the ruler . The people secured a parliament through which to express their wishes . The monarch lost his status of a superior being with divine rights . Political parties grew stronger ; they developed into open organizations representing conservative and liberal attitudes on the various questions of interest to the constitutional group . The sovereignty of the members of the group became recognized . The fascist group is a reversion to a dictatorship . The leader rules by might . The group gives over its powers of governing to one man who by support from an army suppresses and imprisons opponents . Freedom of the press , of assemblage , of speech are denied to all except those who agree with the dictator . The schools become propagandistic and a generation of automatons is produced . Fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major industry becomes " Public Spectacles . " The megalomania , or thirst for power , of the dictator at times knows no limit . Political absolutism and amoral nationalism are in the saddle As Mussolini has said , " The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing ; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist , much less have value . " In a presidential message to the people of the United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 1 , 1939 , summed up the disadvantages of totalitarian dictatorship in the form of several costs : " The cost of our spiritual values . The cost of the blessed right of being able to say what we please . The cost of freedom of religion . The cost of seeing our capital confiscated . The cost of being thrown into a concentration camp . The cost of being afraid to walk down the street with the wrong neighbor . The cost of having our children brought up not as free and dignified human beings but as pawns molded and enslaved by a machine . " Fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still keeps the classes . When the classes verge toward conflict the state clamps down on their activities . Labor unions are supplanted by guilds operating under direct state control . Sit-down strikes , sabotage , and picketing are prohibited . Likewise the employer is forbidden to profiteer , to dismiss employees arbitrarily , or to maintain indecent conditions of labor . Unfair competition among employers and monopolistic control by employers are not permitted . The rights of property are protected and the obligation to work is emphasized . Fascism experiences a serious dilemma in that it demands , as Ebenstein suggests , obedience , discipline , and a blind acceptance of fascist principles , and yet on the other hand if it would meet new and changing social problems and wax strong from within it must have " intellectual courage and  | independent thinking . " But how can it achieve its goal when it demands meek subservience and refuses to develop original social and political thinking ? Another dilemma is found in the fact that if fascism is to keep its subjects satisfied with being mere cogs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which produce poverty and more dissatisfaction . The alternative is war itself , which brings about still greater poverty and misery , and hence more social rumblings of internal dissension . In any case fascism seems to face from within a tragic circle of events . Totalitarianism considers the individualistic view of life " a basic error . " Individuals are abstractions and do not exist outside of the state . They are " born from the State , sustained by the State , and brought up in the history and traditions of the State . " According to the ideas of individualism , men live in their smaller selves ; but under totalitarianism , individuals give their smaller selves up " in order to return to and live in that higher and all-embracing life " of the state . In Japan , for instance , " the highest life for the Japanese subject , is to offer himself in perfect loyalty to the Throne so that lie may participate in Its glorious life . " Katz and Schanck argue that fascism 's goal is one of complete regimentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of employer who desires " an ideal working class made up of men who will work hard , ask for little , spend that little upon necessities rather than drink , starve through depressions without complaining , and raise their children to follow in their footsteps . " Fascism has developed in active nations in which " there is economic stress , lack of raw materials ; and need of new  | territory and economic expansion . " In conjuncture with these three factors comes a dictator who promises " a great , glorious , and prosperous future that is supposedly hindered by external enemies alone . " As progress is made in determining the conditions under which dictatorships rise and flourish , it may some day be possible for a deliberative body representing a world society of nations to deteilnine what kind of political ideologies can best guide mankind along lines of peaceful development and enrichment . The democratic nation abolishes the office of king and establishes the sovereignty of the people . By means of representatives the people attempt to express their wishes . A general election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disapproval . Gigantic political powers develop . There are generally no more than two leading political parties in the democratic state at a given time , although in European countries such as Germany before the Hitler revolution in 1933 , there were several strong parties which were deadlocked to the point that no majority could be obtained by any of them . The deadlock created inefficiency and helped to prepare the way for National Socialism . Political parties perform a definite social function . The party in power rarely initiates new programs after having been in authority for any length of time . It generally has more than it can do in fulfilling pre-election promises . The party not in control renders a service in prodding up the party in power , and in insisting that the latter live up to its promises . The party out of power usually stands for new measures in order to bid successfully for the suffrage of the people . The democratic national group is in danger of breaking down because of too much individualism and indifference to social welfare . The multiplication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government . The complexity of modem city life is so great that the ordinary person has difficulty in determining the truth about candidates for office . It was Elihu Root who once publicly expressed the belief that there are too many persons who are trying to get something out of their country and too few who are trying to serve it . Too many persons have accepted government positions for the sake of the offices , the appropriations , the class benefits , and " too few have sought to preserve liberty and to do justice " for the sake of their national group . Some persons give their attention so largely to their private affairs and neglect governmental affairs so generally that politics has fallen into the hands of racketeers . Hence , many worthy persons refuse to run for public office lest their own good names become smirched . Many politicians work in a realm of irresponsible secrecy and government decays at the core . That a public office is a public trust is a principle exceedingly difficult to realize . The larger a nation becomes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a democratic one , as " a ruler operating from above . " It is not easy for the government of a hundred million people to remain in touch with the people , or to act promptly and flexibly in response to public need . It is also difficult for public opinion under such circumstances not to be influenced by propaganda 43 The nation , thus , is a group of people living within a specific territory and exercising organized control over its members . Its activities are threefold : ( 1 ) activity with reference to its citizens , guaranteeing them both security and liberty ; ( 2 ) activity in promoting constructive measures for  | group advancement ; and ( 3 ) activity with reference to other states for the interchange of goods and services and the defense of citizens abroad or of its territory at home 44 In the first instance the state defends the law-abiding citizen and punishes the anti-social individual . It enforces contracts between persons when properly drawn ; it affords damages for accidents ; it aims to protect individuals against fraud ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other purposes . It is a powerful agency of social control ; it incarcerates for life and it takes life . In the second instance , the state has many social and economic functions . It coins money and assumes charge of or responsibility for banking . It has become an extensive employer of labor ; it carries the mail ; it builds and maintains highways . The question may be raised : How far should the state go in the economic sphere ? The answer varies . The capitalist says : " Just as little as possible , and still maintain national unity " ; the socialist , " As far as possible , and still maintain individual participation . " The present tendencies are in the main toward an increasing degree of government supervision and control . The entrance of our Government into direct competition with private enterprise was well under way by 1935 when over 10,000 workers were employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority . This public works enterprise included not only the turning of the hydraulic forces of the Tennessee River into electrical power but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government also manufactures and sells phosphates as fertilizers . Moreover , the Government has taken charge of social reorganization in portions of the Tennessee Valley , and has built homes and villages or small towns . The meaning of this development for the future of our country depends on its success and on public opinion regarding its merits . In the third instance , the state carries on an elaborate set  | of diplomatic and military activities . The citizen expresses his indebtedness to the state through patriotism , which often is built up largely as a defense mechanism against other states . The strength of patriotism becomes apparent only in case of national emergency , especially when some other state becomes aggressive . Patriotism sometimes unwittingly contributes to national egotism . Sometimes it denies the full obligation of the nation to other nations . Sometimes it creates chauvinism . Sometimes it defeats internationalism . Nevertheless , patriotism is absolutely essential to national welfare . The nation is a group which needs citizens of strong moral character , but which is not in position to create that character directly . Moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does something in this connection , however , such as preventing the circulation of obscene literature , and regulating the sale of intoxicants . The national group that is wise provides training for adequate rural leadership and rural social organization . It endeavors to transform its village groups into active intermediaries between rural and urban life , providing through them many of the advantages of urban life with little of the nervous wear and tear for which cities are notorious . It strives to make its cities into social groups where constructive home life prevails , where slums arc abolished , where persons are stimulated to do their best but not at the expense of other persons , and where pro-social attitudes reign . The succession of horde , tribe , city state , feudal state , monarchical state , and democratic national state has but one next stage and that is world community . Hundreds of international organizations have been formed in , the last fifty years ; all of these connote progress in world community thinking . Although many of these international bodies are loosely organized , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they do not carry the force of law or national decree , they are creating world opinion and are stimulating co-operative international activities .  | The Hague Tribunal has attracted the attention of the world in the settlement of many international disputes , some of which could easily have led to war . It has demonstrated the need for a more widely effective world instrument of adjudication . The League to Enforce Peace set a new ideal clearly before the world and pointed the way to a League of Nations , the formation of which constituted another step in the direction of world community . President Woodrow Wilson 's memorable statement before the Chamber of Deputies in Rome , January 3 , 1919 , that the need of the hour is " to organize the friendship of the world " is still fundamentally true . International law is an evidence of world community at least in an incipient form . International law is a body of rules , generally recognized by civilized states , which determines to a degree the conduct of modern states in their mutual relations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it necessary that they develop standard rules of action in their interaction . In war times and similar crises the principles of international conduct are likely to be violated . Owing to the absence of an adequate world opinion or of some other social force , international law may break down . The function of international law , however , is to regulate the conduct of national groups in all their contacts , hostile as well as pacific . Modern international law is based on the principle that nations are organic units in a larger society , and possess mutual obligations . Hugo Grotius was one of the first outstanding leaders in bringing about a recognition of the international concept . World community is developing despite many and serious setbacks . The spirit of nationalism is still far stronger than the spirit of world community . The World War of 1914-1918 demonstrated that nationalism in Europe is more powerful than Christianity , with its doctrine of the brotherhood  | of man , for Christians split up into their respective national camps and viciously mowed each other down while calling upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise showed that nationalism is stronger than socialism with its international premises , for calloused-handed workers were divided into the opposing national camps and tried to annihilate each other with poison gas . The League of Nations was seriously handicapped because it was built upon so many nationally narrow concepts . Some feared it as an organization of nations for the promotion of an autocratic capitalism . Others suspected it as a post-war weapon for defending the Versailles Treaty . Still others felt that it was in reality a league of European nations . Even its very limited power to deprive nations of a small part of their sovereignty for the sake of world community was deplored by nationalists everywhere . The Washington Conference on Limitation of Armaments was based on the principle that independent nations should come to agreement on world problems without giving up even a slight degree of sovereignty to a world agreement . The Conference furthered the development of a world public opinion . The Kellogg-I3riand or Paris Peace Pact made considerable headway in a world community direction . Its pronouncement is remarkable : The High Contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another . The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be , which may arise among them , shall never be sought except by pacific means . On July 24 , 1929 , President Herbert Hoover proclaimed the Pact in full force . World community was definitely pro- moted by it . However , in September , 1931 , Japan , one of the signatories to the Peace Pact , sent her armies into Manchuria and to Shanghai and opened her guns on the Chinese , violating the spirit of her own signature to the Peace Pact . Secretary of State Henry Stimson in January , 1932 , declared that any territory taken over by Japan in violation of the Peace Pact would not be so recognized by the United States . Japan did not actually declare war , and hence it is claimed that she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1932 it was proclaimed that a declaration against war was not enough to meet the world situation . The phrase in the Pact " condemn recourse to war " shall become " condemn recourse to force . " Thus the movement to safeguard world peace and promote world community is a contest of wits , a struggle to solve the problems created by hypernationalism , and a desperate race between warlike forces and attitudes of peace . The London Economic Conference of 1933 made little headway , partly because three underlying national principles were in conflict . From London William Allen White pointed out that three systems of control were deadlocked , namely : democracy , represented , for example , by Great Britain , France , the United States ; fascism , represented by Italy and Germany ; and communism , represented by Russia . Nationalism was blocking internationalism , with fears , hatreds , and prejudices predominant . Moreover , it was proclaimed that the public conference method is inefficient , because while the speakers are addressing the assembled multitude of newspaper reporters and political attaches of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the representatives of the respective nations behind closed doors or via telegraph and cable dispatches in code to each other . However , there never was a time when so many people as now in each country are aware of the nature of international dilemmas and hence in a position to exercise effective influence through public opinion .  | In 1933 Hitler came into power in Germany and began to challenge many treaty agreements . By the threat of force he was able to defy the League of Nations and the democracies of Europe . Even England and France led in 1938 in sacrificing the leading democracy of Central Europe , Czechoslovakia , to Hitler 's campaign for a greater Germany . National Socialism is fascism and totalitarianism plus the doctrine that " Germany is the supreme embodiment and leader of the noble and creative Germanic , Nordic or Aryan race . " Liberalism , democracy , and parliamentarianism are all rejected . A tribal racialism is being developed , and a religion with Wotan or Odun , god of battles , as its chief god is being revived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition on a tremendous scale of collective psycho-pathology ; compounded of desperation , fear , a patriotic inferiority complex and defense mechanism . " In 1935 Italy proceeded to attack Ethiopia by force , and to carry on a campaign of destruction of human lives against a relatively helpless people . Deadly mustard gas was sprayed from airplanes , and susceptible chieftains were bribed . Ethiopia fell despite the strenuous efforts of the League of Nations to impose sanctions against Italy for violation of agreements . Sanctions in this case arc restrictions on an aggressor nation . They amount to embargoes as far as the nations employing them are concerned . In other words , nations agree not to sell goods or to lend money to a nation that is violating treaties and endeavoring to conquer a weaker nation . Sanctions against Italy failed partly because England and France could not agree and partly because sanctions could not be enforced universally and completely . In 1937 Japan sent her armed forces into China in order to bring that independent but divided nation " to her knees . " The League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assistance in protecting China . The latter country , having relied upon the League and being failed by it , was  | forced to arm as best she could in order to defend herself . Not receiving much real support from the Western democracies , China was forced to make peace with the Communists within her borders and to turn to countries like Russia for aid . Neutrality has been a much-used concept . It means that a nation adopting a neutrality policy in the case of war between two other countries will not sell munitions of war or secondary war materials or make loans to either combatant . By adopting a policy of this kind in 1937 with reference to the civil war in Spain , the United States found her merchants of munitions selling war materials chiefly to people in Europe who were supporting the fascist-dictator group in Spain . Since the liberal-government group could not afford to buy , the United States through its " financial interests " was thus helping the fascist-dictator group to win . In this case neutrality defeated the aims of its promoters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States not to declare a neutrality policy with reference to Japan 's undeclared war on China . Why ? In so doing , war materials would not be sold to either country , and Japan would be greatly favored , for Japan had large reserves of war materials in storage with which she could defeat China , which had no reserve supplies . Another important aspect of the neutrality situation is that all countries must unite on a neutrality policy against an aggressor nation or aggressor nations if it is to succeed . If the United States adopts a neutrality policy and Canada does not , then while our merchants will cease to sell directly to an aggressor , they can sell through Canadian business men to the aggressor at only a slight inconvenience . Pacifists argue that the declaration of an embargo or a boycott , that is , a refusal to buy from an aggressor nation , is almost a declaration of war against that nation . The argument is that embargoes and boycotts cut off the masses of people of an aggressor nation from food and turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their  | government views the embargo and boycott declared against them as an act of " war . " In 1938 a sharp division of opinion developed in the United States and elsewhere within the ranks of the advocates of peace . One group believed in " collective security " and the other in " isolation . " The latter includes many r oo per cent pacifists . They renounce war altogether . They believe that if ro per cent or some such percentage of people in each nation would refuse to kill the people of other nations , war would speedily disappear . On the other hand , the collective security advocates contend that the nations who believe in democracy and liberalism should agree on a policy of defending democracy by the use of discretionary legislation . In other words , all such peoples should agree upon a general policy ( before war breaks out anywhere ) of what they will do in case of war . For example , they could announce beforehand that any nation or nations that engage in aggressive war in violation of agreements will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are numerous enough , if united in a positive policy , to prevent war by dictator groups . But are the democratic groups ready to work together in behalf of these purposes ? In the early decade of the twentieth century the world was reaching the place where thinking people were speaking of Western civilization or Eastern civilization , of Occidentalism or Orientalism , but where the differences between the two , not the likenesses , were emphasized by the chauvinists on both sides of the Pacific . The average members of the Western social order were widely proclaiming its superiority . They failed to understand or to study the worthy phases of Orientalism ; they saw and magnified its defects . They often failed to acknowledge the weaknesses of Occidentalism , and went on their way boastfully blind . Likewise , many adherents of Eastern civilization were silently and politely feeling a sense of their own superiority . They pitied Western chauvinists . Now and then someone such as Rabindranath Tagore openly expressed himself , calling Western society  | black and dwelling upon the many superiorities of the East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made by Charles A. Ellwood , J ? who has outlined the following attributes : ( 1 ) A set of ethical and religious values was derived from the Hebrews and early Christians . In the former the major concept is justice ; in the latter , love . ( 2 ) Philosophical and ethical values were contributed by the Greeks . ( 3 ) Administrative and legal values stressing the rights of property originated with the Romans . ( 4 ) Personal liberty values were developed by the early Teutons and given concrete modern expression under the laissez-faire doctrine of the nineteenth century in Western Europe and the United States . Within recent decades additional values have been produced by Occidentalism , namely , ( 5 ) scientific methods , ( 6 ) business and industrial techniques , ( 7 ) universal education , and ( 8 ) as an antidote to economic inhumanity , a set of humanitarian values . Eastern civilization is distinguished by the following : ( 1 ) Its sacrifice values are so important to the Oriental that the Occident seems to him synonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values in Orientalism , culminating in mysticism . ( 3 ) In the East there is veneration for parents , for customs and traditions , for law , order , and stability . ( 4 ) There are important conventional standards expressing themselves in courtesy and in an appreciation of the finer values of life . ( 5 ) Orientalism is esthetic and mystic , not rational-philosophic. ( 6 ) Orientalism has a sense of social solidarity , and strong sentiments of patriotism . The social group past and present ranks far above the individual . ( 7 ) Family stability extending back into past generations is given prominence , whereas in the West the convenience of the individual is often put first . ( 8 ) The Oriental lives in generalizations rather than in particularizations . He glories in the abstract more than in the concrete . When the positive elements in Western and Eastern civili- zations are brought together apparent differences are present . We see the rationally versus the mystically philosophic , action versus contemplation , the physical versus the psychical , individualism versus solidarity , the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility versus estheticism , anxiety as opposed to tranquillity , and the means of life versus the sake of living . " These apparent contrasts , vividly stated by Dr. Inazo Nitobe , upon reflection provide nothing less than adequate bases for building a world community that will be superior to either Western or Eastern civilization . Many of these seeming contrasts represent different poles of the same social axis . Apparently the peoples of the world are growing psychically and culturally similar . Mankind had common origins but dispersed early in many directions over the earth . In various physical , climatic , and social environments mankind became widely differentiated into races and cultures . Whether one accepts a polygenetic theory or a monogenetic theory of the origin of man , the main point still obtains , namely , that a unity of culture patterns is developing . World community is being built out of the values of the individual nations , but its development is being hindered by hyper-nationalism , provincialism , and chauvinism . It is balked today by balance of power practices , by secret treaties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindered by a grouping of peoples under the banners of totalitarianism . Can totalitarians and believers in democracy work together ? Can a new Union of Nations be developed where two widely differing ideologies find agreement ? Was the agreement arrived at in Munich in September , 1938 , between Chamberlain , Daladier , Mussolini , and Hitler a capitulation or did it involve compromise and mutual sacrifice ? Even the League of Nations with all its failures was not visionary but a realistic vision . It built up the concept of " a  | world society settling its affairs , not by force of war , but by common consultation and in co-operation . " The League has gone as far as the world is ready to have it go . The world is not yet ready for a super-state . World community is a working together although not necessarily alike of all peoples toward the realization of world values . A world situation in which there are sixty nation groups , each setting up its own standards of right and wrong conduct , and each passing judgment on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a socialized citizenry , and a widespread community consciousness . Humanitarianism , having no goal outside itself , tends to become self-centered , concentrated , and professional . The principles of brotherhood are more than humanitarian . Since their ultimate goal is located outside and beyond humanity , they provide a dynamic guiding force for world community . A new Association of Nations is needed . It needs to be based frankly not on the results of past wars but on present needs and future interests . If the sociological hypotheses are correct , namely , that people the world over are far more alike than they are different and that they have more in common than they have in opposition , then an association of nations has solid foundations in human nature upon which to build . Strange to say , the first step has scarcely yet been taken . Certainly no official progress from any source has made much headway . This initial step involves the investigation by a broadly representative committee of the widespread and common interests of the nations of the world . In the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and needs would have to be obtained . Here would be substantial ground upon which another representative committee could build plans for an international association of nations . This association would need to pool the good will and the dependability of each nation . It would have as its task the defining of goals toward which all could work . If a world ideal toward which all the nations could strive in  | co-operation were to be clearly and acceptably defined , a great gain would be made . The economic development of all would be a worthy aim . Co-operation , not competition , would serve as an excellent principle . After progress had been made in co-operative and dependable and trustworthy efforts and organization , an association of nations could then undertake to study the specific needs of each nation and to devise ways and means of achieving such ends in ways that would not destroy the developmental interests of any of the other nations . A co-operative society of nations might have to reduce competition in many directions and to boost co-operation into first place as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize the democratic nations of the world into an international association . Streit 's idea assumes that democratic and totalitarian nations can not work together . " Their social principles are too variant . Perhaps he is correct , and yet where is the dividing line between democratic and non-democratic nations ? What would a non-democratic nation need to do in order to qualify for membership in a democratic league ? Would the organization of such a league tend to bring the totalitarian states into closer union and thus set up another powerful and competing organization of nations ? A " union now " of the democratic nations would build up a nucleus of increasing size and strength of nations who believe in and practice negotiation and arbitration . If the test of willingness to practice the two principles of negotiation and arbitration ( when negotiation fails ) is adequate , then " union now " of all the democratic forces of the world is in order . Another suggested procedure is for all the nations to organize de novo an Association of Nations on the ground that the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each nation might indicate its .  | sincerity by cutting down its expenditures for war purposes by 10 per cent . The money that would come from this 10 per cent would be put into an International Fund , the fund to serve as a basis for building up the welfare of all the nations . Five methods of helping the nations are suggested : ( i ) stabilizing currencies , ( 2 ) lowering tariffs , ( 3 ) financing and furthering the distribution of raw materials , ( 4 ) developing many international services , new and old , and ( 5 ) assisting nations when widespread calamities strike them.54 The plan assumes that behind different ideologies are common beliefs and ideas and social forces that can be utilized in putting the nations on a working-together basis . It supposes a higher , universal aim toward which all can work . In so doing it may be that mutual trust would begin to develop and mutual mistrust be allayed and reduced . A world society requires that the leaders of the world work together and develop mutual dependability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations for an enduring Association of Nations .  | HUMAN life is focused not only in the family and community groups but also in occupational groups . In the family group bread and butter problems , money matters , and occupational activities arise from time to time for comment and discussion . Dinner table talk frequently relates to the day 's work . If work is regular and remuneration is received , an occupational status has been achieved . An occupation is any type of activity to which a number of persons give themselves regularly for pay . A profession is a specialized type of occupation which maintains formal standards for admission , which requires training based on a special university curriculum , and which maintains codes of ethics and formally takes membership away from those who are proved unworthy . An occupational group is composed of all the persons engaged in a similar type of activity , who tend to use special vocabularies and have similar views on life as a result of their occupational activities over a period of years . Among early human groups the elemental impulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to activity . Primitive people satisfied this impulse by searching for food and living upon what they could raise . They gorged and starved , feasted and fasted , according to their skill or luck in finding food . As an aid in this search for food , primitive people invented  | crude weapons and tools . Man , the only tool-using animal , invented knives for cutting , hammers for fracturing , needles and awls for perforating , tongs for grasping , and so on throughout a long list of complex implements . ' It was a remarkable advance when man learned how to kindle a fire , and could cook . Another achievement was the discovery of drying foods in the sun , or before a fire , as a means of preserving them for times of scarcity . The digging stick , as the forerunner of hoe-culture and later of agriculture , was used to scratch the surface of the soil for planting seeds . For long centuries , doubtless , women with digging sticks and similar crude implements managed to raise a few herbs and roots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime men were engaged chiefly in the hunt and the chase , and in fighting . Man moved forward again when he learned to domesticate animals . This domestication resulted in giving the human race valuable assistance in its industrial activities : in the dog , man had an assistant in the chase ; and in the ox , a beast of burden . Then there developed the raising of domesticated animals for food , which guaranteed a dependable defense against hunger and relieved the human group of its dangers of famine , except occasionally . The domestication of animals became a group undertaking , and a few domesticated animals grew into extensive flocks and herds . Group life changed when pastoral and nomadic life developed . In order to secure pasturage , the human group followed the flocks up the valleys and mountain slopes in the summer and back again in the winter . Not only was a stable food supply thus made fairly certain , but materials were always at hand for clothing . Social organization took on new aspects . Instead of human life 's being organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flocks and herds , women were subordinated , and men came into a larger dominance .  | Along with the development of hoe-culture , field-culture , or agriculture , and pastoral occupations , there arose the institution of private property . Tools and weapons were early considered to be the private property of their maker . With the increase of flocks and herds the institution of private property seems to have become well established . Land and pasturage , however , were first considered group property , but flocks became private property with group protection . Each tribe or group possessed its generally recognized territory throughout which its members might wander with their cattle , sheep , and goats . The use of land as an occupational activity is primeval and universal . Hoe-culture , including the protection of roots and tubers for future consumption , developed into tillage of the soil with oxen and plow . When men turned from the hunt as a means of livelihood to hoe-culture ? which was probably developed first by women ? they made application of some of the technical skill which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed , and hoe-culture was supplemented by crude field-culture on a relatively larger scale . Thus agriculture was born . With the rise of agriculture , primitive groups passed from the flesh diet of nomadism to a larger use of vegetable foods . The roaming life of hunting days and pastoral nomadism gave way by degrees to the more settled life of agriculture and to the farmer . The farming occupation developed its own attitudes and values , based on an individualistic , stationary life located close to nature rather than to people . With the cultivation of the soil and the accompanying vast increase in food supply , population multiplied . Agriculture made fixed abodes necessary , and led to the establishment of village communities . The village group grew out of gregariousness , and of the need for protection against human enemies and against storm , famine , sickness , wild beasts , evil spirits . All these changes were accompanied by the creation of new forms of wealth . The making of money itself became an oc- cupation which has added greatly to human welfare but which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery , and which has dominated other occupations as well as life itself . Slavery early acquired an occupational status . Slaves were used as labor on plantations , in building gigantic structures in the days before appropriate machinery was invented , and in ceremonial exercises . The slaves in royal households enjoyed great status in the eyes of other slaves . Slavery gradually became economically unprofitable and was ultimately supplanted by free labor and the wage system . Even if human sentiments had not been deeply affronted by such practices as selling children and women " on the block , " the factory system would have overcome the slave system . People paid by the hour , day , week , or month have greater stimuli to work than do slaves as a class . In the long run they are much more efficient . In this way the wage system drives out the slave system . This tendency was developing in the South in the United States even before the abolitionists began their campaign against slavery . Down to the middle of the eighteenth century , agriculture was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating the soil , which had existed for centuries , permitted a small percentage of the people , sometimes known as lords , to own not only the land but also the people who worked on the lands and who were known as serfs . With the Industrial Revolution which began in England in the latter part of the eighteenth century , and with the manufacture of tools on a large scale , there developed a new type of agriculture . The division of land into farms under independent ownership became common . An increase in population and in the demand for food brought about a change from a superficial and extensive type to an efficient and intensive type of farming , and inaugurated the scientific agriculture of the twentieth century . Likewise free labor paid for on a monthly or day basis developed . The Industrial Revolution furthered specialization . In- stead of being a jack-of-all-trades , each person became a specialist in one . Along with specialization in industry and in agriculture , there developed many occupations and with them occupational attitudes . These attitudes and their accompanying values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an occupation is a set of repeated and somewhat standardized activities , it is natural that certain attitudes toward life should develop out of it . Any type of doing and thinking concentrates the attention upon certain objects or values . The continued seeking of the values produces established tendencies to act or attitudes . Each occupation thus has its characteristic attitude and corresponding values . An occupational attitude is an acquired and established way to act with reference to some value offered by a regular means of earning a living . Each occupation has its own peculiar problems , its own demands upon the attention of its representatives , and its special influences upon the latter 's attitudes . Doing a thing or a set of things according to certain formulae every day , in season and out , tends to create mental patterns . The occupation of driving ox teams will produce a slow-moving mental pattern , while driving a taxicab in a large city will lead to quick-moving mental habits . Acting as a motorman with the sign before one of " Do n't speak to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial mental vacuum , while teaching college classes of wide awake , inquiring young people sharpens one 's wits and creates alert mental patterns . Correcting children 's mistakes in arithmetic , spelling , and reading for several hours daily over a period of years produces a mistake-hunting pattern . ' A person who has enjoyed his work in a given occupation and has succeeded in it is likely to feel that his occupation or profession is the most important of all . Life becomes organized habitually around or conditioned by occupational activities . Moreover , as J. M. Williams explains , " A man 's business becomes precious to him as it is that for which he has  | given his life , just as children are precious to the mother as that for which she has given her life . . . . Life is precious and whatever one gives it for becomes precious . " ' In this way life comes to revolve around one 's occupation , and an occupational egocentrism develops . A professional attitude is a specialized occupational tendency to act , arising from skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be distinguished from a trade in that the latter deals primarily with transforming material things into useful commodities , whereas the former renders personal services and at its best promotes health , knowledge , happiness , better government , and better living . The professional groups maintain high entrance standards . They foster an occupational ethics and occupational organizations . They have usually been allied with the higher well-to-do classes . Often they have represented middle-class attitudes and served as a steady mean between the economic extremes . Each profession has developed a high degree of pride and even of self-sufficiency . This tendency has produced bias , narrow-mindedness and intolerance , due in part to overspecialization . Modern industry has gone a long way from those early days when human activities were divided into only four types , with women engaged in rearing children and hoe-culture , and men in hunting and fighting . Modern industry has shifted greatly from the days when settled agriculture arose and slavery and serfdom prevailed . It has its immediate origins in the changes which supplanted the slave and serf systems by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new measure of personal independence ; in ' consequence they did more work per day than slaves or serfs did , and hence supplanted the latter groups . The rise of the factory system in the latter part of the .  | eighteenth century and in the early nineteenth century drew free laborers together under single roofs , giving rise to class consciousness . They were drawn away from the homes of their employers , where they had worked under the domestic system of industry and where they and their respective employers kept in close touch with each other . In the factory they lost contact with their employers and a social chasm developed between the two groups . It was then that modern industrial troubles began . With the industry divided into two antagonistic groups , labor-capital conflicts arose . The application of steam as a motive force in operating machinery revolutionized industry . I-land , - driven tools were supplanted by power-driven machinery ; and the home as the unit of production gave way to the factory . Although the factory system and large-scale production imply mutual dependence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to endless industrial troubles . Labor began to organize for its own protection ; capital likewise organized for its own advancement . Labor wished to secure control of industry ; capital wished to dominate . Two large and powerful classes have arisen with a black gulf between . The use of steam-driven machinery and the rise of the factory system created a demand for large units of capital . Private business enterprise is conducted ( z ) by individual entrepreneurs , ( 2 ) by partnerships , or ( 3 ) by corporate organizations . The first method puts everything in the hands of one person . It is satisfactory for conducting a small business . The second is adequate where capital larger than one person can supply is needed . The corporate form is not only the largest and most important type of business group , but it wields vast power , and the social control of it has become very difficult . The leading business occupations which have adopted the corporate form of organization are banking , insurance , manufacture , mercantile enterprises , and transportation . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed sinister international connections . Corporate business units first existed independently of  | each other . Then in the last half of the past century in the United States there came a period of competition , and even of cut-throat competition , as it was called . When that competition between business units in the same field became disastrous , these units began to combine into larger groups . The following summary is based on the analyses of several leading economists . ( i ) One of the earliest types of combination was represented by the agreement of independent concerns to fix prices , and hence to increase profits by restricting competition . ( 2 ) The next step was the agreement of business groups to divide the field ; each enterprise contracted to limit its activity to a particular section of the field . ( 3 ) A third phase was the pool , or the attempt to restrict the output rather than the price or the field . According to this type of agreement , each member of the combination accepted an allotted percentage of production . ( q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By this method , each of the constituent companies turned over the operation of its respective shares of the business to a board of central trustees , and in turn received trust certificates . Each essentially abandoned to the trust the entire operation of the business . ( 5 ) The " holding corporation " developed as a successor to the trust . In this connection a new central corporation was formed in order to purchase a majority interest of the stock of individual corporations . Each constituent corporation was operated as a separate unit . The control rested largely in the hands of the parent company . The holding corporation was a trust in a new and more effective form . It made responsibility difficult to locate . ( 6 ) Then the so-called system of " community of interests " developed . By this method the same group of directors possesses a controlling voice in the management of each constituent company . It is exceedingly difficult to prevent combinations of this sort . Their ramifications are difficult  | to trace . Moreover , a few individuals can command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and newspapers , and they can manipulate profits to the advantage of themselves and their friends but to the disadvantage of all who are not " on the inside . " Big business sometimes runs into an orgy of speculation , and speculation easily becomes legalized gambling on a gigantic scale . Big business likewise promotes overproduction , and sometimes it produces minds little in respect to everything except business . Combinations of capital eliminate competitive costs and permit the purchase of large quantities of materials at lower prices than the proprietor of the small independent business can obtain . They permit the undertaking of vast enterprises extending over many years , with the result that the small , independent producer generally suffers . The large corporate group becomes impersonal , and its responsibility to the public is often ignored . The corporation develops attitudes of economic superiority , of class aloofness , of legalism , of profitism , of competitive shrewdness , of worshiping the god of things as they are , and of opposing needed economic and social improvements . A fundamental evil of capitalism is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes great projects of human welfare possible , but all too often it defies national and even international control . The national income of a nation bears a definite relation to that country 's welfare . The greater the total income , the greater the money available for wages , provided a just distribution system is functioning . The greater the total income , the greater the purchasing power of the people . The accompanying table shows both the total income for the United States and also the average per capita income . It will be noticed that the average per capita income was more  | in the depression year of 1932 than in the prosperity year of 1900 . Of course , costs and standards of living have also risen . According to the 1937 Census of Manufactures by the United States Department of Commerce , there were in this country in 1937 a total of 167,000 business establishments . These employed a total of 8,500,000 wage-earners , and paid over ten billions of dollars in wages . New York heads the list in the value of factory-produced goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accompanying table . Each of these states produced goods worth over one billion dollars .  | The North Central states are seen as the main centers of industry , with long arms reaching southward and westward . The figures give an idea of the size of industry in the chief manufacturing states . They suggest a number of problems which are natural yet all too often baffling . Moreover , the total number of 8,500,000 employed by private enterprise in the United States is scarcely equal to the total unemployed in our country . The business cycle is coming to be known as a serious evil of capitalism . On a rising wave of business there develops overproduction , overextension of credit , overspeculation , even gambling with the idea of making millions out of nothing . Prosperity reigns . Then someone gets scared and decides to " cash in , " which requires that others collect the debts owed them . Still others join in selling out until selling exceeds buying . As long as the buying exceeds the selling , prices rise , sometimes sky high , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are caught with promises and obligations that they can not possibly meet . A crisis ensues , the worst business offenders are sent to the penitentiary or exile themselves from the country , and the people are thrown out of work and suffer all the miseries of a long-drawn-out depression . A few who have lost millions still live in comfort , but the millions who have lost all of their hard-earned savings also lose what is worse , namely , their faith in government and human nature , and they grow revolutionary . Then business slowly starts all over again , which is after all a very poor and miserable method of economic procedure , and which in 1933 in the United States brought experiments with a socially-controlled system . The social role of business is often unappreciated . The competition involved in business has led to a great many useful inventions and to the creation of countless comforts in modern life . Business enterprise has enabled a percentage , not always a majority to be sure , of the people to enjoy many conveniences in home life , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | A bank has been called a truly remarkable " institution of social unification . " It unifies industrial activities and establishes credit relations on a scale that permits vast organizational enterprises to be carried to completion . Credit in itself is based on the establishment of widespread human confidence . The movements to remedy and to prevent the evils arising out of modern labor-capital conditions and the competitive economic system are many . As the laboring man has come to realize the extent of economic injustices , he has organized for his own protection . The labor union is a protest against the evils of capitalism . The labor union probably would not have developed in its present form if capitalism had had the social vision and the willingness to correct its own weaknesses . It was during the nineteenth century that labor unions in the United States rose from the status of local organizations to national trade unions , and then into a general federation , the American Federation of Labor . The evolution of the labor union was slow and painful . The labor union had to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capitalism . It learned to fight fire with fire . It too often found the courts on the side of vested interests , and hence took the law into its own hands . It often showed the same shameful indifference to public welfare that it observed on the part of those corporations whose spokesmen sometimes proclaimed : " The public be damned . " Labor unionists believe in collective bargaining . They contend that the representatives of unions shall meet with the representatives of an employing concern , and that together they shall determine wage scales , hours of labor , and other conditions of work . Claiming that labor has the same right to organize as capital does , they logically insist on collective bargaining , because as individual bargainers for wages the ' are helpless in dealing with gigantic corporations . Labor unionists as a class believe in arbitration . They are usually willing to abide by the rule of arbitration , providing  | they are sure that a fair board of arbitrators has been chosen . Reasonable labor unionists believe that they and broadminded employers can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the personal method of settling disputes . They ask that the representatives of organized labor be accorded a fair hearing by the representatives of organized capital , and that the chairman of an arbitration board be a public-spirited citizen . They usually object to compulsory arbitration for fear that the arbitration board will be " stacked " against them , and that they will have no recourse . If denied what they consider a fair hearing , labor unionists resort to strikes . They lay down their tools and walk out . If there is a likelihood that other workers will be brought in to take their places they resort to picketing , that is , others are hindered from taking their places . The strike is a powerful weapon . It stops production and profits . Moreover , it advertises to the world that a group of workers feel that some employer is treating them so unfairly that they are willing to " walk out . " Picketing is a practice established by labor unions whereby individual union members are stationed or walk back and forth in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picketers ( 1 ) try to persuade strikebreakers not to enter the establishment , and ( 2 ) advertise to all corners or passers-by that the establishment is using unfair labor methods . Sometimes picketing has been abused and strike-breakers have been enjoined by force from entering a place of employment ; sometimes the police have been called and many persons have been injured and killed . In recent decades the strike has become a menace to the public . For example , a general railroad strike paralyzes the transportation of food , and brings starvation to the doors of the poor . It puts the traveling public into embarrassing situations . If the public denies the right of labor to strike , then the public is under obligation to provide labor with other means of obtaining justice . If labor can not strike , then employers ,  | it is claimed , should be forbidden to exercise the lockout or to " fire " without notice . Thus , the control of labor-capital problems becomes in part a public affair and subject to social control . The moderate trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a revolutionist . He does not think of overthrowing the present economic order . He does not object to the wage system , or to the institution of private property . ' In the United States he has generally been conservative in his demands . They labor are the real victims of unemployment and economic distress . They are firmly convinced that industrial management and those who actually control the financial and industrial affairs of the nation have refused to accept the remedies which labor proposed and have failed to deal with a great emergency in a constructive and practical way . ' The labor unionist asks for more pay , shorter hours , and safer and healthier conditions of work . He will " always be making these three requests . " He wants more pay ( in normal times ) for the same reason that the capitalist always wants more dividends . Ile urges shorter hours , for he sees many people who are no more worthy citizens than himself , who are not working at all , but who arc living luxuriously , and as it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess a desire for better conditions of labor , because he feels that he is entitled to share in the advances that are being registered by inventions and discoveries . ' The moderate trade unionist in the United States has been aptly described as having no Utopian schemes , as dealing with immediate problems , as priding himself " on his reasonableness and practicality , " as believing in private capital if it is not used as an instrument of special privilege , ' and as pro- testing against the prejudices , the lack of sympathy and comprehension , and the distrust shown by the capitalist . On the other hand , he has often created a trade union autocracy and personified narrow class control . At times he has been obdurate and inconsiderate , hindering works of mercy because trade union rules would be broken thereby . He has worshiped the rules of the union at the expense of both the employer and the public . Company unions have been an industrial storm center . They are organizations of labor within a given company , and represent a partial recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized , however , by labor leaders as being organizations that are kept under control of the particular employer in each case . It is claimed that if an employee does not behave in a way to please his employer , he may lose his job without obtaining much assistance from the company union , for all its members are in similar danger of losing their positions . Employers report that the company unions prevent interference from " outside " labor organizers and agitators . In England the trade unionist is becoming a state socialist . He would nationalize all the major or basic industries . He would have the government take charge of all large-scale business because otherwise he believes that business is dominating government and manipulating it to its own pecuniary ends . By 1933 in Mexico the labor provisions that were originally introduced into the Constitution of 1917 were proving to be an interesting experiment . If a worker feels that he has been dismissed unfairly he may appeal his case ; if he wins he may receive three months ' wages and additional wages at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed by the given firm , and for overtime . Many difficulties have pursued the enforcement and operation of these labor laws . The families in the United States having an employed wageearner may now be considered . In 1935 ? 1936 ( ending June 30 , 1936 ) , it was found that " nearly half of all American non-relief families ( 42 per cent ) receive less than $1000  | a year ; nearly four-fifths of our families ( 79 per cent ) live on incomes of less than $2000 a year . " There were 12,000,000 families at the bottom of the scale which received an average of $605 a year . The next 10,000,000 averaged $141I . Those receiving between $2000 and $3000 annually numbered 3,800,000 . " Only eight per cent of American families receive one-third of the nation 's entire income , " according to the Monthly Survey of Business . ' In a study of costs of living in 59 different cities in the United States it has been found that the total cost for a manual worker 's family of four persons varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of a " maintenance level " of living , which was found to average $1261 a year per family of four , and after examining the cost of living at the " emergence level " for the same type of family , which proved to average $903 a year per family . The cities that were studied varied in size from Albuquerque , New Mexico ( 35,378 ) , to New York ( 7,380,259 ) . Cost variations were great , but the average for one city did not differ greatly from the average for another . Differences in urban communities were evident in connection with many items , for example , automobile ownership . In Seattle and Detroit the percentage of families owning cars was 55.6 and 55.4 respectively , but in Boston and New York the ownership percentage was only 6.2 and 5.7 respectively . Thus , transportation problems vary greatly from city to city . Since studies show that a wage-earner 's family of three in a large city needs $1200 a year or more in order to meet its needs adequately , and a family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be characteristic of over half the families where there is a wage-earner who is employed , not to mention the millions who are on relief and necessarily living below adequate standards . If this be true in the world 's wealthiest nation , what is the situation in other countries ? Moreover , what can be done to improve the situation in our country ?  | Sociology believes in the principle of " Come , let us reason together , " and in methods of adjudicating differences by discussing them frankly and in a friendly manner.10 It believes that labor and capital have the same need to organize , recognized at last in 1933 in the United States by the National Industrial Recovery Act , and that the representatives of organized labor have the same need for a fair hearing as have the representatives of organized capital . Neither has any right to organize if it uses such organization to work against the common weal . In 1933 , labor in the United States responded to the NRA because the latter recognized the principle of collective bargaining . In the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize the representatives of labor unions without prejudice and not to ignore or discriminate against them in favor of independent workers . The right of labor to engage in collective bargaining with employers was given national approval in Clause 7a of the NRA . This clause stated that labor shall " be free from the interference , restraint , or coercion of employers of labor or their agents in the designated or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection . " Moreover , this law freed employees from being obliged to join a company union at the behest of the employing company . In other words , " no employee and no one seeking employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any company union or to refrain from joining , organizing , or assisting a labor organization of his own choosing . " In May , 1935 , the NRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States . Labor began at once to organize its forces along new lines , and under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Relations Act was passed . It is popularly called the Wagner Act . It was signed by President Roosevelt on July 5 , 1935.  | In 1937 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act . Its basic principle is " the safeguarding of collective bargaining by employees through representatives of their own choosing . " This Act created the National Labor Relations Board and gave it power to investigate the conduct of both employers and employees in a labor dispute , to guarantee to employees the right to organize , to bargain collectively , and to strike , without interference . Employees are guaranteed protection against unfair practices on the part of employers . They are protected in their efforts to bargain for higher wages , shorter hours , and better conditions of employment . In the first two years of its operation , the National Labor Relations Board gave attention to over 6000 employer-employee disputes involving nearly 2,000,000 employees . Of these cases 2100 charged employers with unfair labor practices growing out of discrimination against employees because of labor-union activities . In 1500 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . One-third of the cases were settled not by arbitration but by agreement between the contending parties . In 1935 a conflict that had been brewing for years within the ranks of organized labor broke out and labor was forced to choose between the craft idea and the industrial plan of organization . The American Federation of Labor has developed its strength in terms of organizing the crafts in a horizontal way in many manufacturing establishments . For example , the metal workers are organized into metal workers ' unions , irrespective of the companies which employ them . The industrial union is an organization of all the employees in a given industry . The coal miners , for instance , have been organized for many years as an industry under the direction of John L. Lewis . In 1935 Lewis proposed that the industrial union be developed in all industries on the ground that mass action is more effective than divided action by crafts . The A. F. of L. voted down the industrial union plan , whereupon Lewis developed the Committee for Industrial Organization ( C.I.O. ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phenomenal growth . Under the leadership of Lewis it succeeded in challenging successfully the control of organized labor by the A. F. of L. The result was that by 1937 and 1938 the ranks of labor split far apart . In the ensuing conflicts , the general public suffered greatly from internecine fights and began to withdraw support from the cause of labor as a whole . A talking point of the C.I.O. is that it brings into its fold the unskilled workers as well as the skilled to which the A. F. of L. has been limited . Thus large masses of labor which have been without organization now find themselves occupying new status and possessing new protection . However , they are not prepared for all the responsibilities thrust upon them . They usually demand mass action irrespective of the lessons of the history of organized labor and without due regard to the needs of the public . The Fair Labor Standards Act was passed by Congress and signed by the President in 1938 . It provides " a floor to wages and a ceiling to hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour and the maximum hours of labor per week . Minimum wages became 30 cents an hour for the second year of employment and by seven years , forty cents must be reached ( if not before ) . After two years the hours of labor were reduced to 40 per week . The law covers only those workers " who are employed in interstate commerce or in the manufacture of goods shipped in interstate commerce . " It prohibits the employment of children under sixteen in such industry , but affects only about one-fourth of children under sixteen who are gainfully employed . It prohibits the employment of minors of sixteen to eighteen years in hazardous occupations where interstate commerce is involved . Labor makes capital possible . Herein lies the merit of Abraham Lincoln 's statement in his first presidential message to Congress : " Labor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration . " But labor is not the central  | factor in society . Labor 's function is to join with capital and management in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer . " Socialism is on one hand a protest against the evils of private capitalism and profitism and on the other hand an announcement that labor unionism as such is too mild and inefficient . The socialist believes that labor unionism is in the long run the cat 's paw of capitalism . As a result of the evils caused by private property and the corporate group , the movement known as socialism has achieved a world-wide prominence . In general , socialists , having grown hopeless regarding the labor-union method of appealing directly to the employer , advocate national ownership of the main instruments of production and transportation . When the representatives of organized capital refuse to meet the representatives of organized labor , then socialism is advanced as the only recourse for meeting the needs of labor . Socialists as a class are opposed to the use of private property " to produce more private property . " They make no war upon capital as such , but believe in capital provided it can be owned and operated for the benefit of all . Instead of having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from capital and land , they would have both owned by the state , and a managerial system developed for operating them , in the same manner as the postal service is governmentally owned and operated in many countries . Instead of dividing the returns from economic enterprise into four parts , namely , rent , interest , profits , and wages , the socialist urges that all the returns should go to labor , recognizing different types of and gradations in labor service . Since land would be owned by the state no one would need to pay any rent , and since capital would be state-owned , no interest would be charged . Since both land and capital would be used by individuals under the direction of the state , there would be no need for individuals to secure profits to them- selves . Thus all the returns from industrial enterprise , according to the socialist 's plan , would go in one major direction , namely , to labor , ranging from the highest type of superintendence and administrative labor to unskilled labor . No one would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined by the skill or managerial ability which the individual showed , and by the social value of his activities . The socialist does not believe that governmental regulation of gigantic private monopolies will succeed . He contends that the monopolies have become so powerful that they regulate governments . He points to case after case where private monopolies have become entrenched in governmental positions , even in Cabinets of the President of the United States , in Congress and in gubernatorial chairs . The socialist says that the alternative is for government to go all the way and take over the large private businesses , beginning with the socalled national banks , the transportation systems , the basic industries of iron and steel , and so on . The socialist secretly smiles when he sees a gigantic monopoly developing , for he believes that such a monopoly is putting itself into a position where the next logical step will be for the government to take it over . He sees no alternative but for governments to own and control the major industries of their countries on a non-profit basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major instruments of production by the national state , as described in the preceding paragraphs , has several strong and several weak points . The strong points will be considered first . ( 1 ) Justice is an effective plea . The ideal of socialism is to have everyone rewarded in proportion to his services , not to himself , but to society . Socialism urges a more just distribution of wealth ; it desires to eliminate special privilege . It protests against an economic system which pays one man a million dollars annually merely because he is the son of his father , another man , $1o,000 a year for managing the father 's business , and other men , $750 or $1500 a year each for  | furnishing the bulk of the labor . In all sincerity socialism argues that the big economic rewards should not go to the shrewd and the cunning , that the big prizes should not go to those favored by inheritance irrespective of their social worth . It insists upon a more just distribution of wealth . ( 2 ) Socialism asks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It asks that the multiplicity of middlemen be reduced . For example , there are perhaps three times as many milk wagons and drivers today in the United States as are required to serve the people . No one would think of returning to competitive postmen , that is , of having three or four postmen delivering mail on a given street at the same time and in the employment of as many different companies . When the farmer sells apricots on his trees at a cent a pound and the consumer a hundred miles away six months later pays twenty-five cents a pound for those same apricots , there is room for a more economical organization of exchange , the socialist claims . ( 3 ) Socialism would eliminate the commercialized spirit . The producing of goods and the rendering of service for profit would be stopped , as the latter has already been stopped in the postal service . It is contended that today many goods are manufactured primarily for profit , that is , primarily for selling purposes rather than because of usefulness . Under socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to help the customer find out what he really needs , whereas under capitalism it is often to his interest to sell the customer what he does not need or what will return the largest profits . ( 4 ) Socialism fearlessly proclaims the truth about unjust economic practices . It uncovers the worst conditions in industry . It engenders a critical public spirit . It holds the mirror of publicity before weak spots in economic life . The first weakness of socialism that may be mentioned is ( 1 ) its attempt to put into practice a new economic system before people are ready for it , or before they are trained to assume responsibility under it . In Russia during the first ten years of the Soviet regime a great deal of difficulty was en- countered because a new economic system had been thrust upon a people unprepared for such responsibility . Socialism would move too rapidly ; it often overlooks needed evolutionary measures . ( 1 ) Socialism tends to underestimate the premium that is placed by the present system upon thrift and energy . Under socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency of relying upon the state . The watchword might become : " What does it matter ? The state will take care of me anyway . " ( 3 ) Under socialism there would still be serious danger to personal liberty . Under capitalism when political rulers and business magnates combine , the majority of the people are helpless . With socialism in charge vast political power and absolute economic monopoly would be in the hands of a few persons at a time ; moreover such concentrated authority would be fully legal . ( 4 ) Socialism puts nearly all its emphasis upon a new organization of society . It holds that if you would change the structure of society , you would ipso facto secure ' the desired improvement . It does not provide for adequate and immediate changes in personal character and in personal attitudes toward other classes of people . It makes no primary effort to change the self-centered attitudes which govern so many people so much of the time . Fabian socialism has developed in England among the educated people . It is the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their chief faith in intellectually spreading an evolutionary state socialism rather than in working out an organized political movement . The group has remained weak in numbers but strong in its personnel . Outstanding among its leaders have been Sidney and Beatrice Webb . Christian socialism also began in England . The Christian socialists find the basis of their beliefs in the teachings of Jesus . They claim that Jesus taught an essentially socialist view of life and that the first Christians set out to practice a form of communism . Theirs is an evolutionary type of state socialism based on religious zeal and motivation . Maurice and  | Kingsley are the two best known founders of Christian socialism . The movement has gained considerable sporadic strength but nothing equal to the expectations of its founders . Guild socialism is another movement that has developed in England . It is struggling toward the organization of manufacturing establishments as industrial units with the workers in charge and in virtual ownership . It centers its efforts not on securing political control of society but on obtaining a new industrial organization of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extreme form of socialism , which aims at a complete overthrow of society by violent means in order to put society in the control of the workers . It has had its major development in France . Like its partial counterpart in the United States , the Industrial Workers of the World ( I.W.W. ) , it believes that the program of the state socialist is too mild , and that the political methods of securing economic control will fail . The syndicalist would have his syndicats , or unions , assume general control in society . The syndicats would be loosely bound together and exercise a working-class control . Syndicalism holds that when state socialists are elected to office they become conservative . The syndicalist therefore advocates direct action . Do not try to get control of government by slow evolutionary means . You will get nowhere . Direct action is the only recourse . A part of the syndicalist 's method is sabotage , which originally referred to throwing a shoe into a machine so as to stop production and to further revolution . In this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you are working in a freight office and asked to ship oranges from Florida to Illinois , then change the shipping address to some town in New Mexico . " By so doing business will break down , profits will be cut off , the consumers will protest against capitalism and ask for " a new deal . " Business under capitalistic control will be defeated , and a new syndicalist order can be set up . The general strike is also advocated . Let  | all employees cease to labor , and capitalistic business can not go on ? it will fail , leaving the way open for syndicalism . Syndicalism has not made much headway in the United States but has made itself felt in Europe , particularly in France . Marxian socialism is best known through its left-wing exponents in Russia , namely , through Bolshevism . Karl Marx in his well-known work , Das Kapital , showed how class struggle is a necessary result of the autocracy of capitalism . Revolution is the way out . In Russia during the World War the Marxian socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolsheviks and Mensheviks , that is , into majority and minority wings . The majority were the more radical , and took charge , establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat . They carried on their political activities through councils , or soviets . The World War had killed many of the Czar 's army officers ; and the men in the ranks , as they became officers , finally swung the proletariat into power through a bloodless revolution . For the first time in the history of the world , the propertyless classes overthrew the propertied classes and assumed political control in one of the largest countries of the earth . Under the direction of Lenin , they established a dictatorship of the proletariat , using the same autocratic methods that they had become acquainted with under the lash of the imperialistic forces of the czars . They represent class control , but with a new class , presumably the weakest class , in charge of society . Their success or failure depends on their five-year plans , on their educational programs , on the degree of democracy which they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Communism is expressed in various movements , but Russian sovietism is often referred to as a fair sample . In communism ownership and control of everything would be in the hands of a small group presumably representing the common people . Marx advocated an equal distribution of wealth , a phrase which is widely misunderstood . Marx did not mean an equal distribution of all property among all the people pro rata , but  | a distribution primarily of income according to the service rendered or the work accomplished . Communism would do away with nationalism and unite the world on a working-class basis . Its internationalism has given that term a special meaning which has painted it red in the eyes of many . According to Marx , nationalism separates the workers and on occasion divides them into warring armies that shoot each other down . Marx developed the class struggle idea , namely , that the interests of capitalists and workers are so far apart that they can not be united . In fact the chasm is bound to widen . The struggle between the laboring classes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until by revolutionary means and by sheer force of numbers the laboring class will come into control of governments . Then there is the surplus value theory as developed by Marx . The capitalist by virtue of being in control pays the workers a wage which is less than the exchange value of the goods produced and keeps this surplus value for himself . On occasion the system is especially bad when the capitalist pays the worker less than a living wage , or employs children and women at low wages , and thereby is enabled to pocket a huge surplus . Lenin came into power in Russia in 1917 , committed to Marxian formulas . But he faced many problems incident to changing from one economic system to another . Hence in the seven years before his death in I924 he did not make great progress in putting Marxianism into practice . After the death of Lenin his leadership fell to Stalin who was challenged by Trotsky . The basis of the disagreement that led to Trotsky 's banishment and was followed by Stalin 's many purges was fundamental as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry communism 's battle into other countries , while Stalin felt that it would be wiser for the U.S.S.R. first to perfect a communistic government at home . It was a case of realist against idealist and the latter lost .  | To change basically the economic system of a people largely rural , of peasant stock , and untrained in the ways of a widespread collectivistic economy in a short period of time is too much to expect , according to Stalin . Hence , within the boundaries of the U.S.S.R. , the transformation pace in the economic life of the people was changed , a number of capitalistic devices were resorted to at least for the time being , and meanwhile at tremendous expense the Red fighting forces were maintained as a protection against attack . Stalin apparently has recognized the fact that culture traits deeply ingrained in the habits of millions of people can not be changed by government fiat without tremendous trouble . In other words , people have to be educationally trained for a new economic system that is so radically different from what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights of free speech , free press , and free assembly in democratic countries , but do not allow people who believe in these privileges to exercise them in a communist-controlled country . Communism has made progress in recent decades , but it has basic weaknesses , for example , its arbitrariness and its dictatorship programs , which put it on a level with some of the worst characteristics of capitalism . Its materialism has led it into atheism and a repudiation of religious values . Its ruthlessness in regard to personality and initiative , when these do not " toe the mark " subserviently , is an evil portent . In many parts of the world communism is greatly feared today . While its methods of control are ancient , it is a very real expression of the increasing unrest of the times . To denounce it feverishly and to jail its leaders will strengthen it . The chief thing needed is that economic and social injustice be rooted out . With the discussion of fascism in Chapter VI ( The Community Group ) as a basis , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporative aspects . In a  | radio address in 1932 a candidate for President proclaimed fascism as the last stand of capitalism against communism . Fascism came into power in Italy in 1922 , under the powerful directing hand of Mussolini . Although once a socialist , Mussolini had become disgusted with the weakness of the masses in their self-governing plans and had violently disagreed with their internationalist and pacifist tendencies . Consequently he shifted his allegiance and promoted the formation of groups of ex-service men , augmented by members of the middle and upper classes in the cities and by the landowners in the rural districts . These fasci di combattimento sometimes took charge in cities when the government failed . The fasci di combattimento were ex-soldiers aided by those who wished to stave off socialism . Fascism originated in part as a defense mechanism against socialism . Capitalism has been undergoing modifications in Italy under fascism . At first employers were left a relatively free hand , but since April 3 , 1926 , the Fascist Government has been putting into operation its so-called " corporative " law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of employers " in each industrial activity are created as legal units " and hence are subject to the will of the Fascist Government . There are no private labor unions or large business organizations outside of fascism . Only corporative units exist . Moreover , they operate only as they respond to the will of fascism . If a business enterprise is conducted in a way judged detrimental to the state , it receives first a warning and then an order to cease its questionable practices . Both strikes and lockouts are forbidden by law . Prices and wages are regulated . The corporative state includes three groups of corporations . The first group of eight corporations involves agricultural , industrial , and commercial activities . The second group of eight corporations relates to industrial fields chiefly . The third group of six deals with insurance and credit , with the professions and arts , with sea and air transportation , with internal communications , with the stage , and with the tourist industry , including hotels . These corporations operate  | through the National Council of Corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . Each of the 22 corporations was in operation by February , 1936 . Closely related are the syndical organizations through which wages , hours , and so forth , are regulated . Each syndicate is composed only of employers or of employees . Since the employers ' syndicates are led in many instances by persons who are leaders in the Fascist party , they are less subject to adverse regulation than are the employees ' syndicates . The control of employers is less significant than the control of employees " in view of the more intimate connection of the farmer with the ruling personnel . " 11 Under the corporative state both the employee and the employer are feeling the effects of an authoritative control . Those persons who do not belong to the corporative state , however , do not count for much . Fascism does not take stock in traditional economic principles , such as " competition is the life of trade , " or that prices should be regulated by the law of supply and demand . In fact , in 1932 the minister of corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his advisers judged to be fair prices , and to regulate supply and production on the basis of needs . The private promoter , the real estate " shark , " the blatant advertiser are likely to be regarded as enemies of the state , and treated accordingly . Private property and capitalism exist in Fascist Italy but are under autocratic control , with the interests of the nation considered paramount . The syndicates send representatives to the council of the appropriate corporation . Employers ' and employees ' syndicates are represented in equal numbers . Each council also includes three members of the Fascist party . When the National Council of Corporations succeeded the Chamber of Deputies in 1938 , it and the Grand Council became the ruling bodies in Italy . The Grand Council includes the national ministers of the corporations , and meets in secret sessions ..  | Thus the occupational life of the nation is closely regulated and regimented by an economic organization governed by a small body of men under the leadership of a dictator , who is supposed to know what is better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of fascism is : Everyone shall work , but no one shall work against the state . A nationally planned economy is thus in operation , with individualism in industry and property being maintained but under rigid and often arbitrary control . This control goes to the extreme of preventing freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of assemblage , if that freedom is used to criticize the fascist system . It is promised , however , that some day , when fascism is more accepted than now , a measure of personal liberty will be returned to the people . Profit-sharing is a form of economic democracy that a few employers have inaugurated whereby " the employee receives a share , fixed in advance , of the profits . " It is a plan of paying to employees a share of profits in addition to wages . It is assunied that the profits which are shared will be created by the increased diligence and care of the employees . It also assumes that the employees help to create profits as well as wages . It implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assumed , but this the employees are unable to do . Hence it becomes a prosperity measure only . Management-sharing gives the employee a part in the operation of a business . Management-sharing in small ways has been extensive . Workers , for example , have been given places on shop committees . In some instances employers have shared management with their employees to the extent of establishing joint committees for determining hours of labor , wages , and settling other difficult points . Sometimes the committee is composed of an equal number of representatives of the employing firm and of workers , with a public-spirited citizen as chairman . Management-sharing probably has  | reached its greatest growth in the form of shop committees . It increases the status of employees . On the other hand , many employees are not qualified to assume a share in management while others are adverse to assuming such responsibility . Industrial democracy is the representation of employees in a fair way in the management of business and manufacturing . For many years employers were prone to confuse welfare work with industrial democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , the public , labor , and capital . The needs and welfare of the public are primary ; the interests of both labor and capital are secondary . Any economic system which gives the entire management of business to labor is unsound ; likewise capital is in error when it wishes to monopolize control . Labor and capital alike are striving in part for material ends ; one wants more wages , the other more profits . Both goals are materialistic ; the higher spiritual needs of life are likely to be neglected . It is thought by many persons that the main solution of economic problems is to give labor representation on boards of directors and in the management of industry . Capital opposes this plan and labor is not trained for it . The joint control of industry by capital and labor is no certain cure-all for industrial evils . Capital and labor have shown signs of combining against the public . At times capital has profiteered and labor has grown arbitrary . In a given corporation an increase in selling costs was proposed some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might accrue should be turned into dividends , and the other half into wages . Capital and labor thus combined against the consumer . In the matter of wages , hours of labor , dividends , and hence of prices , the third party to industrial enterprise needs to have a voice and representation . Without the consumer neither capital nor labor would have much to do . A tripartite organization of industry is suggested . It is essential if all interests vitally concerned are to receive a square deal . The  | public is bound to come into the picture . If capital and labor , or either one separately , takes the bit into his own mouth , the public will insist upon national control , if not of ownership . It might be better to give the public definite representation on boards of ownership and control . Still more important is the development of pro-social attitudes on the part of all who are involved . As a reaction against profiteering , overinflation , and high prices , a new economic phenomenon on a large scale occurred in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buyers ' strike . This strike continued for some time as a protest against high prices . For a time both capital and labor were so engrossed in their struggle against each other that they did not observe that the public was striking in reality against them both . Again , in the depression which began in the latter part of 1929 and continued for a number of years , business attempted in every way possible to start people buying , but the public did not have money with which to buy . Moreover , they learned how well they could get along on little . Even during the national bank holiday of about ten days declared by President Franklin D. Roosevelt soon after he took his oath of office on March 4 , 1933 , people generally were surprised by the way in which they could manage their affairs for a short period of time without buying but by " simply trusting each other . " In the fall of 1933 the NRA urged widespread buying as a recovery measure and a patriotic duty , but still the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' strikes demonstrate the necessity of including the public in the management of industry . It is claimed that industrial democracy will shift the emphasis from rights to functions . Instead of capital 's employing labor , labor will employ capital and grow wise in so doing . Instead of goods being produced for profits , business will purge itself of profitism ? as teaching , medicine , the . ministry have purged themselves ? and will produce goods for needs . According to these principles , capital will be entitled to  | standard rates of interest , dependent upon the amount of risk involved and determined by labor-capital-consumer agreements . Any returns above the standard rates would go back into the business , for promotion and insurance . The professions have been changing from a profit to functional and standard income bases . Teachers once were paid directly by pupils ; the larger the number of pupils the larger the pay . It was a distinct advance when teachers reached a salary basis . If business does not follow some such procedure , it will be in danger of suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial democracy it is claimed that instead of voting as high dividends as possible and paying workers as low wages as they will accept , the material component represented chiefly by capital will be secured at as low a rate as possible , and the human element , the workers , will be paid as much as possible . A prospective investor in stocks , instead of asking first how large the dividends are , will inquire : What service does the company perform ? Social welfare , after all , will be the standard to which all classes must ultimately render an accounting . Good will and the spirit of " Come , let us reason together , " are basic to industrial democracy . An illustration of the democratic spirit in business is that of a leading shoe manufacturer who some years ago announced that the main business of his factories is to help the employees to become better men and women and that the secondary business is to turn out better and better shoes . Only by such methods can evolutionary change take place and revolution be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory are the men and the women who are employed . Are they becoming better persons and citizens , or are they shirking and becoming radical ? Co-operation is a good substitute for destructive competition . Pro-social attitudes in industry would help to make a new earth
