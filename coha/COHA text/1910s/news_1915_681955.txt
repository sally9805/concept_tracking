txt Sheriff Stephen P. Pettit of Nassau County , clothed in the majesty of the law and a new slouch hat , armed with a pocketful of John Doe warrants , and backed by a corps of fifty deputies sworn in for the occasion , visited the Belmont Park racetrack yesterday . The Sheriff is no stranger to the track , as he has been keeping an eye on " oral bettors " almost every day there has been racing at the course this year . Yesterday 's visit was an event , however . Governor Whitman had telegraphed Sheriff Pettit rather sharply to the effect that the Sheriff had abundance.of power under the law to prevent gambling at the racetrack and that he would hold him responsible for failure to enforce the law if such violations occurred . District Attorney Lewis J. Smith of Nassau County had also intimated to the Sheriff that if there was anything that looked like gambling at the track it was up to the ** to round up the offenders , even though he had done so two or three times earter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' prided itself on the fact that there had been no " gambling " within its inclosure . Admittedly there had been a let of " betting " there , but it was of the " oral " sort , where no money passed , and where each party to the wager had to take the other on trust , and collect winnings or losings if he , could . That sort of betting , the managers had been assured by their legal advisers , was hot In violation la ; the ' hiew'against.ganibling , as interpreted by , the Courts in a - lot of cases where the speculatively inelined hied been arrested and discharged from Justody because the court held there had been no violation of the law as set down in the penal code . Smaller Crowd , Smaller Bets . The Sheriff did not find a large crowd at the track . Nor did he find the highfliers of the betting fraternity who stand around and sniff at a man unless he offers to bet a " century . " They had gone out of business for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting of " memoranda " bets . Broadway seemed to have unusual attractions fo : them yesterday . Their cashiers were at the track , however , to make good obligations incurred in the raves on Wednesday . Most of those cashiers settled at the Pennsylvania Station before the departure of the race trains yesterday , and early goers ' to Belmont Park saw more money flashed and exchanged in the big marble rotunda of the railroad station than they have seen at a race course since the days of promiscuous betting and open bookmaking . Compared to the size of the crowd there was just as much and just as open betting at Belmont Park yesterday as if Sheriff Pettit had not been there . There was something of a curb on the marking of race programs with cabalistic figures which are generally supposed to represent the price the holder of the penciled card is willing to lay against the horses in the race under speculative consideration . The bettor had to ask for prices against the horse of his choice instead of merely glancing at the card of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and which answered for the marked racing program . There was also a. marked reluctance to accept cash from unknowns on the lawns in both the reserved and the general admission se2tions of the track . But otherwise business went on about as usual , if one could nose his way between the deputy sheriffs and the horde of Pinkertonians both uniformed and in plain clothes , who outnumbered the wen who were willing to lay the odds . Twelve Men Arrested . Memoranda making was done as plainly and openly as ever and the professional layers accepted these evidences of wagers without much attempt at hiding their operations . It was only when a strange face appeared that they shied . But Sheriff Pettit 's men did their work and during the afternoon arrested twelve men who either made or accepted these memoranda , or who attempted to pay to some successful bettor the amount he had won on a race just finished . The haul was enough to thoroughly try out the question as to whether what the arrested parties were doing was a violation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot were taken to Hempstead last evening , arraigned before I Magistrate Jones and remanded until this evening bonds being furnished by men who have something more than a passing interest in the politics of the county . Most of those placed under arrest gave New York City as their residence , their names being Richard Weldon , Henry Stedeker , Joseph Blumer , Peter Blong , Nicholas Nascolozo , Samuel Brauenstein , George Long , Samuel Gordon , Hugh Collins , Cy 1roldie , Harry Hart , and John J. Grundy . All were charged with violation of the section of the penal code prohibiting gambling . How the Layers of Odds View It . How the layers of the odds viewed the affair was voiced in a fashion that runs about like this : " The political pot is boiling and some one warm to get into the limelight in the big city . Saratoga was not a favorable spot to make the play , as there are some political - powers up that way who object to having their toes or those of their constituents trodden on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for this sudden interest in the betting at Belmont Park at this late day ? Are we violating the law any more than we were up in Saratoga , and the Governor was within stone throw of the racetrack up there two or three days during the season unless all the reports as to his visits to Saratoga Springs were mistakes . Polities is a funny game , t it ?
