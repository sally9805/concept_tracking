SCENE  --  A small room serving both as kitchen and dining room in a fiat on Christopher Street , New York City . In the rear , to the right , a door leading to the outer hallway . On the left of the doorway , a sink , and a two-burner gas stove . Over the stove , and extending to the left wall , a wooden closet for dishes , etc . On the left , two windows looking out on a fire escape where several potted plants are dying of neglect . Before the windows , a table covered with oilcloth . Two cane-bottomed chairs are placed by the table . Another stands against the wall to the right of door in rear . In the right wall , rear , a doorway leading into a bedroom . Farther forward , different articles of a man 's and a woman 's clothing are hung on pegs . A clothes line is strung from the left corner , rear , to the right wall , forward . It is about eight-thirty in the morning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowland enters from the bedroom , yawning , her hands still busy putting the finishing touches on a slovenly toilet by sticking hairpins into her hair which is bunched up in a drab-colored mass on top of her round head . She is of medium height and inclined to a shapeless stoutness , accentuated by her formless blue dress , shabby and worn . Her face is characterless , with small regular features and eyes of a nondescript blue . There is a pinched expression about her eyes and nose and her weak , spiteful mouth . She is in her early twenties but looks much older . She comes to the middle of the room and yawns , stretching her arms to their full length . Her drowsy eyes stare about the room with the irritated look of one to whom a long sleep has not been a long rest . She goes wearily to the clothes hanging on the right and takes an apron from a hook . She ties it about her waist , giving vent to an exasperated " damn " when the knot fails to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to the gas stove and lights one burner . She fills the coffee pot at the sink and sets it over the flame . Then slumps down into a chair by the table and puts a hand over her forehead as if she were suffering from headache . Suddenly her face brightens as though she had remembered something , and she casts a quick glance at the dish closet ; then looks sharply at the bedroom door and listens intently for a moment or so . MRS . ROWLAND  --  ( in a low voice ) Alfred ! Alfred ! ( There is no answer from the next room and she continues suspiciously in a louder tone ) You need n't pretend you 're asleep . ( There is no reply to this from the bedroom , and , reassured , she gets up from her chair and tiptoes cautiously to the dish closet . She slowly opens one door , taking great care to make no noise , and slides out , from their hiding place behind the dishes , a bottle of Gordon gin and a glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattles a little . At this sound she starts guiltily and looks with sulky defiance at the doorway to the next room . ) ( He voice trembling ) Alfred ! ( After a pause , during which she listens for any sound , she takes the glass and pours out a large drink and gulps it down ; then hastily returns the bottle and glass to their hiding place . She closes the closet door with the same care as she had opened it , and , heaving a great sigh of relief , sinks down into her chair again . The large dose of alcohol she has taken has an almost immediate effect . Her features become more animated , she seems to gather energy , and she looks at the bedroom door with a hard , vindictive smile on her lips . Her eyes glance quickly about the room and are fixed on a man 's coat and vest which hang from a hook at right . She moves stealthily over to the open doorway and stands there , out of sight of anyone inside , listening for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred ! ( Again there is no reply . With a swift movement she takes the coat and vest from the hook and returns with them to her chair . She sits down and takes the various articles out of each pocket but quickly puts them back again . At last , in the inside pocket of the vest , she finds a letter . ( Looking at the handwriting  --  slowly to herself ) Hmm ! I knew it . ( She opens the letter and reads it . At first her expression is one of hatred and rage , but as she goes on to the end it changes to one of triumphant malignity . She remains in deep thought for a moment , staring before her , the letter in her hands , a cruel smile on her lips . Then she puts the letter back in the pocket of the vest , and still careful not to awaken the sleeper , hangs the clothes up again on the same hook , and goes to the bedroom door and looks in . ) ( In a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( There is a muffled , yawning groan from the next room . ) Do n't you think it 's about time you got up ? Do you want to stay in bed all day ? ( turning around and coming back to her chair ) Not that I 've got any doubts about your being lazy enough to stay in bed forever . ( She sits down and looks cut of the window , irritably ) Goodness knows what time it is . We have n't even got any way of telling the time since you pawned your watch like a fool . The last valuable thing we had , and you knew it . It 's been nothing but pawn , pawn , pawn , with you  --  anything to put off getting a job , anything to get out of going to work like a man . ( She taps the floor with her foot nervously , biting her lips . ) ( After a short pause ) Alfred ! Get up , do you hear me ? I want to make that bed before I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continual muss on your account . ( with a certain vindictive satisfaction ) Not that we 'll be here long unless you manage to get some money some place . Heaven knows I do my part  --  and more  --  going out to sew every day while you play the gentleman and loaf around bar rooms with that good-for-nothing lot of artists from the Square . ( A short pause during which she plays nervously with a cup and saucer on the table . ) And where are you going to get money , I 'd like to know ? The rent 's due this week and you know what the landlord is . He wo n't let us stay a minute over our time . You say you ca n't get a job . That 's a lie and you know it . You never even look for one . All you do is moon around all day writing silly poetry and stories that no one will buy  --  and no wonder they wo n't . I notice I can always get a position , such as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving to death . ( Gets up and goes over to the stove  --  looks into the coffee pot to see if the water is boiling ; then comes back and sits down again . ) You 'll have to get money to-day some place . I ca n't do it all , and I wo n't do it all . You 've got to come to your senses . You 've got to beg , borrow , or steal it somewheres . ( with a contemptuous laugh ) But where , I 'd like to know ? You 're too proud to beg , and you 've borrowed the limit , and you have n't the nerve to steal . ( After a pause  --  getting up angrily ) Are n't you up yet , for heaven 's sake ? It 's just like you to go to sleep again , or pretend to . ( She goes to the bedroom door and looks in . ) Oh , you are up . Well , it 's about time . You need n't look at me like that . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you too well  --  better than you think I do  --  you and your goings-on . ( turning away from the door  --  meaningly ) I know a lot of things , my dear . Never mind what I know , now . I 'll tell you before I go , you need n't worry . ( She comes to the middle of the room and stands there , frowning . ) ( Irritably ) Hmm ! I suppose I might as well get breakfast ready  --  not that there 's anything much to get . ( questioningly ) Unless you have some money ? ( She pauses for an answer from the next room which does not come . ) Foolish question ! ( She gives a short , hard laugh . ) I ought to know you better than that by this time . When you left here in such a huff last night I knew what would happen . You ca n't be trusted for a second . A nice condition you came home in ! The fight we had was only an excuse for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use pawning your watch if all you wanted with the money was to waste it in buying drink ? ( Goes over to the dish closet and takes out plates , cups , etc. , while she is talking . ) Hurry up ! It do n't take long to get breakfast these days , thanks to you . All we got this morning is bread and butter and coffee ; and you would n't even have that if it was n't for me sewing my fingers off . ( She slams the loaf of bread on the table with a bang . ) The bread 's stale . I hope you 'll like it . You do n't deserve any better , but I do n't see why I should suffer . ( Going over to the stove ) The coffee 'll be ready in a minute , and you need n't expect me to wait for you . ( Suddenly with great anger ) What on earth are you doing all this time ? ( She goes over to the door and looks in . ) Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find you back in bed . That 'd be just like you . How awful you look this morning ! For heaven 's sake , shave ! You 're disgusting ! You look like a tramp . No wonder no one will give you a job . I do n't blame them  --  when you do n't even look half-way decent . ( She goes to the stove . ) There 's plenty of hot water right here . You 've got no excuse . ( gets a bowl and pours some of the water from the coffee pot into it ) Here . ( He reaches his hand into the room for it . It is a sensitive hand with slender fingers . It trembles and some of the water spills on the floor . ) ( Tauntingly ) Look at your hand tremble ! You 'd better give up drinking . You ca n't stand it . It 's just your kind that get the D. T 's . That would be the last straw ! ( looking down at the floor ) Look at the mess you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place . Why ca n't you put them on a plate ? No , you would n't be considerate enough to do that . You never think of me . You do n't have to sweep the room and that 's all you care about . ( Takes the broom and commences to sweep viciously , raising a cloud of dust . From the inner room comes the sound of a razor being stropped . ) ( Sweeping ) Hurry up ! It must be nearly time for me to go . If I 'm late I 'm liable to lose my position , and then I could n't support you any longer . ( As an afterthought she adds sarcastically ) And then you 'd have to go to work or something dreadful like that . ( sweeping under the table ) What I want to know is whether you 're going to look for a job to-day or not . You know your family wo n't help us any more . They 've had enough of you , too . ( after a moment 's silent sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've a good notion to go home , if I was n't too proud to let them know what a failure you 've been  --  you , the millionaire Rowland 's only son , the Harvard graduate , the poet , the catch of the town  --  Huh ! ( with bitterness ) There would n't be many of them now envy my catch if they knew the truth . What has our marriage been , I 'd like to know ? Even before your millionaire father died owing every one in the world money , you certainly never wasted any of your time on your wife . I suppose you thought I 'd ought to be glad you were honorable enough to marry me  --  after getting me into trouble . You were ashamed of me with your fine friends because my father 's only a grocer , that 's what you were . At least he 's honest , which is more than any one could say about yours . ( She is sweeping steadily toward the door . Leans on her broom for a moment . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry me , and pity you , did n't you ? You did n't hesitate much about telling me you loved me , and making me believe your lies , before it happened , did you ? You made me think you did n't want your father to buy me off as he tried to do . I know better now . I have n't lived with you all this time for nothing . ( somberly ) It 's lucky the poor thing was born dead , after all . What a father you 'd have been ! ( Is silent , brooding moodily for a moment  --  then she continues with a sort of savage joy . ) But I 'm not the only one who 's got you to thank for being unhappy . There 's one other , at least , and she ca n't hope to marry you now . ( She puts her head into the next room . ) How about Helen ? ( She starts back from the doorway , half frightened . ) Do n't look at me that way ! Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a right to . I 'm your wife . And I know all there is to know , so do n't lie . You need n't stare at me so . You ca n't bully me with your superior airs any longer . Only for me you 'd be going without breakfast this very morning . ( She sets the broom back in the corner  --  whiningly ) You never did have any gratitude for what I 've done . ( She comes to the stove and puts the coffee into the pot . ) The coffee 's ready . I 'm not going to wait for you . ( She sits down in her chair again . ) ( After a pause  --  puts her hand to her head  --  fretfully ) My head aches so this morning . It 's a shame I 've got to go to work in a stuffy room all day in my condition . And I would n't if you were half a man . By rights I ought to be lying on my back instead of you . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you object when I take a little something to keep up my spirits . You even did n't want me to take that tonic I got at the drug store . ( with a hard laugh ) I know you 'd be glad to have me dead and out of your way ; then you 'd be free to run after all these silly girls that think you 're such a wonderful , misunderstood person  --  this Helen and the others . ( There is a sharp exclamation of pain from the next room . ) ( With satisfaction ) There ! I knew you 'd cut yourself . It 'll be a lesson to you . You know you ought n't to be running around nights drinking with your nerves in such an awful shape . ( She goes to the door and looks in . ) What makes you so pale ? What are you staring at yourself in the mirror that way for ? For goodness sake , wipe that blood off your face ! ( with a shudder ) It 's horrible . ( in relieved tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand the sight of blood . ( She shrinks backs from the door a little . ) You better give up trying and go to a barber shop . Your hand shakes dreadfully . Why do you stare at me like that ? ( She turns away from the door . ) Are you still mad at me about that letter ? ( defiantly ) Well , I had a right to read it . I 'm your wife . ( She comes to the chair and sits down again . After a pause ) I knew all the time you were running around with some one . Your lame excuses about spending the time at the library did n't fool me . Who is this Helen , anyway ? One of those artists ? Or does she write poetry , too ? Her letter sounds that way . I 'll bet she told you your things were the best ever , and you believed her , like a fool . Is she young and pretty ? I was young and pretty , too , when you fooled me with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon wear anyone down . What I 've been through ! ( Goes over and takes the coffee off the stove ) Breakfast is ready . ( with a contemptuous glance ) Breakfast ! ( pours out a cup of coffee for herself and puts the pot on the table ) Your coffee 'll be cold . What are you doing  --  still shaving , for heaven 's sake ? You 'd better give it up . One of these mornings you 'll give yourself a serious cut . ( She cuts off bread and butters it . During the following speeches she eats and sips her coffee . ) I 'll have to run as soon as I 've finished eating . One of us has got to work . ( angrily ) Are you going to look for a job today or are n't you ? I should think some of your fine friends would help you , if they really think you 're so much . But I guess they just like to hear you talk . ( sits in silence for a moment ) I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got any feelings for other people ? What will her family say ? I see she mentions them in her letter . What is she going to do  --  have the child  --  or go to one of those doctors ? That 's a nice thing , I must say . Where can she get the money ? Is she rich ? ( She waits for some answer to this volley of questions . ) Hmm ! You wo n't tell me anything about her , will you ? Much I care . Come to think of it , I 'm not so sorry for her after all . She knew what she was doing . She is n't any schoolgirl , like I was , from the looks of her letter . Does she know you 're married ? Of course , she must . All your friends know about your unhappy marriage . I know they pity you , but they do n't know my side of it . They 'd talk different if they did . ( Too busy eating to go on for a second or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she knew you were married . What does she expect , then ? That I 'll divorce you and let her marry you ? Does she think I 'm crazy enough for that  --  after all you 've made me go through ? I guess not ! And you ca n't get a divorce from me and you know it . No one can say I 've ever done anything wrong . ( drinks the last of her cup of coffee ) She deserves to suffer , that 's all I can say . I 'll tell you what I think ; I think your Helen is no better than a common street-walker , that 's what I think . ( There is a stifled groan of pain from the next room . ) Did you cut yourself again ? Serves you right . ( gets up and takes off her apron ) Well , I 've got to run along . ( peevishly ) This is a fine life for me to be leading ! I wo n't stand for your loafing any longer . ( Something catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ! You 've overturned the water all over everything . Do n't say you have n't . I can hear it dripping on the floor . ( A vague expression of fear comes over her face . ) Alfred ! Why do n't you answer me ? ( She moves slowly toward the room . There is the noise of a chair being overturned and something crashes heavily to the floor . She stands , trembling with fright . ) Alfred ! Alfred ! Answer me ! What is it you knocked over ? Are you still drunk ? ( Unable to stand the tension a second longer she rushes to the door of the bedroom . ) Alfred ! ( She stands in the doorway looking down at the floor of the inner room , transfixed with horror . Then she shrieks wildly and runs to the other door , unlocks it and frenziedly pulls it open , and runs shrieking madly into the outer hallway. )
