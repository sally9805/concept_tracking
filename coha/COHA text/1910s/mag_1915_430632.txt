 | The writer of the series of West Point letters , beginning in this number of the QUARTERLY , was Thomas Rowland , eldest son of Major Isaac S. Rowland and Catherine Armistead Mason . He was born in Detroit , Michigan , March 25 , 1842 , and at an early age , upon the death of his father , Virginia became his home . Here he was brought up , among his mother 's kindred , in Fairfax County , three miles from Alexandria and near the Episcopal Theological Seminary . His early education was received at schools in Virginia . In 1856 he was a student at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Troy , N. Y. , and in July , 1859 , he was entered at West Point . When he sent in his resignation , on the secession of Virginia , Cadet Rowland was at the head of his class , then consisting of forty-two members . Fifty of his letters , written from West Point , have been preserved , from which these selections are made . Of his class there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the North , were in the United States Army , and one , Captain Richard Marshall Nelson of North Carolina , was a Confederate . On the 4th of May , 1861 , young Rowland was commissioned by Governor Letcher , Second Lieutenant in the Provisional Army of Virginia . He did duty at this time drilling volunteers in Ashland and at the Camp of Instruction in Richmond . When the Provisional Army was turned over to the Confederate States , Lieutenant Rowland received a commission as Cadet in the Engineer Corps . He was still drilling raw recruits , however , but early in September he was  | ordered to report to General Gatlin in North Carolina . Here he was stationed successively at Newbern , at Fort Johnson in Wilmington , then at Brunswick Point and Fort St. Philip on the Cape Fear River . And he rendered important service at this time in superintending the construction of the coast defences of the state . His opportu= ' ty for active service was soon at hand . On the 22nd of July , 1862 , Cadet Rowland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Staff of Brigadier-General Robert Ransom , who was then in camp at Petersburg , Va . The brigade was soon after on its way to the Valley and participated in the first invasion of Maryland . The battle of Sharpsburg and the capture of Harper 's Ferry gave Captain Rowland his baptism of fire . in his office of Adjutant he wrote the orders for the commanding-general , to which the latter added any mention he wished to make of his staff . The Sharpsburg order was complimented as " a handsome and stirring piece . " The battle of Sharpsburg took place September 7 ? and on the 13th of December was fought the battle of Fredericksburg . A copy in Captain Rowland 's handwriting has been preserved of the congratulatory address of the commanding general written after the battle of Fredericksburg the composition undoubtedly of the Adjutant . It was in this battle that Captain Rowland distinguished himself for bravery , as General Ransom states in his report . He says : " The valuable assistance and daring gallantry of my Assistant Adjutant General , Captain Rowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , deserve my warmest commendation . They three times during the day each traversed the entire front of my line descending and returning from the road , thus six times running the gauntlet of a most fearful fire . " In January , 1863 , Ransom 's Brigade was in North Carolina , where General Ransom was assigned to the command of " all the troops in North Carolina outside of the District of the Cape Fear . " Early the following June he was promoted and sent again to Virginia . The division had missed the battle of Chancellorsville in May , and was not to participate in the Gettysburg campaign . They remained at Petersburg through August and part of September . General Ransom was then  | assigned to the District of Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee . In Tennessee the division had much rough marching to do , and some skirmishing with the enemy 's cavalry . In the spring of 1864 they were back again in Virginia , at Drewry 's Bluff in May ; at Lynchburg in June , where they were following up Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble attack was soon repulsed . General Ransom was at this time in command of all the cavalry forces in the Valley of Virginia , but he resigned in August , General Lomax being assigned to the command of the division . The Adjutant-General remained with the division . And , as aid to General Lomax , Major Rowland participated in the battles of Winchester and Fisher 's Hill . In the latter fight he received his first and only wound , a flesh wound in the thigh . This gave him a furlough of thirty days which he spent with his mother and sisters in Richmond . He was back in the Valley again in October . In December he writes from Gordonsville of the march of three days from the Luray Valley , through snow , sleet , and hail , crossing the Blue Ridge in a snow storm . On the 22nd of December , Lomax 's Division had a fight at Liberty Mills near Gordonsville , where as General Lee 's official report states , the enemy " was repulsed and severely punished . " In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short leave . He was soon back with his command . But the end was near at hand . The evacuation of Richmond , the surrender of Lee , those fatal April days , brought despair to all hearts . On the 16th of April , the division disbanded at Buchanan , " until the 1st of May " as the order said , for there was still hope that something more might be done for the cause . Major Rowland had left General Lomax before the 16th to join Johnston 's army in the South . But before he could reach North Carolina Johnston surrendered . He wrote to his family then that he would go to Mexico . Sober second thought decided him to remain in his own country . At the close of the war , Major Rowland took the law course at the University of Virginia , and soon after he commenced practice in Baltimore where he rapidly gained distinction . But in a few years his health gave way . Vainly trying change of climate , first going to Brazil and then to California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he died in the latter city , the victim of consumption , April 25 , 1874. 1859 WEST POINT , N. Y. , June 25 , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER I am sorry that I have allowed so many days to slip by without writing to you and giving some account of my new home and profession . I can now announce myself most pleasantly settled , and initiated into camp life , after passing honorably through the examinations , mental and physical . About fifty new cadets have been admitted ? eighteen were found deficient and dismissed ; two had not a cent to travel upon , and as the Government would not pay their expenses home , we ( the class ) have advanced the money out of our pay . I left New York on the 15th of this month after a very pleasant visit which I have already told you of . Upon the afternoon of the same day I reported myself at the office of the Adjutant of this post , soon after I was received in barracks as a " plebe " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King3 were expecting me and by their kindness my embarrassment on that momentous occasion was considerably relieved . At 4 P. M. upon the same day the corps of cadets pitched their tents and went into encampment for the summer . The tents at the base are 6 ft by 7 ; the floor is a plank platform raised 3 inches from the ground to protect us from the rain ; our furniture consists of a long , narrow camp chest and our blankets . There are either three or four in each tent , giving a space of 2 ft or less for each man . So you see we have no room for any such luxuries as chairs or tables . The cadet captains who are appointed out of the first class , are allowed to have a camp stool and writing table , so that they may be able to prepare their reports . When we write we sit upon a blanket and put our paper on the camp chest . At all  | times in the day when we are not in motion we rest ourselves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a synopsis of the routine of daily duty as it is at present for our class . Reveille is at 5 A. M. Precisely at that hour the cannon is fired by the sentinel in front of the camp . The drum strikes up immediately and beats for five minutes , during which time we are expected to slip on our clothes and take our places in ranks . As soon as the drum stops beating the roll is called and those who are not there to answer to their names are reported to the Commandant of the post for demerits and are expected to give an explanation of their absence to Lieut . McCook . This is the case at every parade , roll call and inspection . Immediately after reveille we turn out for police duty , i. e. , to clean up every piece of paper , stick and loose stone in the camp ground . ( This would just suit Aunt Emily.4 ) At 5/ A. M. we have another drum for drill which lasts until 672 . We then have half an hour to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pile them in the corner and arrange everything in straight lines for inspection . If everything is not arranged with the greatest exactitude we receive demerits for neglect of duty . At 7 A. M. we are marched in squads to the mess hall for breakfast . The fare is plain , of course , but I would not wish it better . Everything is well cooked , and the bread and butter is excellent . At 8 A. M. we have guard mount . Between 9 and 11 we have no regular duty to perform , though we are sometimes called out to march to the armory or commissary department . From 11 to 1 we have drill again and bayonet exercise . At 1 P. M. we march again to the mess hall . They always allow exactly half an hour for every meal and we are obliged to rise at command and march back to camp as soon as the time expires . From 2 to 5 P. M. is the same as from 9 to 11 A. M. From 5 to 6 P. M. we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade and inspection of arms , tents , &c.; At parade the offences and demerits for the preceding day are read off , the band plays 2 or 3 airs or marches , the battalion executes movements with muskets to show their proficiency to spectators of  | whom there are not a few , and the whole is closed by discharge of a cannon . Parade is always a beautiful sight and the band is excellent . This morning they played an air from " Lucia , " and some days ago they played " Oft in the Stilly Night . " The corps is divided into four companies , A , B , C and D. I am in Company B. Mr. Mill 's friend Benjamin is one of the cadet officers of my Company . I have not yet had an opportunity of making his acquaintance . I-am tenting at present with two of Lew 's classmates , Davis of Pennsylvania , and Cross of Massachusetts , who was formerly at the R. P. I.7 He stands at the head of his class . Lew Horton is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the best fellow in the corps . Since the thinning out produced by the examination and one or two subsequent desertions the camp is not so crowded . Tomorrow I am to move into a tent with one of my own classmates ? " a lineal ( ? ) descendant of George Washington , " 8 and a cousin of Miss Laura Lippitt.9 He is a fine fellow of course ( as who could not be under such circumstances ) . We have made an arrangement to room together when we get into barracks and be studious . But I have broken off in my account of our day 's employment . Directly after parade we march to mess hall again for supper . After supper we go to an excellent place on the Hudson to swim . I am learning to swim quite well . At 9/ P. M. the drum is beat for tattoo , the roll is called , and after an allowance of five minutes to undress , every light must be extinguished at the tap of the drum or " taps . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when interrupted by the " pulling out . " I was pulled out only once the first night and have not been troubled at all for a week , although some of my classmates have not been so fortunate . The guard tent is a great instrument of punishment for " plebes . " Two or three  | are confined there every day by cadet officers for inattention at drill or some such offence . I am sorry to say that Chapman has failed to pass his examination , but he expects to get a reappointment and to return in September . Ben King is on a furlough . He will return by the 28th of August , that being the day upon which we enter barracks . We will then study hard until the January examination , which is said to be the most difficult one in the course , ? decides who is " to be " and who " not to be " in our class . SUNDAY 26TH JUNE : I did not have time to finish this letter yesterday so I take it up this evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the service this morning , and the choir , which is composed entirely of cadets sang " While Thee I Seek , Protecting Power " to the same air that you used to sing it . They commenced the service by chanting " The Lord is in His Holy Temple , " &c.,; and sang all the doxologies after the hymns . Mr. French is an excellent reader , the choir have very fine voices , and altogether I enjoyed the services very much . He gave notice that next Sunday would be Communion Sunday . I suppose that it will be at your Chapel also . You must say a prayer for me on that occasion . Our chapel is a very pretty building , tastefully decorated on the inside and receiving a military aspect from the flags and cannon ranged along the walls , trophies taken in 1812 and in Mexico . I was reminded of home this morning by the band playing " Strike the Cymbal " during inspection . I went to see Clara Paige last week and saw her again at church this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to Mr. French . I will try and get a permit to go tomorrow . She is very much admired among the cadets . Tell Steeny that two of the " at large " appointments failed to pass the examination . Perhaps he might get one of the vacancies . I know he would enjoy this life . You must give my love to all my friends and kiss all the family for me . I will write again as soon as possible , but after coming in from a double quick  | drill on a bayonet exercise we do not feel much like sitting down on the floor to write a letter . Your aff. son T. ROWLAND WEST PoINT , N. Y. , Monday , June 27 , 1859 , 10:40 A. M. MY DEAR KATE 'S Here I am curled up on my tent floor like a Turk , endeavoring to fulfil my promise of writing to you , though I expect to be called out on the plain in about five minutes to be drilled with my class in infantry tactics . This plain is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blade of grass , and upon such a day as this , the hot sun reflected from the sand makes drilling at " double quick " rather warm work ; yet we rather enjoy it , especially when we kirow that it is only the preparation for higher things . The cadet officers are very fierce and give their commands with an emphasis that makes a man tremble in his shoes , and if a poor " plebe " in his fright and confusion makes a false step or an awkward or slow movement with his musket , no matter how inexperienced he may be , he is confined to the guard tomb for the offence . Until the trying ordeal of the plebian encampment is over we will have a hard time . We must live the life of a common soldier , and experience all its hardships and severities with its more galling indignities until the name of " Old Cadet " removes the indignities and finally a commission in the army crowns all our labors with success . No one who has not lived this hard life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a cadet hails his approaching furlough or graduation . It forms the subject of many a pleasant anticipation and many a " happy dream , " and is truly the rose that has its thorn . If a man had nothing else to recommend him , the mere fact of his being a graduate of West Point ought to entitle him to respect . It shows that he has done what hundreds have failed to accomplish , and what has tried the spirit and the strength of all the best officers of our army . On the 4th of July the hops commence and then the Point will be crowded with ladies and the cadets will have a gay sum- mer , though the plebes are not generally admitted to these entertainments ; if any of my friends come , however , I shall transcend the limits of a plebe in this respect . Have you heard anything of Jennie Coopers " since I left ? I shall look forward with great pleasure to the arrival of that charming cousin . When you write to me you must tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know when Miss Connie Cary15 comes home . I am reading the book that Miss Julia Johns16 gave me ; I like it very much and you must thank her for me and give love to her and to all my friends in the neighborhood . My tentmate is a great admirer of Miss Laura Lippitt ; we have sympathizing talks together on that subject . You must tell Mason ' to write to me and tell me the progress of the garden , the state of John Jackson 's health , &c.; Any accounts of family affairs however trivial , would be interesting to me , even down to Winnie , Richard and Henry . I must now close my letter and take my musket to pieces and clean it for another drill . We have to have the barrel and all the steel parts so bright that the inspecting officer can see his face in them . Adieu , T. ROWLAND U. S. C. C. WEST POINT , N. Y. , Sunday , July 10 , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER I am going to ask your forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Although it gives me great pleasure to write , my time is so cut up and intersected by drills and parades that I invariably find myself putting off this pleasant duty until Sunday . Since last writing to you I have received a letter from yourself and one from Kittie , and I can not tell you how much  | pleasure it gives me to hear from you all , for although it would not do to say that I have been homesick , the sudden change from a life so calm and pleasant to one fraught with so many trials and difficulties , has made me feel more keenly than I had anticipated , the separation from home and family . Write to me oftener , even if it is only a page or two . I need something in these trying times to keep my spirits up . Nothing does this more effectually than a cheerful letter from home . Let me sympathize with you all in everything ; tell me of all your pleasures and " Je serai heureux lorsque je saurais que vows l'etes vous-rnenles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will easily be able to send me a letter twice a week . Now that Mason 's holiday has commenced he might write to me now and then . You must not let my letters give you the impression that I am not happy in my new line of life . My pleasures overbalance my troubles and though sometimes depressed I am never discontented , but feel assured that the profession I have chosen is the one best suited to my tastes , and though difficult in the attainment , rich in its rewards . I have been several times to see Clara Paige . She has been exceedingly kind , taking as she calls it a motherly interest in me . I have been introduced to Mrs. French and Miss Clara French , both of whom are very kind , giving me a standing invitation to visit them . Prof. French was not at home when I called , though I see and hear him every Sunday . Last Sunday I was with you all in spirit at the Communion Table . Two of my classmates came forward ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making only about ten in all out of a battalion of nearly two hundred . On the fourth of July we had a great celebration , of course ; salutes from the batteries , an original and excellent oration from a first-classman , reminding us of our particular duties , and some splendid music from our band . General Scott was present and was received by the battalion of cadets with military honors . In the evening we had beautiful fireworks , as fine as any I ever saw . They were all made on the Point by the ca- dets . Our class has commenced artillery drills . We practice with the identical battery with which the brave Captain Bragg gave the Mexicans " a little more grape . " The dancing lessons have commenced . The cost is $2 per month ? a lesson every day . I will not take lessons until I see how my treasurer 's accounts stand . It is so late in the season that I have only been able to obtain one card for the " hops . " Lew told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing it to Alexandria , so I will send this one to Miss Connie Cary . You must give all my other friends a verbal invitation . The " plebes " have just commenced going on guard and their mistakes and embarrassments during the first night on post create a great deal of amusment in the camp . My tentmate Washington , was carried off his post twice in a wheelbarrow and had his musket taken away from him . Another fellow was tied to a tree . My turn will come in a day or two . I will write you my first experience . The pulling out is nearly over , but the guard tent is kept pretty well filled with prisoners . We do not hear much news in camp , so you may tell Kittie whenever she finds an interesting article in the Times to mail it to me . An Alexandria Gazette occasionally would also be acceptable . I must now bid you goodbye for the present and prepare for infantry drill . So with a great deal of love for Aunt Emily , the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else in Alexandria or Fairfax County ( including Winnie , Aunt Betsy and Richard ) , believe me your very devoted Son T. ROWLAND U. S. C. C. P. S. I send Kit a very pleasant tribute to one of her favorite poets . Tell her she must read Goldsmith and Parnell in return . WEST POINT , N. Y. , July 24 , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER Tomorrow I will be detailed for guard duty which lasts for twenty-four hours , so I must contrive to write you a few lines this evening , as the active and continuous duty of a sentinel keeps him ever on the alert and prevents anything of  | the kind . Eight hours of this time is consumed in walking post ; during the remainder of the time , even while sleeping we must have on full uniform , belts and accoutrements with our muskets by our side so as to be ready at any moment day or night to turn out instantly upon command , for inspection by the " officer of the day , " or the " officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or escorts for prisoners . In pencil . As I have to prepare my arms and accoutrements for the rigid inspection which always attends guard mount , I will not have time to finish this letter , but rather than fail in my weekly epistle I will add a few lines in pencil and send this although it is hardly commenced . Since writing my letter to Aunt Emily last week I have receive the most delightful budgets of letters from yourself at Okeley and from Mason and Kitty at the Cottage . They were both filled with interesting details of dear home news and have afforded me pleasure and amusement ever since , for I always make one letter last until the arrival of the next . Mason 's letter was filled with real family jokes such as I have often joined in and enjoyed with you all over our social dinner table at home . Just as I looked up then from my paper my eye fell upon a fourleaved clover ; I send it as emblematical of the good influence that is always attendant upon my intercourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he must try it again . His account of the chickens and garden were very interesting to me , and his graceful compliment to Miss Laura Lippitt 's charms was a chef d'oeuvre which accorded exactly with the sentiments of my roommate and myself . I mean my roommate in prospect , for my tentmate is a Mr. Calef from that enterprising but unlovely State of Massachusetts . By-the-bye , my friend Washington seems to be a very ardent admirer of Miss Laura . He always sends love when I write to you . Llew who seems much interested in my welfare , is delighted with my choice of roommate . I have reason to be thankful for my success here so far . Kit tells me that Cousin Beverley has come home . I would give anything to see him . It is nearly time for evening  | parade so I must close this important epistle with love and a kiss for you all . I bear you all continually in my thoughts , picturing you in imagination in the various domestic scenes in which I used t to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite mercy may spare us all to join in many more scenes as pleasant and as pure , is the earnest prayer of Your devoted and affectionate son , T. ROWLAND WEST PoINT , N. Y. , Aug. 9th , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER It is nearly two weeks since I have written a letter to any one at the Cottage . Two or three times when I have been on the point of writing , other duties more immediately necessary have prevented me from executing this pleasant task . My last letter was sent to Aunt Emily at Rockaway , and I almost forgot that in writing to one I did not write to all . Llew and I are joyfully expecting her visit with Dora22 to West Point , which is now , I hope , not more than a week or ten days distant . It will be so pleasant to see someone from home and to show Aunt Emily just how I live . I am learning to love my new home more than I used to . I have moved into a company of Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Point " plebe ; " I have found firm friends among my classmates ; I have become hardened to the severe routine of duty ; and I begin to regard with affectionate familiarity the rugged old hills that formerly looked down so sternly upon me as they echoed back the startling beat of the drum which warned me to hasten ? I knew not where , to do ? I knew not what . In about three weeks from today we will move into barracks and commence study . I will then feel more in my native element , and you may rest assured that I will do all that taste , application and ambition can accomplish to stand well in my class , to please my mother , and to show Aunt Emily that  | time and trouble which she expended in obtaining my appointment have not been expended in vain . Yet I must tell you that this class is probably one of the smartest that ever entered West Point , and I will have to contend with many who have spent years in preparation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the winter 's campaign . It will take many a hard-fought battle to win the laurel of our class and time only must decide the contest and prove the victor . Since I last wrote to you I have received an excellent letter from Liz , enlivened by the mention of Miss Emily McGuire and Miss Connie Cary , parts of which I read to Llew , as we always supply each other with the latest news from Virginia . Liz 's letter contained also a note from my literary sympathizer . Since then I have received your letter of the 23rd ult ; written immediately upon your return from Okeley and enclosed in one from Aunt Emily of the same date ; still later yours of the 1st August brought with its other contents the sweet little Cottage violet . Although I can not answer all these in particular I thank you all very much for them , and hope that you will continue to supply me with all the details of home and keep before me a constant picture of our delightful neighborhood . The note from Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was much interested in your account of the new choir . I should like to be there to join if I could do no more than blow the bellows for you , though inspired by the sound of Miss Connie 's voice I think I could learn to sing too . You must keep me informed of your progress . I have not heard the grand Te Deum sung since I left home . You have no idea how much I miss your songs , and Lizzie 's playing , to say nothing of Kit 's accompaniments upon the guitar . We sometimes have some very fine music from our band which plays morning and evening at parade . Last night the " Anvil Chorus " was played most beautifully by the full brass band with drums . The scenery here is more beautiful than any that I have ever seen . The plain upon which the encampment is situated is entirely surrounded by a circular ridge of lofty mountains only broken where the beautiful Hudson has forced its way  | through the solid rock of the ancient hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered with forest and bare rocks but upon the opposite side of the river we can see the fields of yellow grain waving in the very clouds of heaven . Imagine a violent storm in this mountainous enclosure , the thunder echoing around its massy walls until bursting out suddenly through the valley of the river it is heard rumbling and muttering among the unseen mountains in the distance . I hope next year you will see West Point for yourself and then you will find that its charms are not exaggerated . In some places you can read at the distance of a quarter of a mile the names of " Palo Alto , " " Buena Vista " and " Monterey , " where they have been carved in gigantic letters in the solid rock . Here too the ruins of Fort Putnam look down upon us , with its Revolutionary memories , reminding us of the gallant men who fought and perished , ? as we may fight and perish ? in their country 's cause . But how come on the corn and potatoes which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees ? How does " Jack " spend his vacation ? I am glad to hear that he has become a beau ; he will derive more benefit from ladies ' society of the proper sort than from too much association with boys , who from wildness and mischief are too apt to run into dissipation and immorality . If Annapolis is anything like West Point he will need all the good principles he can form and they must be firm ones too ! WEST POINT , N. Y. , Oct. 9th , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER I commenced a letter to Aunt Emily last week acknowledging the receipt of the delightful fruit which she sent me from New York , but I was so busy at the time that I did not have time to finish it and it has laid in my writing-desk until now entirely out of date . If she is with you at the Cottage now as I suppose she is , you must thank her very much for me . John French was so kind as to receive the basket for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters under the cover of night . ( You know it is against regulations to have provisions of any kind in barracks . ) The contents  | proved well worth the trouble , and my friends and myself feasted upon them for some time afterwards . Yesterday I received a triple letter from yourself and the two girls , and I have been enjoying ever since the account of the Clermont party , the dedication of the new Seminary and other interesting bits of home news which they contained . I can well imagine how much pleasure you all feel at getting back to the dear Cottage again even after visiting such a delightful place as Okeley . Oh for the time when we may all meet there again in health and happiness ! I hope when I get my furlough that Aunt Laura and Uncle Robert will be in the East . I will stop in New York for Dora and once again in our old Virginia home we will have such a family party as we were wont to have in olden times . The party at Clermont must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Connie 's beau should have been arrested so suddenly in his career and in such a peculiar manner . It must have been rather an embarrassing position for her to say the least of it . I have just paused in my letter for a half an hour to go to Prof. French 's Bible Class . Llew was there also . We meet every Sunday at four o'clk in the chapel . Prof. French is very entertaining and he makes these few moments pass very pleasantly and profitably to us all . I suppose you know that Llew has become a member of the church . I have been twice with him to the Communion Table . I have never told you of our prayer meetings ; we have them every Monday and Thursday evening during the half hour which intervenes between supper and " Call to quarters " ( the bugle for evening study ) . They are presided over by Lieutenant Howard , 24 one of the professors of mathematics . He reads a chapter in the Bible and then we sing a hymn and have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exegencies of the army and corps of cadets . Do n't be shocked ; they are quite orthodox and do a great deal of good in keeping us reminded  | of our duties and strengthening us against the temptations peculiar to our mode of life . I suppose you have heard of the sad death of Major Chapman . I heard that he committed suicide . I wish you would let me know the particulars if you have heard them . His son has obtained two days leave . Meigs25 is one of the smartest of our class in mathematics and appears to have studied a great deal of the course . He and Washington and myself have been transferred to the first section . This morning our room was complimented by the Commandant as being the neatest that he had seen in barracks ? so much for having Miss Laura Lippitt 's cousin for a chum . I was much amused with Kittie 's account of the three charming young men . I can imagine lliurray eating in the rocking chair , " Maxy " yearning , and Hale squalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the " grub . " You must give my respects to the Sewing Society , and do give my love to Cousin Lucy . It is nearly tattoo so I must bid you good night with much love to Aunt Libby , Aunt Emily , the girls and Mason . Your devoted Son T. ROWLAND WEST PoINT , N. Y. , Oct. 18th , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER I am very sorry that I delayed writing so long as to call forth a scolding from ma chere mere . I received yesterday your letter of the 11th and felt how much I deserved the mild but serious rebuke therein contained . I must be more punctual in future . I suppose by this time you have received my letter of last week . I was in hopes it would reach you before you fulminated the thunderbolts which I so much dread in their silent power . * * * * * * I hope during the winter the course will be reduced again to four years ; then I will be released one year sooner and be enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never do as a cadet .

I received a paper containing an article on the San Francisco Murder and an account of the San Juan difficulties , for which I must thank Kittie , I suppose , she being the only member of the family who reads the papers . My love to Aunt Emily , and tell her that her copy of Thomas a Kempis proves quite a treasure . Llew always sends love to you . Meigs is doing very well indeed ; he is considered one of the best mathematicians in our class . Winter has nearly commenced here ; we have some quite cold days and the beautiful autumn leaves will soon be gone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night gathered around the cheerful open fires in the dining room . Imagine me there . Give my best love to Cousin Maria and Jennie if they are in the neighborhood . Do they intend to spend the winter at " Cameron " ? I hope for your sake they will . Love to all ? and love to " Cousin Laura " and " Cousin Charlotte , " from my chum . Yours " PICKWICK " WEST POINT , N. Y. , October 23d , 1859 . MY DEAR MOTHER , I received last week Kittie 's letter of the 17th enclosing a short note from Aunt Emily . I will be deligrited to receive the dressing gown of which she spoke , and will prize it very highly as a relic of the noble man to whom it belonged . Who is the Captain Caxon to whose care it was to be directed ? I know of no such person ? Tell Aunt Emily that all the fruit came safely to hand except the peaches ; I suppose there was not room for them in the basket . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest I have seen this year . I must thank you for the " Church Journals " which  | I received last week containing articles upon the General Convention and a notice of the ordination of our friend Mr. Mayer . I should like very much to see the " House of Bishops " ; they must form an imposing assembly when in session . I see from one of the papers that three of the Bishops were graduates of West Point . There has been quite an excitement here for the last few days occasioned by the startling and almost incredible news of an insurrection at Harper 's Ferry . Washington was particularly interested in the state of affairs as his home is only four miles from Harper 's Ferry , and his father is a prominent slaveholder of that region . Very fortunately his sister had left home for Baltimore the day before the insurrection occurred , but his father was the first person taken by these desperate men . They came to his house during the night and woke him up , telling him that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a stir in the quiet Old Dominion , and though his attempt has miserably failed , there is something quite romantic in his fanatical idea of revolutionizing our government with a handful of men armed with revolvers and iron pikes . He must certainly have been a monomaniac , though he is represented as giving his orders with remarkable coolness when defending his position in the armory against the attack of the U. S. Marines . A most singular affair ! Conducted in a most singular manner ? by a most singular person ! I should like to see a further development of the plot . I received a Washington Star containing an account of the insurrection , and also an Alexandria Gazette directed in a strange hand . The cold weather has actually commenced ; I should like very much to have some of your knit woolen socks and undershirts if there were any way of sending them on , but I suppose there is not . The cold north winds as they come down the valley of the Hudson are very penetrating , and there is no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobstructed ( to the northward ) plains of West Point . Love to Cousin Maria and to Jennie , and love to all at " The Cottage . "
