txt CORPORATION TAX RETURN . Trusts President Taft Will Call for an Extension to April 15 . It is worth remembering that fifteen years ago this month , when the income tax cases were pending in the Supreme Court , Congress by joint resolution extended the time for filing the returns of income from March 1 to April 15 . There Is more reason for such a resolution now than there was then , for the corporation tax is a novel measure , not controlled by any precedent , and is believed lty most lawyers who have considered it carefully to be unconstitutional . It is therefore , I think , a little unfair to the Administration and to Congress to impute to either a desire to avoid fair play or to show disrespect to the Supreme Court . It is rather to be assumed that the Administration and Congress will be as liberal to the people of the United States and as courteous to the court as their predecessors were in February , 1895 , and it is not unreasonable to expect that a joint resolution extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be requested by the President , and promptly passed by Congress , so that nobody shall be obliged to assume the burdents of a law which a few weekS later may be declared unconstitutional .
