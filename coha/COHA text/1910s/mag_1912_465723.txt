It was within the experience of the author whom we are writing of , that now and then one of those who had pierced him in some tenderest place was so sorry for it as to offer him frank amends . Such repentant scorncrs confessed that they had been wrong both in their opinions and in the manner of delivering them ; and their repentance was none the less acceptable because in the process of the years the author was no longer sure that they had been so wrong in their opinions . Much , he secretly owned , might be said for their opinions , though in accepting their amends he was far from saying this . He was far also from allowing that his manner of laying down the law had sometimes been extremely offensive , and such as to provoke insult in return . It was not his affair to justify the offenders in the misbehavior which they now acknowledged ; he was not moved to the avowal of his own misbehavior in planting darts in other writers . In one of the most signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sting , and leave them rankling . It did not avail him with his conscience that be felt himself esthetically right , or that people said how brilliantly , how amusingly , how nobly right he was He was aware of all that ; but he was also aware how wanting in singleness his motive was . He believed that the victim merited all he got and more , but he could not rejoice in giving it him . If there had been some proud , fine way of acknowledging this truth , he would gladly have acknowledged it ; but he could not see any such way . Then the days passed , and after many years he happened on that cruel criticism , and gaspingly glanced it over . That had taken place ? It was not nearly so bad as he had long thought . There were not nearly so many poisoned points iu it as he had imagined . Was it then mostly a verjuice of the will which he had been so sensible of dipping those points into ? If his victim could have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would he have felt the pain which the author knew he had meant him to feel ? He wished they could now read the thing over together , for he thought in this ultimate state he might have justified it to him . To be sure there would have remained the difficulty of justifying it to himself ; he would have remembered the sort of malice it was that winged the shafts once so sharp , now so blunted . Perhaps the subject of a cruel criticism never feels it so much as the critic at first hopes and then fears . Very few of the subjects talk back ; it is somehow thought undignified for them to talk back , though why it should be thought so we do not quite see . It might be a very good thing for criticism if the criticized did talk back . The most signal instance of back-talk was that of Thaekeray 's preface to the second edition of The Kiekleburys on the Rhine , in which he turned upon the London Times reviewer of the book . The retort was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not yet see why it was unwise , though it is now fifty years since we formed our opinion of it . As we remember , it left very little of the reviewer , and it must have improved the quality of the Times 's reviews for a good while . But mostly , almost always , indeed , the author takes the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism in silence . He pretends sometimes that they amuse him , as Pope did when he was seen writhing in an agony of pleasure from one of them . There is , of course , the middle way of not reading the criticism , but this is beset by the perpetual temptation to read it . The only safety lies in not merely not seeing it , but in not knowing of it , or in not coming on it till years afterward , when it has got cold and has lost its sting . Let us hope it will certainly he so with the unworthy flings at that aged author whose case we began with , when he finds them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests a much more important question , and that is whether there is not something essentially perishable in criticism , the most general , the most generous , the least personal . We have just been reading Mr. Arnold Bennett 's paper on " The Future of the American Novel , " and fancying that which was written nine years ago , but only now printed , already obsolescent , almost obsolete , through the changing circumstances . We do not say changing conditions , for these remain much the same in 1912 that they were in 1903 . The novelist who is also an artist is still trying to write something good and great , or at least the best and greatest things he can ; the publisher , who is a merchant , is seeking to bring out the thing that everybody is reading ; the reader , who knows what be likes , is trying to find it in the book that the most people are liking . It is still the old lottery , with hazard apparently overruling law , but with the law , eternal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is excellent , as God lives , is permanent , " and in spite of all doubts whether God really lives , something supreme ordains the survival of the fittest in literature , in fiction , as in everything else . Since Mr. Bennett wrote his interesting paper a hundred big sellers have gone to the rag-bag , the ash-barrel . Having ceased to sell big , they have ceased to sell little , and some books that sold little are selling a little more . It is not much to brag of , but it is the most we have , and we make it our meek boast . We are still in the competitive age , the stone age , the mud age , as to our conditions , but our circumstances have improved . Occasionally a publisher who has grown rich in big-selling feels that he can print a good book because it is good , because he himself loves it . Occasionally an author produces a failure after the formula which has often warranted success ; but more than ever , it seems to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chances with it . Our criticism is more intelligent and better mannered ; our public is more intelligent and better read than it was nine years ago . The friendly foreign observer has also advanced , and we take leave to think that Mr. Bennett would write in 1912 a better paper on the future of our novel than he wrote in 1903 . We do not believe , for instance , that he mould now look at the phenomena of our enormous enterprise in all kinds , as the best material for fiction , as the material with which art would prosper most . That material is the stuff for the newspaper , but not for the novel , except as such wonders of the outer world can be related to the miracles of the inner world . Fiction can deal with the facts of finance and industry and invention only as the expressions of character ; otherwise these things are wholly dead . Nobody really lives in them , though for the most part we live among them , in the toils of the day and the dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader than to our hopeful critic , for nobody knows better than he how inanimate the material things are . The man who has written of the Five Towns and the heights and depths of the real life there ought not to indulge the illusion that there can be for the novelist elsewhere any lasting future except in writing of the real life which he knows . We do not think he would indulge this illusion now , because with him also the eircumatances have changed in the last nine years . In that time he has found himself , and if the world had not found him , too , it would scarcely have mattered to him in his sense of the true work he has done . This sense is his triumph and his exceeding great reward , but when he wrote his paper on the future of our novel , he had not done the work which it crowns . We must not , therefore , suppose that if he were writing now he would imply that our objective bigness was the stuff of our art . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be so , and that if we were ever to discover our greatness to others we must withdraw from our bigness to the recesses of that consciousness from which characters as well as camels are evolved . The American , no more than any other man , shall know himself from his environment , but he shall know his environment from himself . In the measure of his selfknowledge only shall he truthfully portray his neighbor , and he shall instinctively keep to his neighborhood , to his experience of it for his chance of knowledge beyond it . This has been instinctively so with the localiets whom Mr. Bennett finds to have written novels of the States , but not of the United States . We for our part do not believe that the novel of the United States ever will be , or ever can be , written , or that it would be worth reading if it were written . In fiction , first the provincial , then the national , then the universal ; but the parochial is better and more to be desired than either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR - G37 the Americans are the most decentralized people in the world , and just as there can never be a national Italian fiction , or national Spanish fiction , there can be no national American fiction . but only provincial , only parochial fictions evermore . The English can not imagine this because of their allegiance to a capital , such as we feel to no supreme city of ours ; and yet the English have no national novel , no United Kingdom novel . Mr. Bennett , who has written novels on a settle nobly vast , is strictly provincial in his scope ; as provincial as Ibsen himself . When lie goes to Paris with his scene he takes the Five Towns folk with him , and he realizes Paris to us through them , whom alone he perfectly knows . We could not wish it otherwise , and if we did we could not have it ; or he , either . Can any one , when he comes to it , really conceive of a United States novel ? No more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tremendous industries , our convulsive finance , our seismic politics , our shameless graft , stuff of an imaginative ' work . Mr. Bennett figures Balzac confronted with our gross material marvels , and crying out : " This country is simply steeped in romance ; it lies in heaps . Give me a pen quirk , for Heaven 's sake ! " The words are brave and flattering to our vanity , but when we wake in the night and wish we had not eaten so much for dinner , we must doubt whether Balzae , hit of a quack as he was , would not have paused and reflected before attempting to extract sunbeams from our maninsoth cucumbers . They are cucumbers , after all ; and the more precious fruits of our earth and air are those that grow everywhere from the blossoms that mostly blush unseen . To seek them out and impart their color and perfume to his page is the true office of the artist . The simple structure of our society , the free play of our democracy in spite of our plutocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalence of the wrong , the generous instinct of selfsacrifice , the wish to wreak ourselves in limitless hospitality , the capacity for indefatigable toil , the will to make our achievement commensurate with our opportunity ? these are the national things which the national novel might deal with , better than with Pittsburg chimneys and Chicago expresses . In the mean time we have the localists who have done and are doing far better work than any conceivable of a nationalist : Sarah Orne Jewett and Mrs. Wilkins Freeman for New England , Mr. Cable for New Orleans , Miss Murfree for the Tennessee mountains , Mr. Brand Whitlock for the older Middle West , Mr. Hamlin Garland for the younger and farther West , Mr. Henry B. Fuller and Miss Edith Wyatt for Chicago , Georg Sehock for German Pennsylvania , Mr. Harben for Northern Georgia . We name a few out of many , and we would not leave unnamed Mr. William B. Trites , whose two very extraordinary books , John Cave and Life , are now making him known in England for the mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism and the life of a small Pennsylvania town . John Cave is a tragedy of such proportions as is not easily predicable of an action commensurate with our geographical superficies , and in the brief compass of Life , the vast conception of a chain of Beauty Parlors stretching from ocean to ocean has its origin in the imagination of a village youth mean in everything but his generous passion for the village girl who studied with him in their small-town environment . If the story strays to capitals beside and beyond the sea it is with no purpose of the author to enlarge it to national dimensions . We do not forget what Frank Norris did and wished to do . His epic of the wheat was to have run from California to Chicago , and from Chicago to Paris ; but he , too , was a localist , and The Octopus was better than The Pit , because he had lived more in California than in Chicago , and was more vitally intimate with his scene and action there . Closer , firmer , truer than even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which scarcely ever leaves the shabby San Francisco street where the irregular dentist hangs out his sign of a golden tooth . Our novelists are each bound by the accident of birth to this locality or that ; and we do not believe we shall ever have a truly United States novel till some genius is born all over the Union .
