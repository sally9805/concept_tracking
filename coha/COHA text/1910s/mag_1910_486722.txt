Basutoland comprises the Drakensberg range , the Switzerland of South Africa , and has been in the possession of its people for nearly a century . It first came into touch with the whites in 1823 , when its chief , Moshesh , asked for a missionary to come and live with him , and give him advice in governing Largely through the wisdom of their chief the Basutos have fared well . In 1854 he published an ordinance against the introduction of spiritous liquor , which contains the statement , " We deem that a good chief and judge can not claim to be competent to execute his duties , if he make use of anything of an intoxicating nature . " Independence being endangered by the encroachment of the Dutch settlers , Moshesh procured in 1842 the protection of the British Crown . The narrative of the events during his rule occupies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wars , intertribal and with their neighbors in the Orange Free State , boundary disputes and negotiations with the British officials , of whose mistakes and unjust acts there is no attempt at concealment . Prominent among these was the issue of a command to the Basutos to give up their firearms , which caused serious trouble for several years , until the policy was abandoned and the act repealed . It is hardly necessary to add that there are countless instances of the heartless treatment of the natives by the Doers . Basutoland is still virtually independent , though under the supreme authority of the Crown . In 1903 a large share of the government was delegated to a National Council partly selected by the chiefs and partly nominated by the government . At its first meeting it adopted a code of laws , one of which provided for the " statutory punishment for seduction and abduction of women . " Its present condition is as remarkable as its history . There is no pauperism , and " it has a balance in the bank of ? 150,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest statistics available , there are 248 schools with 12,195 pupils , and two years ago " 78,000 men went ' abroad at intervals for work , not all absent at the same time . " Their social and economic life is founded on the communal ownership of land , which has prevented Europeans from purchasing or otherwise gaining occupation . Sir Godfrey 's work , it must be confessed , is not easy reading , so much of it is taken up with detailed accounts of small matters and with long extracts from documents . Major Comyn 's book , like Sir Godfrey 's , describes the author 's rich first hand experiences with natives  --  in his case the Sudanese . For the larger part of the four years , he was a member of the ' civil administration , his principal duties being dispensing justice , settling disputes , building stations , opening roads , the cultivation of oases , and " patrolling . " This meant going from village to village to come in touch with the sultans , as the chiefs are termed in many tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . He also did much exploring in the little-known regions bordering on Abyssinia in the southeast and on the Nile and Congo watershed in the west . Many times he was obliged to defend his camp from the attacks of lions . In one instance , he says : The fires were lighted , and shortly afterwards we began to see lions walking round our camp , the firelight playing on them , and showing , as they stood and stared at intervals , the corners of their cruel mouths drooping There were quite thirty of them . Elephants were very numerous in many places , and here is his account of an experience with giraffes : I fear I will be dubbed a dreamer , or worse , when I state that one day a herd which numbered from 500 to SOO , followed the gunboat so closely that we could distinguish the markings on their heads . They evidently took our yellow funnel for the neck of their Mandi . This herd moved in quite a military formation . The thick mass in the centre was surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have followed us is not extraordinary , for the giraffe is intensely curious . The " selt-sacrificing earnestness and practical intelligence " of these " pioneers of administration " are well attested by " In the Torrid Sudan , " of which the main purpose , however , is to recount the author 's extensive journey . Starting from Khartum , Mr. Tangye ascended the Dinder , one of the affluents of the Blue Nile , to the Abyssinian frontier , which he was not allowed to cross . Here is a post established to prevent the slave-trade , and so effective is its work that " only one case of slave-running occurred in 1908 . " From this place , he crossed to the White Nile , through a region which he characterizes as a " breezeless , burning , shadeless furnace  --  the home of great loneliness . " In the one hundred and sixteen miles traversed , there were only two places which water could be found . Up the main river , he came to the marsh land where dwells " man in the raw state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Much interesting information is given of these Nuers , Dinkas , and Shilluks , who attain an enormous height , the leg being of great length , probably because of the constant necessity of wading . Among other things , he learned that the laws , of the Dinka are " drawn up in a well-defined code . . . . Many provisions have resemblance to laws detailed in the earliest , books of the Bible . " The almost unknown region , lying between British East Africa and Abyssinia , is the portion of Africa which Capt C. H. Stigand has chosen to describe With a modest following of thirty porters and a headman he made his explorations , which he describes in " Ta Abyssinia through an Unknown Land . " There are vivid pictures of life on the trek , and much information , including some folk-lore tales , is given about the twenty different tribes encountered , some of which had never before seen a white man . In three of them the custom prevailed of strangling the first-born child and throwing the body away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience , they asserted , to a decree of their ancestors . Duke Adolphus Frederick , in his explorations " In the Heart of Africa , " was accompanied by a scientific staff consisting of topographer , geologist , botanist , zoologist , ethnologist , bacteriologist and doctor , and seven hundred men were employed as carriers . Some idea may be gained of what it costs to maintain such an expedition by the fact that " during the first fourteen days " they " disposed of 20,000 bunches of bananas . " The research work was confined to the northwestern part of the German East African Protectorate , and considerable space is given to reports by leaders of parties sent out to make special investigations . The most original work was the investigation of the animal and plant world , and more especially of the geological conditions of the Virunga volcanic region , then virtually unknown . From one of its eight gigantic peaks-eleven eruptions were observed : The columns of vapor , illuminated as if by a smelting furnace , shot up from the broad mouth of the crater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then fell down to earth again , sparkling and scintillating in a glorious rain o ashes . Many craters , one over a mile in diameter , and lava tunnels and caves were found , and elephants were tracked to-heights of above 7,000 feet . The natives said they " always kept to the mountain slopes and never shifted their quarters to the plains . " The homeward journey was made through the Congo State . The account leaves a favorable impression of some of the Belgian officials and their methods of government. - The stations were well-built and attractive , with gardens and with rubber , cotton , and coffee plantations , and the natives seemed on good terms with their rulers . One station at which " foreign visitors had never before been received " was the-headquarters of a district which , it had been recently discovered , was rich in alluvial gold . A mining industry had been started with twenty-one engineers , and prospectors and eight hundred , which all the creeks and rivers carry gold , into nearer touch with the civilized world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lake Albert , and " the first 130 miles were finished in the spring of 1909 . " When completed , Kilo will be only fourteen days distant from the Indian Ocean . While passing through the Congo territory the duke was impressed with the way in which Stanley 's memory was cherished by the natives . Prominent Europeans are designated by his name , " Bulamatari , " breaker of rocks . " The governor and heads of districts are frequently given this name ; I myself was honored with it at times . " The aim of Herbert Ward in " A Voice from the Congo " is to call forth sympathy for his African friends , among whom , while in the Belgian service , he passed the five most impressionable years of his life . The stories which he tells reveal in the native a rare amount of noble devotion and loyalty . Among the interesting men who flit across his pages are Tippoo Tib the great slave-hunter , Stanley , and Capt . Deane , the gallant defender of Stanley Fails against the attack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing , as is the lack of information in regard to the Congo State as it existed in his time , now more than twenty years ago . Some of his anecdotes and observations are trivial and unworthy of publication . The seventy-two illustrations are , many of them , of unusual interest . They include reproductions of photographs of the native , of his implements , and of some remarkable sculptures , one of which , a bronze statue of a Congo chief , won a gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1908 There is also given the music of two native songs . For graphic description of the romantic life and adventures of the hunter after big game , " In Africa , " by John T. McCutcheon , the well-known cartoonist of the Chicago Tribune , can be heartily commended . The object of the expedition , of which he was a member and Mr. Akeley the head , was to obtain specimens for the American Museum of Natural History in New York ; the familiar region of British East Africa , the home of the lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to Col. Roosevelt , who had promised to cooperate in the work ; for a time the two expeditions were joined . The farthest point reached was Mt . Elgon on the Uganda frontier ; the wonderful caverns on its slopes were explored . They have been inhabited from anciert times , " and in places the solid rock was worn smooth and deep by the bare feet of centuries of naked people . " At the end Mr. McCutcheon had a unique adventure . Riding in a carriage drawn by two mules , just outside of Nairobi , the seat of government of the protectorate , he mense males and a female , and pursued them for hours unsuccessfully . In addition to his narrative , he describes with great care the different species of big game which are to be found in this region , and gives much useful information for intending sportsmen . The only criticism which we have to make is that his material has not been wisely edited . CURRENT FICTION . The Barrier . By Rene Bazin . Translated by Mary D. Frost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is professor of law at the University of Anger , and member of the most intellectual society in the world , the French Academy . But he is also a member of that great church which still ? when every tendency of the times makes for the fusion and identification of the divine with the human  --  insists with some vestiges of its ancient power upon the absolute distinction between the spiritual realm and the kingdom of this world . For him , therefore , religion is not the facile bond ' that unites a heterogeneous multitude in church teas , expensive music , and social reform . It is , indeed , the bond of true believers But it is also , as of old , the dividing sword between father and son , and lover and beloved . Within its circle is the warmth of the world ; without , the coldness of an eternal separation . The note of M. Bazin 's novels is a rare spiritual sensitiveness which impresses one as being at once essentially feminine , eminently French , and distinctively Roman Catholic . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a human faculty  --  the sense of religious purity . The hero of the book is Reginald Breynolds , son of an English baronet , who is a political and religious Tory . Reginald , an officer in the army , is a curious latter-day Newman . For - him the question of " the Real Presence in the sacrament , " upon which he has been brooding in the Indian jungle , constitutes " the essence of religion . " He settles the question as did the Cardinal , and thus establishes the barrier between himself and his father . FfiHelen Limerel is a young Frenchman reared in a family nominally Roman Catholic , but in practice entirely worldly , F6licien , after painful struggles , loses his faith and becomes a skeptic . His unbelief constitutes the barrier between him and his cousin , Marie , with whom he is desperately in love . Marie is the type and touchstone of religious purity . She loves , or loved , Ffilicien , but to her marriage is a sacrament to be celebrated only with believers . When Reginald goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pale are powerfully attracted to each other . They refrain from union , however , for the present , out of delicacy for the memory of FeHelen . The book is , of course , an anachronism for those outside the timeless church . It is not necessary to recognize the validity of " the barrier " ; but unless one is interested in the religious questions involved , the story is naught , for the characters are quite insignificant except as they illustrate the plot . Cynthia 's Chauffeur . By Louis Tracy . New York : Edward J. Clode . In the role of hired chauffeur , a young English lord of distinguished military , diplomatic , and scientific attainments conducts an American heiress and her chaperon on an extended trip . This arrangement permits him to dazzle the lady with his knowledge of English history and poetry , to save her from a ducking in the Wye , to protect her from the matrimonial designs of an unscrupulous French count , and to fall in love with her himself ; but the discerning reader will readily see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Cynthia , who is proud and queenly , and who will strive against the dictates of her own heart because it is not seem-y that she should wed her father 's paid servant " However , when Cynthia 's Predilection has been reinforced by a sight of his mansion in Cavendish Square , and my lord in his own titled person has granted satisfaction to the wicked count , and fallen , desperately wounded , on the sands of Calais , the experienced eye sees the way clear to an international alliance . And when , learning of his ensanguined plight , and realizing that she has missed the next train to Calais , Cynthia moans , ' Would I could fly there ! " no reasonable reader can refuse full sanction to her ardor . A year or two more and Mr. Tracy will be able to put an aeroplane at the immediate disposal of similarly placed heroines . For the present he has had to content himself with a motor-car as the vehicle of romance . And never before has the intractable automobile been subdued to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Romance of Inspiration . New York : Harper &; Bros . When , last summer , J. Pierpont Morgan heard that this novel was to be republished , he took occasion to congratulate the publishers : " I consider it , " he wrote , " one of the most helpful books published during these latter years that has come under my cognizance . " Now , what he admires. the book for is its exemplification of " the spirit that should animate human kind in the endeavor to develop civilization through a real cooperation . " This is magnanimous in one whose immense fortune has sprung from competition . But we do not doubt Mr. Morgan 's sincere admiration for a book whose spirit does not seek expression in the embarrassing form of practical thebry . The vague socialism it preaches does not profess to embody itself in any such Utopian scheme as newer writers , from Bellamy to Wells and London , have been wont to offer . Such moral as it has lies in the spectacle of a single disinterested and aspiring life . The hero  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and warm aspiration . The machinery and flavor of his private romance is Trollopeen . He falls in love with a Welsh girl pupil , and runs away from her as soon as he finds that she loves him , because he regards her as his social ( and pecuniary ) superior . His own origin is obscure ; but everything is readily brought out right in the end by the revelation of a very respectable birth and a sufficient inheritance as his due . Where he breaks with the Trollopean tradition is in giving up his birthright to the half-brother who has been brought up in expectation of it . However , he accepts a small competency as his share , and we are comfortably sure that this marriage with the Welsh girl does not entail those material uncertainties on her part which sometimes fall to the lot of those who try to live on terms of cooperation in a world where competition still rules : The book , from its quaintness of method ( for Trollope is already quaint ) , and its fresh , if vague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morgan is justified in believing " that great good will come from an enlarged promulgation of its principles " ; or rather we doubt if such promulgation is likely to result from the present republication . The principles in question may be found in every primer of modern socialism ; and in much modern fiction which is chiefly effective because it is of to-day . Out of Drowning Valley . By S. Carleton Jones . New York : Henry Holt &; Co . Here is a complicated web of adventure woven around the good old theme of a fabulous gold mine . Tlie whole train of breath-taking dangers and narrow escapes is run off with such speed and smoothness , and is related with such a vigorous , convincing plainness of phrase , that the reader has no chance to be either critical or incredulous . Even the obliging landslide , whose strangely opportune intervention saves Scarlett and his boyish sweetheart from death in the flooded cavern , excites unmixed sentiments of admiration and relief . THE SERMON OF THE DEED . Twenty Years at Hull-Hoitse , with Autobiographical Notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York : The Macmillan Co. $2.50 net . " Which is better , " asks Professor Cooley in his " Social Organization , " fellowship or distinction ? There is much to be said on both sides , but the finer spirits of our day lean toward the former , and find it more human and exhilarating to spread abroad the good things the world already has than to prosecute a lonesome search for new ones . I notice among the choicest people I know ? those who seem to me most representative of the inner trend of democracy ? a certain generous contempt for distinction and a passion to cast their lives heartily on the general current . " This penetrating observation is suggested by Miss Jane ' Addams 's new ' book on her life at Hull-House . About a third of the material has previously appeared in the magazines ; but unlike the author 's previous books setting forth conclusions based on her experience , this traces the experiences themselves with the invaluable sidelight emanating from her own early history . Miss Addams was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter of a Hicksite Quaker who , from 1854 to 1870 , was a member of the State Senate , and sufficiently conversant with politics to enjoy the intimate confidence of Lincoln . Her mother died when the future founder of Hull-House was a baby . Despite her physical infirmity  --  a curvature of the spine  --  her childhood was a joyous one . The family was well-to-do , if not prosperous ; there was an ample air of public interest and public spirit stirring in the household circle ; and more than the ordinary heritage of culture . She records that even as a child , her " mind ' was busy , however , with the old question eternally suggested by the inequalities of the human lot " ( p. 14 ) . Like her older sisters before her , Miss Addams went to the seminary , now college , at Rockford , Illinois , one of the earliest schools in the West for the higher education of women , and dubbed , because of affinity of spirit , " The Mount Holyoke of the West . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education for women found in Miss Ad-dams hospitable lodgment , though she records with a bit of waggishness how once upon occasion , in an intercollegiate oratorical contest , she was pitted against no less a competitor than William Jennings Bryan ( p. 55 ) . Her father 's death occurred soon after she left college . Diverted from the professional study of medicine by a long illness , she spent some years in study , and in travel and residence abroad , until Hull-House in Chicago was opened in 1889 . She speaks with an amusing impatience of " the snare of preparation , " and with true feminine relief at the thought that " I had at last finished with the everlasting preparation for life , " however ill-prepared I might be " ( p. 88 ) . The social settlement has become so familiar an institution that an estimate of its nature and functions is less necessary than an insight into the convictions and character of the best known ' of its early founders in this country  --  and this , for the reason that Miss Addams 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere in the United States . The fundamental motive which seems to have actuated her proceeded from her conviction of the utter futility of a detached attainment of moral ? excellence . This root idea she expresses at times negatively in terms of revolt , or at least of reaction , against a premature overdose of individualistic cultivation , " a moral revulsion against this feverish search after culture " ( p. 75 ) . Positively , the same dominant impulse she describes almost passionately as a belief in the supreme moral worth of democracy in social relationships . During the eight years that fell wasted in " the snare of preparation " she " was absolutely at sea so far as any moral purpose was concerned , clinging only to the desire to live in a really living world and refusing to be content with a shadowy intellectual or aesthetic reflection of it " ( p. 64 ) . At times , a note almost bitter against the intellectual surfeiting of college training is sounded ? " lumbering our minds with literature that only served to cloud the really vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or again , when she avers that the " first generation of college women had taken their learning too quickly , had departed too suddenly from the active emotional life led by their grandmothers " . . . had lost that simple almost automatic response to the human appeal " ( p. 71 ) . Her positive attachment to democracy , in the sense of " universal fellowship " in the life-adventure of the race , will appear most clearly if treated conjointly with Miss Addams 's second ruling trait , a curious detachment coupled with skepticism about any system , religion , or panacea which falls short of her dominating idea of " universal fellowship . " She herself ascribes her rejection of the evangelical assault upon her at college as due to her father 's insistence upon " moral integrity " in the forum of conscience as the supreme law of the soul . But some years after , when all outside pressure was withdrawn , she voluntarily was baptized and became a communicant . The recital of the episode is exquisite  --  as " mere literature " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but , while explicit as to the absence of disturbance of soul or strong compunction , she adds this revelatory comment : There was also growing within me an almost passionate devotion to the ideals of democracy , and when in all history had these ideals been so thrillingly expressed as when the faith , of the fisherman and slave had  --  been boldly opposed to the accepted moral belief that the well-being of a privileged few might justly be built upon the ignorance and sacrifice of the many ? ( p. 79 ) . After this one does not wonder that the single-taxer who sought to convert her to his cult by sudden prayer for her in her presence went away sorrowful ( p. 57 ) ; or that she failed to convert herself to Socialism , though she conscientiously made the effort ( p. 186 ) . It is interesting to notice how this underlying conviction and motive determine her attitude  --  and incidentally the attitude of settlement workers so largely  --  upon public issues . Of factory legislation in behalf of the weak , children and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as " it is a general social movement concerning all members of society and not merely a class struggle " ( p. 213 ) , they are in sympathy . For a discriminating State regimentation they stand , for " if certain industrial conditions are forcing workers below the standard of decency , it becomes possible to deduce the right of State regulation " on the ground that " the very existence of the State depends upon the character of its citizens " ( p. 229 ) . There is a ' fortunate sanity of temper and attitude flowing from the ground idea of " universal fellowship " in social relations which , while misrepresented and at times maligned , has kept the settlements close on the track of their quest of social betterment . Even when outbreaks of individual anarchists have driven the proud logicians into panic and grotesque absurdity , the settlement workers , and Miss Addams in particular , have emerged with signal credit . Even their hero-worship has been in a way transfigured by their guiding motive . Miss Addams confesses that , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once purposed to give to young boys of promise , she actually presented Schurz 's " Abraham Lincoln . " Moreover , in retrospect as to " the actual attainment of these early hopes , " she remarks , " so far as they have been realized at all , they seem to have come from men of affairs rather than from those given to speculation " ( p. 193 ) . The various experiments of Hull House , its failures and triumphs , its inner life as well as its outer adtivities , are all set forth engagingly in this volume , with a surprising modesty as regards general scientific conclusions such as the professional sociologist would expect . Miss Addams has generally a direct way of putting things , and an enjoyment of humorous by-products . Occasionally , however , there is a note of wistful pathos ? " the sense of universality thus imparted to that mysterious injustice , the burden of which we are all forced to bear and with which I have become only too familiar " ( p. 27 ) . Miss Addams 's narration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tol stoyism , will be of particular interest at this juncture . The prophet in his peasant 's garb glanced disapprovingly at her large sleeves which were then in vogue , and , " pulling out one sleeve to an interminable breadth , said quite simply that ' there was enough stuff on one arm to make a frock for a little girl ' ( p. 268 ) . He would have said something similar about an historic alabaster box of ointment . Miss Addams is fortunate in her illustrator . There are an arresting power and a suggestive charm about some of the plates that entitle the artist to distinction . The Literature of the South . By Montrose J. Moses . New York : Thomas Y. Crowell 07 . Co. $2.50 net . It is significant  --  and ominous  --  that the recognized authorities on American and , more especially , on Southern literature have carefully refrained from attempting any such elaborate history of southern literature as this well-printed volume is designed to be . Why they have refrained is quite apparent after one has read the present book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has brought together a mass of more or less valuable material , including a useful bibliography of twenty-four pages . His general point of view , which implies the treatment of literature as the product of social conditions , is admirable in principle . His judicial attitude toward such creative Southern literature as he can discover is praiseworthy . He is capable of warm , yet not undue , appreciation , as is shown in his sympathetic and pleasing chapter on the poets of the civil war . Yet one closes the volume with the conviction that the work was scarcely worth while , unless it was the writer 's purpose to put it beyond all doubt that the literature of the South possesses as a whole insufficient esthetic value to merit elaborate treatment apart from the general body of American literature . As a matter of fact , Mr. Moses does not seem to meet a single one of the conditions entailed by his historical point of view . He often fails to give definite and well-ordered facts just where they are most needed ( e. g , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perplexed though honestly inquiring reader lays down the volume knowing little more in the way of detailed knowledge than when he took it up . Again , the statement of causes in the form of " social forces " is neither clear nor succinct . Finally , owing partly to poor arrangement of material , Mr. Moses fails , in our judgment , to establish the connection between his causes and his results . ? To illustrate these defects is an easy task . Although one-third of the book is taken up with a consideration of the socoal conditions that are supposed to have produced Southern books and writers , the author is continually driven to acknowledge the extreme poverty of the resulting literature . The chapters on the Colonial period , amounting to eight ty-seven pages , close with the anticlimactic admission that the period " produced nothing large in the South " ; and that , so far as concerns the authors , " As Englishmen they came to see and as Englishmen they wrote " ( pp. 86-87 ) . The twelve pages devoted to Jefferson ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is true of the treatment accorded to the South Carolina statesmen and to the orators of the civil war . Worse still , one is first astonished . then wearied , with the analysis of social conditions in the " New South . " All this may belong to a treatise on present-day economics , but it seems sadly out of place in a history of literature . And when at last Mr. Moses actually abandons his judicial point of view and descends into the arena to do battle for his own opinions as against those of Mr. Cable ( p. 435 ) and Mr. Dubois ( p. 445 ) , the reader 's patience almost comes to an end . This result would have been avoided in part if the writer had not massed and distributed his material so carelessly . Irrelevant matter is everywhere , and even misleading chapter headings are not lacking . For example , Chapter vi , Revolutionary Literature ( pp. 142159 ) , has for its sole sub-heading Poetry and Poets , although the first twelve pages of the chapter treat writers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal in every other case solely with social conditions , Chapter xiii ( pp. 295338 ) devotes its last thirteen pages to specific literary criticism . And why is Lanier placed in the civil-war period ? Superfluous digressions such as that on William and Mary College ( p. 140 ) ; irrelevancies , such as the gentle admonition to Miss Glasgow ( p. 463 ) ; inconsistencies , such as the including of Poe ( Chapter xii ) after he has been ruled out by definition , abound throughout the book . Faulty structure , in conclusion , is supplemented by a worse than faulty style . Obscurity , turgidity , incoherence in sentence structure , and violations of usage occur in scores of passages . We are told , for example , that " We glean of Jefferson 's position through his own writing , through the opinions of others " ( p. 142 ) . A hundred pages later we have the phrase , " redolent witfo savage uncouthness " ( p. 240 ) . Farther on we encounter such jargon as the following : " This digression from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at the conclusion that democratization , as it applies to literature , virtually means a deepening realization of social and economic contures into this field ( cf. Nation , Vol. xc , p. 189 ) ; but it would be invidious to multiply instances . Two recent works have either escaped Mr. Lang 's observation or have appeared since his book went to press . One is the admirable summary and dismissal of the Homeric question in the introductory chapter of Mr. Mackail 's " Lectures on Greek Poetry . " The other is Dr. Molder 's portentous volume on " Die Bias and ihre Quellen , " received with much applause in Germany . This book goes far to show that the Homeric question will remain a permanent phenomenon of pathological psychology . Milder rejects as futile the past literature of disintegration and proclaims his belief in a real Homer . He then , with a sudden volte-face , reinstates the banished scholasticism and all its vicious methods by an attempt to demonstrate the precise way in which Homer worked up his material . For an illustration : when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone from the hand of Patroclus , falls headlong from his char- , iot , Patroclus mockingly compares him to a man diving for " oysters . " Minder 's critical flair detects here " what no scholar has ever observed before " : the oysters , we are gravely told , are the charioteer 's eyes , which he dives after as they he on the ground , and Homer , working over the old story of the last battle of Patroclus , introduces the irrational use of a big stone as a weapon solely in order to knock out the eyes and so " place " his own special , original contribution , this horrid Teutonic apergu . This , we think , fixes the high-water mark of Homeric philology . Mulder has " left no hyperbole for his successors , " as Isocrates would put it . Mr. Lang may do justice to Mulder in his next book . We can only echo the schoolboy who translated ' n Jy.5=- ? by " 0 my eye !

It is a refreshment to discover that the author of these letters learned enough of the colloquial tongue to make the greater part of her trip through China without an interpreter . For a period of eighteen months , she lived in or wandered about the great triangle ' defined by the cities of Peking , Ch'entu , and Hangchow , visiting the Yangtse region and parts of three northern provinces , but leaving untouched the southern half of China proper . This itinerary does not perfectly satisfy the implication of the title that the author saw the whole Empire , but she at least refrains from those dangerous generalizations which spoil the accounts of many travellers . The reader who goes astray by applymg what she says to the people of the South has himself to blame , for she tells us nothing of how that other half lives . The style is sufficiently fresh , and an occasional quaint phrase lifts her narrative above the level of monotony : at Shanghai the river " consists half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a street in Kum .

" The main impression which the author conveys is not , however , one of humorous portrayal ; she emphasizes , rather , her sober interest in the land which she has come to study , and gets , on the whole , little fun out of the discomforts of travel .

More than four thousand students are trained in the new learning in this city alone .
