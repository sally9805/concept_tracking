THIRTY-FIVE years ago the impulse which has since been organized as the Zionist Movement led my parents to leave their homes in Roumania and emigrate to Palestine , where they joined a number of other Jewish pioneers in founding Zicron-Jacob ? a little village lying just south of Mount Cannel , in that fertile coastal region close to the ancient Plains of Armageddon . Here I was born ; my childhood was passed here in the peace and harmony of this little agricultural community , with its whitewashed stone houses huddled close together for protection against the native Arabs who , at first , menaced the life of the new colony.The village was far more suggestive of Switzerland than of the conventional , slovenly villages of the East , mud-built and filthy ; for while it was the purpose of our people , in returning to the Holy Land , to foster the Jewish language and the social conditions of the Old Testament as far as possible , there was The title of this personal narrative , meaning , Our swords are ' red , 0 Sultan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Jew from Palestine , who has lived some years in America , and has been a close observer of American life , character , and language . ? THE EDITORS . VOL. 118-NO. 2 nothing retrograde in this movement . No time was lost in introducing progressive methods of agriculture , and the climatological experiments of other countries were observed and made use of in developing the ample natural resources of the land . Eucalyptus , imported from Australia , soon gave the shade of its cool , healthful foliage where previously no trees had grown . In the course of time dry farming ( which some people consider a recent discovery , but which in reality is as old as the Old Testament ) was introduced and extended with American agricultural implements ; blooded cattle were imported , and poultry-raising on a large scale was undertaken with the aid of incubators ? to the disgust of the Arabs , who look on such usurpation of the hen 's functions as against nature and sinful . Our people replaced the wretched native trails with good roads , bordered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with downy little yellow blossoms that smelled sweeter than honey when the sun was on them . More important than all these , a communistic village government was established , in which both sexes enjoyed equal rights , including that of suffrage ? strange as this may seem to persons who ( when they think of the matter at all ) form vague conceptions of all the women-folk of Palestine as shut up in harems . A short experience with Turkis41 courts and Turkish justice taught our people that they would have to establish a legal system of their own . Two collaborating judges were therefore appointed  --  one to interpret the Mosaic law , another to temper it with modern jurisprudence . All Jewish disputes were settled by this court . Its effective-mss may be judged by the fact that the Arabs , weary of Turkish venality ,  --  as open and shameless as anywhere in the world , ? began in increasing numbers to bring their difficulties to our tribunal . Jews are law-abiding people , and life in those Palestine colonies tended to bring out the fraternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that in over thirty years not one Jewish criminal case was reported from forty-five villages . Zicron-Jacob was a little town of 130 fires ' ? so we call it ? when , in 1910 , on the advice of my elder brother , who was chief of the Jewish Experiment Station at Athlit , an ancient town of the Crusaders , I left for America to enter the service of the United States Department of Agriculture . A few days after reaching this country I took out my first naturalization papers and then proceeded to Washington , where I became a part of that great government service whose beneficent activity is too little known by Americans . Here I remained until June , 1913 , when I re- ned to Palestine with the object of taking motion-pictures and stereopticon views . These I intended to use in a lecturing tour for spreading the Zionist propaganda in the United States . During the years of my residence in America I was able to appreciate and judge at their right value the beauty and inspiration of the life which mypeople led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw better the need of organization among our communities , and I determined to build up a fraternal union of the young Jewish men all over the country . Two months after my return from America , an event occurred which gave impetus to these projects . The physician of our village , an old man who had devoted his entire life to serving and healing the people of Palestine , without distinction of race or religion , was driving home one evening in his carriage from a neighboring settlement . With him was a young girl of sixteen . In a deserted place they were set upon by four armed Arabs , who beat the old man to unconsciousness as he tried , in vain , to defend the girl from the terrible fate which awaited her . Night came on . Alarmed by the absence of the physician , we young men rode out in search of him . We finally discovered what had happened ; and then and there , in the serene moonlight of that Eastern night , I made my comrades take oath on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong society for the defense of the life and honor of our villagers and our people at large . II These details are , perhaps , useful for the better understanding of the disturbances that came thick and fast when in August , 1914 , the war-madness broke out among the nations of Europe . The repercussion was at once felt even in our remote corner of the earth . Soon after the German invasion of Belgium the Turkish army was mobilized and all citizens of the Empire between 19 and 45 years were called to the colors . As the Young Turk Constitution of 1909 provided that . all Christians and Jews were equally liable to military service , our young men knew that they , too , would be called on to make the common sacrifice . For the most part , they were not unw.lhn to sustain the ( Turkish government . While the Con- ; ; stitution imposed on t m the burden of militarism , it had brought with it the compensation of freedom of religion and equal rights ; and we could not forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the Jews who fled ' from the Spanish Inquisition and similar ministrations of other civilized countries Of course , we never d earned that Turkey would do anything but remain neutral . If we had had any idea of the turn things were ultimately to take , we should have given a different greeting to the rnouchtar , or sheriff , who came to our village with the list of mobilizable men to be called on for service . My own position was a curious one . I had every intention of completing the process of becoming an American citizen , which I had egun by taking out ' first papers . ' n the eyes of the law , however , I was still a Turkish subject , with no claim to American protection . This was sneeringly pointed out to me by the American consul at Haifa , who happens to be a German ; so there was no other course but to surrender myself to the Turkish government ) There was no question as to my eligibility for service . I was young and strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical examination of Turkish recruits is a farce . The enlisting officers have a theory of their own that no man is really unfit for the army ? a theory which has been fostered by the ingenious devices of the Arabs to avoid conscription . To these wild people the protracted discipline of military training is simply a purgatory , and for weeks before the recruiting officers are due , they dose themselves with powerful herbs and physics , and fast , and nurse sores into being , until they are ina really deplorable condition . Some of them go so far as to cut off a finger or two . The officers , however , have learned to see beyond these little tricks , and few Arabs succeed in wriggling through their drag-net . I have seen dozens of them brought in to the recruiting office on camels or horses , so weak were they , and welcomed into the service with a severe beating ? sick and shammers sharing the same fate . Thus it often happens that some of the new recruits die after their first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I presented myself at the recruiting station at Ace() ( the St. Jean d'Acre of history ) . We had been given to understand that , once our names were registered , we should be allowed to return home to provide ourselves with money , suitable clothing , and food , as well as to hid our families good-bye . To our astonishment , however , we were marched off to the Ilan , or caravanserai , and locked into t he great courtyard with hundreds of dirty Arabs . Hour after hour passed ; darkness came , and finally we had to stretch ourselves on the ground and make the best of a had situation . It was a night of horrors . Few of us had closed an eye when , at dawn , an officer appeared and ordered us out of the Han . From our total number , about three hundred ( including four young men from our village and myself ) were picked out and told to make ready to start at once for Saffad ? a town in the hills of northern Galilee near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be located . No attention was paid to our requests that we be allowed to return to our homes for a final visit . That same morning we were on our way to SOCA  --  a motley , disgruntled crew . It was a four days ' march ? four days of heat and dust and physical suffering . The September sun smote us mercilessly as we straggled along the 4 SAIFNA AHMAR , YA SULTAN ! miserable native trail , full of gullies and loose stones . It would not have been so had if we had been adequately shod or clothed ; but soon we found ourselves envying the ragged Arabs as they trudged along barefoot , paying no heed to the jagged flints . ( Shoes , to the Arab , are articles for ceremonious indoor use ; when any serious walking is to be done , he takes them off , slings them over his shoulder , and trusts to the horny soles of his feet . ) To add to our troubles , the Turkish officers , with characteristic fatalism , had made no commissary provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be purchased by the roadside from our own funds , which were scant enough to start with . The Arabs were in a terrible plight . Most of them were penniless , and , as the pangs of hunger set in , they began pillaging right and left from the little farms by the wayside . From modest beginnings ( poultry and vegetables ) they progressed to larger game , unhindered by the officers . Houses were entered , women insulted ; again and again I saw a stray horse , grazing by the roadside , seized by a crowd of grinning Arabs , who piled on the poor beast 's back until he was almost crushed to earth , and rode off triumphantly , while their comrades held back the weeping owner . As the result of this sort of ' requisitioning , ' our band of recruits was followed by an increasing throng of farmers ? imploring , threatening , trying by hook or by crook to win back the stolen goods . Little satisfaction did they get , although some of them went with us as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor has it an inviting reputation . Lord Kitchener himself has good reason to remember it . As a young lieutenant of twenty-three , in the Royal Engineering Corps , he was nearly killed there by a band of fanatical Arabs whilesurveying for the Palestine Exploration Fund . Kitchener had a narrow escape of it ( one of his fellow officers was shot dead close by him ) , but he went calmly ahead and completed his maps ? splendid large-scale affairs which have never since been equaled ? and which are now in use by the Turkish and German armies ! However , although Saffed combines most of the unpleasant characteristics of Palestine native towns , we welcomed the sight of it , for we were used up by the march . An old deserted mosque was given us for barracks ; there , on the bare stone floor , in close-packed promiscuity , too tired to react to filth and vermin , we spent our first night as soldiers of the Sultan , while the milky moonlight streamed in through every chink and aperture , and bats flitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next morning we were routed out at five . The black depths of the well in the centre of the mosque courtyard provided doubtful water for washing , bathing and drinking ; then came breakfast , ? our first government meal , ? consisting , simply enough , of boiled rice , which was ladled out into tin washbasins holding rations for ten men . In true Eastern fashion we squatted down round the basin and dug into the rice with our fingers . At first I was rather upset by this sort of table manners , and for some time I ate with my eyes fixed on my own portion , to avoid seeing the Arabs , who fill the palms of their hands with rice , pat it into a ball , and cram it into their mouths just so , the bolus making a great lump in their lean throats as it reluctantly descends . In the course of that same morning we were allotted our uniforms . The Turkish uniform , under indirect German influence , has been greatly modified during the past five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British Army , and of conventional European cut . Spiral puttees and good boots are provided ; the only peculiar feature is the headgear ? a curious , uncouth-looking combination of the turban and German helmet , devised by Enver Pasha to combine religion and practicality , and called in his honor enverieh : ( With commendable thrift , Enver patented his invention , and it is rumored that he has drawn a comfortable fortune from its sale . ) An excellent uniform it is , on the whole ; but , to our disgust , we found that in the great olive-drab pile to which we were led , there was not a single new one . All were old , discarded , and dirty , and the mere thought of putting on the clothes of some unknown Arab legionary , who , perhaps , had died of cholera at Mecca or Yemen , made me shudder . After some indecision , my friends and I finally went up to one of the officers and offered to buy new uniforms with the money we expected daily from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little private profit , gave his consent . The days and weeks following were busy ones . From morning till night , it was drill , drill , and again drill . We were divided into groups of fifty , each of which was put in charge of a young non-commissioned officer from the Military School of Constantinople or Damascus , or of some Arab who had seen several years ' service . These instructors had a hard time of it ; the German military system , which had only recently been introduced , was too much for them . They kept mixing up the old and the new methods of training , with the result that it was often hopeless to try and make out their orders . Whole weeks were spent in grinding into the Arabs the names of the different parts of the rifle ; weeks more went to teaching them to clean it ? although it must be said that , once they had masteredthese technicalities , they were excellent shots . Their efficiency would have been considerably greater if there had been more target-shooting . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a scarcity of ammunition . This shortage the drill-masters , in a spirit of compensation , attempted to make up by abundant severity . The whip of soft , flexible , stinging leather , which seldom leaves the Turkish officer 's hand , was never idle . This was not surprising , for the Arab is a cunning fellow , whose only respect is for brute force . Ile exercises it himself over every possible victim , and expects the same treatment from his superiors . So far as my comrades and I were concerned , I must admit that we were generally treated kindly . We knew most of the drill-exercises from the gymnastic training we had practiced since childhood , and the officers realized that we were educated and came from respectable families . The same was also true with regard to the native Christians , most of whom can read and write and are of a better class than the Mohammedans of the country . When Turkey threw in her lot with the Germanic powers , the attitude toward Jews and Christians changed radically : but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard life we led while in training at Saffed ; evening would find us dead tired , and little disposed for anything but res As the tremendous light-play of the Eastern sunsets faded away , we would gather in little groups in the courtyard of our mosque ? its minaret towering black against a turquoise sky ? and talk fitfully of the little happenings of the day , while the Arabs murmured gutturally around us . Occasionally , one of them would burst into a quavering , hot-blooded tribal love-song . It happened that I was fairly well-known among these natives through my horse Koch ba ? of pure Maneghi-Sbeli blood ? which I had purchased from some Al ) azzi Bedouins who were encamped near Aleppo : a swift and intelligent animal he was , winner of many races , and in a land where a horse is considerably more valuable than a wife , his ownership cast quite a glamour over me . In the evenings , then , the Arabs would come up to chat . As they speak seldom of their children , of their women-folk never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the weather , or to the recitation of never-ending tales of Abou-Zeid , the famous hero of the Beni-Hilal , or of Antar the glorious . Politics , of which they have amazing ideas , also came in for discussion . Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Victoria are still living figures to them ; but ( significantly enough ) they considered the Kaiser king of all the kin , s ? 5 ; world , with the exception of the Sultan , whom they admitted to equality . Seldom did an evening pass without a dance . As darkness fell , the Arabs would gather in a great circle round one of their comrades , who squatted on the ground with a bamboo flute ; to a weird minor music they would begin swaying and moving round while some self-chosen poet among them sang impromptu verses to the flute obbligato . As a rule the themes were homely . To-morrow we shall eat rice and meat , ' the singer would wail . Yaha lili-amali ' ( my endeavor be granted ) , would come the full-throated response of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singer would indulge in pointed personalities , with answering roars of laughter . These dances lasted for hours , and as they progressed the men gradually worked themselves into a frenzy , I never failed to wonder at these people , who , without the aid of alcohol , could reproduce the various stages of intoxication . As I lay by and watched the moon riding serenely above the frantic men and their twisting black shadows , I reflected that they were just in the condition when one word from a holy man would suffice to send them off to wholesale murder and rapine . It was my good fortune soon to be released from the noise and dirt of the mosque . I had had experience with corruptible Turkish officers ; and one day , when barrack conditions became unendurable , I went to the officer commanding our division  --  an old Arab from Latakieh who had been called from retirement at the time of the mobilization . He lived in a little tent near the mosque , where I found him squatting on the floor , nodding drowsily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old regime , I entered boldly , squatted beside him , and told him my troubles . The answer came with an enormous shrug of the shoulders . ( You are serving the Sultan . Hard-ship should be sweet ! ' ' I should be more fit to serve him if I got more sleep and rest . ' - He waved a fat hand about the tent . Look at me ! Here I am , an officer of rank and ' ? shooting a knowing look at me -- - I have not even a nice blanket . ' ' A crime ! A crime ! ' I interrupted . " Po think of it , when I , a humble soldier , have dozens of them at home ! I should be honored if you would allow me ? ' My voice trailed off suggestively . How could you get one ? ' he asked . Oh , I have friends here in Saffed ; but I must be able to sleep in a nice place . ' ' Of course ; certainly . What would you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do , ' I replied . More amenities were exchanged , the upshot of which was that my four friends and I were given permission to sleep at the inn ? a humble place , but infinitely better than the mosque . It was all perfectly simple . IV So passed the days of our training , ? swiftly , monotonously , ? until the fateful December morning when news came like a thunderbolt that Turkey was about to join hands with Germany . We had had reports of the war ? of a kind . Copies of telegrams from Constantinople , printed in Arabic , were circulated among us , giving accounts of endless German victories . These , however , we had laughed at as fabrications of a Prussophile press agency , and in our skepticism we had failed to give the Teutons credit for the successes they had actually won . To us , born and bred in the East as we were , the success of the German propaganda in the Turkish Empire could not come as an overwhelming surprise ; but its fullness amazed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words here regarding this propaganda as I had seen it in Palestine , spreading under strong and efficient organization for twenty years . In order to realize her imperialistic dreams , Germany absolutely needed Palestine . It was the key to the whole Oriental situation . No mere coincidence brought the to Damascus in November , 1898 , same month that Kitchener , in London , was hailed as Gordon 's avenger , ? when he uttered his famous phrase at the tomb of Saladin : ( yell the three hundred million Moslem of the world that I am their friend ! ' We have all seen photographs of the imperial figure , draped in an amazing burnous of his own designing ( above which the Prussian pickelhaube rises supreme ) , as he moved from point to point in this portentous visit . We may also have seen Caran d'Ache 's celebrated cartoon ( a subject of diplomatic correspondence ) representing this same imperial figure , in its Oriental toggery , riding into Jerusalem on an ass . The nations of Europe laughed at this visit and its transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which won for the Germans the concessions for the Konia-Bagdad Railway , and made them owners of t he double valley of the Euphrates and Tigris . Through branch lines projected through the Fir-man , they are practically in control of both the Syrian routes toward the ( ) Triode Mediterranean and the Lebanon valleys . They also control the three Armenian routes of Cappadocia , the Black Sea , and the trans-Caucasian branch of Urfa , Marach , and Mar-dine . ( The fall of Erzerum has altered conditions respecting this last . ) They dominate the Persian routes toward Tauris and Teheran as well ; and last , but not least , the Gulf branch of Zobeir . These railways delivered into German hands the control of Persia , whence the road to India may be made easy : through Syria lies the route to the Suez Canal and Egypt , which was used in February , 1915 , and will probably be used again this year . To make this Oriental dream a reality , the Germans have not relied on their railway concessions alone . Their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Palestine . Scattered all over the country are German mills that half of the time have nothing to grind . German hotels have been opened in places seldom frequented by tourists . German engineers appeared in force , surveying , sounding , noting . All these colonists held gatherings in the Arab villages , when the ignorant natives were told of the greatness of Germany , of her good intentions , and of the evil machinations of other powers . What I state here can be corroborated by any one who knows Palestine and has lived in it . About the time when we first knew that Turkey would join the Germanic powers came the news that the ' capitulations ' had been revoked . As is generally known , foreigners formerly enjoyed the protection of their respective consuls . The Turkish government had no jurisdiction over an American , for instance , or a Frenchman , who could not be arrested without the consent of his consul . In the Ottoman Empire ? where law and justice are not at a premium ? such protection , known as capitulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of the ' capitulations ' was a terrible blow to all the Europeans , meaning , as it did , the practical surrender of all rights . Upon the Arabs it acted like an intoxicant . Every bootblack or boatman felt that he was the equal of the accursed ' Frank , ' who now had no consul to protect him ; and abuses began immediately . Moreover , as if by magic , the whole country became Germanized . In all the mosques Friday prayers were ended with an invocation for the welfare of the Sultan and Had ji G eel iotin . " The significance of this lies in the fact that the title ' Hadji ' can be properly applied only to a Moslem who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca and kissed the sacred stone of the Kaaba . Instant death is the penalty paid by any Christian who is found within that enclosure ; yet Wilhelm II , head of the Lutheran faith , steps forward as Hadji Geelioun . ' His pictures were sold everywhere ; German officers appeared ; and it seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant figure of this move- ment in Palestine was , without doubt , the German consul at Haifa . He traveled about the country , making speeches , and distributing pamphlets in Arabic , in which it was elaborately proved that Germans are not Christians , like the French or English , but that they are descendants of the prophet Mohammed . Passages from the Koran were quoted , prophesying the coming of the Kaiser as the savior of Islam . The news of the actual declaration of war by Turkey caused a tremendous stir in our regiment . The prevailing feeling was one of great restlessness and discontent.Ve Arabs made many bit-ter remarks gainst Germany . Why did n't she help us against the Italians during the War for Tripoli ? ' they said . Now that she is in trouble she is drawing us into the fight . ' ) Their opinions , however , soon underwthit a change . In the first place , they came to realize that Turkey had taken up arms against Russia ; and Russia is considered first and foremost the arch-enemy . German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They began to grow boastful and arrogant ; and the sight of the plundering of Europeans , Jews , and Christians convinced them that a very desirable regime was setting in . Saff6d has a large Jewish colony , and it was torment for me to have to witness the outrages that my people suffered in the name of ' requisitioning . ' The final blow came one morning when all the Jewish and Christian soldiers of our regiment were called out and told that henceforth they were to serve in the taboor amlieh , or working corps . The object of this action , plainly enough , was to conciliate and flatter the Mohammedan population , and at the same time to put the Jews and Christians , who for the most part fay- ored the cause of the Allies , in a position where they would be least dangerous . We were disarmed ; our uniforms were taken away , and we became hard-driven ' gangsters . ' I shall never forget the humiliation of that day when we , who , after all , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work of pushing wheelbarrows and handling spades , by grinning Arabs , rifle on shoulder . We were set to building the road between Saffed and Tiberias , on the Sea of Galilee ? a link in the military highway from Damascus to the coast , which would be used for the movement of troops in case the railroad should be cut off . It had no immediate strategic bearing on the attack on Suez , however . From six in the morning till seven at night we were hard at it , except for one hour 's rest at noon . While we had money , it was possible to get some slight relief by bribing our task-masters ; but this soon came to an end , and we had to endure their brutality as best we could . The wheelbarrows we used were the property of a French company which , before the war , was undertaking a highway to Beirut . No grease was provided for the wheels , so that there was a maddening squeaking and squealing in addition to the difficulty of pushing the barrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the wheels were not greased the axles would be burned out . He agreed with me , and issued an order that the men were to provide their own oil to lubricate the wheels ! I shall not dwell on the physical sufferings we underwent while working on this road , for the reason that the conditions I have described were prevalent over the whole country ; and later , when I had the opportunity to visit some construction camps in Samaria and Judaea , I found that in comparison our lot had been a happy one . While we were breaking stones and trundling squeaking wheelbarrows , however , the most disquieting rumors began to drift in to us from our home villages . Plundering had been going on in the name of ' requisitioning ' ; the country was full of soldiery whose capacity for mischief-making was well known to us , and it was torture to think of what might be happening in our peaceful homes where so few men had been left for protection . All the barbed-wire fences , we heard , had been torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a wild land like Palestine , where the native has no respect for property , where fields and crops are always at the mercy of marauders , the barbed-wire fence has been a tremendous factor for civilization , and with these gone the Arabs were once more free to sweep across country unhindered , stealing and destroying . The situation grew more and more unbearable . One day a little Christian soldier ? a Nazarene ? disappeared from the ranks . We never saw him again , but we learned that his sister , a very young girl , had been forcibly taken by a Turkish officer of the Nazareth garrison . In Palestine , the dishonor of a girl can be redeemed by blood alone . The young soldier had hunted for his sister , found her in the barracks , and shot her ; he then surrendered himself to the military authorities , who undoubtedly put him to death . Ho had not dared to kill the real criminal , ? the officer , ? for he knew that this would not only bring death to his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians of Nazareth . When I learned of this tragedy , I determined to get out of the army and return to my village at all costs . Nine Turkish officers out of ten can be bought , and I had reason to know that the officer in command at Saffed was not that tenth man . Now , according to the law of the country , a man has the right to purchase exemption from military service for a sum equivalent to two hundred dollars . My case was different , for I was already enrolled ; but everything is possible in Turkey . I set to work , and in less than two weeks I had bought half a dozen officers , ranging from corporal to captain , and had obtained consent of the higher authorities to my departure , provided I could get a physician 's certificate declaring me unfit for service . This was arranged in short order , although I am healthy-looking and the doctor found some difficulty in hitting on an appropriate ailment . Finally he decided that I had too much blood ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I paid the regular price of two hundred dollars from the funds which had been sent : me by my family , and walked out of the barracks a free man . My happiness was mingled with sadness at the thought of leaving the comrades with whom I had suffered and hoped . The four boys from my village were splendid . They felt that I was right in going home to do what I could for the people ; but when they kissed me good-bye , in Eastern fashion , the tears were running down their cheeks ; and they were all strong , brave fellows . On my way back to Zieron-Jacob , I passed through t he town of Sheframr , where I got a foretaste of the conditions I was to find at home . A Turkish soldier , sauntering along the street , helped himself to fruit from the basket of an old vender , and went on without offering to pay a farthing . When the old man ventured to protest , the soldier turned like a flash and began beating him mercilessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bleeding , and covered with the mud of the streets . There was a hubbub ; a crowd formed , through which a Turkish officer forced his way , demanding explanations . The soldier sketched the situation in a few words , whereupon the officer , turning to the old man , said impressively , ' If a soldier of the Sultan should choose to heap filth on your head , it is for you to kiss his hand in gratitude . ' VI When I finally reached Zieron-Jacob , I found rather a sad state of affairs . Military law had been declared . No one was supposed to be seen in the streets after sundown . The village was full of soldiers , and civilians had to put up with all kinds of ill-treatment . Moreover , our people were in a state of great excitement because an order had recently come from the Turkish authorities bidding them surrender whatever firearms or weapons they had in their possession . A sinister command , this ; we knew that similar measures had been taken before the terrible Armenian massacres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparation for our people . With the arms gone , the head men of the village knew that our last hold over the Arabs , our last recourse for defense against sudden violence would be gone , and they had refused to give them up . A house-tohouse search had been made ? fruitlessly , for our little arsenal was safely cached in a field , beneath growing grain . It was a tense , unpleasant situation . At any time the Turks might decide to back up their demand by some of the violent methods of which they are past masters . A family council was held in my home , and it was decided to send my sister , a girl of twenty-three , to some friends at the American Syrian Protestant College at Beirut , so that we might be able to move freely without the responsibility of having a girl at home , in a country where , as a matter of course , the women-folk are seized and carried off before a massacre . At Beirut we knew that there was an American consul-general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor for the protection of American interests . My sister got away none too soon . One evening just after her departure , as I was standing in the doorway of our house watching the ever-fresh miracle of the Eastern sunset , a Turkish officer rode clown the street with about thirty cavalrymen . He called inc out and ordered me to follow him to the little village inn , where he dismounted and led me to one of the inner rooms , his spurs jingling loudly as we passed along the stone corridor . I never knew whether I had been selected for this attention because of my prominence as a leader of the Jewish young men or simply because I had been standing conveniently in the doorway . The officer closed the door and came straight to the point by asking me where our store of arms was hidden . Ile was a big fellow , with the handsome , cruel features usual enough in his class . There was no open menace in his first question . When I refused to telhhim , he began wheedling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Then , all of a sudden , he whipped out a revolver and stuck the muzzle right in my face . I felt the blood leave my heart , but I was able to control myself and refuse his demand . The officer was not easily discouraged ; the hours I passed in that little room , with its smoky kerosene lamp , were terrible ones . I realized , however , how tremendously important the question of the arms was , and strength was given me to hold out until the officer gave up in disgust and let me go home . My father knew nothing of what had happened , but the rest of my family were tremendously excited . I made light of the whole affair , but I felt sure that this was only the beginning . Sure enough , next morning ? the Sabbath ? the same officer returned and put three of the leading elders of the village , together with myself , under arrest . After another fruitless inquisition at the hotel , we were handcuffed and started on foot toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little procession passed my home , my father , who was aged and feeble , came tottering forward to say good-bye to me . A soldier pushed him roughly back ; he reeled , then fell full-length in the street before my eyes . It was a dismal departure . We were driven through t be st reets shackled like criminals , and the women and children came out of the houses and watched us in silence ? their heads bowed , tears running clown their checks . They realized that for thirty-five years these old men , my comrades , had been struggling and suffering for their ideal ? a regenerated Palestine ; now , in the dusk of their life , it seemed as if all their hopes and dreams were coming to ruin . The oppressive tragedy of t he sit uat ion settled down on me more and more heavily as the day wore on and heat and fatigue told on my companions . My feelings must have been written large on my face , for one of them , a fine-looking patriarch , tried to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon strength of arms , and that our spirit could never be broken , no matter how defenseless we were . Thus he , an old man , was encouraging me instead of receiving help from my youth and enthusiasm . At last we arrived at the prison and were locked into separate cells . That same night we were tortured with the falogy , or bast inado . The victim of this horrible punishment is trussed up , arms and legs , and thrown on his knees ; then , on his bare soles , a pliant green 1C2 SAIFNA AHMAR , YA SULTAN ! rod is brought down with all the force of a soldier 's arm . The pain is exquisite ; blood spurts at the first cut , and strong men usually faint after thirty or forty strokes . Strange to say , the worst part of it is not the blow itself , but the whistling of the rod through the air as it rushes to its mark . The groans of my older comrades , whose gasps and prayers I could hear through the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciousness mercifully came to t he rescue . For several clays more we were kept in t he prison , sick and broken with suffering . The second night , as I lay sleepless and desperate on the strip of dirty matting that served as bed , I heard a scratch-scratching at the grated slit of a window , and presently a slender stick was inserted into the cell . I went over and shook it ; some one at the other end was holding it firm . And then a curious whispering sound began to come from the end of the stick . I put my ear down , and caught the voice of one of the men from our village . He had taken a long bamboo pole , pierced the joints , and crept up behind a broken old wall close beneath my window . By means of this primitive telephone we talked as long as we dared . I assured him that we were still enduring , and urged him on no account to give up the arms to the Turkish authorities ? not even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found that torture and imprisonment would not make us yield our secret , the Turks resorted to the final test ? the ordeal which we could not withstand . They announced that on a certain date a number of our young girls would be carried off and handed over to the officers , to be kept until the arms were disclosed . We knew that they were capable of carrying out this threat ; we knew exactly what it meant . There was no alternative . The people of our village had nothing to do but dig up the treasured arms and , with broken hearts , hand them over to the authorities . And so the terrible news was brought to us one morning that we were free . Personally , I felt much happier on the day I was put in prison than when I was released . I had often wondered how our people had been able to bear the rack and thumbscrew of the Spanish Inquisition ; but when my turn and my comrades ' came for torture , I realized that the same spirit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that our suffering had been useless . Whenever the Turkish authorities wished , the horrors of the Armenian massacres would live again in Zicron-Jacob , and we would be powerless to raise a hand to protect ourselves . As we came limping home through the streets of our village , I caught sight of my own Smith and Wesson revolver in the hands of a mere boy of fifteen ? the son of a well-known Arab outlaw . I realized then that the Turks had not only taken our weapons , but had distributed them among the natives in order to complete our humiliation . The blood rushed to my face . I started forward to take the revolver away from the boy , but one of the old men caught hold of my sleeve and held me back .
