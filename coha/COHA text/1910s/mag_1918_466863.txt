HAVE already men-tioned in these papers 7 that I was one of the examiners for the Span-ish Taylorian scholar-ship at Oxford in 1883 , and again in 1888 . But perhaps before I go further in these Recollections I may put down here ? somewhat out of its place ? a reminis-cence connected with the first of these examinations , which seems to me worth recording . My Spanish colleague in 18S8 was , as I have said , Don Pascual Gayan-gos , well known among students for his History of Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain , for his edition of the Correspond-ence of Cardinal Cisneros , and other his-torical work . Apropos of the examination , he came to see me in Russell Square , and his talk about Spain revived in me , for the time , a fading passion . Senor Gayangos was born in 1809 , so that in 1883 he was already an old man , though full of vigor and work . He told me the following story . Unfortunately I took no contemporary note . I give it now as I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can correct and amplify it no one will be better pleased than I. He said that as quite a young man , somewhere in the thirties of the last century , he was traveling through Spain to England where , if I remember right , he had relations with Sir Thomas Phillipps , the ardent book and MSS. collector , so many of whose treasures are now in the great libraries of Europe . Sir Thomas employed him in the search for Spanish MSS. and rare Spanish books . I gathered that at the time to which the story refers Gayangos him-self was not much acquainted with Eng-lish or English literature . On his journey north from Madrid to Burgos , which was of course in the days before railways , he stopped at Valladolid for the night , and went to see an acquaintance of his , the newly appointed librarian of an aristo-cratic family having a " palace " in Valladolid . He found his friend in the old library of the old house , engaged in a work of destruction . On the floor of the long room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning up a quantity of what he described as useless and miscellaneous hooks , with a view to the rearrangement of the library . The old sheepskin or vellum bindings had been stripped off , while the printed matter was burning steadily , and the room was full of smoke . There was a pile of old books whose turn had not yet come , lying on the floor . Gayangos picked one up . It was a volume containing the plays of " Mr. William Shakespeare , " and published in 1623 . In other words , it was a copy of the First Folio , and , as he declared to me , in excellent preservation . At that time he knew nothing about Shakespeare bibliography . He was struck , however , by the name of Shakespeare , and also by the fact that , according to an inscription inside it , the book belonged to Count Gondomar , who had himself lived in Valladolid , and collected a large library there . But his friend the librarian attached no importance to the book , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gayangos noticed particularly , as he turned it over , that its margins were covered with notes in a seventeenth-century hand . He continued his journey to England , and presently mentioned the incident to Sir Thomas Phillipps , and Sir Thomas 's future son-in-law , Mr. Halliwell after-wards Halliwell-Phillipps . Th a copy which had been sent out to Gondomar from England , for he was well acquainted with English life and letters , and had collected much of his library in London . The very thought of such a treasure perishing barbarously in a bonfire of waste paper was enough to drive a bibliophile out of his wits . Gayangos was sent back to Spain post haste . But alack ! he found a library swept and garnished , no trace of the volume he had once held there in his hand , and on the face of his friend the librarian , only a frank and peevish wonder that anybody should tease him with questions about such a trifle . But just dream a little ! Who sent the volume ? Who wrote the thick marginal notes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who arrived in England three years before Shakespeare 's death , was himself a man of letters , and had probably seen most of the plays ? In the few years which intervened between his withdrawal from England and his own death ( 1626 ) , did he annotate the copy , storing there what he could remember of the English stage , and of " pleasant Willy " himself perhaps , dur , . ing his two sojourns in London ? And was the hook overlooked as English , and of no importance , in the transfer of Gandomar 's own library , a hundred and sixty years after his death , to Charles III . of Spain ? ? and had it been soldperhaps -- for an old song , and with other remnants of Gondomar 's books , just for their local interest , to some Valladolid grandee ? Above all , did those marginal notes which Gayangos had once idly looked through , contain the key to the perennial Shakespeare mysteries ? to Mr. W. H. , and the " dark lady , " and all the impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves took care that the veil should not be rent . The secret remains . We were at Borough Farm when the vision of David Grieve first came upon me . It was ? a summer evening of extraordinary beauty , and I had been wandering through the heather and pine-woods. " he country " ? to quote an account written some years ago ? " was drenched Vo , CXXXVII. ? No. 819. - 51in sunset ; " white , towering thunder-. clouds descending upon and mingling with the crimson of the heath , the green stretches of bracken , the brown pools upon the common ; everywhere a rosy suffusion , a majesty of light interweaving heaven and earth , and transfiguring all dear familiar things ? the old farmhouse , the sand-pit where the children played , and the sand-martins nested , the wood-pile by the farm door , the phloxes in the tumbledown farmyard , the cottage down the lane . After months of rest , the fount of mental energy which had been exhausted in me the year before had filled again . I was eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hopeful , positive , and consoling " than the subject of the earlier book . A visit to Derbyshire in the autumn gave me some of the setting for the story . Then I took the first chapters abroad during the winter to Valescure , and worked at them in that fragrant , sunny spot . At Valescure we were within easy reach of Cannes , where the Actons were settled at the Villa Madeleine . The awkwardness of the trains prevented us from seeing as much of them as we had hoped , but I remember some pleasant walks and talks with Lord Acton , and especially the vehement advice he gave us , when my husband joined us , and we started on a short , a very short , flight to Italy ? for my husband had only a meager holiday from the Timer : " Go to Rome ! Never mind the journeys . Go ! You will have three days there , you say ? Well , ro have walked through Rome , to have spent an hour in the Forum , another on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel and St. Peter 's , to have climbed the Janiculurn and looked out over the Alban hills and the Campagna ? and you can do all that in three days ? well ! ? life is not the same afterwards . If you only had an afternoon in Rome , it would be well worth while . But three days ! " We laughed , took him at his word , and rushed on for Rome . And on the way we saw Perugia and Assisi for the first time , dipping into spring as soon as we got south of the Apennines , and tasting that intoxication of Italian sun in winter which turns northern heads . Of our week in Rome , I remember only the first overwhelming impression ? as of something infinitely old and pagan , through which Christianity moved like some parvenu , amid an elder generation of phantom presences , already gray with time long before Calvary that , and the making of a few new friends . The summer of ' 89 was filled with an adventure to which I still look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting and one of the main themes of Marcella . We were at that time half way through the building of a house at Haslemere , which was to supersede Borough Farm . We had grown out of Borough , and were for the moment homeless , so far as summer quarters were concerned . And for my work 's sake , I felt that eagerness for new scenes and suggestions , which is generally present , I think , in storytellers of all shades . Suddenly , in a house-agent 's catalogue , we came across an astonishing advertisement . Hampden House , on the Chiltern Hills , the ancestral home of John Hampden , of Ship-Money fame , was to let for the summer , and for a rent not beyond our powers . The new Lord Buckinghamshire , who had inherited it , was not then able to live in it . It had indeed , as we knew , been let for a while , some years earlier , to our old friends , Sir Mountstuart and Lady Grant Duff , before his departure for the Governorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished , but quite habitable ; and without more ado , we took it ! And what a place to wander in ! After we left it Hampden was restored , beautified , and refurnished . It is now , I have no doubt , a charming and comfortable country-house . But when we lived in it for three months ? in its halffurnished and tatterdemalion condition ? it was Romance , pure and simple . The old galleried hall , the bare rooms , the neglected pictures ? among them the " Queen Elizabeth , " presented to the owner of Hampden by the Queen herself after a visit ; the gray walls of King John 's garden , and just beyond it the little church where Hampden lies buried ; the deserted library on the top floor , running along the beautiful garden front , with books in it that might have belonged to the patriot himself , and a stately , full - length portrait ? painted about i600 ? which stood up , torn and frameless. among lumber of various kinds ; the portrait of a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden ; the locked room , opened to us occasionally by the agent of the property , which contained some of the ancestral treasures of the house ? the family Bible among them , with the births of John Hampden and his cousin Oliver Cromwell , recorded on the same fly-leaf ; the black cedars outside , and the great glade in front of the house , stretching downwards for half a mile towards the ruined lodges , just visible from the windows ? all this mingling of nature and history with the slightest , gentlest touch of pathos and decay , seen too under the golden light of a perfect summer , sank deep into mind and sense . Whoever cares to turn to the first chapters of Marcella will find as much of Hampden as could be transferred to paper ? Hampden as it was then ? in the description of Mellor . Our old and dear friend , Mrs. J. R. Green , the widow of the historian , and herself the most distinguished woman historian of our time , joined us in the venture . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up in one halfdismantled room , and she in another , with the eighteenth-century drawingroom between us . Here our hooks and papers soon made home . I was working at David Grieve ; she , if I remember right , at the brilliant book on English Town Life she brought out in 1891 . My husband came down to us for long week-ends , and as soon as we had provided ourselves with the absolute necessaries of life , visitors began to arrive . Professor and Mrs. Huxley , Sir Alfred Lyall , M. Jusserand , then consei Ile r d'ambassade under M. Waddington , now the French ambassador in Washington , Mr. and Mrs. Lvulph Stanley ( now Lord and Lady Sheffield ) , my first cousin H. 0 . Arnold-Forster , afterwards War Minister in Mr. Balfour 's Cabinet , and his wife , Mrs. Graham Smith , Laura Lyttelton 's sister , and many kinsfolk . In those days Hampden was six miles from the nearest railway station ; the Great Central Railway which now passes through the valley below it was not built , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched since the days of Roundhead and Cavalier , where the occasional sound of woodcutters in the beech solitudes was often , through a long walk , the only hint of human life . What good walks and talks we had in those summer days ! My sister had married Professor Huxley 's eldest son , so that with him and his dear wife we were on terms always of the closest intimacy and affection . " Pater " and " Moo , " as all their kith and kin and many of their friends called them , were the most racy of guests . He had been that year pursuing an animated controversy in the Ninteenth . Century with Doctor Wace , now Dean of Canterbury , who had also ? about a year before ? belabored the author of Robert Elsinere in the Quarterly Review . The Professor and I naturally enjoyed dancing a little on our opponents ? when there was none to make reply ! ? as we strolled about Hampden ; but there was never a touch of bitterness in Huxley 's nature , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? life was so interesting , and its horizon so full of light and color ! Of his wife ? " Moo " - who outlived him many years , how much one might say ! In this very year , 1889 , Huxley wrote to her from the Canaries , whither he had gone alone for his health : Catch me going out of reach of letters again ! I have been horridly anxious . Nobody ? children or any one else -- can be to me what you are . Ulysses preferred his old woman to immortality , and this absence has led me to see that he was as wise in that as in other things . They were indeed lovers to the end . He had waited and served for her eight years in his youth , and her sunny , affectionate nature , with its veins both of humor and stoicism , gave her man of genius exactly what he wanted . She survived him for many years , living her own life at Eastbourne , climbing Beachy Head in all weathers , interested in everything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised occasionally by sheer intensity of feeling ? about her husband ? into something very near thereal thing . I quote these verses from a privately-printed volume she gave me : If you were here , ? and I were where you lie , Would you , Beloved , give your little span Of life remaining unto tear and sigh ? Nol ? setting every tender memory Within your breast , as faded roses kept For giver 's sake , of giver when bereft , Still to the last the lamp of work you 'd burn For purpose high , nor any moment spurn . So , as you would have done , I fain would do In poorer fashion . Ah , how oft J try , Try to fulfil your wishes , till at length The scent of those dead roses steals my strength . As to our other guests , to what company would not Sir Alfred Lyall have added that touch of something provocative and challenging which draws men and women after it , like an Orpheusmusic ? I can see him sitting silent , his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth drooping , his eyes downcast , like one spent and wearied , from whom all virtue had gone our . Then some one , a man he liked ? but still oftener a woman ? would approach him , and the whole figure would wake to life ? a gentle , whimsical , melancholy life , yet possessed of a strange spell and pungency . Brooding , sad and deep , seemed to me to hold his inmost mind . The fatalism and dream of those Oriental religions to which he had given so much of his scholar 's mind , had touched him profoundly . His poems express it in mystical and somber verse , and his volume ofitriatic Studies contains the intellectual analysis of that background of thought from which the poems spring . Yet no one was shrewder , more acute than Sir Alfred in dealing with the men and politics of the moment . He swore to no man 's words , and one felt in him not only the first-rate administrator , as shown by his Indian career , but also the thinker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an excellent gossip , of a refined and subtle sort ; he was the soul of honor ; and there was that in his fragile and delicate personality which earned the warm affection of many friends . So gentle , so absentminded , so tired he often seemed ; and yet I could imagine those gray-blue eyes of Sir Alfred 's answering inexorably to any public or patriotic call . He was a disillusioned spectator of the " great mundane movement , " yet eternally interested in it and the man who loves this poor human life of ours , without ever being fooled by it , at least after youth is past , has a rare place among us . We forgive his insight because there is nothing in it pharisaical . And the irony he uses on us we know well that he has long since sharpened on himself . When I think of M. Jusserand playing tennis on the big lawn at Hampden , and determined to master it , like all else that was English , memory leads one back behind that pleasant scene to earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official of the French Foreign Office , who spent much of his scanty holidays in a scholarly pursuit of English literature . In Russell Square we were close to the British Museum , where M. Jusserand , during his visits to London , was deep in Chaucerian and other problems , gathering learning which " he presently began to throw into a series of books on the English centuries from Chaucer to Shakespeare . Who introduced him to us I can not remember , but during his work at the Museum he would drop in sometimes for luncheon or tea , so that we soon began to know him well . Then , later , he came to London as conseiller d'aurbassade under M. Waddington , an office which he filled till he became French minister to Denmark in 1900 . Then , in 1904 , he was sent as French ambassador to the United States , and there we found him in 1908 , when we stayed for a delightful few days at the British Embassy , with Mr. and Mrs. Bryce . It has always been a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wonderful English scholar ? M. w sserand , or M. Andr6 Chevrillon , ine 's nephew and literary executor , and himself one of the leaders of French letters , with whom , as with M. Jusse-rand , I may reckon now some thirty years of friendship . No one could say that M. Jusserand speaks our tongue exactly like an Englishman . He does much better . He uses it ? always , of course , with perfect fluency and correctness ? to express French ideas , and French wits , in a way as nearly Frenchas the foreign language will permit . The result is extraordinarily stimulating to our English wits . The slight differences both in accent and phrase keep the ear attentive and alive . New shades emerge ; old clichis are broken up . M. Chevrillon has much less accent and his talk is more flowingly and convincingly English , for which , no doubt , a boyhood partly spent in England accounts , while for vivacity and ease there is little or nothing to choose . But to these two distinguished and accomplished men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude . They have not by any means always approved of our national behavior . M. Jusserand during his official career in Egypt was , I believe , a very candid critic of British administration and British methods , and in the days of our early acquaintance with him I can remember many an amusing and caustic sally of his at the expense of our politicians and our foreign policy . M. Chevrillon took the Boer side in the South African War , and took it with passion . All the same , the friendship of both the diplomat and the man of letters for this country , based upon their knowledge of her , and warmly returned to them by many English friends , has been a real . factor in the growth of that broad-based sympathy which we now call the Entente . M. Chevrillon 's knowledge of us is really uncanny . He knows more than we know ourselves . And his last book about us ? L ' Angleterre et la Guerre ? is not only photographically close to the facts , but full of a spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men of such high gifts are not easily multiplied in any country . But , looking to the future of Europe , the more that France and England ? and America ? can cultivate in their citizens some degree , at any rate , of that intimate understanding of a foreign nation , which shines so conspicuously in the work of these two Frenchmen , the safer will that future be . It was in November , 1891 , that I finished David Grieve , after a long wrestle of more than three years . I was tired out , and we fled south for rest to Rome , Naples , Amalfi , and Ravello . The Cappucini hotel at Amalfi , Madame Palumbo 's inn at Ravello , remain with me as places of pure delight , shone on even in winter by a more than earthly sun . Madame Palumbo was , as her many guests remember , an Englishwoman , and showed a special zeal in making English folk comfortable . Can one ever forget the sunrise over the Gulf of Salerno from the Ravello windows ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winter . From the inn perched on a rock-paint above the coast one looked straight down for hundreds of feet , through lemon-groves and olive-gardens to the blue water . Flaming over the mountains rose an unclouded sun , shining on the purple coast with its innumerable rock towns ? congesta manu pretruptis oppida sax is ? and sending broad paths over the " wine-dark " sea . Never , I think , have I felt the glory and beauty of the world more rapturously , more painfully ? for there is pain in id ? than when standing alone on a December morning , at a window which seemed to make part of the precipitous rock itself , looking over that fairest of scenes . From Ravello we went back to Rome , and a short spell of its joys . What is it makes the peculiar pleasure of society in Rome ? A number of elements , of course , enter in . The setting is incomparable , and the clashing of great world policies , represented by the diplomats ? of the main religious and Liberal forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy ? kindles a warmth and animation in the social air which matches the clearness of the Roman day , when the bright spells of the winter weather arrive , and the omnipresent fountains of the Eternal City flash the January or February sun through its streets and piazzas . Ours , however , was only a brief stay . But the figure perhaps which chiefly stands out in memory as connected with this short visit is that of Lord Dufferin , then our ambassador in Rome . Was there ever a greater charmer than Lord Dufferin ? In the sketch of the " Ambassador " in Eleanor there are some points caught from the living Lord Dufferin , so closely indeed that before the book came out I sent him the proofs and asked his leave ! ? which he gave at once , in one ofthe graceful little notes of which he was always master . For the diplomatic life and successes of Lord Dufferin are told in many official documents , and in the biography of him by Sir Alfred Lyall ; but the key to it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print . In the first place he was ? even at sixty-five ? wonderfully handsome . He had inherited the beauty , and also the humor and the grace , of his Sheridan ancestry . For his mother , as all the world knows , was Helen Sheridan , one of the three famous daughters of Toni Sheridar. , the dramatist 's only son . Mrs. Norton , the innocent heroine of the Melbourne divorce suit , was one of his aunts , and the " Queen of Beauty " at the Eglinton Tournament ? then Lady Seymour , afterwards Duchess of Somerset ? was the other . His mother 's memory was a living thing to him all his life ; he published her letters and poems ; and at Clandeboye , his Ulster home ? in " Helen 's Tower " ? he had formed a collection of memorials of her which he liked to show to those of whom he made friends . " You must come to Clandeboye , and let me show you Helen 's Tower , " he would say , eagerly , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time never came . My personal recollections of him are ? apart from letters ? all connected with Rome , or Paris , whither he was transferred the year after we saw him at the Roman Embassy in December , 1891 . So that it was his last winter at Rome , and he had only been ambassador there a little more than two years ? since he ceased to be Viceroy of India in 1889 . But he had already won everybody 's affection . The social duties of the British Embassy in Rome ? what with the Italian world in all its shades , the more or less permanent English colony , and the rush of English tourists through the winter and spring ? seemed to me by no means easy . But Lady Dufferin 's dignity and simplicity , and Lord Dufferin 's temperament carried them triumphantly through the tangle . Especially do I remember the informal Christmas dance to which we took , by the ambassador 's special wish , our young daughter of seventeen , who was not really " out . " And no sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders , than he discovered her . I can see him still as he made her a smiling bow ? his noble gray head and kind eyes , the blue ribbon crossing his chest . " You promised me a dance ! " And so for her first waltz , in her first grown-up dance , D. was well provided , nervous as the moment was . There are few things I regret more in relation to London social life than the short time allowed me by fate wherein to see something more of Lord Derby . If I remember right , we first met him at a small dinner-party at Lady Winifred 's in 1891 , and he died early in 1893 . But he made a very great impression upon me , and , though he was generally thought to he awkward and shy in general society , in the conversations I remember with him , nothing could have been more genial or more attractive than his manner . He had been at Rugby under my grandfather , which was a link to begin with , though he afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of , any signs of the special Rugby influence which stamped men like Dean Stanley and Clough . And yet of the moral independence and activity which my grandfather prized and cultivated in his boys , there was certainly no lack in Lord Derby 's career . For the greater part of his political life he was nominally a Conservative , yet the rank and file of his party only half trusted a mind trained by John Stuart Mill , and perpetually brooding on social reform . As Lord Stanley , his close association and personal friendship with Disraeli during the ministries and politics of the mid-nineteenth century have been well brought out in Mr. Buckle 's last volume of the Disraeli Life . But the ultimate parting between himself and " Dizzy " was probably always inevitable . For his loathing of adventurous policies of all kinds , and of any increase whatever in the vast commitments of England , was sure at some point to bring him into conflict with the imagination or , as we may now call it , the prescience of Disraeli . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner-table , that he had been offered the throne of Greece in 1892 . If he accepts the charge ( wrote " Dizzy " to Mrs. Bridges Williams I shall lose a powerful friend and colleague . It is a dazzling adventure for the House of Stanley , but they are not an imaginative race , and I fancy they will prefer Knowsley to the Parthenon , and Lancashire to the Attic plain . It is a privilege to live in this age of rapid and brilliant events . What an error to consider ix an utilitarian age ! It is one of infinite romance . Thrones tumble down and crowns are offered , like a fairy tale . Sixteen years later came his famous resignation in 1878 , when the Fleet was ordered to the Dardanelles , and Lord Derby , as he had now become , then Foreign Secretary , refused to sanction a step that might lead to war . That , for him , was the end as far as Toryism was concerned . In 188o he joined Mr. Gladstone , but only to separate from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him , in 1891 , he was leader of the Liberal Unionist peers in the House of Lords . A little later he became president of the great Labor Commission of 1892 , and before he could see Gladstone 's fresh defeat in 1893 he died . Speculatively he was as open-minded as a reader and follower of Mill might be expected to be . He had been interested in Robert Eli-mere , and the discussion of books and persons to which it led him in conversation with me showed him fully aware of the new forces abroad in literature and history . Especially interested , too , as to what Labor was going to make of Christianity ! and well aware ? how could he fail to be , as chairman of that great , that epoch-making commission of 1892. ' ? of the advancing strength of organized Labor on all horizons . He appeared to me , too , as a typical North-countryman ? a son of Lancashire , proud of the great Lancashire towns , and thoroughly at home in the life of the Lancashire countryside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that he had thought much ? in his balanced , reticent way ? on matters in which I was then groping : how to humanize the relations between employer and employed ; how to enrich and soften the life of the workman ; how , in short , to break down the barrier between modern industrialism and the stored-up treasures ? art , science , thought ? of man 's long history . that when David Grieve was fin-I sent it to Lord Derby , not long our first meeting , in no spirit of empty compliment , and I have always kept his letter in return as a memento of a remarkable personality . Some day I hope there may be a Memoir of him , for none has yet appeared . He had not the charm , the versatility , the easy classical culture of his famous father , " the Rupert of debate , " but with his great stature ? he was six foot two ? his square head , and strong , smooth-shaven face , he was noticeable everywhere . He was a childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of a lonely roan , for all his busy political life and his vast estates . But he was particularly interesting to me , as representing a type I have once or twice tried to draw ? of the aristocrat standing between the old world , before railways and the first reform bill , which saw his birth , and the new world and new men of the later half of the century . He was traditionally with the old world ; by conviction and conscience , I think , with the new ; yet not sorry , probably , that he was to see no more than its threshold ! It will be remembered that 1892 was the first year of American copyright , and the great success of David Grieve in America , following on the extraordinary vogue there of Robert Eisinere , in its pirated edition , brought me largely increased literary receipts . It seemed that I was not destined , after all , to " ruin my publishers , " as I had despondently foretold in a letter to my husband before the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to a fairly steady income . We therefore felt justified in seizing an opportunity brought to our notice by an old friend who lived in the neighborhood , and migrating to a house north of London , in the real heart of Middle England . After leaving Borough Farm , we had built a house on a hill near Haslemere , looking south over a glorious view ; but two years ' residence had convinced me that Surrey was almost as populous as London , and that real solitude for literary work was not to be found there at any rate in that corner of it where we had chosen to build . While we werenursing our newly planted shrubberies of baby pines and rhododendrons , there was always in my mind , as I find from letters of the time , a discontented yearning for " an old house and old trees " ! We found both at Stocks , whither we migrated in the summer of 1892 . The little estate had then been recently inherited by Mrs. Grey , mother of Sir Edward Grey , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first tenants of the house and grounds , but in 1896 we bought the small property from the Greys , and have now been for more than twenty years its happy possessors . The house lies on a high upland , under one of the last easterly spurs of the Chilterns . It was built in 1780 ( we rebuilt it in 1908 ) in succession to a much older house of which a few fragments remain , and the village at its gates had changed hardly at all in the hundred years which preceded our arrival . A few new cottages had been built ; more needed to be built ; and two residents , intimately connected with the past of the village , had built houses just outside it . But villadorn did not exist . The village was rich in old folk , in whom were stored the memories and traditions of its quiet past . The postmaster , " Johnny Dolt , " who was nearing his eighties , was the universal referee on all local questions ? rights of way , boundaries , village customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old women of the village , as they were twenty-five years ago , I have drawn as faithful a picture as I could in one or two chapters of Marcella . The New Brotherhood of Robert Elsmere had become in some sort a realized dream ? so far as any dream can ever take to itself the practical garments of this puzzling world . To show that the faith of Green and Martineau and Stopford Brooke was a faith that would wear and work ? to provide a home for the new learning of a New Reformation , and a practical outlet for its enthusiasm of humanity ? were the chief aims in the minds of those of us who in 1890 founded the University Hall Settlement in London . I look back now with emotion on that astonishing experiment . The scheme had taken shape in my mind during the summer of 889 , and in the following year I was able to persuade Doctor Martineau , Mr. Stopford Brooke , my old friend , Lord Carlisle , and a group of other religious Liberals , to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an adequate subscription list was raised without difficulty . University Hall in Gordon Square was taken as a residence for young men , and was very soon filled . Continuous teaching by the best men available , from all the churches , on the history and philosophy of religion was one half the scheme ; the other half busied itself with an attempt to bring about some real contact between brain and manual workers . We took a little dingy hall in Marchmont Street , where the residents of the hall started clubs and classes , Saturday mornings for chil-dren and the like . The foundation of Toynbee Hall ? the Universities Settlement ? in East London , in memory of Arnold Tovnbee , was then a fresh and striking fact in social history . A spirit of fraternization was in the air , an a -- dent wish to break down the local and geographical harriers that separated rich from poor , East End from West End . The new venture in which I was interested attached itself therefore to a growing movement . The work in Marchmont Street grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it a real center of comradeship , and the residents at the hall in Gordon Square , led by a remarkable man of deeply religious temper and Quaker origin , the late Mr. Alfred Robinson , devoted themselves in the evenings to a work marked by a very genuine and practical enthusiasm . Soon it was evident that larger premises were wanted . It was in the days when Mr. Passmore Edwards was giving large sums to institutions of different kinds in London , but especially to the founding of public libraries . He began to haunt the shabby hall in Marchmont Street , and presently offered to build us a new hall there for classes and social gatherings . But the scheme grew and grew , in my mind as in his . And when the question of a site arose we were fortunate enough to interest the practical and generous mind of the chief ground landlord of Bloomsbury , the Duke of Bedford . With him I explored varioussites in the neighborhood , and finally the duke offered us a site in Tavistock Place on most liberal terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a 999 years ' lease , and returning us the ground rent . And there the Settlement now stands , the most beautiful and commodious settlement building in London , with a large garden behind it made by the duke out of various old private gardens , and lent to the Settlement for its various purposes . Mr. Passmore Edwards contributed E14,00D to its cost , and it bears his name . It was opened in 1898 by Lord Peel and Mr. Morley , and for twenty-five years it has been a center of social work and endeavor in St. Pancras . On the threshold of its early history there stands a venerable figure ? the beautiful and saintly presence of James Martineau . For he was a member of the original Council , and his lectures on the Gospel of St. Luke , in the old " Elsmerian " hail , marked the best of what we tried to give in those first days . I knew Harriet Martineau in my childhood at Fox How . Well I remember going to tea with that tremendous woman when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in much awe of her cap , her strong face , her eartrumpet , and then being taken away to a neighboring room by a kind niece , that I might not disturb her further . Once or twice during my growing up I saw her . She lived only a mile from Fox How , and was always on friendly terms with my people . Matthew Arnold had a true admiration for her ? sturdy fighter that she was in Liberal causes . So had W. E. Forster , only he suffered a good deal at her hands , as she disapproved of the Education Bill , and contrived so to manage her trumpet when he came to see her as to take all the argument and give him all the listening . When my eldest child was born a cot-blanket arrived , knitted by Miss Martineau 's own hands , the busy hands ? soon then to be at rest !  - -  - that wrote the " History of the Peace , " " Feats on the Fiord , " the " Settlers at Home , " and those excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law days in the Daily News , which are still well worth reading . Between Harriet Martineau and her brother James , as many people will remember , there arose an unhappy difference in middle life which was never mended or healed . I never heard him speak of her . His standards were high and severe , for all the sensitive delicacy of his long distinguished face and visionary eyes ; and neither he nor she was of the stuff that allows kinship to supersede conscience . He published a somewhat vehement criticism of a book in which she was part author , and she never forgave it . And although to me , in the University Hall venture , he was gentleness and courtesy itself , and though his presence seemed to hallow a room directly he entered it , one felt always that he was formidable . The prophet and the Puritan lay deep in him . Yet in his two famous volumes of sermons there are tones of an exquisite tenderness and sweetness , together with harmonies of prose style , that remind me often how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen at the Monday Popular Concerts , week after week , his thinker 's brow thrown back to catch the finest shades of Joachim 's playing . The year after David Grieve appeared , Mr. Jowett died . His long letter to me on the book contained some characteristic passages of which I quote the fol-lowing : I should like to have a good talk with you . I seldom get any one to talk on religious subjects . It seems to me toat the world is growing rather tired of German criticism , having got out of it nearly all that it is capable of giving . To me it appears one of the most hopeful signs of the present day that we are coming back to the old , old doctrine , " he ca n't be wrong whose life is in the right . " Yet this has to be taught in a new way , adapted to the wants of the age . We must give up doctrine and teach by the lives of men , beginning with the life of Christ , instead . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prophets , will be our Bible . Vou , CXXXVIL ? No. 510. - 52 does n't reconcile me to the recollection of how little I knew of his failing health , till suddenly in September the news reached me that he was lying dangerously ill in the house of Sir Robert Wright , in Surrey . " Every one who waited on him in his illness loved him , " wrote an old friend of his and mine who was with him to the end . What were almost his last words , " I bless God for my life ! I bless God for my life ! " seemed to bring the noble story of it to a triumphant close ; and after death he lay " with the look of a little child on his face . " . . . " He will live in the hearts of those who loved him , as well as in his work . " He lives indeed ; and as we recede further from him , the originality and greatness of his character will become more and more clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained are now in the full stream of politics and life . His pupils and friends are or have been everywhere , and they have borne . in whatever vocation , the influence of his mind or the mark of his friendship . Lord Lansdowne , Mr. Asquith , Lord Justice Bowen , Lord Coleridge , Lord Milner , Sir Robert Morier , Matthew Arnold , Huxley , Tennyson , Lord Goschen , Miss Nightingale , and a hundred others of the nation 's leaders ? amid profoundest difference , the memory of " the Master " has been for them a common and a felt bond . No other religious personality of the nineteenth century ? unless it be that of Newman ? has stood for so much . In his very contradictions and inconsistencies of thought he was the typical man of a time beset on all sides by new problems to which Jowett knew very well there was no intellectual answer ; while through the passion of his central faith in God , and hope for man , he has been in many hearts and minds ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling light which in the marvelous beacon-chain of " Agamemnon , " fired the long procession of heights from Troy to Argos . And to these great matters the Jowettian oddities and idiosyncrasies added just that touch of laughter and surprise that makes a man loved by his own time , and arrests the eye and ear of posterity .
