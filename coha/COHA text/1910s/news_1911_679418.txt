txt The Inheritance Tax . In this morning 's TIMES is a letter from Mr. William J. Coombs , stating that , In case of death , estates are obliged-to pay an enormous tax If held In New York . and , what is worse , another tax to the State In which the company issuing the bonds or stock is incorporated . The subject of the payment of Inheritance taxes In two or three States is one to which I have- given considerable attention during the last few months , and the results of my Investigation were recently published In pamphlet form . So far as my Investigation went . there are few States which attempt to collect any tax upon bonds issued under their laws and held by estates of non-residents , and then only in cases where the bonds are registered . A resident of New York who confined his Investments to coupon bonds . and retained them within this. , State would be subject only to the one tax Imposed by New York .. The double and triple taxation to *bleb attention has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations of other States , or where he keeps his securities in other than the State of his residence . So far as a holder of coupon bonds is concerned , conditions are not so burdensome as your correspondent seems to believe .
