txt The Park Rhododendrons . It would be unfortunate to bar rhododendrons ) from the Park , as they are of easiest culture . Plant them under trees , for shade , mulch them with all the leaves possible to get , and do not remove these leaves in the Spring , but allow , them to decay as in the natural habitat of these beautiful native plants . For thirty years I have planted them and now have hundreds of them , and have never lost but one or two . Instead of being a care , they help the gardener , as the leaves near by are raked into the beds instead of being carted away and burned . But never , never apply heating manure , as they love coolness . They are not exotic .
