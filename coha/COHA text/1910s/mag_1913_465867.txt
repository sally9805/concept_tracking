0NE of the most singular delusions that used to prevail about our language was that every educated man knows all the words that belong to it ; at any rate , all the words that belong to it properly . Belief in this special sort of omniscience doubtless existed from the beginning ; but it made little public proclamation of itself until after the rise of critical periodicals in the eighteenth century . This class of publications gave ample opportunity to numbers of men to air their views , or rather their prejudices , on the subject of usage ; to decide , so far as their influence went , just what expressions it was the correct thing to employ or to avoid . It was the usual assumption of the reviewer that words or phrases strange to him , or for any reason objectionable to him , by that very fact proved that they had no business whatever in the speech . At all events , it proved their non-existence in that pure and perfect diction of which he himself was an authorized exponent . Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said that in some quarters it has not even yet died out . But it never made much recognizable exhibition of itself till the second half of the eighteenth century . Then the manifestation of self-consciousness may be said to have begun . It was then that men became very critical on the subject of usage . The situation was such as almost to necessitate this state of mind . New words and phrases were beginning to pour into the tongue in large numbers . New discoveries in the arts and sciences were constantly being made . New inventions were devised . New ideas of all sorts were in the air . All these demanded for their description and expression words which the current speech did not supply . Accordingly the required terms had to be developed from existing roots , or to be imported from foreign sources . As was not unnatural , these new creations or borrowings did not meet the approval of the conservative ? though then they would not have called themselves so , as at that time such usage of the word did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt and expressed . The candidate for adoption into the language was clumsy , or ill-sounding , or incorrectly formed . But the objectors failed to consider the all-important point that some new word was absolutely necessary . If they could not devise one better , the word already suggested was sure to be adopted . Always , indeed , during the history of every tongue , men have insisted on maintaining a firm stand against the entrances into it of new expressions of any sort . In so doing they have honestly believed that they were actuated not by a senseless but by a holy zeal for purity of speech . The strongest sort of opposition has been frequently offered to the recognition of words which it would now seem to us we could hardly do without . The feeling existed in high places . In 1773 the fourth edition of Johnson 's dictionary was published . It was the last edition which appeared under his own supervision . Boswell tells us that he in vain urged Johnson to insert civilization . This was just then beginning to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to barbarism . He refused to acknowledge the intruder . Humiliating he admitted to he a word frequently used , but he did not know it to be legitimate English ? whatever that means . So , though he inserted the noun humiliation , the corresponding verb and adjective are not found in his final revised edition . Not long after this time development appeared in the title of a book . Its author was sternly informed by one of his reviewers that there was no such word in the language . William Taylor , of Norwich , somewhat renowned for the peculiar words he used in his writings , sent an article to the Monthly Review , in which occurred the verb rehabilitate . It was at once struck out by the editor . It was not English , Taylor was informed , and would not have been understood . It may be said in palliation if not defense of this action that it was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the word became well known , especially in the sense of whitewashing questionable characters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the nineteenth century . The new terms introduced were objected to , not because of their demerits , but on account of their novelty or origin . Violent protests were made against their employment . Critics were slow to learn ? what indeed some of them never learn that in the use of words the - whole body of educated men know better what they need than any one of their number , no matter who be be . Hence critical omniscience was constantly engaged in insisting that particular words were not in the language . If finally forced to accept them as being in it , it as constantly insisted that they ought not to be in it . Singular illustrations of this attitude meet us on every side . In his autobiography , John Stuart Mill tells that in the winter of 1822-23 he planned the formation of a little body of debaters which was made up of those who acknowledged utility as their standard of ethics and polities . To this society he gave the name of Utilitarian . It was the first time , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not invent the word , " he wrote , " but found it in one of Galt 's novels , The Annals of the . Parish . " Toward the end of this same third decade of the century , John Silk Buckingham established the critical weekly , the Athencrunt . That soon passed for a short period into the hands of John Sterling and Frederick Denison Maurice . During their sway the periodical attacked fiercely the views of those who called themselves ttilitarians . Not content with denouncing their tenets , it denounced their name . Repeatedly it insisted that there was no such word in the language . Sterling and Maurice have passed away ; utilitarian , still survives . From Mill 's statement it is probable at least it is possible that this term was of Scottish origin . At all events it was from that part of the United Kingdom that many new words came to be adopted into English literary use . They were apt to be received with a good deal of protest if their source was known or suspected . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that was considered ; it was the quarter from which it proceeded . In truth , before Americanisms were discovered , Scotticism was the term with which the Englishman with limited knowledge of his own tongue , but with large ideas of his own knowledge of it , was much disposed to stigmatize every word or usage to which he took exception . Occasionally he termed it an Irishism ; or , to resort to a more exalted form of nomenclature , an Hibernicism . But Scotland as the assumed source of its origin was the part of the United Kingdom generally preferred . As a Scotticism accordingly it was to be shunned . At the outset these expressions of hostility often , and perhaps one might say commonly , imposed upon the natives themselves of that country . No more striking illustration of the state of mind generally prevailing in the eighteenth century can be found than that exhibited by Hume . Hume was renowned as an essayist , as a historian , and as a philosopher . No inhabitant of Great Britain of his time was so eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time had so great a Continental reputation . Yet in the matter of language he submitted himself , almost with servility , to the opinions of men who , besides being intellectually far his inferiors , had not a tithe of his knowledge of literature or of his ability of expression . Had ho taken half the pains to study the usage of the great English writers which he took to get the opinions of very ordinary Englishmen on points of usage , he would have saved himself not only from much needless anxiety , but from the acquisition of much misleading information . Furthermore , this position of linguistic inferiority Hume accepted for his countrymen as well as for himself . He assumed as without question that by the very fact of being a Scotchman be must necessarily speak and write not pure English , but a dialect of English . In 1757 he said with just pride to his friend Gilbert Elliot , of Minto , that the people to whom they belonged were " the most distinguished for literature in Europe . " This result , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced disadvantages . " We are , " he said , " unhappy in our accent and pronunciation . " In addition he remarked that we " speak a very corrupt dialect of the tongue we make use of . " Nor was Hume at all singular in this depreciatory estimate . Exactly the same attitude was taken by his Scottish contemporaries . The very friend of his who has just been mentioned assumed it as a matter of course . In 1759 George Grenville had spoken to Elliot with highest praise of Robertson 's History of Scotland , which had just appeared . " T suppose , " said Elliot , deprecatingly , " although the matter may be tolerable , as the author was never on this side of the Tweed till he wrote it , it must be very barbarous in the expression . " " By no means , " replied Grenville . " Had the author lived all his life in London , and in the best company , he could not have expressed himself with greater elegance and purity . " There were then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable view of the language employed by the historian . But the very difference of opinion on this point shows how unfixed is the standard by which propriety of usage has to be determined . In accordance with the views he held , Hume devoted no small share of his time and thought to ridding himself of what be considered Scotticisms . In so doing , like most verbal critics , he got rid of words and expressions which bad been not merely in use from an early period , but had furthermore been in the best of use . For his course in so doing he had a certain justification in his lack of adequate means to decide authoritatively . Some points , indeed , could be settled easily . There were words and expressions peculiar to Scotland which were utterly unknown to classical English . Several of these , owing perhaps to our unfamiliarity with them , strike us now as singularly uncouth . Others there were against which it would seemimpossible to make reasonable objection . But whether uncouth or expressive , they all fell alike under Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compose in the purest sort of English , he made out a list of Scotticisms which were to be avoided . By the side of these assumed disreputable citizens of the linguistic commonwealth he placed the correspondingly correct English words or phrases . A most singular list this was as a whole . It consisted of about one hundred examples . Some of them were words and phrases which were then peculiar to Scotland . So they have remained to this day , if they still continue to exist at all . Others there were which were once correct , but had become antiquated . In consequence they belonged rather to a treatise on good usage than to a vocabulary of Scotticisms . Such , for instance , was /earn in the obsolete sense of " teach " ? that is , obsolete in the literary speech , but not in the speech of the uneducated . Others there were which were then frequently employed in both Scotland and England ; but possibly much more employed in the former country than in the latter . Of still others it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England then , they speedily became so . This list of Scotticisms was , however , especially remarkable for containing a goodly proportion of words and expressions which were in no sense peculiar to Scotland - then and never have been . What . indeed , are we to think of the linguistic acquirements of a man of letters who could seriously set down for his own guidance that " simply impossible " is Scotch , while " absolutely impossible " is English ; that " nothing else " is Scotch and " no other thing " is English ; that " common soldiers " is Scotch and " privates , " or " private men , " is English ; that " there " and " where " are Scotch and " thither " and " whither " are English ? He doubtless got his information on such points from Englishmen who had amassed as much ignorance of the whole subject as he had himself . In the last examples given there is some justification for the introduction of the words as a question of precise usage . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marking a distinction between Scotch and English usage . There and where are adverbs which belong to verbs of rest . Strictly speaking , they are out of place with verbs of motion . With these latter thither and whither or where to are the ones properly employed . This distinction is still largely , perhaps generally , maintained by scrupulous writers in their printed productions ; but colloquial usage has so universally abandoned it that it would be impossible to preserve it in conversation without frequently subjecting oneself to the charge of pedantry . Several of the Scottirisms imported into this country crossed at the same time the Tweed . They were adopted into the literary speech of England , though occasionally under protest ; but the protest , when made , was soon forgotten . They consequently came in time to be considered as much a constituent part of the language of South Britain as of North . Take as an illustration the word greed . It is a back - formation from greedy . This adjective had been in the language from the earliest known period . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for a long time the use of greed ? the word , not the thing ? was limited to Scotland . In fact , it did not make its way into English literature until the nineteenth century . Men insisted that it was unnecessary ; it expressed no more than greediness . It is probable that it was its employment by Scott that contributed largely to the acceptance it met at last . Few there are now who will deny that it is a positive contribution to the resources of the speech . At any rate the place of its origin was long ago condoned and is now generally forgotten . The employment in this country of certain words and - usages characteristic of the speech of North Britain - took place , as has been said , at about the same time that they made their way into English literature generally . Hence our contemporaneous adoption of them ceased to have any note of distinctiveness . But certain words and expressions there are in which no simultaneous action of this sort occurred . They consequently have come to form a marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two in particular of the Seotticisms found in Hume 's list demand here full consideration , for they may be said to be entitled now to the distinction of being regarded also as Americanisms . One of these is the use of the adverb some in the sense of " somewhat . " In Hume 's list some better is put down as a Scotticism opposed to the English " something better . " Doubtless this same employment of the adverb may be found in a few of the English dialects . Scotland , however . was its chief home , and from Scotland it was brought to this country . Here of late it has had a mighty development . It must have reached here early . The first vocabulary of Americanisms which was ever published ? appearing in the first quarter of the nineteenth century ? contained it . In that it was said to be " used chiefly by the illiterate . " Such , too , is the distinctly disparaging description of it found now in dictionaries published in England . To the account of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " not so much used in the seaports as in the country towns of New England . " The work referred to was published in Boston ; and 13oston lied already begun to be jealous of her linguistic reputation . Unfortunately this asserted limitation of the use of some ? where something or somewhat is the proper word ? if it were even true then , is not at all true now . It has taken as full possession of the seaboard as it has of the interior . It not merely exists here ; it abounds . There is no - usage more common among the semieducated . We must add that the same statement applies to too large a number of the educated . To its wide spread its constant occurrence in the newspapers has undoubtedly contributed . That of itself would tend to familiarize it to all ; and a usage constantly met in print is always likely to be unhesitatingly , or at least unthinkingly , employed in conversation . It is , indeed , sedulously avoided by those who are scrupulous about propriety of speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in number . Still , unless solitary instances have escaped my notice , some in the sense of " some's+ can not be found in the writings best American authors when any one of them is speaking in his own person or is representing the usage of the cultivated . At all events , this was true of those of the past generation . Their writings are as free from its employment as are those of English authors . But its present extensive use here , at least so far as colloquial and newspaper speech is concerned , entitles it now to be regarded as an Americanism . As it has no literary support in its favor , it is hardly a usage to be proud of . The other one of the Scotticisms mentioned in Hume 's list which has maintained itself hero is the use of pled instead of pleaded in the preterite and past participle . The fuller form is frequently found also ; but the contracted one is not only heard often in conversation , it is met with pretty constantly in print . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has here the greater vogue both in colloquial speech and in written . In England the reverse is true . There the shortened form is out of use ? that is , out of educated use . Once it was not wholly so . The New Historical Dictionary cites from Spenser a passage containing it . But all its other quotations from British authors come from those belonging to Scotland . Even among these the only ones possessing any literary authority whatever are Chalmers and Scott . That the contracted form was not in common use in the English of the Elizabethan period may be fairly inferred from the practice of Shakespeare . He never employs it . Three times he uses the preterite or past participle . In these instances pleaded is the form found . Tho same statement seems to be true of later writers in Great Britain outside of Scotland . But pled as a preterite or past participle stands on an entirely different footing from some in the sense of somewhat . " For it exists a certain amount of literary precedent and a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the slightest linguistic objection to its employment , though there is to the frequent spelling of it as plead , which is not sanctioned by the early use and still less by common sense . Plead , with the past tense and past participle pled , belongs to a small class of anomalous verbs of the weak conjugation . These have come to have a family likeness to the strong verbs because they no longer add anything to form the preterite , and , furthermore , shorten the vowel sound of the present . This sound is represented in the spelling of that tense by ee or ea . There are some of these verbs in which no one thinks of employing the full and strictly regular form . It is invariably the contracted one . Lead does not give us the preterite leaded , but led . Read similarly discards readed . The past tense is pronounced red ; but in the absurd conventional orthography prevailing it appears as read . It is needless to add that there are those who honestly believe that the language would enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of lead , should be spelled in accordance with ite pronunciation . Again in the words in which this same sound is represented by ee , bleed , breed , and feed have for their preterites not the regular full forms bleeded , breeded , and feeded , but the contracted ones bled and bred and fed . It shows the capriciousness of language or of its users that speed , another adverb of this same class , has had during all periods of modern English both the full form speeded and the contracted form sped . To a less extent this is true of plead . In accordance with the course followed by the few verbs just mentioned , pled ought to be the accepted preterite instead of pleaded . That it is of Norman - French origin , while they are of Anglo-Saxon , has never had the slightest bearing upon the question . Plead came into the language when the two elements out of which the speech was formed had completely coalesced . It was at once fully naturalized . It was subjected to the same influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thought of its origin at the time . It is not likely that one in a - thousand of the multitudes of men who have since used it has had the least idea of the quarter from which it came into our tongue . But pleaded has been adopted so universally in England that pled must be regarded as one of the Seotticisms which have now become Americanisms . Hume 's attitude was essentially the same as that taken by the two later Scottish authors who devoted themselves to the consideration of this subject . The first of these was Sir John Sinclair . In 1782 he brought out a volume entitled Observations on the Scottish Dialect . His list was very much fuller than Hume 's . It contained a large number of words and phrases which were genuinely peculiar to Scotland ; some of them , indeed , necessary to Scotland , for there were no others to fill their place . But it contained also no small number that had belonged to the English language from time immemorial . In addition to his predecessor 's list , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet Beattie . This had been privately printed in 1779 . Sinclair , unlike his two fellow-countrymen , was occasionally conscious of the ridiculousness of certain of his statements . To this feeling his education at Oxford University doubtless contributed . In a few cases he admitted that the word or phrase which he spoke of as a Scotticism had been used by Shakespeare and other authors of his grade . These seem in his opinion to have written a sort of English which had fallen into disrepute in the high-polite English society which he had frequented . A few others of these alleged Scotticisms were to be found also in the authorized version of the Bible . Naturally some of the distinctions Sinclair made between the language of North and of South Britain strike us now , and pretty surely struck many then , as more amusing than edifying . To mime a person to do a thing instead of making him do it was , we were told , " a frequent and obnoxious Scotticism . " Instead of " making up to a lady , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper thing in the southern part was " to make an offer of marriage to a lady . " The former expression had probably not been long in use ; but a few there must have been even then who were sufficiently dense not to recognize that the meaning of the two was essentially different . " In place of " for " instead of , " he tells us , " is a Scotticism often . fallen into . " " To blow the bellows " was also Scotch . The pruner way of express-ing the action was " to blow the fire with the bellows . " On this matter Sinclair was a little hesitant as to the region of use , but not at all as to tho propriety of the usage . " H blow the bellows , " he said , " is English , it is surely a ridiculous expression . " Again he tells us that the Scotch say " to fall in the gutter , " where the English would say " to fall in the dirt . " The reason given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " A gutter , " wrote Sinclair , " is properly a passage for water , not the dirt and water with which it may be filled . " little satisfaction would it be to him who had fallen into one to know that the defiling dirt he found in it was not necessarily there according to any proper definition of the word . Page after page could be taken up with these asserted distinctions of usage . They either did not exist then , or , if they had existed in the past , had long passed . away . There was , however , justification at the time for the introduction of certain words and phrases which to all readers now would seem strange as ever having been deemed peculiar to Scotland . They were soon to make their way into universal acceptance . There was another Scotsman to whom the fact of such acceptance , which was becoming every day more plainly perceptible , brought extremest grief . This was the poet Beattie . His glossary , which had been printed privately in 1779 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be felt , for him to come forward and do something toward stemming the tide of linguistic corruption which was setting in with increased violence . For Beattie from an early period had taken the English tongue under his particular care . Like most men who with pure zeal but inadequate knowledge devote themselves to this task , it had brought him little but anguish . His later years ? he died in 1803 ? were saddened , not to say rendered miserable , by the prospect of the ruin which in various ways was overtaking the language . His solicitude , unlike Hume 's , was not so much for the purity of his own speech as for the purity of English speech . In particular it grieved him that expres ? sions , from the use of which he had carefully freed his own style , were beginning to be used in South Britain . According to him , Scottish words and phrases were crossing the Tweed in as large numbers as Scotchmen themselves . The English language , as we learn from its linguistic nurses of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . For centuries , if we can trust to contemporary experts , it has been steadily going to the dogs from the increasing prevalence of particular ailments . According to Beattie , one virulent malady from which it was at that time suffering sprang from the tendency it displayed to yield to the temptation of adopting Scotch words and idioms . This the degenerate Englishmen of that day had apparently not virtue enough to resist . This hostility to Scotticisms purely as Scotticisms was on the face of it absurd . The place where a word originates is of little importance as regards either its use or its usefulness . When it presents itself for admission the question that then arises is primarily whether or not it supplies an actual need ; secondarily , whether it is well or ill formed . If it meet these two conditions successfully , the language is enriched by its introduction , not impaired . Accordingly , all this nonsense about Scotticisms it needed only the coining of a man of genius to dissipate . The result was brought about by the rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of Hume and Beattie . He had , indeed , a contempt for the whole generation of purists , which they have never been slow to resent . This he hardly took the pains to conceal . Naturally the fact that he was employing a Scotch word unknown to English readers , or unused by English writers , was one of the last things that would have given him the slightest concern . He had , indeed , no reason to worry himself upon this point . His unbounded popularity caused the expressions he used to pass muster everywhere . He exercised the right with which genius is always endowed of conferring citizenship upon long-forgotten or hitherto unused words by simply using them himself . Even those which he coined under a mistaken conception of their meaning or derivation , like the illegitimate sons of great monarchs , received from his begetting Voc . CXXVI . ? No. 753. - 53 of them a patent of nobility of which later ages have not deprived them . Few of us have any conception of the number of old words and forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the same with the Scotticisms he introduced . Many of them were , of course , forced upon him by the subjects he treated or the characters he depicted . Others could have been avoided by him if ho had so chosen . He did not choose . The universal acceptance of his writings , coupled with the greatness of his genius , was not merely sufficient to overawe critical protest , had it been uttered , but caused some of the words and expressions ho used to become not only familiar but fashionable . With his unhesitating resort to Scotticisms the denunciation of them practically subsided . Accordingly , a certain number of words originally limited to Scottish writers came to be accepted as part of the literary speech of England . Since they served a distinctly valuable use , the question of their origin sank into abeyance . With that the question of their propriety largely disappeared also . The occurrence of any one of them might be noted ; but as a general rule it was no longer imputed as a reproach . The belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued unabated that he knows all the words which belong to the language , and is able to pronounce offhand whether they are pure English or not . Since the opprobrium attaching to a Scottish origin had largely passed away , somebody or some country must he found to bear the burden of introducing words or phrases unfamiliar or objectionable to the writer . With the failure of Scotland to perform this useful function , the rise of America came as a godsend . Americanism became the general term applied to any word or phrase which incurred the dislike of the English reviewer . The number in consequence which ignorance or prejudice has imputed to this country would fill a large volume . It may he remarked in passing that originally the comment or connotation was almost invariably of a disparaging nature . Now it is not unfrequently complimentary . In neither case , however , does America itself often deserve either the blame or the praise . There was a certain palliation for this belief , at least for the ignorance displayed in it , if not for the hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same excuse exists for many of the errors and shortcomings made by earlier workers belonging to this country who have labored in the field of Americanisms . Until lately men had no secure ground upon which to build . They had few means of knowing whether the use of any particular word was peculiar to the United States or not , still fewer means of determining whether the word itself or some special use of it originated here or not . From much the larger proportion of the difficulties which beset the first collectors of Americanisms , real or reputed , we are now happily free . This result has been brought about by the publication of the New Historical Dictionary of the English Language , still unfinished , but now rapidly approaching completion . It is right to say at this point that no one has any business to express an opinion on the correctness or incorrectness of any particular usage without having first consulted carefully the pages of this invaluable work . It effectually disposes of a vast number of blundering statements which have been made about words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made by the ill-informed . The only general fault to be found with it is that too many of its examples are taken from obscure or anonymous writers who in questions of propriety of usage have not the slightest authority whatever . On such disputed points it is the masters of English literature who alone carry weight , not the journeymen workers . For the determination of the genuineness of the words assumed to be Americanisms this work has furthermore an importance which can not be overestimated . Here , indeed , no investigator can dispense with it . This is not to say that all its statements are to be accepted without question . There will be an occasional necessity in these articles to controvert certain of them . For usage here the editors have necessarily been dependent on contributions furnished from this side of the Atlantic . By these they have sometimes been misled ; for the contributors have not always been wise . The chance coinage of the moment by an individual or by a newspaper has been too often diligently collected and forwarded . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attributed to this country , and usually to the whole of it , which either belongs to a particular region or has frequently had a mere momentary existence in the mouth of a single person . Accordingly , the letters " U. S. " in this great dictionary have sometimes to be taken with many more than the usual grains of allowance . But occasional drawbacks do not impair , to any extent worth speaking of , the importance and value of the work , both to the student of usage and to the student of Americanisms . There will be constant occasion to refer to it or the information supplied by it in the course of these articles . For the very reason that there will be need to call in question the correctness of a few of its statements , it seems desirable to emphasize at the outset both one 's own personal obligations to it and its absolute necessity to all interested in the study of English .                    @
