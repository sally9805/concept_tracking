" HERE is a striking similarity in the physical makeup and composition of milk and petroleum and this likeness is carried throughout the natural and artificial treatments they are subjected to . In milk the major part is just plain simple water in which are millions of minute particles floating about . " These small particles are invisible to the naked eye , nor can they be seen in the ordinary powerful microscope . It is only by the use of an ultra-microscope that they can be detected , and then they are seen to be in constant vibration even after the milk has been standing at perfect rest for a long time . The manner in which the ultra-microscope makes it possible to see the minute particles in the milk can be well illustrated by means of a very common and well-known fact . You look across a room or at an object in the room and see with such distinctness that you comment on the perfect clearness of the air . Now darken the room and allow a ray of sunlight to pass through the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rays by innumerable particles of solid matter floating in what you formerly thought was perfectly transparent air . They have been made visible by the sun 's rays when thrown into contrast with the surrounding darkness . So with the ultra-microscope . By means of a ray of arc light minute particles , that are invisible under a powerful microscope , are made visible in the same instrument by means of this bright illumination . These minute particles in vibration are termed , in scientific language , colloids , and the vibratory movement was first seen by a man of the name of Brown , and ever since this movement has been known as the Brownian Movement .  |p465  HOW MILK SEPARATLS INTO ITS PRODUCTS THE fresh milk as taken from the cow is largely or wholly composed of three substances . The greater part is pure , ordinary water . In this water are colloids of two distinct varieties . If a pan of fresh milk be set aside it is only a matter of a few hours until the colloids of one variety collect at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream having been skimmed from the milk and set aside will in a short time sour , an acid having been formed in it . This sourness , or acidity , causes the colloids of the cream to coagulate , or gather together in small globules , which are recognized as fat . The soured cream is next put through a churning process which causes the small globules of fat to unite , forming what we know to be butter , and this when carried to the proper state is removed from the water . Having disposed of our cream by the removal of the colloids as butter , we will now turn to what we ordinarily term our skim-milk , and we find in due time this will also turn sour and the white clatter in the milk coagulate , and perhaps you have seen this product poured into a suitably arranged bag and the water drained out , leaving our cottage cheese in the bag . With the removal of the colloids in the form of cottage cheese and the final elimination of the water we have completed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , butter , cheese and water , and the first step in this separation is the formation by Nature of an acid within the liquid , the presence of this acid being quite essential for the removal of the fats , or food material , from the water with which they are associated . An alkali , such as lime or caustic soda , would have accomplished the same result , but Nature uses an acid as the means . Petroleum as taken from the earth is also full of colloids , but it is not so easy to understand as milk . Its chemical composition is now well known but there has not been a clear comprehension of its physical make-up , and this notwithstanding the fact that the value of petroleum  |p466  largely depends " on'the7physical characteristics of its several components which range from the thin , clear benzine , through our kerosene , fuel and lubricating oils . The thickness , or what is termed viscosity , of these several component parts increases in the same order from the benzine to the heavy lubricating oils . WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of petroleum , by means of the ultra-microscope , discloses the fact that colloids exist in all of them with the exception of the benzine , and , further , that the number of colloids present increases as the petroleum product increases in viscosity , and this , naturally , leads to the idea that the viscosity may be due to the presence of the colloids , but whether that be true is not an assured fact , yet it is a fact that it is to them that lubricating oils owe their greasiness and unctuousness . It is the greasiness of lubricating oil that causes it to adhere to the surface of the shaft and bearings , thereby keeping them separated , while its unctuousness causes easy slipping of the surfaces , and as these two qualities are due to the presence of the colloids , it is evident the real value of the lubricating oil lies in these colloids . As the value of petroleum lubricating oil lies in the colloids present in the oil , and , in turn , the existence of our industrial life depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair understanding of the nature of these all-important ultra-microscopic particles . They have the greasiness and unctuousness of the butter colloids , which are commonly known as fat , hence we can not be much in error if we call the colloids found in petroleum , fat . One we know as an animal fat , and the other we will call petroleum fat . It is quite well understood that an animal fat can not be rubbed off a surface upon which it has been applied , nor will plain water remove it . We use soap and water . Apply such a test as this to a lubricating oil . Take the same oil before and after being subjected to the usual filtering process as carried out by the oil refiners : select four pieces of glass , such for instance as the common glass slide used in  |p467  mounting objects for microscopic examinations : on the center of one slide place a drop of the unfiltered oil and cover the drop with another one of the slides : on the third slide place a drop of the filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking these two sets in your hands between the thumb and fingers , rub them for some minutes , after which place both hands beneath the surface of water and continue rubbing the two sets of slides under the water the same as they were rubbed in the air . In a few minutes it will be found that the two glass plates between which the filtered oil was placed are in contact , the oil having been washed away by the water , whereas the plates between which the unfiltered oil was placed are not in contact , and upon removing the slides from the water it will be found there is a real grease or fat body between the glass plates , and this can not be removed excepting by the use of soap and water . The result of this test can only be construed as proof that the filtering removes valuable fats , the oil being improved in appearance at the expense of its effi. ciency . All colloids are subject to much the same laws . Acids , most alkalies and chemicals generally are poison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown in the case of the soured cream and skim-milk . Another in portant point is that they adhere to any object they are brought in contact with . This fact has been commented on as a valuable one in lubricating when they adhere to the surfaces of the shaft and bearings . Having thus briefly , and in a very general manner , reviewed the characteristics of colloids , and more particularly fat colloids , let us look into the methods usually practised in the so-called refining of petroleum lubricating oil . METHOD OF REFINING LUBRICATING OIL PREVIOUS to the discovery of petroleum in quantity , there was sold on the market for illuminating purposes , what was called " coal oil . " This coal oil in its use was made to ascend a wick , and to do so successfully it was found  |p468  necessary to treat it with sulphuric acid in order to free it from impurities that caused clogging of the wick . This same acid treatment was found necessary with kerosene as taken from petroleum . The preparation of kerosene for the market eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulphuric acid followed by a treatment with caustic soda , followed by washing with water , followed by filtration through fullers ' earth . It would not be expected that any fat colloids present in the crude kerosene would escape this extended chemical and filtration treatment . Nevertheless some of them do , as can be seen in an ultramicroscope . It is the presence of these few fat colloids in kerosene that causes this liquid to produce a grease spot or stain on any fabric it is brought in contact with . The main purpose of the chemical and filtration treatment of kerosene is to remove the fat colloids . It may be found difficult to believe that this highly successful method of removing the fat from kerosene would be used in the treatment of lubricating oils , for their worth is wholly due to them , but nevertheless such is the fact . A number of methods and processes are practiced in the treatment of lubricating oils , but each of them contain all or a part of the steps practiced with kerosene . In some cases as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the treatment with sulphuric acid , and still other amounts are lost in the caustic soda and filtration treatment , and these losses are largely due to the removal of fat . When it be recalled that at least one-half of the coal consumed in making steam to run manufacturing plants is wholly lost in friction , and that our lubricating oils are used to reduce or prevent friction , any treatment that tends to diminish the lubricating value of the oil should be looked upon with pronounced disfavor . IMPROVING OIL 'S APPEARANCE COSTLY U NDOUBTEDLY the processes through which the oils are passed improve their appearance immensely because the presence of the fat colloids tends to produce a dark and  |p469  rather unpleasing appearance , and this is quite objectionable from a salesman 's point of view . The public , and more particularly the manufacturers , should not be interested in the color of an oil . They should demand of the oil salesman some proof as to the lubricating values of the oils he offers for sale . Evidently the refiners must know their refining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidenced by the fact that they use black oil that has not been subjected to a high degree of refining when they themselves undertake extensive lubrication , as in railroad-car journals . The more thoroughly the question of lubrication is studied , the more positive the conviction becomes of the truth of the statement recently made by Mr. W. B. Hardy , F. R. S. , Secretary of the Royal Society of England , that " the problem of lubrication is merely a special problem of colloidal physics . "  |p470
