txt George W. Perkins said last night that he had no intention of retiring as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the I Progressive National Committee . This statement was made after the full text of the much discussed letter written by Amos R. E. Pinchot , a Progressive of first prominence , to Chairman Joseph M. Dixon of the National Progressive Committee and the other members of that body had been made public . In this letter Mr. Pinchot denounces Mr. Perkins as a friend of the trusts and an enemy of labor , declares that the Mancier is too heavy a load for the Progressive Party to carry through another campaign , and calls for his immediate retirement as Chairman of the Execu ' tive Committee . " I know that what Mr. Pinchot says can not drive me out of the Progressive Party , " said Mr. Perkins at his home in Riverdale last night " I do n't think Mr. Pinchot 's letter will either help or hurt him . I do n't think anything will happen as a result of the letter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mine to the Progressive Party . " A copy of the Pinchot letter was forwarded to Mr. Perkins by Chairman Dixon shortly after it was written on May 23 . Col. Roosevelt also had a copy before he sailed for Spain . " I think I am warranted in saying , " Mr. Pinchot wrote , " that in view of the approaching election and the facts I have stated in my letter , the rank and file of the Progressive Party and ' a majority of its leaders feel that the resignation of Mr. Perkins as Chairman of the Executive Committee is necessary . I am sure that upon re ' flection you will agree as will Mr. Perkins himself that the success of the party demands such action immediately . " Mr. Perkins InperturnbIe . When Mr. Perkins was asked what he had to say about the Pinchot letter , he declined to enter upon any exhaustive discussion of the points made against him by his fellow Progressive . " /Ao n't question Mr. Pinchot 's sincerity ; " he said . " I have known his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a discussion of our differences would not do any good . The whole thing resolves itself to this ? we differ on several questions now before the country . We probably always have differed and we probably always will . I regard it as a case of honest I difference of opinion on both sides . Mr. Pinchot is privileged to think as he pleases and I shall certainly cling to I my opinions . " " Are you going to make any reply either to Mr. Pinchot or to the Na-tional Committee of the Progressive Party ? " Mr. Perkins was asked . " I have no such intention , " said Mr. Perkins . " Mr. Pinchot 's letter is his expression of opinion . I knew before he wrote how he felt and he knew how I felt . I think the party leaders are equally well aware of our views , and that these differ . I do not see why I should write to the committee members when what I could write would not be news to them . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That is not for me to say , " said Mr. Perkins . " The Progressive National Committee can do whatever it pleases . I shall neither instigate nor encourage any action , but I can not speak for the committee . " Mr. Perkins would not discuss the obvious attempt made by Mr. Pinchot to have it appear that he ( Perkins ) was responsible for the appearance in the newspapers at the time of the Bull Moose National Convention of copies of the platform in which the trust plank had been " doctored " to suit Mr. Perkins 's views . How closely those views correspond with the views expressed by Col. Roosevelt about the time he made his distinction between " good " and " bad " trusts has been a matter of general comment . Col. Roosevelt while President expressed himself in favor of ' trust regulation by the Federal Government . Mr. Pinehot 's Letter , " A situation exists within the Progressive Party which must be terminated before it can command general popular support , " Mr. Pinchot wrote . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An element in our party leadership , headed by Mr. George W. Perkins , the present Chairman of the National ' ExI ecutive Committee , favors the protection of private monopoly in American industry , and , since the party 's forma1 tion , has been taking active steps to commit the party to that policy . ( 2 ) I The Chairman of our Executive Committee Is actively opposed to the recognition of labor 's right to organize and deal with capital through labor unions , and has frequently gone on record to this effect . Our party is therefore subject to the effect that it is lukewarm . or even antagonistic to the interests of organized wage earners . On both these subjects the Progressive Party has placed itself positively and definitely on record in opposition to Mr. Perkins . But the fact that the executive leader and recognized spokesman of the party is an active member of the governing committees of the Steel Corporation and the International Harvester Company , the two great monopolies which have succeeded most completely in exploiting the public and crushing organized labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public mind . " Through the Progressive Party 's official bulletin , through public speeches and interviews , and in pamphlets , printed as Progressive Party literature and distributed from the party 's headquarters in New York and Washington . Mr. Perkins has conducted an extensive pro-trust propaganda calculated to convince the party and the public that the trusts are useful and sacred institutions ; that those who attack them are bent upon the destruction of all healthy industry on a large scale , and , finally , that the Progressive Party fully agrees with him in these views . The result is that we have been placed in a false and fatal position . Our sincerity has been attacked . Our energy is largely expended in defending ourselves . Ana we are constantly under the embarrassing necessity of explaining that the party stands for something directly contrary to that which the spokesman and executive leader says it stands for. , " Ur . Perkins'a *pro-trust activity within the Progressive Party began soon after the party 's formation . It has continued until the present titre . Sherman Law In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 Mr. Perkins vigorously opposed putting any indorsement or approval of the Sherman law in the Progressive Platform . The Resolution Committee , however , took the opposite view and inserted a clause in the trust plank indorsing the Sherman law and recommending that it should be strengthened . " If the clause referred to above had been left out of the trust plank and the Progressives had won in 1912 , no matter what stand our individual candidates might have taken we would not have been committed , as a party , either to the enforcement of the Sherman law or to an anti-monopoly policy . Mr. Perkins in his fight against the indorsement of the Sherman law in our platform represented the demand of America 's monopoly group . The Resolutions Committee , on the other hand , took the position of the party and the public . " A trust plank , including a clause relating to the Sherman law , was , accordingly , passed by the Resolutions Committee . It was read to and adopted by the convention . Mr. Perkins and myself were both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this clause was cut from the version of the platform furnished to the press associations and omitted from the copies of the platform which were printed and issued in large quantities during the campaign from Progressive headquarters . I am assured on the best authority that those responsible for cutting the clause referring to the Sherman law from the platform did so under the impression that it had never been adopted by the Resolutions Committee and that it was read to the convention by mistake . I do not question this statement . I do not say that Mr. Perkins had anything to do with this expurgation or with giving the gentlemen who directed it the impression that the clause was read to the convention by mistake . But I do say that if it had not been for Mr. Perkins 's fight against the Sherman law while the platform was being drawn there would have been no misunderstanding and the party would never have been led into a false and indefensible position . " Later on , at my insistence and after considerable controversy , the missing clause was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1912 , and January , 1913 . It is all a matter of party history . " The Bulletin a Perkins Organ . At this point the Pinchot letter recalls the fact that in August , 1912 , the Progressive Party began to publish The Progressive Bulletin as a party organ , with Mr. Perkins personally directing its policy . He writes : " It has been consistently and , I think unwisely , used as Mr. Perkins 's personal organ , to defend the trusts , to attack the Sherman law , and to glorify the two great monopolies of which Mr. Perkins is respectively a Director and a member of the finance , or governing , committee . And , finally , it has been regularly employed to ram home the conception that our party did not indorse the Sherman law and is hostile to it . " In the very first issue of The Bulletin , Mr. Pinchot writes . was published an editorial article eulogizing the late E. H. Harriman , J. P. Morgan , and  --  George W. Perkins . Mr. Pinchot , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The country needs the work of such men as E. II . Harriman , powerful enough and strong enough to build thousands upon thousands of miles of railroad in a life that ended too soon . The country needs the imagination and power of such men as J. Pierpont Morgan , wasting his energies now in the accumulation of money that does him no good and spending the money in the accumulation of collections that will do him no good  --  although they may be useful to the country in the future . ? ? ? One such man as George Perkins , giving to the business of the people the energy and capacity that he has given to private business undertakings , would be a good , new thing in politics and a useful man in government . ? ? ? Mr. Perkins directs the financial and practical management of the . Roosevelt party  --  luckily for the party . ' Both in the first issue and in the next , according to the Pinchot letter . there appeared digests of the Progressive platform , with the trust plank shorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issue of Sept. 23 , the letter says , an editorial appeared condemning the Sherman law , condemning the trust policy of the older parties , and winding up with this declaration : " The Progressive Party begins with the sane belief  --  backed by the economic experience of the whole world for a full generation  --  that competition may be harmful and combination salutary . It is only from this point of view that any solution of the trust problem will ever be found . " Several subsequent issues of The Bulletin , according to Mr. Pinchot 's letter , contained articles condemning the Sherman law and denouncing attacks on the trusts . All this was while the Presidential campaign was in progress . About election time a halt was called in response to a very vigorous protest against the Perkins pro-trust ptopaganda . In June , 1913 , however , The Bulletin published a eulogy of the welfare work conducted by the International Harvester Company , one of the large corporations in which Mr. Perkins is a director . This was followed by a defense of the Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg on which to hang a eulogy of the trust which , In this instance , came coupled with an explanation of how the application of the Sherman law had worked a hardship on the people of Missouri . " Is Perkins Honest ? " Mr. Pinchot relates how a Progressive letter in Colorado asked National Progressive Headquarters to send him some Progressive literature . Mr. Perkins responded promptly by shipping several crates filled with a pamphlet entitled , " Is Perkins Honest ? " The Colorado Bull Moose leader was compelled to pay $80 express charges on the consignment . Mr. Pinchot , in his letter , gives these interesting extracts from the Perkins Honesty pamphlet : " It was the night before Albert J. Beveridge delivered his keynote speech of the new political crusade . He asked Col. Roosevelt , George W. Perkins and a few other leaders to come to his room and hear him read the manuscript . The reading proceeded in tense silence . Beveridge was evidently laboring under emotion , and Col , Roosevelt was himself visibly moved . But on George Perkins 's cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those passages in which he outlined the course of justice for the men Who make the nation , Perkins , with a sob he could not stifle , hastily left the room and paced the corridors to regain his self-control . ? ? ? He saw that the world of business was built on what he calls the three Ms  --  men , money and machinery . ? His gospel was that justice promotes peace , and peace promotes prosperity , and that the workman 's prosperity was necessary to the business men 's prosperity . He put loyalty on the books as a commodity no concern could continue without . " He went to the Morgans and the Garys and the Rockefeliers and the McCormicks and showed them that any great business was a partnership between Directors and workmen , and that the denial of that partnership was what caused all the industrial trouble of the times . He tried to demonstrate to them that the fostering of the spirit of partnership in a substantial way , by making it a partnership in profits as well as work , was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he convinced them , and now his schemes are all at work , but only in those few factories where he was personally interested . ? a ? " So he left the banking firm of J. Pierpont Morgan . It was said at the time there was some difference between him and Mr. Morgan . Undoubtedly there was . This able younger man , always planning aomething ? for the first M of business , was sometimes uncomfortable to have about . When Perkins left he gave out a statement to the effect that his next job would be the solution of industrial problems , the bring. ! inr : fit ut a batter tahlerala44graad a more equitable distribution of the goid. things produced equally by labor and capital , ? ? ? Mr. Perkins was the American business man to do the square thing without having it forced upon him . He wants him to see that the square deal is not business loss , but business gain . He wants , in his own phrase . to Peopleize ? industry . It is brotherhood brought down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet to the rich . Other men are able to tell the masses what they ought to have . But Perkins , with his proved business ability , his immense practical experience , his complete knowledge of the situation from the rich man 's point of view , Is able to tell the captains of industry what THEY ought to DO to be saved . ? ? ? These are the facts of his life , as interpreted by himself , and as verified by his acts . They may serve to answer the question , ' Is Perkins honest ? ' " The Company Store . The Pinchot letter continues : " Apropos of this pamphlet , Mr. Perkins has frequently assured the public that the Steel Corporation has not crushed labor organizations . He says it has merely persuaded the men that it is better for them not to organize , inasmuch as it is the policy of the company to make each employe a partner and ' bring down brotherhood to the pay envelope . ' In spite of this we find that in 1902 the corporation organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of life . I do not know how much actual money was put into this company , but it was capitalized at $500,000 . I also do not know how much , if anything , the company put back in the business after paying dividends . The first year . 1903 , it did not pay anything at all . In 1904 R. paid in dividends $250,000 ; in 1905 , $g405 , - 000 ' in 1906 , $805,000 ? in 1907 , $500.000 ; in 1908 , $320,000 ; in 1009 , $440,000 , and in 1910. $520.000. or 104 per cent . on its capitalization . These earnings taken out of the wages of the employes of the corporation seem a little excessive , and suggest inconsistency with the co-operative brotherhood theory . " Mr. Pinchot quotes some testimony regarding conditions of employment in the Steel Corporation given before the Stanley committee about the same time by Louis D. Brandeis , and says : Mr. Brandeis might have included the Harvester Trust in this statement , for , according to the report of the New York Factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar to those in the Steel Corporation . " The letter says that while the Presidential campaign was in progress Mr. Perkins issued as Progressive Party literature a pamphlet explaining the contribution of $48,500 which he made to the Republican National Committee in 1904 out of the funds of the New York Life Insurance Company , and adds : " In fact , the number of pamphlets written by Mr. Perkins and his associates , largely in defense of Mr. Perkins and of big business , and issued as Progressive Party literature , seems to have been almost as great as those containing the utterances of Col. Roosevelt and Gov . Johnson combined . " Mr. Pinchot goes on to say that in his capacity as Executive Chairman Mr. Perkins hag made speeches and given out newspaper interviews defending the trusts , thus creating a false impression among the public relative to the attitude on the trust question . Admits They Took His Money . " I do not say that I am right and Mr. Perkins is wrong about monopoly , " writes Mr. Pinchot , " or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its destruction of competition , its gigantic monopoly profits , and its denial of the rights and liberties of its army of dependents , may not be a good thing for this country . But I do say that . if even an angel with a fiery sword should descend from Heaven , at this time , and try to persuade the people of United nited States to love the trusts and vote for those who protect them , he would make very little headway before election day  --  even with the assistance of Mr. Perkins 's pamphlets . " When , a year and a half ago , a few of us talked of making a public protest against Mr. Perkins remaining Chairman of the Executive Committee of the party , we were prevented by the consideration that to accept Mr. Perkins 's money and industry during the campaign , and then turn upon him as soon as we were defeated , would be ungrateful and unfair . But to wait until after the Fall election now  --  until after Mr. Perkins has once more given us the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this protest . would be still more unfair . It would be as unfair to Mr. Perkins as to the Progressive Party . If we are ever to protest against trust leadership in the Progressive Party , we must do it now . We must prepare our party for action and rid ourselves of all unnecessary handicaps . Practically all the wage earners working in the industrial plants in the United States know the labor records of the Steel and Harvester trusts . They know that Mr. Perkins 's name has been repeatedly signed to resolutions of the Steel Corporation declaring against organization within its plants . They are aware that Mr. Perkins 's views on the most critical issues between capital and organized labor coincide cosely with those of John D. Rockefeller , Jr . "
