A GOOD SPORT I was a little lad , and the older boys called to me from the pier : They called to me : ' Be a sport : be a sport ! Leap in and swim ! ' I leaped in and swam , though I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , and they all shouted : ' Well done ! Well done , Brave boy , you are a sport , a good sport ! ' And I was very glad . But now I wish I had learned to swim the right way , Or had never learned at all . Now I regret that day , For it led to my fall . I was a youth , and I heard the older men talking of the road to wealth ; They talked of bulls and bears , of buying on margins , And they said , ' Be a sport , my boy , plunge in and win or lose it all ! It is the only way to fortune . ' So I plunged in and won ; and the older men patted me on the back , And they said , ' You are a sport , my boy , a good sport ! ' And I was very glad . But now I wish I had lost all I ventured on that day - Yes , wish I had lost it all . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fall . I was a young man , and the gay world called me to come ; Gay women and gay men called to me , crying : ' Be a sport ; be a good sport ! Fill our glasses and let us fill yours . We are young but once ; let us dance and sing , And drive the dull hours of night until they stand at bay Against the shining bayonets of day . ' So I filled my glass , and I filled their glasses , over and over again , And I sang and danced and drank , and drank and danced and sang , And I heard them cry , ' He is a sport , a good sport ! ' As they held their glasses out to be filled again . And I was very glad . Oh the madness of youth and song and dance and wine , Of woman 's eyes and lips , when the night dies in the arms of dawn ! And now I wish I had not gone that way . Now I wish I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good sport ! ' For I am old who should be young . The splendid vigour of my youth I flung Under the feet of a mad , unthinking throng . My strength went out with wine and dance and song ; Unto the winds of earth I tossed like chaff , With idle jest and laugh , The pride of splendid manhood , all its wealth Of unused power and health - Its dream of looking into some pure girl 's eyes And finding there its earthly paradise - Its hope of virile children free from blight - Its thoughts of climbing to some noble height Of great achievement  --  all these gifts divine I cast away for song and dance and wine . Oh , I have been a sport , a good sport ; But I am very sad . A SON SPEAKS Mother , sit down , for I have much to say Anent this widespread ever-growing theme Of woman and her virtues and her rights . I left you for the large , loud world of men , When I had lived one little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my heart Was filled with high esteem and reverence For your angelic sex ; and for the wives , The sisters , daughters , mothers of my friends I held but holy thoughts . To fallen stars ( Of whom you told me in our last sweet talk , Warning me of the dangers in my path ) I gave wide pity as you bade me to , Saying their sins harked back to my base sex . Now listen , mother mine : Ten years have passed Since that clean-minded and pure-bodied youth , Thinking to write his name upon the stars , Went from your presence . He returns to you Fallen from his altitude of thought , Hiding deep scars of sins upon his soul , His fair illusions shattered and destroyed . And would you know the story of his fall ? He sat beside a good man 's honoured wife At her own table . She was beautiful As woods in early autumn . Full of soft And subtle witcheries of voice and look - His senior , both in knowledge and in years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April sunlight when it falls Upon a blooming tree , until she leaned So close her rounded body sent quick thrills Along his nerves . He thought it accident , And moved a little ; soon she leaned again . The half-hid beauties of her heaving breast Rising and falling under scented lace , The teasing tendrils of her fragrant hair , With intermittent touches on his cheek , Changed the boy 's interest to a man 's desire . She saw that first young madness in his eyes And smiled and fanned the flame . That was his fall ; And as some mangled fly may crawl away And leave his wings behind him in the web , So were his wings of faith in womanhood Left in the meshes of her sensuous net . The youth , forced into sudden manhood , went Seeking the lost ideal of his dreams . He met , in churches and in drawing-rooms , Women who wore the mask of innocence And basked in public favour , yet who seemed To find their pleasure playing with men 's hearts , As children play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell dull upon his ears ) The unsolicited complaints of wives And mothers all unsatisfied with life , While crowned with every blessing earth can give Longing for God knows what to bring content , And openly or with appealing look Asking for sympathy . ( The first blind step That leads from wifely honour down to shame , Is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy . ) He saw proud women who would flush and pale With sense of outraged modesty if one Spoke of the ancient sin before them , bare To all men 's sight , or flimsily conceal By veils that bid adventurous eyes proceed , Charms meant alone for lover and for child . He saw chaste virgins tempt and tantalise , Lure and deny , invite  --  and then refuse , And drive men forth half crazed to wantons ' arms . Mother , you taught me there were but two kinds Of women in the world  --  the good and bad . But you have been too sheltered in the safe , Old-fashioned sweetness of your quiet life , To know how women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I have been more tempted and more shocked By belles and beauties in the social whirl , By trusted wives and mothers in their homes , Than by the women of the underworld Who sell their favours . Do you think me mad ? No , mother ; I am sane , but very sad . I miss my boyhood 's faith in woman 's worth - Torn from my heart , by ' good folks ' of the earth . THE YOUNGER BORN The modern English-speaking young girl is the astonishment of the world and the despair of the older generation . Nothing like her has ever been seen or heard before . Alike in drawing-rooms and the amusement places of the people , she defies conventions in dress , speech , and conduct . She is bold , yet not immoral . She is immodest , yet she is chaste . She has no ideals , yet she is kind and generous . She is an anomaly and a paradox . We are the little daughters of Time and the World his wife , We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are marred with our mother 's follies and torn with our father 's strife . We are the little daughters of the modern world , And Time , her spouse . She has brought many children to our father 's house Before we came , when both our parents were content With simple pleasures and with quiet homely ways . Modest and mild Were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days , Modest and mild . But Father Time grew restless and longed for a swifter pace , And our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender grace , And life was no more living but just a headlong race . And we are wild - Yea , wild are we , the younger born of the World Into life 's vortex hurled . With the milk of our mother 's breast We drank her own unrest , And we learned our speech from Time Who scoffs at the things sublime . Time and the World have hurried so They could not help their younger born to grow ; We only follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them as they ran ; There was but one goal , pleasure , for Woman or for Man , And they robbed the nights of slumber to lengthen the days ' brief span . We are the demi-virgins of the modern day ; All evil on the earth is known to us in thought , But yet we do it not . We bare our beauteous bodies to the gaze of men , We lure them , tempt them , lead them on , and then Lightly we turn away . By strong compelling passion we are never stirred ; To us it is a word - A word much used when tragic tales are told ; We are the younger born , yet we are very old In understanding , and our knowledge makes us bold . Boldly we look at life , Loving its stress and strife , And hating all conventions that may mean restraint , Yet shunning sin 's black taint . We know wine 's taste ; And the young-maiden bloom and sweetness of our lips Is often in eclipse Under the brown weed 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large capacity for joy or pain , But an insatiable appetite for pleasure . We have no use for leisure And never learned the meaning of that word ' repose . ' Life as it goes Must spell excitement for us , be the cost what may . Speeding along the way , We ofttimes pause to do some generous little deed , And fill the cup of need ; For we are kind at heart , Though with less heart than head , Unmoral , not immoral , when the worst is said ; We are the product of the modern day . We are the little daughters of Time and the World his wife , We are not like the children , born in their younger life , We are marred with our mother 's follies and torn with our father 's strife . HAPPINESS There are so many little things that make life beautiful . I can recall a day in early youth when I was longing for happiness . Toward the western hills I gazed , watching for its approach . The hills lay between me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When some traveller crossed the hill , always a fine grey dust rose cloudless against the sky . The traveller I could not distinguish , but the dust-cloud I could see . And the dust-cloud seemed formed of hopes and possibilities  --  each speck an embryo event . At sunset , when the skies were fair , the dust-cloud grew radiant and shone with visions . The happiness for which I waited came not to me adown that western slope , But now I can recall the cloud of golden dust , the sunset , and the highway leading over the hill , The wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart , the visions of youth in my eyes ; and I know this was happiness . There are so many little things that make life beautiful . I can recall another day when I rebelled at life 's monotony . Everywhere about me was the commonplace ; and nothing seemed to happen . Each day was like its yesterday , and to-morrow gave no promise of change . My young heart rose rebellious in my breast ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June . I sent out a dumb cry to Fate , demanding larger joys and more delight . I ran blindly into a field of blooming clover . It was breast-high , and billowed about me like rose-red waves of a fragrant sea . The bees were singing above it ; and their little brown bodies were loaded with honey-dew , extracted from the clover blossoms . The sun reeled in the heavens dizzy with its own splendour . The day went into night , without bringing any new event to change my life . But now I recall the field of blooming clover , and the honey-laden bees , the glorious June sunlight , and the passion of youth in my heart ; and I know that was happiness . There are so many little things that make life beautiful . Yesterday a failure stared me in the face , where I had thought to welcome proud success . There was no radiant cloud of dust against the western sky , and no clover field lying fragrant under mid-June suns , Neither was youth with me any more . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock of birds sought shelter just at twilight ; And , standing at my casement , I could hear the twitter of their voices and the soft , sweet flutter of their wings . Then over me there fell a sense of peace and calm , and love for all created things , and trust illimitable . And that I knew was happiness . There are so many little things to make life beautiful . SEEKING FOR HAPPINESS Seeking for happiness we must go slowly ; The road leads not down avenues of haste ; But often gently winds through by ways lowly , Whose hidden pleasures are serene and chaste Seeking for happiness we must take heed Of simple joys that are not found in speed . Eager for noon-time 's large effulgent splendour , Too oft we miss the beauty of the dawn , Which tiptoes by us , evanescent , tender , Its pure delights unrecognised till gone . Seeking for happiness we needs must care For all the little things that make life fair . Dreaming of future pleasures and achievements We must not let to-day starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bereavements Before we count the riches in our store . Seeking for happiness we must prize this - Not what will be , or was , but that which IS . In simple pathways hand in hand with duty ( With faith and love , too , ever at her side ) , May happiness be met in all her beauty The while we search for her both far and wide . Seeking for happiness we find the way Doing the things we ought to do each day . THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY Said Willie to Tom , ' Let us hie away To the wonderful Island of Endless Play . It lies off the border of " No School Land , " And abounds with pleasure , I understand . There boys go swimming whenever they please In a lovely river right under the trees . And marbles are free , so you need not buy ; And kites of all sizes are ready to fly . We sail down the Isthmus of Idle Delight - We sail and we sail for a day and a night . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in the Harbour of Do-as-You-Please . And there lies the Island of Endless Play , With no one to say to us , Must , or Nay . Books are not known in that land so fair , Teachers are stoned if they set foot there . Hurrah for the Island , so glad and free , That is the country for you and me . ' So away went Willie and Tom together On a pleasure boat , in the lazy weather , And they sailed in the teeth of a friendly breeze Right into the harbour of ' Do-as-You-Please . ' Where boats and tackle and marbles and kites Were waiting them there in this Land of Delights . They dwelt on the Island of Endless Play For five long years ; then one sad day A strange , dark ship sailed up to the strand , And ' Ho ! for the voyage to Stupid Land , ' The captain cried , with a terrible noise , As he seized the frightened and struggling boys And threw them into the dark ship 's hold ; And off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to let them out , He answered only with scoff and shout . ' Boys that do n't study or work , ' said he , ' Must sail one day down the Ignorant Sea To Stupid Land by the No-Book Strait , With Captain Time on the Pitiless Fate . ' He let out the sails and away went the three Over the waters of Ignorant Sea , Out and away to Stupid Land ; And they live there yet , I understand . And there 's where every one goes , they say , Who seeks the Island of Endless Play . THE RIVER OF SLEEP There are curious isles in the River of Sleep , Curious isles without number . We 'll visit them all as we leisurely creep Down the winding stream whose current is deep , In our beautiful barge of Slumber . The very first isle in this wonderful stream Quite close to the shore is lying , And after a supper of cakes and cream We come to the Night-Mare-Isle with a scream , And hurry away from it crying . And next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winds are only a perfumed sigh , And the birds that sing in the treetops try To imitate Mothers ' voices . A little beyond is the Isle-of-Dreams ; Oh , that is the place to be straying . Everything there is just as it seems ; Dolls are real and sunshine gleams , And no one calls us from playing . And then we come to the drollest isle , And the funniest sounds come pouring Down from its borderlands once in a while , And we lean o'er our barge and listen and smile ; For that is the Isle-of-Snoring . And the very last isle in the River of Sleep Is the sunshiny Isle-of-Waking . We see it first with our eyes a-peep , And we give a yawn  --  then away we leap , The barge of Slumber forsaking . THE THINGS THAT COUNT Now , dear , it is n't the bold things , Great deeds of valour and might , That count the most in the summing up of life at the end of the day . But it is the doing of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And doing them over and over again , no matter what others say ; In smiling at fate , when you want to cry , and in keeping at work when you want to play - Dear , those are the things that count . And , dear , it is n't the new ways Where the wonder-seekers crowd That lead us into the land of content , or help us to find our own . But it is keeping to true ways , Though the music is not so loud , And there may be many a shadowed spot where we journey along alone ; In flinging a prayer at the face of fear , and in changing into a song a groan - Dear , these are the things that count . My dear , it is n't the loud part Of creeds that are pleasing to God , Not the chant of a prayer , or the hum of a hymn , or a jubilant shout or song . But it is the beautiful proud part Of walking with feet faith-shod ; And in loving , loving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; In trusting ever , though dark the day , and in keeping your hope when the way seems long - Dear , these are the things that count . LIMITLESS When the motive is right and the will is strong There are no limits to human power ; For that great Force back of us moves along And takes us with it , in trial 's hour . And whatever the height you yearn to climb , Though it never was trod by the foot of man , And no matter how steep  --  I say you CAN , If you will be patient  --  and use your time . WHAT THEY SAW Sad man , Sad man , tell me , pray , What did you see to-day ? I saw the unloved and unhappy old , waiting for slow delinquent death to come ; Pale little children toiling for the rich , in rooms where sunlight is ashamed to go ; The awful almshouse , where the living dead rot slowly in their hideous open graves . And there were shameful things . Soldiers and forts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil-birds , All bent on slaughter and destruction . These and yet more shameful things mine eyes beheld : Old men upon lascivious conquest bent , and young men living with no thought of God , And half-clothed women puffing at a weed , aping the vices of the underworld , Engrossed in shallow pleasures and intent on being barren wives . These things I saw . ( How God must loathe His earth ! ) Glad man , Glad man , tell me , pray . What did you see to-day ? I saw an aged couple , in whose eyes Shone that deep light of mingled love and faith , Which makes the earth one room of paradise , And leaves no sting in death . I saw vast regiments of children pour , Rank after rank , out of the schoolroom door By Progress mobilised . They seemed to say : ' Let ignorance make way . We are the heralds of a better day . ' I saw the college and the church that stood For all things sane and good . I saw God 's helpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope to come , And True Religion , from the grave of creeds , Springing to meet man 's needs . I saw great Science reverently stand And listen for a sound from Border-land , No longer arrogant with unbelief - Holding itself aloof - But drawing near , and searching high and low For that complete and all-convincing proof Which shall permit its voice to comfort grief , Saying , ' We know . ' I saw fair women in their radiance rise And trample old traditions in the dust . Looking in their clear eyes , I seemed to hear these words as from the skies : ' He who would father our sweet children must Be worthy of the trust . ' Against the rosy dawn , I saw unfurled The banner of the race we usher in , The supermen and women of the world , Who make no code of sex to cover sin ; Before they till the soil of parenthood , They look to it that seed and soil are good . And I saw , too , that old , old sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the breast . These things I saw . ( How God must love His earth ! ) THE CONVENTION From the Queen Bee mother , the mother Beast , and the mother Fowl in the fen , A call went up to the human world , to Woman , the mother of men . The call said , ' Come : for we , the dumb , are given speech for a day , And the things we have thought for a thousand years we are going at last to say . ' Much they marvelled , these women of earth , at the strange and curious call , And some of them laughed , and some of them sneered , but they answered it one and all , For they wanted to hear what never before was heard since the world began - The spoken word of Beast and Bird , and the message it held for Man . ' A plea for shelter , ' the woman said , ' or food in the wintry weathers , Or a foolish request that we be dressed without their furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor dumb things , but they must be sensible . ' Then The meeting was called and a she-bear stood and voiced the thought of the fen . ' Now this is the message we give to you ' ( it was thus the she-bear spake ) : ' You the creatures of homes and shrines , and we of the wold and brake , We have no churches , we have no schools , and our minds you question and doubt , But we follow the laws which some Great Cause , alike for us all , laid out . ' We eat and we drink to live ; we shun the things that poison and kill , And we settle the problems of sex and birth by the law of the female will , For never was one of us known by a male , or made to mother its kind , Unless there went from our minds consent ( or from what we call the mind ) . ' But you , the highest of all she-things , you gorge yourselves at your feasts , And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard of beasts ; For a ring , a roof and a rag , you are bought by your males , to have and to hold , And you mate and you breed without nature 's need , while your hearts and your bodies are cold . ' All unwanted your offspring come , or you slay them before they are born ; And now the wild she-things of the earth have spoken and told their scorn . We have no mind and we have no souls , maybe as you think  --  And still , Never one of us ate or drank the things that poison and kill , And never was one of us known by a male except by our wish and will . ' PROTEST To sit in silence when we should protest Makes cowards out of men . The human race Has climbed on protest . Had no voice been raised Against injustice , ignorance and lust The Inquisition yet would serve the law And guillotines decide our least disputes . The few who dare must speak and speak again To right the wrongs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this great day and land Can gag or throttle ; Press and voice may cry Loud disapproval of existing ills , May criticise oppression and condemn The lawlessness of wealth-protecting laws That let the children and child-bearers toil To purchase ease for idle millionaires . Therefore do I protest against the boast Of independence in this mighty land . Call no chain strong which holds one rusted link , Call no land free that holds one fettered slave . Until the manacled , slim wrists of babes Are loosed to toss in childish sport and glee ; Until the Mother bears no burden save The precious one beneath her heart ; until God 's soil is rescued from the clutch of greed And given back to labour , let no man Call this the Land of Freedom . A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT All that a man can say of woman 's charms , Mine eyes have spoken and my lips have told To you a thousand times . Your perfect arms ( A replica from that lost Melos mould ) , The fair firm crescents of your bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Your eyes ( that mask with innocence their smile ) , The ( artful ) artlessness of all your ways , Your kiss-provoking mouth , its lure , its guile - All these have had my fond and frequent praise . And something more than praise to you I gave - Something which made you know me as your slave . Yet slaves , at times , grow mutinous and rebel . Here in this morning hour , from you apart , The mood is on me to be frank and tell The thoughts long hidden deep down in my heart . These thoughts are bitter  --  thorny plants , that grew Below the flowers of praise I plucked for you . Those flowery praises led you to suppose You were my benefactor . Well , in truth , When lovely woman on dull man bestows Sweet favours of her beauty and her youth , He is her debtor . I am yours : and yet You robbed me while you placed me thus in debt . I owe you for keen moments when you stirred My senses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) belied the prudent word Your curled lips uttered . You are worldly wise , And while you like to set men 's hearts on flame , You take no risks in that old passion-game . The carnal , common self of dual me Found pleasure in this danger play of yours . ( An egotist , man always thinks to be The victor , if his patience but endures , And holds in leash the hounds of fierce desire , Until the silly woman 's heart takes fire . ) But now it is the Higher Self who speaks - The Me of me  --  the inner Man  --  the real - Whoever dreams his dream and ever seeks To bring to earth his beautiful ideal . That lifelong dream with all its promised joy Your soft bedevilments have helped destroy . Woman , how can I hope for happy life In days to come at my own nuptial hearth , When you who bear the honoured name of wife So lightly hold the dearest gifts of earth ? Descending from your pedestal , alas ! You shake the pedestals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a thief Who breaks into the temple of men 's souls , And steals the golden vessels of belief , The swinging censers , and the incense bowls . All women seem less loyal and less true , Less worthy of men 's faith since I met you . THE SUPERWOMAN What will the superwoman be , of whom we sing - She who is coming over the dim border Of Far To-morrow , after earth 's disorder Is tidied up by Time ? What will she bring To make life better on tempestuous earth ? How will her worth Be greater than her forbears ? What new power Within her being will burst into flower ? She will bring beauty , not the transient dower Of adolescence which departs with youth - But beauty based on knowledge of the truth Of its eternal message and the source Of all its potent force . Her outer being by the inner thought Shall into lasting loveliness be wrought . She will bring virtue ; but it will not be The pale , white blossom of cold chastity Which hides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or angel , but the superwoman - Mother and mate and friend of superman . She will bring strength to aid the larger Plan , Wisdom and strength and sweetness all combined , Drawn from the Cosmic Mind - Wisdom to act , strength to attain , And sweetness that finds growth in joy or pain . She will bring that large virtue , self-control , And cherish it as her supremest treasure . Not at the call of sense or for man 's pleasure Will she invite from space an embryo soul , To live on earth again in mortal fashion , Unless love stirs her with divinest passion . To motherhood she will bring common sense - That most uncommon virtue . She will give Love that is more than she-wolf violence ( Which slaughters others that its own may live ) . Love that will help each little tendril mind To grow and climb ; Love that will know the lordliest use of Time In training human egos to be kind . She will be formed to guide , but not to lead - Leaders are ever lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mate , Loved , loving , and with insight fine and clear , Which casts its searchlight on the course of fate , And to the leaders says , ' Proceed ' or ' Wait . ' And best of all , she will bring holy faith To penetrate the shadowy world of death , And show the road beyond it , bright and broad , That leads straight up to God . CERTITUDE There was a time when I was confident That God 's stupendous mystery of birth Was mine to know . The wonder of it lent New ecstasy and glory to the earth . I heard no voice that uttered it aloud , Nor was it written for me on a scroll ; Yet , if alone or in the common crowd , I felt myself a consecrated soul . My child leaped in its dark and silent room And cried , ' I am , ' though all unheard by men . So leaps my spirit in the body 's gloom And cries , ' I live ! I shall be born again . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor argue , since I know , I know ! COMPASSION He was a failure , and one day he died . Across the border of the mapless land He found himself among a sad-eyed band Of disappointed souls ; they , too , had tried And missed their purpose . With one voice they cried Unto the shining Angel in command : ' Oh , lead us not before our Lord to stand , For we are failures , failures ! Let us hide . ' Yet on the Angel fared , until they stood Before the Master . ( Even His holy place The hideous noises of the earth assailed . ) Christ reached His arms out to the trembling brood , With God 's vast sorrow in His listening face . Come unto Me , ' He said ; ' I , too , have failed . ' LOVE Dreaming of love , the ardent mind of youth Conceives it one with passion 's brief delights , With keen desire and rapture . But , in truth , These are but milestones to sublime heights After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow and blazing sun rays beat , After the billows of tempestuous oceans , Fair mountain summits wait the lover 's feet . The path is narrow , but the view is wide , And beauteous the outlook towards the west Happy are they who walk there side by side , Leaving below the valleys of unrest , And on the radiant altitudes above Know the serene intensity of love . THREE SOULS Three Souls there were that reached the Heavenly Gate , And gained permission of the Guard to wait . Barred from the bliss of Paradise by sin , They did not ask or hope to enter in . ' We loved one woman ( thus their story ran ) ; We lost her , for she chose another man . So great our love , it brought us to this door ; We only ask to see her face once more . Then will we go to realms where we belong , And pay our penalty for doing wrong . ' ' And wert thou friends on earth ? ' ( The Guard spake thus . ) ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . The dominating thought within each Soul Brought us together , comrades , to this goal , To see her face , and in its radiance bask For one great moment  --  that is all we ask . And , having seen her , we must journey back The path we came  --  a hard and dangerous track . ' ' Wait , then , ' the Angel said , ' beside me here , But do not strive within God 's Gate to peer Nor converse hold with Spirits clothed in light Who pass this way ; thou hast not earned the right . ' They waited year on year . Then , like a flame , News of the woman 's death from earth-land came . The eager lovers scanned with hungry eyes Each Soul that passed the Gates of Paradise . The well-beloved face in vain they sought , Until one day the Guardian Angel brought A message to them . ' She has gone , ' he said , ' Down to the lower regions of the dead ; Her chosen mate went first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait above To dwell with him , until perchance some day , Absolved from sin , he seeks the Better Way . ' Silent , the lovers turned . The pitying Guard Said : ' Stay ( the while his hand the door unbarred ) , There waits for thee no darker grief or woe ; Enter the Gates , and all God 's glories know . But to be ready for so great a bliss , Pause for a moment and take heed of this : The dearest treasure by each mortal lost Lies yonder , when the Threshold has been crossed , And thou shalt find within that Sacred Place The shining wonder of her worshipped face . All that is past is but a troubled dream ; Go forward now and claim the Fact Supreme . ' Then clothed like Angels , fitting their estate , Three Souls went singing , singing through God 's Gate . WHEN LOVE IS LOST When love is lost , the day sets towards the night , Albeit the morning sun may still be bright , And not one cloud-ship sails across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie Gone is the lustrous glory of the light . No splendour rests in any mountain height , No scene spreads fair and beauteous to the sight ; All , all seems dull and dreary to the eye When love is lost . Love lends to life its grandeur and its might ; Love goes , and leaves behind it gloom and blight ; Like ghosts of time the pallid hours drag by , And grief 's one happy thought is that we die . Ah , what can recompense us for its flight When love is lost ? OCCUPATION There must in heaven be many industries And occupations , varied , infinite ; Or heaven could not be heaven . What gracious tasks The Mighty Maker of the universe Can offer souls that have prepared on earth By holding lovely thoughts and fair desires ! Art thou a poet to whom words come not ? A dumb composer of unuttered sounds , Ignored by fame and to the world unknown ? Thine may be , then , the mission to create Immortal lyrics and immortal strains , For stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where God dwells . Hast thou the artist instinct with no skill To give it form or colour ? Unto thee It may be given to paint upon the skies Astounding dawns and sunsets , framed by seas And mountains ; or to fashion and adorn New faces for sweet pansies and new dyes To tint their velvet garments . Oftentimes Methinks behind a beauteous flower I see , Or in the tender glory of a dawn , The presence of some spirit who has gone Into the place of mystery , whose call , Imperious and compelling , sounds for all Or soon or late . So many have passed on - So many with ambitions , hopes , and aims Unrealised , who could not be content As idle angels even in paradise . The unknown Michelangelos who lived With thoughts on beauty bent while chained to toil That gave them only bread and burial - These must find waiting in the world of space The shining timbers of their splendid dreams , Ready for shaping temples , shrines , and towers , Where radiant hosts may congregate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will there not be gardens glorious , And mansions all embosomed among blooms , Where heavenly children reach out loving arms To lonely women who have been denied On earth the longed-for boon of motherhood ? Surely God has provided work to do For souls like these , and for the weary , rest . THE VALLEY OF FEAR In the journey of life , as we travel along To the mystical goal that is hidden from sight , You may stumble at times into Roadways of Wrong , Not seeing the sign-board that points to the right . Through caverns of sorrow your feet may be led , Where the noon of the day will like midnight appear . But no matter whither you wander or tread , Keep out of the Valley of Fear . The Roadways of Wrong will wind out into light If you sit in the silence and ask for a Guide ; In the caverns of sorrow your soul gains its sight Of beautiful vistas , ascending and wide . In by-paths of worry and trouble and strife Full many a bloom grows bedewed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all life Is the desolate Valley of Fear . The Valley of Fear is a maddening maze Of paths that wind on without exit or end , From nowhere to nowhere lead all of its ways , And shadows with shadows in more shadows blend . Each guide-post is lettered , ' This way to Despair , ' And the River of Death in the darkness flows near , But there is a beautiful Roadway of Prayer This side of the Valley of Fear . This beautiful Roadway is narrow and steep , And it runs up the side of the Mountain of Faith . You may not perceive it at first if you weep , But it rises high over the River of Death . Though the Roadway is narrow and dark at the base , It widens ascending , and ever grows clear , Till it shines at the top with the Light of God 's face , Far , far from the Valley of Fear . When close to that Valley your footsteps shall fare , Turn , turn to the Roadway of Prayer - The beautiful Roadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the words of Jesus , And what would He pause and say , If we were to meet in home or street , The Lord of the world to-day ? Oh , I think He would pause and say : ' Go on with your chosen labour ; Speak only good of your neighbour ; Widen your farms , and lay down your arms , Or dig up the soil with each sabre . ' Now what were the answer of Jesus If we should ask for a creed , To carry us straight to the wonderful gate When soul from body is freed ? Oh , I think He would give us this creed : ' Praise God whatever betide you ; Cast joy on the lives beside you ; Better the earth , by growing in worth , With love as the law to guide you . ' Now what were the answer of Jesus If we should ask Him to tell Of the last great goal of the homing soul Where each of us hopes to dwell ? Oh , I think it is this He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake it ; The mind is the kingdom  --  then take it ; And thought upon thought let Eden be wrought , For heaven will be what you make it . ' AMERICA I am the refuge of all the oppressed , I am the boast of the free , I am the harbour where ships may rest Safely ' twixt sea and sea . I hold up a torch to a darkened world , I lighten the path with its ray . Let my hand keep steady And let me be ready For whatever comes my way - Let me be ready . Oh , better than fortresses , better than guns , Better than lance or spear , Are the loyal hearts of my daughters and sons , Faithful and without fear . But my daughters and sons must understand THAT ATTILA DID NOT DIE . And they must be ready , Their hands must be steady , If the hosts of hell come nigh - They must be ready . If Jesus were back on the earth with men , He would not preach to-day Until He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defilers away . He would throw down the tables of lust and greed And scatter the changers ' gold . He would be ready , His hand would be steady , As it was in that temple of old - He would be ready . I am the cradle of God 's new world , From me shall the new race rise , And my glorious banner must float unfurled , Unsullied against the skies . My sons and daughters must be my strength , With courage to do and to dare , With hearts that are ready , With hands that are steady , And their slogan must be , PREPARE ! - They must be ready ! With a prayer on the lip they must shoulder arms , For after all has been said , We must muster guns , If we master Huns - AND ATTILA IS NOT DEAD - We must be ready ! WAR MOTHERS There is something in the sound of drum and fife That stirs all the savage instincts into life . In the old times of peace we went our ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times , When from the steeple sounded wedding chimes , Telling to all the world some maid was wife - But taking patiently our part in life As it was portioned us by Church and State , Believing it our fate . Our thoughts all chaste Held yet a secret wish to love and mate Ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste . But men we criticised for lack of strength , And kept them at arm 's length . Then the war came - The world was all aflame ! The men we had thought dull and void of power Were heroes in an hour . He who had seemed a slave to petty greed Showed masterful in that great time of need . He who had plotted for his neighbour 's pelf , Now for his fellows offers up himself . And we were only women , forced by war To sacrifice the things worth living for . Something within us broke , Something within us woke , The wild cave-woman spoke . When we heard the sound of drumming , As our soldiers went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we watched to see them coming , And they looked at us and smiled ( Yes , looked back at us and smiled ) , As they filed along by hillock and by hollow , Then our hearts were so beguiled That , for many and many a day , We dreamed we heard them say , ' Oh , follow , follow , follow ! ' And the distant , rolling drum Called us ' Come , come , come ! ' Till our virtue seemed a thing to give away . War had swept ten thousand years away from earth . We were primal once again . There were males , not modern men ; We were females meant to bring their sons to birth . And we could not wait for any formal rite , We could hear them calling to us , ' Come to-night ; For to-morrow , at the dawn , We move on ! ' And the drum Bellowed , ' Come , come , come ! ' And the fife Whistled , ' Life , life , life ! ' So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mourned , they are the nation 's pride . We fought our battles , too , but with the tide Of our red blood , we gave the world new lives . Because we were not wives We are dishonoured . Is it noble , then , To break God 's laws only by killing men To save one 's country from destruction ? We took no man 's life but gave our chastity , And sinned the ancient sin To plant young trees and fill felled forests in . Oh , clergy of the land , Bible in hand , All reverently you stand , On holy thoughts intent While barren wives receive the sacrament ! Had you the open visions you could see Phantoms of infants murdered in the womb , Who never knew a cradle or a tomb , Hovering about these wives accusingly . Bestow the sacrament ! Their sins are not well known - Ours to the four winds of the earth are blown . A HOLIDAY Berlin , Germany , gave the school children a half holiday to celebrate the sinking of the Lusitania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play . Ring-a-rosy round the earth With the garland of your mirth . Shrill a song brim full of glee Of a great ship sunk at sea . Tell with pleasure and with pride How a hundred children died . Sing of orphan babes , whose cries Beat against unanswering skies ; Let a mother 's mad despair Lend staccato to your air . Sing of babes who drowned alone ; Sing of headstones , marked ' Unknown ' ; Sing of homes made desolate Where the stricken mourners wait . Sing of battered corpses tossed By the heedless waves , and lost . Run , sweet children , sing and play ; War declares a holiday . THE UNDERTONE When I was very young I used to feel the dark despairs of youth ; Out of my little griefs I would invent great tragedies and woes ; Not only for myself , but for all those I held most dear I would invent vast sorrows in my melancholy moods of thought . Yet down deep , deep in my heart there was an undertone of rapture . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Saying things joyful . As I grew older , and Life offered bitter gall for me to drink , Forcing it through clenched teeth when I refused to take it willingly ; When Pain prepared some special anguish for my heart to bear , And all the things I longed for seemed to be wholly beyond my reach - Yet down deep , deep in my heart there was an undertone of rapture . It was like a Voice , a Voice from some other world calling to me , Bringing glad tidings . Now when I look about me , and see the great injustices of men , See Idleness and Greed waited upon by luxury and mirth , See prosperous Vice ride by in state , while footsore Virtue walks ; Now when I hear the cry of need rise up from lands of shameful wealth - Yet down deep , deep in my heart there is an undertone of rapture . It is like a Voice  --  it is a Voice  --  calling to me and saying : ' Love rules triumphant . ' Now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstones , And one by one dear faces that I loved are hid away from sight ; Now when in each familiar home I see a vacant chair , And in the throngs once formed of friends I meet unrecognising eyes - Yet down deep , deep in my heart there is an undertone of rapture . It is the Voice , it is the Voice for ever saying unto me : ' Life is Eternal . ' GYPSYING Gypsying , gypsying , through the world together , Never mind the way we go , never mind what port . Follow trails , or fashion sails , start in any weather : While we journey hand in hand , everything is sport . Gypsying , gypsying , leaving care and worry : Never mind the ' if ' and ' but ' ( words for coward lips ) . Put them out with ' fear ' and ' doubt , ' in the pack with ' hurry , ' While we stroll like vagabonds forth to trails , or ships . Gypsying , gypsying , just where fancy calls us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere or foul or fair , liking what befalls us : While you have me at your side , and while I have you . Gypsying , gypsying , camp by hill or hollow ; Never mind the why of it , since it suits our mood . Go or stay , and pay our way , and let those who follow Find , upspringing from the soil , some small seed of good . Gypsying , gypsying , through the world we wander : Never mind the rushing years , that have come and gone . There must be for you and me , lying over Yonder , Other lands , where side by side we can gypsy on . SONG OF THE ROAD I am a Road ; a good road , fair and smooth and broad ; And I link with my beautiful tether Town and Country together , Like a ribbon rolled on the earth , from the reel of God . Oh , great the life of a Road ! I am a Road ; a long road , leading on and on ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hill and hollow , Through desolate night , to the open gates of dawn . Oh , bold the life of a Road ! I am a Road ; a kind road , shaped by strong hands . I make strange cities neighbours ; The poor grow rich with my labours , And beauty and comfort follow me through the lands . Oh , glad the life of a Road ! I am a Road ; a wise road , knowing all men 's ways ; And I know how each heart reaches For the things dear Nature teaches ; And I am the path that leads into green young Mays . Oh , sweet the life of a Road ! I am a Road ; and I speed away from the slums , Away from desolate places , Away from unused spaces ; Wherever I go , there order from chaos comes . Oh , brave the life of a Road ! I am a Road ; and I would make the whole world one . I would give hope to duty , And cover the earth with beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this might be done ? So vast the power of the Road ! THE FAITH WE NEED Too tall our structures , and too swift our pace ; Not so we mount , not so we gain the race . Too loud the voice of commerce in the land ; Not so truth speaks , not so we understand . Too vast our conquests , and too large our gains ; Not so comes peace , not so the soul attains . But the need of the world is a faith that will live anywhere ; In the still dark depths of the woods , or out in the sun 's full glare . A faith that can hear God 's voice , alike in the quiet glen , Or in the roar of the street , and over the noises of men . And the need of the world is a creed that is founded on joy ; A creed with the turrets of hope and trust , no winds can destroy ; A creed where the soul finds rest , whatever this life bestows , And dwells undoubting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the need of the world is love that burns in the heart like flame ; A love for the Giver of Life , in sorrow or joy the same ; A love that blazes a trail to Go through the dark and the cold , Or keeps the pathway that leads to Him clean , through glory and gold . For the faith that can only thrive or grow in the solitude , And droops and dies in the marts of men , where sights and sounds are rude ; That is not a faith at all , but a dream of a mystic 's heart ; Our faith should point as the compass points , whatever be the chart . Our faith must find its centre of peace in a babel of noise ; In the changing ways of the world of men it must keep its poise ; And over the sorrowing sounds of earth it must hear God 's call ; And the faith that can not do all this , that is not faith at all . THE PRICE HE PAID I said I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And I did n't believe a thing That the parsons have to say . I did n't believe in a God That gives us blood like fire , Then flings us into hell because We answer the call of desire . And I said : ' Religion is rot , And the laws of the world are nil ; For the bad man is he who is caught And can not foot his bill . And there is no place called hell ; And heaven is only a truth When a man has his way with a maid , In the fresh keen hour of youth . ' And money can buy us grace , If it rings on the plate of the church : And money can neatly erase Each sign of a sinful smirch . ' For I saw men everywhere , Hotfooting the road of vice ; And women and preachers smiled on them As long as they paid the price . So I had my joy of life : I went the pace of the town ; And then I took me a wife , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare For all of the simple joys That belong with a house and a home And a brood of girls and boys . I married a girl with health And virtue and spotless fame . I gave in exchange my wealth And a proud old family name . And I gave her the love of a heart Grown sated and sick of sin ! My deal with the devil was all cleaned up , And the last bill handed in . She was going to bring me a child , And when in labour she cried With love and fear I was wild - But now I wish she had died . For the son she bore me was blind And crippled and weak and sore ! And his mother was left a wreck . It was so she settled my score . I said I must have my fling , And they knew the path I would go ; Yet no one told me a thing Of what I needed to know . Folks talk too much of a soul From heavenly joys debarred - And not enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred . DIVORCED Thinking of one thing all day long , at night I fall asleep , brain weary and heart sore ; But only for a little while . At three , Sometimes at two o'clock , I wake and lie , Staring out into darkness ; while my thoughts Begin the weary treadmill-toil again , From that white marriage morning of our youth Down to this dreadful hour . I see your face Lit with the lovelight of the honeymoon ; I hear your voice , that lingered on my name As if it loved each letter ; and I feel The clinging of your arms about my form , Your kisses on my cheek  --  and long to break The anguish of such memories with tears , But can not weep ; the fountain has run dry . We were so young , so happy , and so full Of keen sweet joy of life . I had no wish Outside your pleasure ; and you loved me so That when I sometimes felt a woman 's need For more serene expression of man 's love ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail ever on the stormy main ) , Yet would I rouse myself to your desire ; Meet ardent kiss with kisses just as warm ; So nothing I could give should be denied . And then our children came . Deep in my soul , From the first hour of conscious motherhood , I knew I should conserve myself for this Most holy office ; knew God meant it so . Yet even then , I held your wishes first ; And by my double duties lost the bloom And freshness of my beauty ; and beheld A look of disapproval in your eyes . But with the coming of our precious child , The lover 's smile , tinged with the father 's pride , Returned again ; and helped to make me strong ; And life was very sweet for both of us . Another , and another birth , and twice The little white hearse paused beside our door And took away some portion of my youth With my sweet babies . At the first you seemed To suffer with me , standing very near ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I was hurt , not realising then My grief was selfish . I could see the change Which motherhood and sorrow made in me ; And when I saw the change that came to you , Saw how your eyes looked past me when you talked , And when I missed the love tone from your voice , I did that foolish thing weak women do , Complained and cried , accused you of neglect , And made myself obnoxious in your sight . And often , after you had left my side , Alone I stood before my mirror , mad With anger at my pallid cheeks , my dull Unlighted eyes , my shrunken mother-breasts , And wept , and wept , and faded more and more . How could I hope to win back wandering love , And make new flames in dying embers leap , By such ungracious means ? And then She came , Firm-bosomed , round of cheek , with such young eyes , And all the ways of youth . I who had died A thousand deaths , in waiting the return Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet again and went straight into hell When I beheld it come at her approach . My God , my God , how have I borne it all ! Yet since she had the power to wake that look - The power to sweep the ashes from your heart Of burned-out love of me , and light new fires , One thing remained for me  --  to let you go . I had no wish to keep the empty frame From which the priceless picture had been wrenched . Nor do I blame you ; it was not your fault : You gave me all that most men can give  --  love Of youth , of beauty , and of passion ; and I gave you full return ; my womanhood Matched well your manhood . Yet had you grown ill , Or old , and unattractive from some cause ( Less close than was my service unto you ) , I should have clung the tighter to you , dear ; And loved you , loved you , loved you more and more . I grow so weary thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the awful nights . THE REVEALING ANGELS Suddenly and without warning they came - The Revealing Angels came . Suddenly and simultaneously , through city streets , Through quiet lanes and country roads they walked . They walked crying : ' God has sent us to find The vilest sinners of earth . We are to bring them before Him , before the Lord of Life . ' Their voices were like bugles ; And then all war , all strife , And all the noises of the world grew still ; And no one talked ; And no one toiled , but many strove to flee away . Robbers and thieves , and those sunk in drunkenness and crime , Men and women of evil repute , And mothers with fatherless children in their arms , all strove to hide . But the Revealing Angels passed them by , Saying : ' Not you , not you . Another day , when we shall come again Unto the haunts of men , Then we will call your names ; But God has asked us first to bring to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or drunkenness , or vice - Yea , greater than murder done in passion , Or self-destruction done in dark despair . Now in His Holy Name we call : Come one and all Come forth ; reveal your faces . ' Then through the awful silence of the world , Where noise had ceased , they came - The sinful hosts . They came from lowly and from lofty places , Some poorly clad , but many clothed like queens ; They came from scenes of revel and from toil ; From haunts of sin , from palaces , from homes , From boudoirs , and from churches . They came like ghosts - THE VAST BRIGADES OF WOMEN WHO HAD SLAIN THEIR HELPLESS , UNBORN CHILDREN . With them trailed Lovers and husbands who had said , ' Do this , ' And those who helped for hire . They stood before the Angels  --  before the Revealing Angels they stood . And they heard the Angels say , And all the listening world heard the Angels say : ' These are the vilest sinners of all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ; Made sex and its keen compelling desire To fashion bodies wherein souls might go From lower planes to higher , Until the end is reached ( which is Beginning ) . They have stolen the costly pleasures of the senses And refused to pay God 's price . They have come together , these men and these women , As male and female they have come together In the great creative act . They have invited souls , and then flung them out into space ; They have made a jest of God 's design . All other sins look white beside this sinning ; All other sins may be condoned , forgiven ; All other sinners may be cleansed and shriven ; Not these , not these . Pass on , and meet God 's eyes . ' The vast brigade moved forward , and behind then walked the Angels , Walked the sorrowful Revealing Angels . THE WELL-BORN So many people  --  people  --  in the world ; So few great souls , love ordered , well begun , In answer to the fertile mother need ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal dream ; So many born of mere propinquity - Of lustful habit , or of accident . Their mothers felt No mighty , all-compelling wish to see Their bosoms garden-places Abloom with flower faces ; No tidal wave swept o'er them with its flood ; No thrill of flesh or heart ; no leap of blood ; No glowing fire , flaming to white desire For mating and for motherhood : Yet they bore children . God ! how mankind misuses Thy command , To populate the earth ! How low is brought high birth ! How low the woman ; when , inert as spawn Left on the sands to fertilise , She is the means through which the race goes on ! Not so the first intent . Birth , as the Supreme Mind conceived it , meant The clear imperious call of mate to mate And the clear answer . Only thus and then Are fine , well-ordered , and potential lives Brought into being . Not by Church or State Can birth be made legitimate , Unless Love in its fulness bless . Creation so ordains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , Is lesser in the generative cause . The father may be merely man , the male ; Yet more than female must the mother be . The woman who would fashion Souls , for the use of earth and angels meet , Must entertain a high and holy passion . Not rank , or wealth , or influence of kings Can give a soul its dower Of majesty and power , Unless the mother brings Great love to that great hour . SISTERS OF MINE Sisters , sisters of mine , have we done what we could In all the old ways , through all the new days , To better the race and to make life sweet and good ? Have we played the full part that was ours in the start , Sisters of mine ? Sisters , sisters of mine , as we hurry along To a larger world , with our banners unfurled , The battle-cry on lips where once was Love 's old song , Are we leaving behind better things than we find , Sisters of mine ? Sisters , sisters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil and din , without , and within , As we gain something big do we lose something sweet ? In the growth of our might is our grace lost to sight ? As new powers unfold do we LOVE as of old , Sisters of mine ? ANSWER O well have we done the old tasks ! in the old , old ways of earth . We have kept the house in order , we have given the children birth ; And our sons went out with their fathers , and left us alone at the hearth ! We have cooked the meats for their table ; we have woven their cloth at the loom ; We have pulled the weeds from their gardens , and kept the flowers in bloom ; And then we have sat and waited , alone in a silent room . We have borne all the pains of travail in giving life to the race ; We have toiled and saved , for the masters , and helped them to power and place ; And when we asked for a pittance , they gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dollar all the evils of earth are shown . We are weary of love that is barter , and of virtue that pines alone ; We are out in the world with the masters : we are finding and claiming our own ! THE GRADUATES I saw them beautiful , in fair array upon Commencement Day ; Lissome and lovely , radiant and sweet As cultured roses , brought to their estate By careful training . Finished and complete ( As teachers calculate ) . They passed in maiden grace along the aisle , Leaving the chaste white sunlight of a smile Upon the gazing throng . Musing I thought upon their place as mothers of the race . Oh there are many actors who can play Greatly , great parts ; but rare indeed the soul Who can be great when cast for some small role ; Yet that is what the world most needs ; big hearts That will shine forth and glorify poor parts In this strange drama , Life ! Do they , Who in full dress-rehearsal pass to-day Before admiring eyes , hold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From being only earth ; and make men more Than just mere men ? How will they prove their worth Of years of study ? Will they walk abroad Decked with the plumage of dead bards of God , The glorious birds ? And shall the lamb unborn Be slain on altars of their vanity ? To some frail sister who has missed the way Will they give Christ 's compassion , or man 's scorn ; And will clean manhood , linked with honest love , The victor prove , When riches , gained by greed , dispute the claim ? Will they guard well a husband 's home and name . Or lean down from their altitudes to hear The voice of flattery speak in the ear Those lying platitudes which men repeat To listening Self-Conceit ? Musing I thought upon their place as mothers of the race , As beautiful they passed in maiden grace . THE SILENT TRAGEDY The deepest tragedies of life are not Put into books , or acted on the stage . Nay , they are lived in silence , by tense hearts In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who make a whip of words Wherewith to lash these hearts , and call it wit . There is a tragedy lived everywhere In Christian lands , by an increasing horde Of women martyrs to our social laws . Women whose hearts cry out for motherhood ; Women whose bosoms ache for little heads ; Women God meant for mothers , but whose lives Have been restrained , restricted , and denied Their natural channels , till at last they stand Unmated and alone , by that sad sea Whose slow receding tide returns no more . Men meet great sorrows ; but no man can grasp The depth , and height , of such a grief as this . The call of Fatherhood is from man 's brain . Man can not know the answer to that call Save as a woman tells him . But to her The call of Motherhood is from the soul , The brain , the body . She is like a plant Which buds and blossoms only to bear fruit . Man is the pollen , carried by the wind Of accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fatherhood is played . Her threefold knowledge of maternity , Through three times three great months , is hers alone . Man as an egotist is wounded when He is not father . Woman when denied The all-embracing role of motherhood Rebels with her whole being . Oftentimes Rebellion finds its only utterance In shattered nerves , and lack of self-control ; Which gives the merry world its chance to cry ' Old maids are queer . ' In far off Eastern lands They think of God as Mother to the race ; Father and Mother of the Universe . And mayhap this is why they make their girls Wives prematurely , mothers over young , Hoping to please their Mother God this way . Since everywhere in Nature sex is shown For procreative uses , they contend Sterility is sinful . ( Save when one Chooses a life of Saintship here on earth , And so conserves all forces to that end . ) Here in the West , our God is Masculine ; And while we say He bade a Virgin bring His Son to birth , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continence - Preparing heavens for those who live that life - And hells for those who stray by thought or act From the unnatural path our laws have made . Mother of Christ , thou being woman , thou Knowing all depths within the woman heart , All joy , all pain , oh send the world more light . Enlarge our sympathies ; and let our minds Turn from achievements of material things To contemplation of Eternal truths . Space throbs with egos , waiting for rebirth ; And mother-hearted women fill the earth . Mother of Christ , show us the way to thin The ranks of childless women , without sin . THE TRINITY Much may be done with the world we are in , Much with the race to better it ; We can unfetter it , Free it from chains of the old traditions ; Broaden its viewpoint of virtue and sin ; Change its conditions Of labour and wealth ; And open new roadways to knowledge and health . Yet some things ever must stay as they are While the sea has its tide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman with love between , Loyal and tender and true and clean , Nothing better has been or can be Than just those three . Woman may alter the first great plan . Daughters and sisters and mothers May stalk with their brothers Forth from their homes into noisy places Fit ( and fit only ) for masculine man . Marring their graces With conflict and strife To widen the outlook of all human life . Yet some things ever must stay as they are While the sea has its tide and the sky has its star . A man and a woman with love that strengthens And gathers new force as its earth way lengthens ; Nothing better by God is given This side of heaven . Science may show us a wonderful vast Secret of life and of breeding it ; Man by the heeding it Out of earth 's chaos may bring a new order . Off with old systems , old laws may be cast . What now seems the border Of licence in creeds , May then be the centre of thoughts and of deeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea has its tide and the sky has its star . A man and a woman and love undefiled And the look of the two in the face of a child , - Oh , the joys of this world have their changing ways , But this joy stays . Nothing better on earth can be Than just those three . THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE I had been almost happy for an hour , Lost to the world that knew me in the park Among strange faces ; while my little girl Leaped with the squirrels , chirruped with the birds And with the sunlight glowed . She was so dear , So beautiful , so sweet ; and for the time The rose of love , shorn of its thorn of shame , Bloomed in my heart . Then suddenly you passed . I sat alone upon the public bench ; You , with your lawful husband , rode in state ; And when your eyes fell on me and my child , They were not eyes , but daggers , poison tipped . God ! how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold steel , your glance cut through my heart , Struck every petal from the rose of love And left the ragged stalk alive with thorns . My little one came running to my side And called me Mother . It was like a blow Between the eyes ; and made me sick with pain . And then it seemed as if each bird and breeze Took up the word , and changed its syllables From Mother into Magdalene ; and cried My shame to all the world . It was your eyes Which did all this . But listen now to me ( Not you alone , but all the barren wives Who , like you , flaunt their virtue in the face Of fallen women ) : I do chance to know The crimes you think are hidden from all men ( Save one who took your gold and sold his skill And jeopardized his name for your base ends ) . I know how you have sunk your soul in sense Like any wanton ; and refused to bear The harvest of your pleasure-planted seed ; I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ; how you have blighted it ; And made the holy miracle of birth A wicked travesty of God 's design ; Yea , many buds , which might be blossoms now And beautify your selfish , arid life , Have been destroyed , because you chose to keep The aimless freedom , and the purposeless , Self-seeking liberty of childless wives . I was an untaught girl . By nature led , By love and passion blinded , I became An unwed mother . You , an honoured wife , Refuse the crown of motherhood , defy The laws of nature , and fling baby souls Back in the face of God . And yet you dare Call me a sinner , and yourself a saint ; And all the world smiles on you , and its doors Swing wide at your approach . I stand outside . Surely there must be higher courts than earth , Where you and I will some day meet and be Weighed by a larger justice . FATHER AND SON My grand-dame , vigorous at eighty-one , Delights in talking of her only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . ' Ah , but he was the lad ! ' She says , and sighs , and looks at me askance . How well I read the meaning of that glance - ' Poor son of such a dad ; Poor weakling , dull and sad . ' I could , but would not tell her bitter truth About my father 's youth . She says : ' Your father laughed his way through earth : He laughed right in the doctor 's face at birth , Such joy of life he had , such founts of mirth . Ah , what a lad was he ! ' And then she sighs . I feel her silent blame , Because I brought her nothing but his name . Because she does not see Her worshipped son in me . I could , but would not , speak in my defence , Anent the difference . She says : ' He won all prizes in his time : He overworked , and died before his prime . At high ambition 's door I lay the crime . Ah , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in that deceiving thought , Of what avail to say , ' His death was brought By broken sexual laws , The ancient sinful cause . ' I could , but would not , tell the good old dame The story of his shame . I could say : ' I am crippled , weak , and pale , Because my father was an unleashed male . Because he ran so fast , I halt and fail ( Ah , yes , he was the lad ) , Because he drained each cup of sense-delight I must go thirsting , thirsting , day and night . Because he was joy-mad , I must be always sad . Because he learned no law of self-control , I am a blighted soul . ' Of what avail to speak and spoil her joy . Better to see her disapproving eyes , And silent , hear her say , between her sighs , ' Ah , but he was the boy ! ' HUSKS She looked at her neighbour 's house in the light of the waning day - A shower of rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bouquet . And then she drew the shade , to shut out the growing gloom , But she shut it into her heart instead . ( Was that a voice in the room ? ) ' My neighbour is sad , ' she sighed , ' like the mother bird who sees The last of her brood fly out of the nest to make its home in the trees ' - And then in a passion of tears  --  ' But , oh , to be sad like her : Sad for a joy that has come and gone ! ' ( Did some one speak , or stir ? ) She looked at her faded hands , all burdened with costly rings ; She looked on her widowed home , all burdened with priceless things . She thought of the dead years gone , of the empty years ahead - ( Yes , something stirred and something spake , and this was what it said : ) ' The voice of the Might Have Been speaks here through the lonely dusk ; Life offered the fruits of love ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your breast where never a child has slept . ' She covered her face with her ringed old hands , and wept and wept and wept . MEDITATIONS HIS I was so proud of you last night , dear girl , While man with man was striving for your smile . You never lost your head , nor once dropped down From your high place As queen in that gay whirl . ( It takes more poise to wear a little crown With modesty and grace Than to adorn the lordlier thrones of earth . ) You seem so free from artifice and wile : And in your eyes I read Encouragement to my unspoken thought . My heart is eloquent with words to plead Its cause of passion ; but my questioning mind , Knowing how love is blind , Dwells on the pros and cons , and God knows what . My heart cries with each beat , ' She is so beautiful , so pure , so sweet , So more than dear . ' And then I hear The voice of Reason , asking : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ? Could she bear quiet evenings at your hearth , And not be sighing for gay scenes of mirth ? If , some great day , love 's mighty recompense For chastity surrendered came to her , If she felt stir Beneath her heart a little pulse of life , Would she rejoice with holy pride and wonder , And find new glory in the name of wife ? Or would she plot with sin , and seek to plunder Love 's sanctuary , and cast away its treasure , That she might keep her freedom and her pleasure ? Could she be loyal mate and mother dutiful ? Or is she only some bright hothouse bloom , Seedless and beautiful , Meant just for decoration , and for show ? ' Alone here in my room , I hear this voice of Reason . My poor heart Has ever but one answer to impart , ' I love her so . ' HERS After the ball last night , when I came home I stood before my mirror , and took note Of all that men call beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw My own reflection smiling on me there , Because your eyes , through all the swirling hours , And in your slow good-night , had made a fact Of what before I fancied might be so ; Yet knowing how men lie , by look and act , I still had doubted . But I doubt no more , I know you love me , love me . And I feel Your satisfaction in my comeliness . Beauty and youth , good health and willing mind , A spotless reputation , and a heart Longing for mating and for motherhood , And lips unsullied by another 's kiss - These are the riches I can bring to you . But as I sit here , thinking of it all In the clear light of morning , sudden fear Has seized upon me . What has been your past ? From out the jungle of old reckless years , May serpents crawl across our path some day And pierce us with their fangs ? Oh , I am not A prude or bigot ; and I have not lived A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much I can condone ; For well I know our kinship to the earth And all created things . Why , even I Have felt the burden of virginity , When flowers and birds and golden butterflies In early spring were mating ; and I know How loud that call of sex must sound to man Above the feeble protest of the world . But I can hear from depths within my soul The voices of my unborn children cry For rightful heritage . ( May God attune The souls of men , that they may hear and heed That plaintive voice above the call of sex ; And may the world 's weak protest swell into A thunderous diapason  --  a demand For cleaner fatherhood . ) Oh , love , come near ; Look in my eyes , and say I need not fear . THE TRAVELLER Bristling with steeples , high against the hill , Like some great thistle in the rosy dawn It stood ; the **26;2223;TOOLONG , stood . The Traveller surveyed it with a smile . ' Surely , ' He said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with neighbour in accord ; God in the heart of all . Else why these spires ? ' ( Christmas season , and every bell ringing . ) The sudden shriek of whistles changed the sound From mellow music into jarring noise . Then down the street pale hurrying children came , And vanished in the yawning Factory door . He called to them : ' Come back , come unto Me . ' The Foreman cursed , and caned Him from the place . ( Christmas season , and every bell ringing . ) Forth from two churches came two men , and met , Disputing loudly over boundary lines , Hate in their eyes , and murder in their hearts . A haughty woman drew her skirts aside Because her fallen sister passed that way . The Traveller rebuked them all . Amazed , They asked in indignation , ' Who are you , Daring to interfere in private lives ? ' The Traveller replied , ' My name is CHRIST . ' ( Christmas season , and every bell ringing . ) WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with life , O Man ! O Average Man of the world - Average Man of the Christian world we call civilised ? What have you done to pay for the labour pains of the mother who bore you ? On earth you occupy space ; you consume oxygen from the air : And what do you give in return for these things ? Who is better that you live , and strive , and toil ? Or that you live through the toiling and striving of others ? As you pass down the street does any one look on you and say , ' There goes a good son , a true husband , a wise father , a fine citizen ? A man whose strong hand is ready to help a neighbour , A man to trust ' ? And what do women say of you ? Unto their own souls what do women say ?

Do they say : ' There is a woman with a great heart , Loyal to her sex , and above envy and evil speaking ? There is a daughter , wife , mother , with a purpose in life : She can be trusted to mould the minds of little children .
