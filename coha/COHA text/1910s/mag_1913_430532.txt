IF any student , historian , or critic of the art of music were asked to select the names of the six greatest masters , he would indeed find himself confronted with a formidable task . Music has developed so many forms and found so many avenues of expression for the varied moods , emotions , and even aspirations of humanity , that no one master has been able to be supreme in them all . Some have led in the domain of instrumental composition , but have had to yield the palm to others in the treatment of vocal forms , and even within the field of vocal music some have been superior in the simple song , while others have achieved their distinction in writing for great choruses , or for the favored singers . of the operatic stage . But no student or historian would quarrel with the choice of the six names set forth as those of leading masters of musical art . These six men .  | are Johann Sebastian Bach , George Frederick Handel , Josef Haydn , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these had his special distinction , his particular field ; though all of them , except Wagner , made important contributions to other departments . Wagner alone will go down to posterity as a composer whose productiveness was confined almost exclusively to one kind of music , and whose fame rests entirely upon it . This restriction of activity was not wholly the outcome of the composer 's particular bent , but of artistic conditions naturally brought about by the process of evolution in intellectual labor . Specializing is the tendency of later years , and no composer of today would think of undertaking to rival Bach in the amazing diversity of his creations . Perhaps the note here suggested may help us to bring our thoughts into harmony with the entire subject . BACH THE GENIUS OF THE ORGAN All musicians have expressed the profoundest admiration for the marvelous fecundity of Bach 's genius . He is the musician of musicians , the master of masters . But we must not forget , as has been noted , that generalization was more facile in his day than in ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the  | simplest song through practically every form of instrumental and vocal composition except opera , we find that as far as these forms were developed in his day , they are all in general construction founded on the language of the organ . Bach was a mighty master of the organ , and his method of composition for groups of instruments and voices was closely allied to that followed in his day in writing for organ and voice . In building up his system , Bach sounded all the depths of musical science , and originated an amazing number of technical laws upon which the art of all subsequent musicians has had to rest . In doing this he was nevertheless able to compose music which for intimacy of expressiveness and lofty melodic beauty has never been surpassed . The supreme product of his genius is an oratorio called " The Passion According to St. Matthew , " a musical setting of the story of the Savior 's last days and the Crucifixion . In other settings of the same history he also wrote noble music ; and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized by its complete want of elements of brilliant effectiveness . It was born in the organ loft , and it belongs to the atmosphere of the church . It shrinks from the glow and glitter of the concert stage ; but it has to be performed there in order that we may hear it at all . HANDEL THE MASTER OF THE ORATORIO Handel , who was a contemporary of Bach , born in the same year , 1685 , and dying nine years later , in 1759 , spent most of his life in composing Italian operas for theaters in Germany and London . After meeting with many failures he finally turned away from the theater and devoted his genius to the oratorio . It was then that he composed the great work by which he is known to all the world , namely , " The Messiah , " produced in Dublin , Ireland , in 1742 . Handel 's opera airs are often heard in the concert room ; though the works as a whole have disappeared from the stage . These airs are distinguished by melodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the singing voice . But in his oratorios , especially his masterpiece , " The Messiah , " the airs have all the best qualities of his opera music , together with a noble and tender embodiment of religious emotion . The choruses are colossal in the effects produced by the treatment of voices in masses . Here Handel rivals Bach in his application of the speech of the organ to a new instrument . But there is this radical difference between the two , that while Bach never thought of the public , Handel never forgot it . Trained in writing for the stage , Handel always considered how a musical number would influence an audience , and in " The Messiah " his skill in pre- paring grandiose effects for his hearers is such that we are lost in admiration . In this one exercise of his art Handel stands alone and supreme . HAYDN THE FATHER OF THE SYMPHONY Haydn 's claim to a place among the immortals rests on his symphonies and quartets . He wrote two lovely oratorios , " The Creation " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but none of these works would place him in the forefront . Nor are his symphonies comparable in depth and breadth with those of later masters ; but they were the first in which the principles of symphonic construction were clearly set forth . It was in these compositions also that the fundamental laws of writing for the orchestra independent of voices were demonstrated . Haydn 's symphonies were made for a small orchestra , and in the beginning were really chamber music compositions ; but later he wrote works designed for public concert performance . His string quartets were the earliest which have retained their place in the concert room , and from them all subsequent composers have deduced their first principles .  | Haydn thus laid the foundations of both orchestral and chamber music . In his compositions the differentiation between the methods of construction demanded by works on the organ idioms and those intended for delivery by bodies of orchestral instruments , whether large or small , is first unmistakably set forth . In this respect Haydn was a creator . But it must be added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise it might have to be classed merely as the illustration of a method . Many of the symphonies and string quartets are still played , and they give delight to all unjaded ears . MOZART THE GLORIOUS BOY IN MUSIC Mozart was born and died within the life of Haydn . In his brief life ( 1756 ? 1791 ) he advanced the methods of writing symphonies and string quartets so much that Haydn , who was at first his master , in the end came to learn from him , and he also revolutionized the opera . Mozart 's fame today rests upon his last three symphonies , his more important string quartets , and most of all upon his principal operas , " Don Giovanni , " " The Marriage of Figaro , " and " The Magic Flute . " His greatest work is undoubtedly " Don Giovanni , " which is the noblest  | opera written in the form and style antecedent to those introduced byWagner . Mozart was the first opera composer to achieve clear and convincing characterization in music . His Don Giovanni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dramatic music . So again are his Figaro , Cherubino , and Susanna in " The Marriage of Figaro . " Earlier composers of Italian opera made all their personages sound very much alike . After Mozart musical characterization was always attempted ; for he had shown the way . In the treatment of concerted numbers , notably the finales of acts , Mozart again set up methods original and influential upon the whole subsequent development of operatic art . Wagner 's finale in the second act of " Die Meistersinger " rests heavily upon the lessons taught in the great ballroom finale of " Don Giovanni . " With all his other qualities , Mozart had a marvelous gift of melody . His music flows as easily as a great river , and always possesses the clarity and brilliance of sunlight . This spontaneity of invention was born in him . He was a composer at six , and had an opera produced at thirteen . " The Glorious  | Boy , " Rubinstein well called him . BEETHOVEN THE SUPREME MASTER Beethoven 's place in music is established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his piano sonatas , and his one opera . All these proclaim a supreme master and teach new lessons . It was Beethoven who found in instrumental music a vehie for the communication of great ideas and even doctrines . Earlier composers had been content to treat the symphony as a succession of movements with broad general contrasts in melodic content and in sentiments ; but Beethoven did not hesitate to dedicate this form to the publication of the profoundest of human emotions . He made the symphony the medium for the expression of those more overwhelming : eelings which are best understood as the common joys , sorrows , and hopes of mankind . His fifth symphony , for example , delineates the struggle of mar against opposing fate , and the ultimate triumph of the human will and intellect . The only hint given to us of the composer 's intent was contained in his own remark about the tremendous opening of the first foul notes . " Thus , " he said , " Fate knocks at the portals . " The ninth symphony , which calls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement is a stupendous musical version of the fight of man for happiness and his victory in the end . The seventh symphony was called by Wagner " The Apotheosis of the Dance " ; while the third , known as the " Eroica , " was originally designed to be a celebration of the glory of Napoleon . But Beethoven , who was a democrat to the core , could not tolerate Napoleon ' assumption of the purple , and therefore changed the title page o : his work . It will be understood from these statements that the significant . indeed revolutionary , achievement of Beethoven was the transformation of instrumental composition from the state of music for the sake of pure  | musical beauty to that of music with a message and a mission . He was the connecting link between what are known as the classic and romantic schools of musical art . The classic masters strove for perfect beauty , and regarded the formal construction of their works as a paramount issue . The romantic writers demanded the right to alter established forms according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine was that the content was the vital element , and that it should dictate the form . Beethoven stood at the end of the classic school and the beginning of the romantic . He composed his mighty symphonies , his piano sonatas , and his string quartets in the old classic form developed by the searchers for perfect musical beauty ; but he demonstrated that this form could be made the medium for the communication of the profoundest thoughts fitted for musical expression . WAGNER THE CREATOR OF MUSIC DRAMA Richard Wagner 's special claim to a place among the Titans of music rests upon his adaptation of some of the methods of the Greek dramatists to the modern opera . What had been a mere amusement in the hands of the Italians of the early part of the last century was elevated by Wagner to the condition of a universal artwork founded upon thoughts common to mankind as preserved in the mythologies of great races . Wagner built his musical dramas on the legends of the Norse and Teutonic peoples . He developed the ethical doctrines far beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matchless accents the saving grace of woman . He treated in one series of operas the Christian legends modified and developed in the stories of his " Tannhauser , " " Lohengrin , " and " Parsifal , " and in another series the splendid Pagan fables were utilized in his " Flying Dutchman , " " Tristan and Isolde , " and " Ring of the Nibelung . " He also wrote a superb musical comedy , " Die Meistersinger , " in which , while depicting the manners of a period of German history , he satirized the tendency of classicists to reject newand beautiful ideas conveyed in unfamiliar forms .  | In creating the musical medium for these extraordinary lyric dramas , Wagner overset most of the evil practices which had twined themselves about the operatic art . He delivered it from a lamentable slavery , and , by wedding it to the poetic soul of the text , raised it to the blessed estate of a truly artistic wedlock . One does not hear in the Wagner drama music devised merely to tickle the ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner insisted upon the organic cooperation of all the arts of the stage , poetry , scenic illusion , action , and music . His aim was the creation of the most potent and convincing dramatic realization of the splendid ideals found in the poetic bases of his dramas . He therefore originated a new vocal style , a new magnificence of orchestral utterance , a new tradition of operatic action . His works were so stupendous in thought and execution that at first they antagonized the slothful operatic public ; but in time they conquered the world , and for at least twenty-five years no one has composed an opera ? as if Wagner had not existed . He was without question the greatest master of the lyric drama that ever lived , and his methods have revolutionized the whole domain of music , just as did those of Beethoven . It will be seen from the foregoing review of the principal achievements of these six masters of music , that each of them was an originator of a method of creating beauty . Bach showed how to scale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of ut ance developed by centuries of ecclesiastic thought . Handel led this land of music beyond the limits placed upon it by the sanctuary , and imparted to it the more liberal , if less sacred , accents of public eloquence . Haydn showed men how to write instrumental music that should give delight not only by the fluent sweetness of its melodies , but by the ingenuity of its formal construction . Mozart taught composers for the stage how to give their mimic personages character , and to find in the tone art an unerring delineator of the emotions of the drama . Beethoven set instrumental music on a new footing , and made possible a method of mood communication undreamed by Haydn . Wagner seized upon the opera , which had been little more than a public amusement , and made of it a splendid art creation , whose eloquence appeals to all classes , all races , and all nations . It is not difficult to see how these six men have enriched human life , and what a debt of gratitude the world owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
