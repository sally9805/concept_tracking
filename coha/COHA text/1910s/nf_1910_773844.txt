txt 8o MORPHOLOGY the trichogyne . The spermatia have been found attached to the exposed tip of the trichogyne , with their nuclei gone ; so that discharge and nuclear fusion seem to be safe in-ferences . The archi-carp then enlarges and divides , becom-ing transformed into the ascogonium , from which arise the usual ascogenous h y-phae . From hyphae beneath the asco-gonium the sterile branches arise that Produce the invest ing sterile tissue of the ascocarp , the whole structure finally breaking through the surface of the thallus , usually in the form of a disklike or saucer-like ascocarp ( apothecium , fig. 190 ) . One ascocarp may involve a single ascogonium or several , just as described under Pezizales ( see p. 73 ) . ( 3 ) BASIDIOMYCETES This great group of fungi is characterized by the occurrence of a basidium in the life history . A basidium is the swollen end of a hypha , and consists of four cells or one cell ; but in either case it usually gives rise to four slender branches ( sterigmata ) , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( fig. 201 ) . The basidium holds the same place in the life history of a basidiomycete that an ascus does in the life history of an ascomycete . The essential feature of a basidium is that it produces spores externally and that the theoretical number of spores is four . As in the history of the ascus , the young basidium contains two nuclei which fuse . Unlike the ascus , however , the fusion nucleus of the basidium , by two successive divisions , gives rise to four nuclei , and it is these four nuclei that are found in the four spores . In some cases four sterigmata are not produced and four spores are not formed , but four nuclei appear in the basidium. // Among the " higher Basidiomycetos the basidia form a definite layer ( hymenium ) , whose structure and position are important in classification . As yet , the classification of this great group is very uncertain , but for our purpose two great series may be recognized . I. Protobasidiomycetes , in which the basidium is four-celled , each cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the basidium is one-celled and bears four spores ( or at least produces four nuclei ) . I. PROTOBASIDIOMYCETES ( a ) Ustilaginales General character . ? These are the smuts or brand fungi , destructive parasites that attack the floral and other organs , notably the ovaries of grasses , and are of course best known in connection with their ravages among cereals . Ustilago Maydis , the corn smut , may be taken as a representative . Corn smut . ? The mycelium may infect any part of the host , even the roots , and may give external indications of its presence in any region . At the time of flowering , for example , the ovary may become packed with mycelium , which causes a distorted , swollen , tumor-like growth . These tumor-like swellings may be observed also in other parts of the plant , including the tassels . Later this mycelium forms additional cross walls ; the short cells become rounded off and thickwalled , and the mycelium is thus transformed into a mass of black spores , which are the so-called brand spores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of heavy-walled spore , which is a transformed vegetative cell of a septate mycelium , is called a clalamydospore , the name referring to the heavy , protective wall . These spores fall to the ground and pass the winter . Upon germination in the spring , the spore develops a short filament of three or four cells . This filament is saprophytic and each cell buds out spores laterally and the end cell terminally , suggesting conidium-formation . If abundant food supply is available , spores continue to be abstricted in great numbers , and may be multiplied further by the yeastlike budding of the spores ( see p. 70 ) . This filament of three or four cells is thought to represent the basidium , but in this case the very indefinite number of spores produced obscures the resemblance . The spores produced , therefore , are probably ba sidiospores , and the brand spores hold the same place in the life history of smuts as that held by the teleutospores in the life history of rusts // ( see p. 82 ) . The basidiospore develops a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Uredinales General character . ? These are the well-known rusts , all of them being destructive parasites , whose mycelia live in the intercellular spaces of higher plants , especially in the leaves . The best-known form is Puccinia graminis , one of the wheat rusts , and an outline of its life history will serve as an illustration of the group . Wheat rust . ? The mycelium traverses the tissues of the young wheat plant , and during the growth of the host it sends to the surface numerous sporophores , each bearing a single spore , the uredospore ( fig. 191 ) . The groups of uredospores ( summer spores ) on the surface of the host form reddish spots or lines , giving rise to the name rust or red rust . By means of the uredospores the disease spreads rapidly through the growing wheat , the spores falling on the surface of uninfected wheat plants and sending out germ tubes that penetrate the host and form new mycelia . As the wheat plants mature , the mycelium sends to the surface of the host another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thick-walled ( figs. 192 , 193 ) . The teleutospores ( winter spores ) are the wint3r stage of the parasite , germinating in the following spring . Basidium . ? The germination of the teleutospore results in a filament of four cells , each of which gives rise to a slender branch bearing a spore ( fig. 194 ) . This saprophytic filament has been called the promycelium , and its spores sporidia ; but it repfesents a four-celled basidium bearing basidiospores , and is the structure that determines the position of rusts among Basidiomycetes . Aecidium . ? The basidiospores that fall upon young barberry leaves germinate , and an extensive mycelium is developed among the tissues of the new host . This mycelium develops very evident structures of two kinds . Opening usually upon the upper surface of the leaf , small , flask-shaped organs appear , known as spermogonia , within which there arise slender filaments that form by successive abstrictions numerous very small cells , the spermatia ( fig. 195 ) . The names spermogonium and spermatium indicate the belief that this structure is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fucus ( see p. 50 ) . However , this function has not been demonstrated , and some regard them as spore-producing structures , in which case they are spoken of as pycnidia producing pycnidios pores . If this is a sexual apparatus , it would seem to be a vestigial one . The other structure produced by the mycelium in the barberry leaf is the aecidium or clustercup . The aecidia usually appear in groups on the lower leaf surface , each opening upon the surface as a cup containing numerous simple sporophores bearing rows of spores , the aecidiospores ( fig. 196 ) . The scattered aecidiospores that fall upon young wheat plants germinate , the host is penetrated , and the mycelium is produced that begins td form uredospores . Polymorphism . ? In this life history the fungus passes through three distinct phases ( the parasitic mycelium bearing uredospores and // teleutospores , the saprophytic promycelium or basidium bearing basidiospores , and the parasitic mycelium bearing aecidiospores ) , lives upon two unrelated hosts , and produces four ( perhaps five ) kinds of spores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been understood at first , and that the different phases should have received different names . The mycelium bearing uredospores was n2.med Uredo ; that bearing teleutospores , not known at first to be the same mycelium , was named Puccinia ; and the form parasitic on the bar-berry was named Aecidium . Now the name Puccinia is retained for the plant , and the other names are used for convenience in designat-ing the respective stages . Not all rusts include two hosts in their life history , and it is usual to distinguish rusts as autoicous ( those having one host ) and heteroicous ( those having more than one host ) . Alternation . ? Recently the nuclear changes in the life history of wheat rust have been traced . In the aecidium , the cell which produces a row of aecidiospores contains two nuclei , which have been brought together in a single cell somewhere in the mycelium . In the subsequent cell divisions the two nuclei divide independently , so that each aecidiospore contains two nuclei . This binucleate condition con- // tinues in the uredospore-producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleutospore . In the maturing teleutospore , however , the nuclei fuse , so that the cells of the mature teleutospore are uninucleate . This uninucleate condition continues in the cells of the basidium ( promycelium ) , in the basidiospores ( sporidia ) , and in the mycelium on the barberry . Some investigators see in this nuclear history an alternation of generations , the double number of chromosomes ( 2x ) being represented by the two nuclei , and the reduction division ( resulting in the x number ) occurring in the formation of the four cells of the basidium . If this view is correct , the mycelium on wheat is a sporophyte , and the mycelium on barberry is a gametophyte . Other rusts . ? Owing to its infrequency in those regions , it is evident that barberry can not be a general host in the chief wheat-producing areas of North America . Much of the rust attacking the wheat in these fields is not P. graminis , but one or more other species whose aecidia develop upon other intermediate hosts . It has been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at-tack directly the young wheat in the spring , thus eliminating the need of an aecidium host . It has also been claimed that the basidiospores may germinate upon very young wheat plants and infect them , but the claim is very doubtful . The common species of wheat rust mentioned above have now been broken up into numerous species and varieties upon what are called physiological characters . This means that although they may be alike in their appearance , they can be distinguished by their behavior in the selection of hosts . As might be expected , the complete life histories of comparatively few rusts having different hosts are known . The two hosts do not sug-gest one another , and therefore numerous rusts in their various stages are described as Uredo , Puccinia , and Aecidium , without any knowledge as to the forms that belong together in a single life history . Recently the work of linking these forms together has gone forward with consid-erable rapidity . The following list will serve as an illustration of a few of the results , showing also the unrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the ear fungi , appearing as gelatinous , earlike growths on bark , board fences , etc. , a very common form being seen on old stems of elder . When moist , the ear is gelatinous and brightly colored ; when dry , it becomes hard and gray and wrinkled , and externally hairy . This ear is a complex sporophore arising from a mycelium , its internal surface being lined with a hymenium . A section of the hymenium shows basidia transversely divided into four cells , each cell giving rise to a slender branch ( sterigma ) which produces a basidiospore . This basidium so much resembles that of the Uredinales ( the promycelium ) that the ear fungi are sometimes grouped with them ; but the complex sporophore is distinctly like that of the fleshy fungi. ( d ) Tremellales These fungi also appear as gelatinous growths on decaying wood and tree trunks , these growths being complex and more or less indefinite sporophores from a mycelium . When moist , they appear usually as thick , wavy , or folded coatings of quivering gelatinous consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hymenial layer , and the basidia are peculiar in being divided longitudinally into four cells , each cell terminating in a long , slender filament ( sterigma ) bearing a basidiospore . II . AUTOBASIDIOMYCETES These are the true Basidiomycetes , the basidium being one-celled , and they constitute the large assemblage of forms known as the fleshy fungi . Two great subgroups are recognized : ( I ) Hymenomycetes , in which the hymenium is exposed ; and ( II ) Gasteromycetes , in which the hymenium is inclosed. . 1 . Hymenomycetes ( e ) Dacromycetales These forms are interesting on account of their evident relationship to the Tremellales , which they resemble in their gelatinous sporophores . The one-celled basidium forks into two long sterigmata , and hence produces two basidiospores . It has been discovered that the nuclear fusion in the basidium is followed by two successive divisions , resulting in four nuclei , as in all basidia . In spore formation two nuclei remain in the basidium , or the two nuclei may move in pairs into the sterigmata , one of each pair entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites attacks , among other hosts , members of the heath family , as huckleberries , cranberries , etc. , the tips of the shoots , buds , flowers , or young ovaries of the host becoming enlarged and distorted into gall-like growths . These affected parts finally become covered with a whitish bloom , made by the basidia // coming to the surface , after having broken ) through the epidermis . These basidia , each bearing four spores , arise directly from the mycelium , without any complex sporophore formation , differing in this respect from the following groups . ( g ) ' Thelephorales The sporophores of these forms appear on tree , trunks as flat and tough leathery incrustations , the hymenium spreading over the smooth upper surface ; or as brackets raised above the substratum , the hymenium extending over the under surface ; or as funnel-shaped bodies lined with the hymenium . The general character of the sporophore distinguishes this group from the next ; and the indefinite extent of the hymenium over the sporophore distinguishes both groups from those which follow . ( h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporophores that often simulate branching coral in form , the hymenium covering the whole surface of the branches . There are also unbranched , club-shaped sporophores ; but all are characteristically fleshy and hymenium-covered. ( i ) Agaricales This is by far the greatest group of fleshy fungi , containing most of the so-called mushrooms and toadstools . The complex sporophore is usually definite in form , being differentiated into slipe and pileus ( fig. 197 ) , the latter having special surfaces for the hymenium . The principal families are as follows : Hydnaceae . ? These are the tooth fungi , so named because the hymenium covers toothlike or spinelike processes . In simpler forms the sporophore resembles an incrustation , in which case the teeth are on the upper surface . In other cases the teeth occur on the under surface of a bracket-like sporophore ; while in Hydnum they are upon the under surface of the pileus of a mushroom-like sporophore . Polyporaceae . ? These are the pore fungi , so named because the hymenium lines tubes that terminate on the surface with porelike openings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper surface ; or bracket forms ( as Polyporus ) , with pores on the under surface ; or mushroom-like forms ( Boletus ) , with pores on the under surface of the pileus . The incrusting forms and the hard , gray , hoof-shaped bracket forms are very common on tree trunks , fallen logs , stumps , etc . Many are destructive to trees , the mycelium spreading extensively under the bark and through the wood . Agaricaceae . ? These are the gill fungi , being the common mushrooms and toadstools . and the largest family of fleshy fungi . There are bracket forms , but the prevailing type of sporophore is the mushroom , with stipe and pileus ( figs. 198 , 199 ) ; and in every case the hymenium covers bladelike plates , which are the gills ( figs. 200 , 201 ) . Many of the Agaricaceae also are destructive parasites on trees , the mycelium penetrating the host extensively . The development of the characteristic sporophore is as follows . The small buttons consist of interwoven hyphae . Soon the rudiments of stalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volva ) . The elongation of the stipe ruptures the volva , whose torn remnant may form a ring or sheath about the base of the stipe . In many cases a membrane ( velum ) of hyphal tissue extends in the young sporophore from the margin of the pileus to the stipe , covering the gills . When the velum is ruptured by the growth of the pileus , it may remain as a ring of tissue ( annulus ) about the stipe ( fig 597 ) . The presence of two nuclei in the young basidium , the nuclear fusion , the two successive divisions , the migration of the four nuclei into the four sterigmata and // so into the basidiospores , have all been observed In mushrooms . In the common field mushroom ( Agaricus campestris ) the basidium often produces only two sterigmata and spores , but in suc cases four nuclei have been ob served in the mature basidium The vegetative mycelium has bee observed to be binucleate , the con dition found in the uredospore teleutospore mycelium of rust With a uninucleate basidiospor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determin where the binucleate conditio originates . It is suggested tha the basidiospore upon germinatio becomes binucleate . In that case if the interpretation applied to th rusts ( see p. 84 ) obtains amon the mushrooms , the mycelium wit its sporophore is the sporophyte and the basidiospore represent the gametophyte. 2 . Gusteromycetes These are the most highly organized of the fungi , the complexity appearing in the structure of the sporophore . The hymenium is inclosed within the sporophore , which opens only after the spores are mature . The sporophore is differentiated into an outer zone of cortical hyphae ( peridium ) and an inner mass of tissue ( gleba ) which contains the numerous ba-sidium-bearing chambers . These chambers either are filled with loosely woven hyphae whose lateral branches terminate in basidia , or are lined by a definite hyme-nial layer . The gradually increasing complexity of the sporophore will be observed in the following groups : // ( j ) Hymenogastrales This group contains the simplest Gasteromycetes , and the name suggests characters belonging to both Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes . The peridium is simple ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruptures irregularly . The gleba is not chambered , the basidia simply terminating lateral branches of the glebal hyphae. ( k ) Sclerodermales In this group the nearly spherical sporophores have a thick leathery ( light brown ) peridium , which finally becomes cracked or ruptured at apex . The leathery peridium suggested the name of the group . The gleba is chambered , but the chambers are filled with interwoven hyphae whose lateral branches bear pear-shaped basidia , upon which appear four sessile spores , sterigmata not being formed . ( 1 ) Lycoperdales These are the true puffballs , with globular sporophores which sometimes reach 50 cm. in diameter . The peridium is distinctly two-layered and with definite dehiscence . In Lycoperdon the outer layer of the peridium gradually flakes off , and the inner layer bursts at the apex . In Geaster ( earth star ) the outer layer splits into stellate spreading segments , and the inner layer dehisces by a terminal pore ( figs. 1123 , 1124 ) . The gleba contains numerous distinct chambers lined with a hymenial layer and also containing a capillitium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from the wall of the chamber and aiding in the dispersal of the spores. ( m ) Nidulariales These are the nest fungi , as the name suggests . The separate chambers of the gleba become invested each by a membrane of interwoven hyphae , and at maturity become freed by the breaking down of the intervening tissue . When the peridium opens , forming a cuplike structure , the free , membrane-covered hymenial chambers are seen lying like eggs in a nest . ( n ) Phallales These are the stink horns , whose sporophore is more complex than that of any other fungi . The sporophore develops on the mycelium as a white , egg-shaped body . The peridium is two-layered , but the tissue within , which is all gleba in the other groups , is differentiated into a central hollow cylindrical axis and an investing dome-shaped and chambered gleba . At maturity the cylindrical axis elongates with great // rapidity into a stout , hollow stalk , bursts through the peridium , and carries up on its summit the caplike and chambered gleba , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed deliquesces into a slimy , dripping mass with the odor of carrion , which attracts carrion flies , by whose agency the embedded spores are dispersed . Lichens The Ascomycetes , with a few exceptions , are the lichen formers ( see p. 78 ) , and these exceptions are basidiomycetes . These lichens are the tropical Core pavonia , of loose texture , whose mycelium produces basidia at the surface , instead of the ordinary ascocarp , and a few related forms . CHAPTER II ? BRYOPHYTES Introductory . ? This great division of plants comprises the liverworts ( Hepaticae ) and mosses ( Musa ) . The conspicuous features of the group as contrasted with thallophytes are as follows : 1 . The establishment of a definite alternation of generations . Distinct sexual and sexless individuals alternately produce each other , the gametophyte producing the sex organs ( containing gametes ) , the sporophyte producing the asexual spores . The two generations are further distinguished by their chromosome numbers : the 2X number arises from the fusion of the sexual cells , and occurs in all the cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the cells of the gametophyte , the reduction taking place in connection with the formation of the tetrad of spores by the mother cell . 2 . The appearance of the archegonium . This female sex organ is very characteristic of the groups that possess it ( bryophytes , pteridophytes , and gymnosperms ) . On this account they are often spoken of collectively as archegoniates , but the groups are too unrelated to deserve a collective name . The archegonium is a flask-shaped organ , consisting of a jacket of sterile cells ( neck and venter ) surrounding an axial row of cells ( neck canal cells , ventral canal cell , and egg ) ( fig. 219 ) . The cells of the axial row are doubtless to be regarded as potential eggs , only the innermost one maturing and functioning as an egg , the others breaking down and leaving an open canal to the egg . 3 . The appearance of a multicellular antheridium . Multicellular sex organs and even multicellular antheridia appear among the algae , as in Ectocar pus ( se ? , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the antheridium of bryophytes is a very uniform and characteristic structure . It is more or less stalked , and consists of a single layer of sterile jacket cells investing a mass of small cubical sperm mother cells ( fig. 210 ) . The sperm is also of a definite kind , consisting of a small , more or less spirally curved body bearing a pair of long terminal cilia ( fig. 2II ) . 9e // r . HEPATICAE General character . ? The liverworts are of great interest on account of their apparent relationship to the green algae on the one hand , and to the higher plants on the other . Through them the aerial habit of green plants seems to have been established . This change in habit involved more compact and better protected bodies , and the change from swimming spores to aerial spores ; but it is important to note that the swimming habit was retained by the sperms . Three groups of liverworts are recog nized , each having developed special features : ( I ) Marchantiales , ( 2 ) Jungermanniales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This group may be represented by its two prominent families , Riccia ceae and Marchantiaceae ; the former representing the more primitive forms , the latter the highly specialized forms . Ricciaceae . ? The genus Riccia ( including Ricciocar pus ) contains aquatic as well as terrestrial species , so that this family belongs to both the water and the land . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte is a flat , dorsiventral body and branches dichotomously ( fig. 202 ) . This dorsiventral habit results in a differentiation of the body into two distinct regions . The dorsal ( upper ) jai Fi 202. - Riccia showing the d dorsiv ve entral , dichotomously branching gametophyte , which puts out rhizoids and scales from its ventral surface ; the rows of dark bodies in the bottom of the conspicuous grooves on the dorsal surface are sporophytes , which show also the position formerly occupied by the archegonia. region is composed of green tissue , the intercellular spaces developing as numerous deep and narrow clefts , which in some cases broaden into chambers " ( fig. 203 ) , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . The superficial cells ( epidermis ) of the dorsal region , discontinuous on account of the numerous clefts , may or may not contain chloroplasts . The cells of the ventral region , against the substratum , do not contain chloroplasts , and the superficial cells often give rise to simple , hairlike rhizoids that serve as holdfasts . Antheridium . ? The antheridia occur in discoid areas slightly raised above the general surface of the thallus , each antheridium standing at the bottom of a deep pit formed by the overgrowth of the surrounding issues ( fig. 204 ) . The antheridium levelops from a single superficial : ell ( antheridium initial ) , and consists of a superficial layer ( wall ) of ster-ile cells investing a compact mass of sperm mother cells ( fig. 2I0 ) . The antheridium initial develops a papillate protrusion , which is cut off by a transverse wall as a projecting cell . A series of transverse divisions transforms this projecting cell into a row of cells . Then vertical ( periclinal ) walls cut off central cells , which by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figs. 205-210 ) . In each mother cell two sperms are formed , the oblique spindles for which are shown in two regions of fig. 210 . Archegonium. ? The archegonia are sunk in deep pits or furrows of the thallus by the overgrowth of the surrounding tissues . The arche-gonium develops just as the antheridium as far as the projecting cell . This cell , however , divides by three vertical walls that surround an inner cell on all sides . A transverse division of this cell then completes the investment of a central cell . This central cell , by transverse divi-sions , develops the axial row , consisting of four neck canal cells , a ventral canal cell , and the egg . The investing sterile cells develop the venter and neck , the latter consisting of six vertical rows of cells ( figs. 212 ? 219 ) . // Sporophyte . ? The fertilized egg ( fig. 220 ) produces the sporophyte ( called sporogonium in the bryophytes ) , which when mature is a spherical body , consisting of a wall layer of sterile cells investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In producing thi body the egg by succes sive divisions usuall first becomes a spher of eight cells ( octants ) Then periclinal ( paralle with the surface ) wall cut off an outer layer o cells ( amphithecium ) tha forms the wall of th sporophyte . The grou of inner cells is th endothecium , which b successive divisions pro duces a mass of sporog enous tissue . The cell produced by the las divisions of the sporog enous tissue are the spor mother cells , each o which produces a tetra of spores ( fig. 226 ) , dur ing which process th reduction in the numbe of chromosomes occurs The mature sporophyte therefore , is simply spore case . The vente of the archegonium grows also , forming a special investing strut ture , the calyptra ( fig 225 ) . Finally the wall layer of the sporophyte and the layers of the calyptra become disorganized , and the spores are free in the archegonial chamber . The spores upon germination produce the gametophyte body .  | MORPHOLOGY Conclusions . ? The life history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest known among // liverworts , being only a spore case , and from such a structure many sup-pose that sporophytes of the higher plants have developed . This primi-tive sporophyte is dependent in a large measure upon the gameto-phyte for its nutrition , so that it appears simply as a spore case developed by the gametophyte . The gametophyte , on the other hand , is far from being the simplest gametophyte known among liverworts , being quite complex in structure . The simplest liverworts should combine the simplest gametophyte with the simplest sporophyte , but such a combination is not known , and per-haps it no longer exists . It follows that while the history of the liver-wort sporophyte may well begin with the Ricciaceae , the history of the liverwort gametophyte must begin with other forms . Marchantiaceae . ? This family includes the most highly specialized of the Marchantiales . The familiar genus Marchantia may be used as an illustration . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte body is a highly developed thallus , whose dorsal region contains a series of large air chambers domed by the epidermis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // These special cells are in short and more or less branching fila-ments that arise from the floor of the chamber and contain the chlo-roplasts , and are thus freely exposed to the internal atmosphere . This remarkable apparatus is one of the specialized features of the Mar-chantiaceae . In the center of the epidermal dome , roofing each air chamber , there is developed a chimney-like air pore . In the ventral region the tissue is composed of colorless cells , and the ventral epidermis develops two kinds of rhizoids and two longitudinal rows of scales . Upon the dorsal surface cuplike structures ( cupules ) are produced , which contain special reproductive bodies ( gemmae ) , which can develop new gametophytes ( figs. 228 , 229 ) . The gemma of Marchantia is a discoid body with two notches on opposite sides , the growing points being located at the bottom of the notches ( figs. 1118 , 1119 ) . In the development of the gametophyte body there are usually three distinct stages : ( I ) a filament of varying length ; ( 2 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cutting faces , ' by means of which the thallus begins to broaden ; and ( 3 ) the development of an apical cell with three or four cutting faces , by means of which the thallus begins to thicken . Sex organs . ? The sex organs are not scattered over the dorsal sur-face , but are restricted to definite areas , these areas becoming disks of // special structure ( receptacles ) . In some cases the receptacles are sessile , but in Marchantia they become long-stalked , the archegonial and an theridial receptacles occurring on different gametophytes . The receptacle borne by the antheridial branch is a disk with lobed margin , a growing point being at the tip of each lobe ( fig. 228 ) . Over the upper surface of this disk the antheridia occur in flask-shaped cavities formed by the overgrowth of the adjacent tissue . From the bottom of each cavity a single antheridium arises ( rarely two ) , similar in structure to those described under Ricciaceae ( figs. 205-2I0 ) . The receptacle borne by the archegonial branch is star-shaped ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the rays , in con nection with the growing points . They arise from the upper surface ( morphologically ) of the disk , but as this becomes the apparent lower surface by the overgrowth of the upper surface , they hang within the notches neck downward . They develop as in the Ricciaceae , but there are usually eight neck canal cells ( figs. 212-219 ) . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte begins to develop as among the Ric ciaceae , but not all of the cells of the endothecium produce sporogenous tissue . Approximately half of these cells gitic ri e to the sporogenous tissue and spores . This means that the sporogenous tissue in the sporo phyte of Marchantia is reduced as compargd , with chat o : the Ric ciaceae . The remaining tissue of the e ido4h.etsi , ; sire . it does not produl-e spores , is said to be sterile . This sterile tissue in Marchantia , which was sporogenous tissue in the Ricciaceae , forms a region of the sporophyte quite distinct from the spore-producing region , so that in the mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule , containing the spores ; ( 2 ) the seta , a short stalk beneath the capsule , which elongates rapidly as the capsule matures ; and ( 3 ) the foot , a spreading structure in which the seta ends , and which anchors the sporophyte in the gametophyte and also acts as an absorbing organ ( fig. 230 ) . The spore production of Marchantia is further diminished by the fact that not all the potentially sporogenous cells produce spores . Some of them become converted into curious elongated , fiber-like cells with spiral thickening ( elaters ) , which by their hygroscopic movements assist in loosening up the spore mass in connection with dehiscence and scattering . The usual calyptra is formed about the developing sporophyte by the venter of the archegonium , but at maturity the capsule breaks through this by the rapid elongation of the seta . After its escape from the calyptra the capsule breaks irregularly and discharges its spores . Conclusions . ? The Marchantiales are characterized by a distinct and strong differentiation of the tissues of the gametophyte , leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for photosynthesis . There is . observable in the group also a distinct tendency in the sporophyte toward the sterilization of the potentially sporogenous tissue into the sterile tissue developing the seta and foot . This means that seta and foot are derived historically from sporogenous tissue . The development of the seta , moreover , is associated with the dispersal of spores , its rapid elongation freeing the capsule from the calyptra . The further sterilization of potentially sporogenous tissue in the production of elaters is another feature of the group , and is also associated with spore dispersal . On the whole , the chief distinction of Marchantiales'as compareff with the other groups of liverworts is the differentiation of the tissues of the gametophyte , which has reached its extreme expyression iii Iiarthantia . BRYOPHYTES IOI ( 2 ) JUNGERMANNIALES General character . ? This is by far the largest group of liverworts , its members living in all conditions of moisture from very wet to very dry . They are especially abundant in tropica forests , being very common on the bark o trees ( epiphytic ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Two grea groups are recognized : ( 1 ) thallose forms whose gametophyte body is a thallus resem bling that of the Marchantiales in genera outline ( see fig. 777 ) ; ( 2 ) foliose forms , wit leafy bodies ( fig. 235 ) . However , there i complete gradation from thallus bodies through those whose thallus is more an more deeply lobed , to those in which th lobes have become distinct leaves . The most essential distinction between th two groups is based upon the position of the archegonia , which of course involves the position of the sporophytes . In the thallose forms the archegonia are on the dorsal surface of the thallus ( figs. 231 , 232 ) ; and on this account they are called the Anacrogynae , mean-ing archegonia not at the apex . In most foliose forms the apical cell becomes an archegonium initial ; and on this account they are called Acrogynae , meaning archegonia at the apex ( fig. 235 ) . The acrogynous Jungerman-nialn are known commonly as the leafy liverworts , or some-times as scale mosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little differentiation of the tissues of the gametophyte ; but they show very great differentiation in the form of the gametophyte. ( a ) Anacrogynae Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte of the simplest Anacrogynae , such as Aneura and Pellia , are the simplest gametophytes known among IO2 MORPHOLOGY liverworts ( fig. 231 ) . They consist of dichotomously branching plates of similar cells , all containing chloroplasts , and with no differentiation of tissues into dorsal and ventral regions . In developing from the spore , only two stages are to be observed : ( 1 ) the filamentous stage , followed by ( 2 ) the stage of the apical cell with two cutting faces . Among the Marchantiales it was noted that these two stages are followed by another , which is accompanied by a distinct differentiation of tissues . The adult thallus of Aneura and Pellia , therefore , represents an embryonic stage of the thallus of Marchantiales . If the sporophyte of Riccia were combined with the gametophyte of Pellia in a single life history , the result would be the simplest hypothetical liverwort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Symphyogyna , etc. ) the gametophyte becomes more complex , beginning to lobe and to develop indistinct leaves ( fig. 232 ) , and in some cases the body becomes distinctly leafy . These leafy forms are classed among the Anacrogynae , however , because the archegonia are dorsal and not terminal . The gametophytes may be multiplied vegetatively in various ways : ( I ) by the death of main axes , thus isolating branches which become independent individuals ; ( 2 ) by gemmae , which are many-celled bodies formed on the surface of the thallus or cut off from the margin ; in Aneura two-celled gemmae have been seen to escape from cells of the thallus ; ( 3 ) by tubers , which are special subterranean branches formed at the end of the growing season and which remain dormant until the return of favorable conditions . Sex organs . ? The sex organs occur singly or in groups on the dorsal surface of the thallus ( figs. 231 , 232 ) or of special branches . In Aneura , for example , the antheridia are sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding tissue ( as in Marchantia ) . The development of the antheridium is very different from that described for the Marchantiales . The projecting papillate cell , derived from the antheridium initial , divides transversely , the lower cell by successive divisions building up a stalk of varying length . The outer cell , which is to form the somewhat globular body of the antheridium , divides by a vertical wall , and this is followed by four other vertical and intersecting walls , so directed as to cut off four peripheral cells , which inclose two central cells . The peripheral cells form the wall of the antheridium , a single layer of cells in thickness ; while the two central cells give rise to the sperm mother cells . The sperm has a more or less coiled body and the usual pair of long terminal cilia. // The archegonia are developed as among the Marchantiales , with three vertical intersecting walls , a cap cell , and a central cell which develops the axial row . In this case the neck canal cells are six to eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aneura , is more complex than that of Marchantia . Much more of the sporophyte is sterile tissue , the sporogenous tissue being still more restricted . The sterile tissue develops a foot and an elongated seta ( fig. 2,31 ) ; and the spore output is still further reduced by the development of elaters and by the use of some of the sporogenous tissue in nourishing the functioning mother cells . In certain forms there occurs also a mass of sterile tissue projecting into the spore chamber from above ( Aneura ) or from below ( Pellia ) , which , on account of its relation to the elaters that radiate from it , is called an elaterophore . As in Marchantia , the seta elongates with great rapidity when the capsule is mature . The capsule opens usually by the longitudinal splitting of the wall into four pieces ( valves ) , which is a more definite and special mechanism for dehiscence than is developed among the Marchantiales . Conclusions . ? The anacrogynous Jungermanniales exhibit some of the simplest gametophytes known among liverworts . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the leafy state , thus changing in form , but without any marked differentiation of tissues . The sporophyte is more highly developed than among Marchantiales , in the sense that there is more sterilization , more organization of the sterile tissue , a stronger development of the seta , and a more specialized dehiscence . Apparently it is a group which has retained the primitive structure of the gametophyte for a Jong time , but in which the sporophyte has developed rapidly . In Pellia and A neura , therefore , we find the simplest gametophyte associated with an advanced sporophyte , the converse being true of the Ricciaceae. ( b ) Acrogynae General character . ? A good representative of the leafy liverworts is Porella . As has been said , the Acrogynae are characterized not only by being leafy forms , but chiefly by the fact that the apical cell of special branches becomes an archegonium initial . This apical position of the archegonium and hence of the sporophyte ( fig. 235 ) is in sharp contrast with their dorsal position among the Anacrogynae . Gametophyte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three stages : ( 1 ) the filamentous stage , ( 2 ) perhaps the stage of an apical cell with two cutting faces , and ( 3 ) the stage of the apical cell with three cutting faces . It should be noted that this is one more stage than shown by Aneura ( see p . IO2 ) , but it is not absolutely certain that the second stage occurs , at least with any regularity . The apical cell of the last stage , cutting off three series of segments , gives rise to three rows of leaves ? two dorsal and one ventral . The mature dorsiventral body consists of a distinct branching axis ( stem ) bearing two rows of dorsal leaves ( figs. 233-235 ) , which are usually two lobed ; and one ventral row of very small leaves against the substratum ( amphigastria ) , variable in form ( fig. 233 ) . The two lobes of the dorsal , chlorophyllbearing leaves are equal or unequal ; and in certain epiphytic forms the lower ( ventral ) lobe forms a small sac containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as given under Anacrogynae ( see p. 102 ) , but the gemmae are usually simpler , often consisting of only one or two cells separating from the leaf margins . Sex , organs . ? The antheridia , of Porella are on short lateral branches , which differ very much in appearance from the sterile branches ( fig. 234 ) . They are conspicuous on account of the closely imbricated leaves , in each of whose axils there is a single , long-stalked , and globular antheridium ( fig. 236 ) . The development of the antheridium is as described under Anacrogynae ( see p . IO2 ) . The archegonia also occur on short lateral branches ( fig. 235 ) , being found in a group at the apex . This group is usually surrounded by a rosette of modified ( usually enlarged ) leaves . The archegonia arise from segments of the apical cell , and finally the apical cell itself becomes // an archegonium initial . The neck canal cells are six or eight in number , and the neck is almost as broad as the venter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same plant ( monoecious ) or upon different plants ( dioecious ) . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte ( sporogonium ) is as described for the Anacrogynae. ( see p. 103 ) , with a conspicuously elongated seta , the same reduction of sporogenous tissue , and the capsule dehiscing by four spread-ing valves ( fig. 235 ) . Conclusions . ? The es-sential contrasts between Jungermanniales and Marchantiales may be stated as follows : In Marchantiales there is ( i ) a differentiation of the tissues of the gameto-Ph yte , but no special differentiation of form , ( 2 ) less sterilization of potentially sporogenous tissue , ( 3 ) little or no development of the seta , and ( 4 ) irregular dehis-cence of the capsule . In Jungermanniales there is ( i ) a differentiation of the gametophyte into axis and leaves , but little or no differentiation of tissues ; ( 2 ) greater sterilization of potentially sporogenous tissue ; ( 3 ) strong development of the seta ; and ( 4 ) a definite dehiscence of the capsule by four spreading valves . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antheridium . In the main , the archegonia of the two groups are similar , the axial row including six or eight neck canal cells ( the exceptions being Riccia with four and Sphaerocarpus with two ) . The archegonium is a very persistent ( " conservative " ) structure , but the gradual disappearance of the neck canal cells is one of the conspicuous facts in its very slow io6 MORPHOLOGY evolution . It is this gradual disappearance that must be noted in connection with subsequent groups . ( 3 ) ANTHOCEROTALES General character . ? This is a small group comprising four genera : Anthoceros and Notothylas of the temperate regions ; Dendroceros , an epiphytic tropical genus ; and Megaceros , a genus recently described from Java . Although few in numbers , the group is of great morphological interest on account of the claims made for it that it possibly represents the ancestral forms of pteridophytes . Its possible relation to the mosses also further emphasizes its important genetic position . It differs so much from the other liverworts as to have suggested its separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate with liverworts and mosses . In Marchantiales and Jungermanniales there is extensive differentiation of the body of the gametophyte , either in structure or in form ; but in Anthocerotales there is a simple gametophyte , while the sporophyte is the most complex among liverworts . Gametophyte . ? The body of the gametophyte is a simple thallus ( figs. 239 , 240 ) , almost as simple as that of Aneura , and much simpler than that of Marcliantia . The margin is often wavy , lobed , or crisped ; and in Dendroceros the lobing in some cases suggests rudimentary leaves . The thallus matures by means of an apical cell with four cutting faces , the preceding stages appearing as usual . There are two marked peculiarities of the gametophyte body in most of the genera : ( i ) the usually single large chloroplast , generally in contact with or even more or less investing the nucleus ; and ( z ) the mucilage cavities , which open by clefts on the 7entral surface . In these cavities endophytic Nostoc colonies occur . The sex organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in : ertain feature3 they differ strikingly from those of other bryophytes. // Anhheridium . ? The antheridia are embedded in the thallus and are therefore hard to detect ( fig. 237 ) . The antheridial initial is a superficial cell , but it does not develop a papillate protrusion as in the other liver-worts . A transverse ( periclinal ) wall divides it into an outer and an inner cell . In the other groups the outer cell develops the antheridium , but in Anthocerotales the antheridium is developed from the inner cell . By a succession of anticlinal and periclinal divisions , the outer cell produces two layers of cells , which form an outer wall or roof to the antheridial chamber . The inner cell develops one to several antheridia . The method of development of an antheridium , whether directly from the inner cell or from one of its daughter cells , is as follows : two vertical walls at right angles to each other result in four cells ; transverse walls result in several tiers of four cells each ; periclinal walls in the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of spermatogenous cells ; and the lower tiers ( sometimes only the lowest ) develop a more or less elon gated stalk . The antheridium or group of antheridia thus produced lie in what may be called an antheridial chamber ( fig. 237 ) . Archegonium . ? The archegonia also are in the tissue of the thallus , in this respect resembling the archegonia of pteridophytes ( fig. 238 ) . In all other bryophytes they are entirely superficial structures . As a result of this relation to the thallus , there are no sterile Jacket cells ( neck and venter ) very dis tinctfrom the adjacent cells of the thallus . The essential part of an archegonium , however , is the axial row , and in the Anthocerotales this is the only distinct structure . The general outline of development of this axial row is as follows : a superficial cell divides transversely , giving rise to outer and inner cells ; the outer cell divides transversely , giving rise to the cap cell and the primary neck canal cell ; the inner cell is the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two successive divisions , develops a row of four neck canal cells ; the primary ventral cell , by a single transverse division , forms the ventral canal cell and the egg . At maturity the cap cells are thrown off , the neck and ventral canal cells break down , and a broad canal is open to the egg ( fig. 23S ) . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte of Anthocerotales deserves special attention on account of its structure and on account of its degree of indenendence ( fins . 239 , 2qo ) . The outline of its development is as follows : the fertilized egg divides by a vertical wall ( transverse in other bryophytes ) ; subsequent transverse and vertical walls result in three tiers of four cells each ; the three tiers produce foot , seta , and capsule . The innermost tier develops a foot which penetrates the thallus by rhizoidlike processes , and finally becomes a large bulbous structure ( fig. 24r ) . The middle tier , which also contributes somewhat to the foot , develops the so-called intermediate zone , corresponding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a region of active cell-division , continually adding to the capsule below , which thus becomes an elongated structure by basal growth ( as distinct from apical growth ) . This growth may not continue long , resulting in a short capsule ( Nolothylas , fig. 240 ) ; or it may continue long enough to result in a much elongated linear capsule ( Anthoceros , fig. 239 ) . Where the sporophyte ( sporogonium ) emerges from the thallus , a tubular sheath is developed around its base by the tissue of the thallus . Capsule . ? The development of the outermost tier in capsule formation is especially noteworthy . By a series of transverse walls a number of tiers of cells is produced , and periclinal walls cut off a peripheral layer of cells ( amphithecium ) inclosing a group of central cells ( endothecium ) . Among the Marchantiales and Jungermanniales there is the same setting apart of two regions , the amphithecium producing the capsule wall , and the endothecium developing the sporogenous tissue . Among the Anthocerotales , however , the two regions develop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporogenous tissue , but forms a central axis of sterile tissue ( columella ) , which in Anthoceros usually shows sixteen cells ip cross section . By periclinal walls , the amphithecium becomes two-layered , and the inner layer is the sporogenous tissue , which thus caps the columella in a domelike layer ; BRYOPHYTES log later the sporogenous tissue becomes two layers of cells . The outer layer of the amphithecium develops a capsule wall of four or more layers , the outermost one being the epidermal layer , consisting of elongated narrow cells and containing stomata similar to those of vas-cular plants . The stomata are related to the fact that the wall layers beneath the epi- dermis are chlorophyll tissue , giving to the sporophyte the ability to manufacture food . The intermediate zone adds continuously new capsule regions below ; therefore in a longitudinal section of a capsule the whole sporogenous series may be seen , from one-layered sporogenous tissue below , through two-layered sporogenous tissue , mother cells , and tetrads , to mature spores above ( fig. 241 ) . The capsule dehisces by splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , leaving the spores ex-posed upon the columella ( fig. 239 ) . In many cases some of the sporogenous cells do not form spores . These sterile groups of cells break up the continuou mass of sporogenous cells into more or less separated groups . This tendency to break up the sporogenous tissue into separate smaller masses by intervening sterile tissue is an important fact , which will be referred to later . These sterilized and somewhat i modified sporogenous cells are called elaters , but they are different from those found among Marchantiales . This green sporophyte , with its sterile and elongating axis , and its sporogenous tissue broken up into smaller masses , is very suggestive of a possible relation to the completely inde-pendent sporophyte of the pteridophytes . Conclusions . ? Among the Anthocerotales there is a remarkable association of a primitive type of gametophyte with a highly developed // sporophyte . In considering the sporophytes of liverworts in general , it is evident that from Riccia to Anthoceros there is a progressive sterilization of sporogenous tissue , the sterilized tissue forming the vegetative structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are noteworthy : ( r ) the beginning of independence by the development of green tissue ; ( 2 ) the beginning of sporangia by the breaking up of a continuous sporogenous mass into separate smaller masses ; ( 3 ) the establishment of a sterile axis by the transfer of the sporogenous tissue to the outer region of the capsule , which suggests the beginning of a region for the development of vascular tissues and the beginning of superficial sporangia . It should be understood clearly just what is meant by such a statement as that the Anthocerotales have certain features suggestive of the pteridophytes . It does not mean that the pteridophytes have been derived from the Anthocerotales or from any of the bryophytes . It means simply that the sporophyte of the Anthocerotales represents a stage of progress like one through which the pteridophytes may have passed during their evolution . The plant groups as we know them now certainly did not give rise to one another , but they can be used to sub gest general stages of progress , of whose real details and connections we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the great group of bryophytes , both in numbers and in specialization . While the liverworts may be the more interesting from the standpoint of suggestions as to pbylogeny , the mosses are the representative bryophytes in our present flora . For so great a group it is very well defined and consistent . Mosses are widely distributed , being found in all habitats except salt water , and are especially conspicuous in colder regions ( alpine and arctic ) , where they form a prominent feature of the vegetation . They seem to have been derived from liverworts , and their sporophyte characters , at least , suggest a possible connection with Anthocerotales ; while in certain features of the gametophyte the resemblance to Jungermanniales is more evident . Three groups are recognized : ( I ) Sphagnales , ( z ) Andreaeales , and ( 3 ) Bryales . ( I ) SPHAGNALES General character . ? These are the bog mosses , all of which belong to the single genus Sphagnum . They are large , pale mosses , characteristic of the swampy regions of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peat , whence they are often called peat mosses . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte begins as a filament ( fig. 242 ) , and then by means of an apical cell with two cutting faces develops as a simple flat thallus with rhizoids ( fig. 243 ) , just as in the simpler liverworts . The moss character appears in the development from this liverwort-like thallus of an upright leafy branch ( fig. 243 ) . This radial leafy branch , from a dorsiventral body , is called vari-ously the adult shoot , the gametophore , or simply the leafy branch . The name gametophore is used because this branch bears the sex organs , just as in Marchanda the sex organs are borne on erect but leafless branches . The leafy branch develops by means of an apical cell with three cutting faces , and hence there are three vertical rows of leaves . These branches are densely leafy and profusely branching , forming terminal tufts ( fig. 246 ) . // The leaves at first have similar cells , but later there is a striking differentiation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 245 ) ? It is this abundance of hyaline cells and paucity of chlorophyll-containing cells that give a pallid look to the leaves . The axis of the leafy branch is differentiated into three regions : ( i ) a cortex of empty and perforate cells , like the hyaline cells of the leaf ; ( 2 ) a cylinder of elongated cells with thick walls and small caliber ( prosenchyma ) ; and ( 3 ) a pithlike axis . There are no special structures for vegetative multiplication , but great masses of individuals are formed by the indefinite growth and branching above , accompanied by dying off below . Antheridium . ? The antheridia occur on special densely leafy branches resembling small catkins ( fig. 246 ) . The leaves also usually differ in color from the ordinary leaves , and in the axil of each there is a solitary globular and long-stalked antheridium ( fig. 247 ) , just as in Porella ( see p. 104 ) . These antheridia develop by means of an apical cell with two cutting faces , the lower segments forming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is initiated by a series of periclinal walls that cut off the peripheral wall layer from a central spermatogenous group of cells . The antheridium opens by irregular lobes and discharges the two or threecoiled biciliate sperms . Archegonium . ? The archegonia occur at the apex of short branches , at the top of the plant ( figs. 248 , 249 ) They are stalked and free , and develop as in the acrogynous Jungermanniales , the archegonium initials being segments of the apical cell , which itself finally becomes an // initial . The mature archego-nium is stalked , with a massive venter , a long and often twisted neck , and numerous neck canal cells ( fig. 249 ) . Sporophyte. ? The sporophyte ( fig. 25o ) develops at . first by a series of transverse walls until a short filament is formed , which later becomes massive by means of vertical walls . The upper tiers develop the capsule , which is organized as in Anthoceros , with the endothecium developed as the axial columella , with the sporogenous tissue cut off as an inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capping the columella like a dome , and with a wall of five to seven layers . These Anthoceros-like features are further emphasized by the lare bulbous foot and the rudimentary seta , which is only a necklike connection between capsule and foot and is often called the neck . Very important differences , however , are as follows : ( r ) there is no such development of chlorophyll tissue in the wall of the capsule as characterizes Anthoceros ; ( z ) the neck is not a growing region , and hence the capsule does not elongate ; and ( 3 ) the capsule dehisces by a definite lid ( operculum ) , which is distinctly a moss character . As in all brYoPhYtes , during the develoPment of the sporophyte the venter of the archegontum develops the encasing calyptra , which in Sphagnum is ruptured by the growing capsule . A peculiar feature of Sphagnum is the pseudopodium , which is a structure replac-n4 MORPHOLOGY ing in function the suppressed seta . It is formed by the elongation of the axis of the leafy branch beneath the sporophyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it resembles an ordinary elongated seta ( fig. 250 ) . Of course the foot of the sporophyte s embedded in its tip . Conclusions. ? The Sphagnales present a remarkable mixture of liverwort and moss characters . The simple thallus body of the gametophyte resembles that of the anacrogynous Jungermanniales ; he special leafy sex branches suggest the acrogynous Jungermanniales ; while the porophyte is organized as in the Antho-erotales . On the other hand , the erect eafy branches of the gametophyte and he operculum of the sporophyte are both distinctly moss characters . In addition to these characters in common with liver-worts and true mosses , Sphagnum possesses ( 2 ) ANDREAEALE3 General character . ? This group comprises a single genus ( Andreaea ) of siliceous rock mosses . Sphagnum is hydrophytic , but Andreaea is very xerophytic. other characters peculiar to itself . It was remarked that the simplest con-ceivable liverwort would be produced by combining the gametophyte of Pelli ? with the sporophyte of Riccia . So in produc-ing Sphagnum , one might imagine a com-bination of the gametophytes of the two groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sphagnum that distinguish it from true mosses in general are ( z ) the thallose gametophyte , ( 2 ) the axillary antheridia , ( 3 ) the dome-shaped sporogenous tissue derived from the amphithecium , and ( 4 ) the pseudopodium . Such a form is often called a transition form , but better a synthetic form , for it combines the characters of several groups . // it is introduced here partly to illustrate the possible effect of changed conditions upon structure , but chiefly to illustrate another synthetic form . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte develops first as a mass of cells ( primary tubercle ) . From the superficial cells of the primary tubercle extensively branching filaments arise , which represent the protonema of the true mosses , as contrasted with the thallus of Sphagnum and the liverworts . The branches of the filament that enter the rock crevices are rhizoids ; those that remain exposed to the light are green and may assume any one of three forms dependent upon conditions : ( i ) they may remain filamentous ; ( 2 ) they may form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylindrical masses . The leafy branch may arise from any of these three forms . Arising from filaments , it resembles a true moss ; arising from a plate of cells , it resembles Sphagnum . Sex organs . ? The antheridia occur at the apex of a special branch , involving the apical cell ; this resembles true mosses and not Sphagnum . In form , however , the antheridium is globular and long-stalked , resembling Sphagnum and not the true mosses . The archegonia also occur at the apex of a special branch , this character being common to leafy liverworts , sphagnums , and true mosses . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte presents the great peculiarities of the group . The sporogenous tissue is cut off from the endothecium as the outermost layer of cells , a feature resembling true mosses but not Sphagnum ; but the sporogenous tissue caps the columella like a dome , a feature resembling Sphagnum but not true mosses . A pseudopodium develops instead of a seta , as in Sphagnum . The dehiscence of the capsule is very peculiar , for instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical slits that do not reach the apex , recalling the four valves of the capsule of Jungermanniales . In fact one of the Jungermanniales ( Symphyogyna ) has just this dehiscence by means of four vertical slits . Conclusions . ? The combination of characters may be summarized as follows : the gametophyte is either thallose , as in Sphagnum , or partly filamentous , as in true mosses ; the antheridia are terminal , as in true mosses , but long-stalked and globular , as in Sphagnum ; the sporogenous tissue is derived from the endothecium , as in true mosses , but caps the columella , as in Sphagnum and Anthoceros ; the capsule dehisces by four slits or valves , as in Jungermanniales , and not by an operculum , as in other mosses ; a pseudopodium is developed , which is a feature of Sphagnum , but not of true mosses. ( 3 ) BRYALES General character . ? This is the great assemblage of mosses , distinguished from all others as true mosses . It includes the most highly organized bryophytes , and is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed line ; that is , it has given rise to no higher groups . Although a vast group , it is so uniform in general structure that a single account will suffice . Ganaetophyte . ? The gametophyte is a branching filament ( prolonema , fig. 251 ) , which is the equivalent of the thallus of Sphagnum X 16 MORPHOLOGY and the liverworts . In these groups the thallus in its development passes through two or three stages , the first one being filamentous ; in the true mosses this earliest filamentous stage persists . This fact is associated with the development of the erect leafy branch ( gametophore ) characteristic of mosses . With green tissue displayed by erect branches the display of green tissue by the thallus body declines , and the thallus finally remains in an embryonic stage . Although the leafy branch is the conspicuous part of mosses , it should not be thought of as the gametophyte , but as a branch of the gametophyte ( fig. 251 ) . In certain mosses , known as reduced forms , this branch is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few leaves appearing ; in fact it may bear only a single scale leaf in addition to the sex organs . The leafy branch develops by means of an apical cell with three cutting faces . The segments are cut into outer and inner cells , the former , for the most part , developing the leaves ; the latter the axis . The leaves usually consist of a single plate of green cells , often thickened in the middle so as to resemble a midrib . Vegetative multiplication . ? The power of vegetative multiplication is remarkably developed . The leafy branch bears the sex organs above the moist substratum , so that the conditions are not favorable for swimming sperms . As a consequence , fertilization in many mosses - 0-  // is rare , and in some cases even sex organs are rare . Therefore , it is probable that reproduction is chiefly by vegetative multiplication , which may occur as follows : ( 1 ) the isolation of branches by the death of older axes ; ( 2 ) the production of gemmae ; ( 3 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be only arrested branch buds ( fig. 251 ) ; and ( 4 ) under appropriate conditions , the development of a new protonema from any part of the leafy branch , or from fragments of leaves and axes . It fellows that u gametophyte once started may propagate indefinitely . Sex organs . ? The sex organs are grouped at the end of the main stem or of its branches . Around this terminal cluster of sex organs the leaves usually become modified in form and sometimes in color , forming a sheath or a rosette ( figs. 252 , 253 ) , the whole being the so-called moss " flower , " a most inappropriate name . The anther-idia and archegonia may occur together in the same cluster , or they may be in separate clusters , and sometimes they are intermixed with multicellular hairs ( poraphyses ) . In the true mosses the antheridia hold the same relation to the apical cell that the archegonia hold in the acrogynous Jungermanniales and in Sphagnales . The antheridium initials are seg-ments of the apical cell , and the apical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of an apical cell with two cutting faces , and the form is usually club-shaped , with a stalk of variable length . In discharging the sperms , the cells at the apex separate , the mother cells are dis-charged en masse , and then the tip cells spring together again , so that empty but complete antheridia are often observed ( fig. 255 ) . The archegonia differ from those of the liverworts in one important particular . The central cell ( pri-mary oogenous cell ) does not form all of the axial row , which is added to by successive divisions of the cap cell . The mature archegonia of mosses are usually more conspicu ously stalked than in the other groups , with more massive venter , and with smaller , more numerous , and more ephemeral canal cells ( fig. 257 ) . iz8 MORPHOLOGY Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte is the most characteristic and com-e in true mosses ( fig. 254 ) . As it develops from the fertilized egg , the venter and stalk of the archegonium develop a remarkable calyptra , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base by the growing sporophyte and is carried up as a cap or hood on the top of the capsule . The first division of the egg is transverse , and an apical cell with two cutting faces is developed in the outer cell or in some one of its early progeny . A variable number of segments is cut off ( fig. 258 ) , resulting usually in a much elongated embryo . In the upper end of the embryo the usual differentiation into amphithecium and endo-thecium occurs ; the former develops into several layers , the latter into quite a mass of cells ( figs. 259 , 26o ) . The sporogenous tissue is cut off late from the periphery of the endothecium , but does not cap the columella , which extends completely through the capsule as an axis ( figs. 261 , 262 ) . The sporogenous tissue becomes two layers of cells , the mass not being dome-shaped , as in Anthoceros and Sphagnum , but barrel-shaped . Among bryophytes , the sporoge-nous tissue , therefore , reaches its greatest relative reduction in true mosses. capsule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final structure of the longitudinal section may be outlined as follows ( fig. 263 ) , beginning with the outside : ( r ) the epidermal layer , ( 2 ) several layers of wall cells , ( 3 ) a region of inter-cellular cavities traversed by threads of chlorophyll tissue , ( 4 ) a toPeta layer ( see p. 126 ) ; these four regions belong to the amphithecium . The endothecium is differentiated as follows : ( 5 ) the two layers of sporogenous cells , ( 6 ) an inner tapetal layer , ( 7 ) a region of intercellular cavities traversed by threads of chlorophyll tissue , ( 8 ) the columella . The inner region of cavities ( 7 ) is present only in such peculiarly organized forms as Polytrichum . At the maturity of the capsule the water fails , all the // tissues between the epidermal layers dry up , and the spores are free in the large cavity . Operculum and peristome . ? The development of the operculum is complicated ( fig. 264 ) . It is sometimes early differentiated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cells forms a plane of cleavage . Above and below this cleavage plane the tissue grows more rapidly , resulting in two evident rings ; the upper one is the annulus , the lower one the ram . The rim is the more or less thickened top of the urnlike capsule ; but the annulus is a definite ring which often becomes detached . The sterile apex is at first solid , the center , occu-pied b endothecia tissue being a continua-tion of the columclla . The sporogenous tissue and the region of cavities end just opposite the cleavage plane , so that they are not represented at the apex . The amphi-thecial region of the apex develops in a peculiar way . The outer walls of one of the t inner layers of cells ( usually the innermost ) l become much thickened ; this layer is an chored to the rim below by a plate of thick- t walled cells . When the tissues of the capsule dry out , all the tissues within the operculum , except this heavy layer of walls , disappear , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls in a conical group of toothlike projections ( peristome ) anchored below to the rim . Some-times there are two sets of peri-stome teeth , in which case both the inner and the outer walls of the peristome-forming cells be-come thickened . There are many variations in peristomes in detail of development and in Pattern . Apophysis . ? The lower hart of the capsule does not always develop sporogenous tissue ; it is then character-ized by a greater display of chlorophyll tissue and stomata ( fig. 263 ) . This principal chlorophyll-bearing region of the sporophyte ( apophysis ) often is conspicuous , and sometimes becomes remarkably expanded . Seta . ? The seta is highly organized , with a central strand of elongated cells ( not vascular ) ; in fact it is the most highly differentiated axial structure below vascular plants ( see figs. 1013-roi6 ) . The great groups . ? The principal groups of so large an assemblage of forms as the true mosses should be indicated , but it should be understood that they are extremely unsatisfactory , because they are very artificial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cleistocarps ) , characterized by the absence of an operculum , and hence ? pith no peristome , the capsule opening by irregular rupture or decay ; and BRYOPHYTES I2I ( 2 ) Stegocarpae ( or stegocarps ) , characterized by an operculum and generally a peristome . The stegocarps are much the more numerous and representative mosses , comprising two groups : ( a ) Pleurocarpae , with the archegonia ( and of course the sporophyte ) terminal on short lateral branches ; and ( b ) Acrocarpae , with the archegonia terminal on the main axis . Highest among the stegocarps is the great family Polytrichaceae , of unusual size and complexity in both leafy branch and sporophyte . The leaves have a specially organized chlorophyll tissue ; the central region of the stem and seta almost suggest conducting tissue ; and there are distinct leaf traces . Conclusions . ? Some of the general conclusions as to bryophytes may be summarized as follows : The gametophyte begins as a simple thallus body and culminates as a filamentous body bearing erect leafy branches . This is the gametophyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much less highly developed . Such a gametophyte introduces conditions unfavorable for the functioning of sperms . The sex organs are fairly constant , the archegonia more so than the antheridia . There is a shifting in position from a general distribution over the dorsal surface of the gametophyte to special regions , and finally to the tips of leafy axes , and in this terminal position the archegonia preceded the antheridia . The conspicuous exception in the development of sex organs and their relation to the gametophyte is found in Anthocerotales , in which they are embedded in the tissue of the thallus , the antheridium developing from the inner cell resulting from the periclinal division of the initial , and the archegonium being invested by the growing tissue of the thallus . This relation of the archegonium to the tissue of the thallus is characteristic of pteridophytes . The sporophyte begins as a simple spore case , being all sporogenous except the single layer of wall cells . But progressive sterilization of potentially sporogenous tissue proceeds through all bryophytes , culminating in the true mosses , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and the great bulk of the sporophyte consists of sterile tissue , from which develops a foot , a highly differentiated seta , and a capsule of remarkable complexity . The sporophyte is dependent upon the gametophyte in all bryophytes , but there is evidently a tendency towards independence , as shown by the development of chlorophyll tissue , which reaches its highest expression in Anthocerotales and in the apophysis of certain mosses . CHAPTER III ? PTERIDOPHYTES Introductory . ? The gap between bryophytes and pteridophytes is perhaps the greatest in the plant kingdom . To pass from the leafless , dependent sporophyte of bryophytes to the leafy , independent , vascular , root-bearing sporophyte of pteridophytes is a very sudden and complete change . One of the great problems in the evolution of plants is to explain how the leafless sporophyte became a leafy one ; and a part of the problem is to discover the most primitive sporophyte among pteridophytes , concerning which there is great diversity of opinion . For convenience of presentation , the sequence of groups suggested by BOWER will be used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosses are widely distributed and comprise about one eighth of the living pteridophytes . The group includes four living genera and also numerous extinct forms , among which are some of the oldest known vascular plants . The three genera Lycopodium , Phylloglossum , and Selaginella are evidently closely related , forming a very natural group , while the fourth genus , Isoetes , has given rise to much discussion as to its affinities . Lycopodium General character . ? This genus , comprising about Too living species , is in all probability one of the oldest living genera of vascular plants , and possibly is represented in the Paleozoic . It deserves a somewhat full description , as it is possibly the best living representative of the earliest forms of vascular plants . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte in its simplest form is a simple stem covered with very numerous small leaves , and on the upper side of each leaf there is a single large sporangium ( fig. 265 ) . Leaves bearing sporangia are called sporophylls , and therefore this simplest vascular sporophyte is a simple leafy stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporophylls is a sirobilus , and therefore this primitive I22 sporophyte is a strobilus . The problem , therefore , is how such a leafless sporophyte ( sporogonium ) as occurs among bryophytes could become a strobilus or rather a strobiloid body . An explanation of the origin of this body has been suggested by BOWER 'S theory of the strobilus . The partially independent sporophyte of Anthoceros is selected as illustrating a possible ancestral condition of vascular plants at the level of bryophytes , and the possible successive changes are outlined as follows : ( i ) the sporogenous tissue becomes more and more superficial ( a change begun when the sporogenous tissue is transferred from the endothecium to the amphithecium ) ; ( 2 ) the continuous sporogenous layer becomes broken into separate masses by intercalated sterile tracts ( a condition present among Anthocerotales ) ; ( 3 ) the separated sporogenous masses become more superficial , resulting in an alternation of green tissue and sporogenous tissue ; ( 4 ) the intervening green tissue develops green expansions ( small // leaves ) , each one having at base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final structure is the simple Lycopodium body just described . It is the so-called Selago type , in which all or nearly all the leaves are sporophylls , and hence practically the whole body is a strobilus . It must be understood that this proposed origin of the Lycopodium sporophyte is simply a theory , but it is a very suggestive one . The more complex sporophytes of Lycopodium are branching bodies ( fi265 ) There is a gradual sterilization of the lower sporophylls , which thus become simply foliage eaves . Finally the sporophyte becomes differentiated into two distinct regions : that bearing oliage leaves and that bearing porophytes . The sporophylls finally become quite different n appearance from the foliage eaves and are organized into a compact strobilus , which is ometimes separated from the branching leafy body by a long talk bearing only rudimentary eaves ( fig. 266 ) . Vascular system. ? The anat-omy of the stem emphasizes urther the primitive character of this sporophyte . A cross ection shows two regions : the ortex , an outer region of living cells ; and the central cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ) is developed . The vascular system has been found to be of great mportance in any study of the evolution of vascular plants , and , therefore , the outline of its history must be indicated . In the simpler lycopodiums , or in young stems , the vascular system of the stem forms a solid axial cylinder , in which the xylem ( the group of water-conducting vessels ) is completely surrounded by the phloem // ( food-conducting cells ) , such an arrangement be-ing called the concentric arrangement . This most primitive vascular system of the stem , therefore , consists of a single , solid cylinder with concentric xylem and phloem corn-monly spoken of as a concentric cylinder ) , to which type the name protostele has been given . In mature stems of Lyco-podium , the solid xylem strand may divide into branches which run through the stele as several strands sepa-rated by pithlike tissue ( fig. 267 ) . From the vascular cyl-finder strands pass out through the cortex , where they are called leaf traces ( fig. 267 ) , and enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sporangium . ? The large spo-rangium is borne upon the upper ( ? daxi ? l ) surface of the sporophyll , near the base . The sporangium initial is superficial ( fig. 268 ) , and is a transverse row of six to twelve cells ; in some cases it consists of two or three such rows . Each of these initial cells divides by a peri-clinal wall ( parallel with the sur face ) , resulting in an outer and an inner transverse row of cells ( figs. // 270 , 271 , 272 ) . The outer cells are the primary wall cells , which by subsequent divisions give rise to a sporangium wall of at least three layers of cells . The inner cells are the primary sporogenous cells , which by subsequent divisions give rise to a considerable mass of sporogenous tissue ( fig. 273 ) . This method of sporangium formation , by which the inner cells , following periclinal division of the superficial initials , give rise to the sporogenous tissue , is called the eusporangiate method , and plants exhibiting it are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the modern ferns , whose peculiar method of sporangium formation will be described later . The sporogenous tissue is invested by a special nutritive layer known as the tapetum or tapetal layer ( fig. 274 ) . In Lye() podium the outer portion of the tapetal layer is composed of the innermost wall layer , and the inner portion of the sterile tissue contiguous to the sporogenous tissue . The tapetum , therefore , is simply the layer of sterile cells abutting against the sporogenous tissue , which have been transformed into feeding cells . This function gives to the layer a very characteristic appearance , making it quite distinct from the sterile tissue outside // and the sporogenous tissue inside . When the tapetal layer has become a complete investment , the sporogenous cells cease dividing by ordinary division and become mother cells , each of which forms a tetrad of spores by two successive divisions , known as the reduction divisions ( see p. 61 ) . Beneath the sporangium , which in section is often somewhat kidney-shaped , there is developed a cushion of sterile cells or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( figs. 271 , 272 , 274 ) , in which the vascular elements end . In certain extinct lycopods with very large sporangia , sterile strands or plates radiate from this subarchesporial pad into the large mass of sporogenous tissue , probably being sterilized sporogenous cells . These sterile strands are important to note , as indicating a tendency to divide a large sporangium into chambers . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte of Lycopodium is a very char-acteristic structure and suggests very little connection with the gameto-phytes of liverworts . In what is regarded as the primitive form the spore produces at first a subterranean tuberous body ( primary tubercle ) , which later gives rise to an aerial , lobed , green portion ( crown ) bearing the sex organs . The gametophyte is differentiated , therefore , into two distinct regions . The subterranean tuberous part is variable in form and is often highly differentiated into tissue regions ( fig. 276 ) ; it always contains a characteristic endophytic fungus , which inhabits a definite region of the body . In certain species , however , the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not green ( fig. 275 ) ; while in still others it is not developed at all ( fig. 277 ) , the gametophyte being simply a subterranean tuberous body hearing the sex organs . In certain epiphytic species the tuberous region is lacking , the gametophyte being entirely aerial , but not always green . Antheridium . ? The antheridium ( figs. 278 ? 282 ) begins as a super-ficial cell , which enlarges and then divides by a periclinal wall . The outer cell following this division is the primary wall cell , which forms an outer wall of one layer of cells ; the inner cell is the primary sperma-togenous cell , which produces a large number of spermatogenous cells , those of the last division being sperm mother cells . This method of I28 MORPHOLOGY antheridium development resembles closely the eusporangiate method of sporangium development , and is always associated with it . It is interesting to note that only the Anthocerotales among bryophytes approach this method of antheridium formation in the fact that the inner cell following the periclinal division gives rise to the sper matogenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ing biciliate , a char acter which belongs to the sperms of bryophytes ( fig. 282 ) . Archegonium. ? The archegonium also resembles that of the Anthocerotales in being an embedded structure . The outline of its develop ment is as follows : It begins as a superficial cell , which divides by a transverse wall ( fig. 283 ) , the outer cell being the primary neck cell , the inner one the inner cell . The inner cell divides by a transverse wall , resulting in a row of three cells ( fig. 284 ) , a condition of the archegonium very commonly seen . Be ginning with the // outermost one of this row of cells , they are called primary neck cell , central cell , and basal cell . The primary neck cell , by successive divi-sions , develops a neck consisting of several tiers of cells ( figs. 284-286 ) , with four cells in each tier . The central cell develops the axial row as follows : the first transverse division results in the primary neck canal cell ( the outer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fig. 285 ) . By successive transverse divi-sions , the primary neck canal cell produces a variable number of neck canal cells ( fig. 286 ) ; in some cases four to six , but in other cases as many as thirteen have been observed . This extraordinarily large number of neck canal cells is regarded as a IOW character , since a steady decrease in the number of neck canal cells // is observed throughout the groups having archegonia . The primary ventral cell , just before the maturity of the archegonium , divides into the ventral canal cell and the egg , and finally all the canal cells dis organize ( fig. 287 ) . Embryo. ? The embryo of the Lycopodium sporophyte develops in a very characteristic way ( figs. 288 ? 293 ) . The fertilized egg divides by a transverse wall , the resulting outer cell being the suspensor cell , and the inner one the embryonal cell ( fig. 288 ) . The suspensor cell may or may not divide , but in any event it usually becomes elongated . The suspensor is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its permanent structure , which is developed by the embryonal cell . By successive divisions this cell becomes four cells ( figs. 289 , 290 ) , which are related to each other as unequal quadrants of a sphere . Two of these quadrant cells develop the foot , which is an absorbing organ of the embryo while it is feeding upon the gametophyte . One of the remaining quadrant cells develops the stem , and the other the first leaf . It is to be observed that in this first differentiation of body regions the root is omitted , but it develops later from the tissue produced by the leaf quadrant ( fig. 294 ) . The foot is a structure of the sporophyte found among the bryophytes , among which the sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte through life . The suspensor is a new organ of the PTERIDOPHYTES embryo sporophyte , found in certain pteridophytes , as the Lycopo diales , but very characteristic of seed plants Phylloglossum This is an Australasian genus of one species , closely allied to Lyco podium and thought by some to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberous stem bearing a cluster of small leaves . Some of the sporophytes also develop a short , naked stalk bearing a terminal stobilus ( fig. 295 ) . Some species of Lycopodium begin with this type of body , but the strobilus-bearing stalk becomes branching and leafy , and the tuberous embryonic body disappears . The adult body of Phylloglossum , therefore , is like the embryonic body of some species of Lycopodium . In other species of Lycopodium this kind of embryonic body is absent from the life history . The gameto phyte resembles that of Lycopodium , in which there is a subterranean // tuberous region and an aerial , green , more or less lobed region bearing the sex organs . Conclusions . ? Since Lycopodium and its ally represent possibly the most primitive vascular plants , a summary of the important features will be useful . It would follow that the most primi-tive leafy sporophyte is a strobilus , in the sense that all its leaves are sporophylls . The first foliage leaves are small and scattered , and are sterilized sporophylls . The vascular system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phloem are concentrically arranged . The sporangia are large and solitary on the adaxial face of the sporophyll , and each one is developed from a transverse row of initial cells . The new structures of this sporophyte , as con-trasted with that of the bryophytes , are sporophylls , foliage leaves , vascular system , root , and suspensor . The gametophyte is a subterranean tuberous body with an aerial , green crown bearing the sex organs . The antheridia develop endogenously , and the sperms are bryophytic in type . The archegonia are also embedded , as in Anthocerotales . Selaginella General character . ? This is the great genus of modern Lycopo diales , comprising nearly 500 species , which belong chiefly to the tropics . It is evidently closely related to Lycopodium , and may be regarded as a modern representative of forms that lived during the coal measures , and that had developed heterospory ( see below ) . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte body resembles that of Lycopodium in habit ( fig. 296 ) , although it is usually much more delicate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a ligade , a flaplike outgrowth from the adaxial surface of the leaf near its base . The ligule is an embryonic organ of the leaf , being very prominent and functional during the growth of the leaf blade . When the blade matures , the ligule becomes merely an inconspicuous and membranous flap . This curious structure is a feature of all the Lycopodiales ( including fossil groups ) except Lycopodium and Phyl loglossum , and for this reason the former are often called Ligulatae , to distinguish them from the latter , which are Eligulatae . The other // noteworthy feature of the sporophyte body is the occurrence of a single chloroplast in the actively dividing cells ( meristem ) . It will be remembered that this same feature appears in the gametophyte body of Anthoceros ( p. io6 ) . The vascular cylinder of the stem is generally of the primitive type , being a protostele ( p. 125 ) ( fig. 297 ) ; but in some cases the cylinder is hollow ( a siphonostele ) , containing pith , a type of cylinder derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in all Lycopodiales , are solitary and adaxial with reference to the sporophyll , and derived from a transverse row of initial cells ; but in Selaginella these initials occur on the stem just above the origin of the sporophyll ( figs. 298 , 299 ) . This means that sporangia are not always produced by sporopbylls , and in such cases the name sporophyll is justified only by its relation to the sporangium . On the basis of their origin , sporangia often are distinguished as foliar ( on the sporophyll ) and cauline ( on the stem ) . Heterospory . ? The notable feature of Selaginella , however , is that all of the sporangia in a strobilus do not mature alike , resulting in heterospory . They all develop alike , and as described under Lycopodium ( p. 125 ) , as far as the mother cell stage ( fig. 300 ) , after which a great difference appears . In some of the sporangia ( usually the larger number ) all or nearly all of the mother cells function , resulting in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporangia an extensive abortion of mother cells occurs , so // extensive that usually only one mother cell functions , all the others contributing to its nutrition ( fig. 302 ) . This results in a relatively very large mother cell and a tetrad of four very large spores . In some cases , although a tetrad of spores is started , two or three of them may not develop further , resulting in a sporangium containing only one or two spores . It is this condition of dissimilar spores that is called heterospory , in contrast with the condition of similar spores ( as in Lycopodium ) , which is called homospory . Selaginella , therefore , is heterosporous , while Lycopodium is homosporous . The terminology applied to the heterosporous condition is simple . The small // spores are microspores , and the large ones are megaspores ; the spo-rangia producing microspores are microsporangia , and those producing megaspores are megasporangia ; the sporophylls related to microsporangia are microsporophylls , and those related to megasporangia are megasporophylls . This differentiation of spores in size ( fig. 303 ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microspores produce male gametophytes , while the megaspores produce female gametophytes . The phenomenon of heterospory , therefore , is associated with the sexual differentiation of gametophytes . It is a phenomenon exhibited among pteridophytes only by certain groups , but it is universal among seed plants . In fact , the appearance of heterospory is the necessary antecedent to the formation of a seed . It follows , therefore , that the development of heterospory among pteridophytes made the great group of seed plants possible . In Selaginella there is a remarkable approach to the seed condition in the fact that the megaspores are not shed , but are retained within the megasporangium , within which the female gametophyte is developed , the egg ( embryo ) formed . just now far this fertilized , and the young sporophyte falls short of being the seed condition will be considered under seed plants . Male gametophyte . ? The male ga-metophyte produced by the microspore is a very simple structure , never out-growing the spore , and therefore en-cased by the old spore wall . The two cells formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antheridium initial and the vegetative cell ( fig. 305 ) . This single vegetative cell is the sole representative of the // vegetative tissue of more primitive gametophytes . The antheridium initial produces an antheridium with the usual jacket of sterile cells investing sperm mother cells ( fig. 3o6 ) . At maturity the jacket cells break down and the mother cells ( with their sperms ) are free in the general cavity of the microspore ( fig. 307 ) . The male gametophyte , therefore , is reduced to one vegetative cell and one antheridium ; and encased by the old microspore wall it is carried to the megasporangium , in which the female gametophytes are developing . There the male gametophyte bursts through the microspore coat ( fig. 307 ) . The sperms are very small , with more or less spirally coiled bodies and two terminal cilia . Selaginella thus shares with Lycopodium and Phylloglossum the character of producing biciliate sperms , a type characteristic of bryophytes , and in strong contrast with the sperms produced by other pteridophytes . Female gametophyte . ? The female gametophyte is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of it is invested by the old megaspore wall ( fig. 308 ) . The nucleus of the megaspore begins a series of divisions that continue until a large number of free nuclei are produced . This free nuclear division occurs chiefly in the apical ( pointed ) end of the megaspore , and results in a layer of nuclei , which later become invested by walls . Subsequent divisions result in a cushion of cells at the apex of the megai spore , while the large body of the mega ; spore is free from cells , acting as a great food reservoir ( fig. 308 ) . The wall of the megaspore cracks at the apex and the apical tissue protrudes , developing a more or less expanded mass of tissue in which archegonia develop ( figs. 308 , 309 ) . Later , the deeper region of the megaspore becomes filled with a tissue of large cells , and continues to act as a food reservoir for the developing embryo . This early differentiation of the female gametophyte into two distinct regions , one that produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the female gametophyte in all heterosporous plants . Fertilization . ? The male gametophytes enclosed by the old micro- // spore walls are brought to the megasporangia by the wind or by gravity . The microspores drift among the megaspores with protruding female gametophytes bearing archegonia . Then the sperms are discharged , enter the archegonia , and fertilization occurs ( fig. 310 ) . In these female gametophytes , still in the sporangia , the embryo sporophytes develop and then emerge , a strobilus often being beset with young sporelings . Later the strobilus as a whole , with its attached sporelings , drops off . Embryo . ? The embryo ( sporophyte ) is developed much as in Lycopodium ( figs. 311-314 ) . The suspensor ( p. 130 ) is more extensive than in Lycopodium , being of use in relating the embryo to the deep nutritive tissue within the megaspore . The embryonal cell at the end of the suspensor first produces three cells : a terminal cell that develops the stem , flanked by two cells ( one on each side ) that develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is developed later ( fig. 313 ) ; and still later , from the same segment the primary root arises ( fig. 314 ) . When fully organized and emerging , the embryo resembles a seedling dicotyledon escaping from its seed . The tuberous foot THOLOGY is embedded in the nutritive region of the female gametophyte invested by the megaspore coat , and from it there extends in one direction , outside of the spore coat , an elongating stem bearing at its tip a pair of young leaves , between which is the stem apex ; and in the other direction the elongating primary root ( fig. 314 ) . Isoetes General character . ? The genus Isoetes ( quillworts ) comprises about sixty species . It is now usually included among the Lycopodiales , although in certain important features it differs from the other members of the group . Sporophyte. ? In general appearance Isoetes suggests a tufted grass , growing on muddy fiats or in the water ( fig. 315 ) . The stem is very short , unbranched , and covered by overlapping leaf bases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been interpreted variously . The stem is so short and the leaves are so numerous that the vascular cylinder is little more than a vascular plate . It seems to be a protostele , however , in which the xylem elements have not completely filled up their region , and there is no recognizable phloem . Such a structure is evidently related to that found among the Lycopodiales , and therefore in vascular anatomy Isoetes is to be associated with that group . Leaves . ? The leaves are unique in structure , being arranged in a close // spiral , and every leaf is a sporophyll , either bearing a sporangium or traces of one . In this sense the whole sporophyte body is a strobilus . Each leaf is distinctly differentiated into sporangium and foliage regions ( fig. 317 ) . The foliage portion of the leaf resembles a narrow grass blade , and contains four longitudinal series of air chambers . At the base of this blade , on the adaxial side , the ligule appears , socketed in a small pitlike depression . Below the ligule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large deep chamber more or less shut off from the outside by a curtain of tissue ( velum ) . This single large sporangium on the adaxial surface of the sporophyll is a very important character relating Isoetes to the other Lycopodiales . Sporangia . ? The sporangium re-sembles also that of the Lycopodiales in arising from a transverse row of initial cells , in this case three or four in number . The method of develop ment is as usual in eusporangiates , beginning with a periclinal division that differentiates the outer wall cells from the inner sporogenous cells . The wall becomes about four-layered , the innermost layer entering into the organization of the tapetal jacket . A large mass of sporogenous tissue is developed , and up to 15,000 ? 25,000 cells all sporangia are alike . At this stage the differences that result in beterospory begin to appear . In those sporangia that are to become microsporangia some of the sporoge nous tissue forms plates of sterile cells ( trabeculae ) extending across the sporangium , and all the other cells function in spore formation , producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 316 ) . In those sporangia that are to become megasporangia , the trabeculae are more massive , and most of the thousands of sporogenous along the triradiate crack through the megaspore wall , along which lines the archegonia appear ( fig. 322 ) . The archegonium is notably broad and short , and the primary neck canal cell usually does not divide , resulting in a single uninucleate neck canal cell , which is as far as the reduction of the axial row is carried among pteridophytes ( fig ? 322 ) ? Embryo . ? The embryo sporophyte differs from that of Selaginella and Lycopodium in several important particulars . In the first place , there is no suspensor , and this feature associates Isoetes with the other pteridophytes . The fertilized egg , however , behaves much as does the embryonal cell in Selaginella and Lycopodium , except that the quadrant cells are assigned differently , two of them forming the foot ( as in Lycopodium ) , and the other two forming leaf and root , the stem being the belated member . However , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belated in appearance . In Lycopodium the belated member is the root , in Selaginella the foot and root , in Isoetes the stem . The embryo of Isoetes has long been recognized to have a remarkable resemblance to the characteristic embryo of monocotyledons among seed plants ; and for this reason it was once suggested that perhaps Isoetes is a living representative of the ancestors of monocotyledons . In Isoetes the axis of the embryo develops the root at one end and a single leaf ( cotyledon ) at the other , the foot arising from the middle region and being embedded in the nutritive tissue within the megaspore . On the free side of the axis a notch appears , from the bottom of which the stem tip arises ( fig. 324 ) . The feature of the embryo of monocotyledons is that the single cotyledon is terminal and the stem tip is lateral , and this feature is exactly reproduced in the embryo of Isoetes . Summary . ? A summary of the arguments for and against retaining Isoetes among Lycopodiales is as follows : its characters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vascular anatomy ; ( 2 ) the solitary sporangium on the adaxial surface of the sporophyll ; ( 3 ) the development of the sporangium from a transverse row of initial cells ; ( 4 ) the trabeculae , which also appear in certain fossil Lycopodiales ; ( 5 ) the ligule which is present in all Lycopodiales except Lycopodium and Phylloglossum ; and ( 6 ) the gametophytes , which resemble closely those of Selaginella . The characters not in common with Lycopodiales are ( i ) the large multiciliate sperms ; ( 2 ) the absence of a suspensor ; ( 3 ) the general habit ; and ( 4 ) the highly specialized leaves . ( 2 ) PSILOTALES This group of pteridophytes comprises two very small living genera : Fsilotum ( fig. 330 ) , with two species occurring in the tropics of both hemispheres ; and Tmesipteris ( fig. 325 ) , with a single Australasian species ( sometimes more species are recognized ) . These forms are introduced here , not to present their life histories , but to illustrate very briefly cer-tain stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to increase the output of spores produced by the sporophyte . The first and simplest method was by branching , thus multiplying strobili . There was also an increase in the size of sporangia ; and this led , apparently for nutritive reasons , to the development of sterilized plates through the sporangium , as in certain ancient lycopods ; and in Isoetes these plates almost divide the sporangium into chambers . In Psilotum and Tmesipteris there are two further stages of development in this // direction . In Tmesipteris a sterile plate divides the large sporangium into two chambers so distinct that they are called two sporangia ( figs. 326-329 ) . That this partition is sterilized spo-rogenous tissue is proved by its development and by the fact that in exceptional cases it functions as spo- rogenous tissue . In Psilotum the same condition occurs , except that the development of two sterile plates results in three chambers , or a group of three sporangia ( figs. 330 , 331 ) ? The other noteworthy feature of Psilotum and Tmesipteris is the development of the subarche sporial pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three sporangia and is called the spo-rangiophore. ( 3 ) SPHENOPHYLLALES This group contains the single large Carboniferous genus Sphenophyllum , which illustrates the further de velopment of the sporangiophore . In Sphenophyllum there is a distinct strobilus , with whorls of linear spo rophylls coalescent at base into spreading funnels . From the adaxial surface of these sporophylls sporangio phores arise , which vary from very short to very long , simple or branching , and bear one to several sporangia . In this genus , therefore , the sporangiophore develop ment is carried much farther than in Psilotum and Tmesipteris , resulting in a multiplication of sporangia by means of the sporangiophore. ( 4 ) EQUISETALES This great group is represented in our present flora by the single genus Equiselum , comprising about twenty-five species of horsetails or scouring rushes . This is only a remnant of a great group that flourished in the Paleozoic along with the ancient Lycopodiales . Sporophyte . ? The sporophyte body consists of a subterranean , dorsiventral main axis , which gives rise to erect ( radial ) aerial branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Equi-selum is characterized by its remarkably small leaves , which for the most part are insignificant scales that occur in a whorl at each joint and coalesce to form a close sheath . " *As a copse- // quence of this abandonment of leaves as foliage , photosynthesis is entirely a function of the green tissue of the stem . Many of the older forms were leafy , but all Equisetales are characterized by the // occurrence of the leaves in cycles ( whorls ) instead of in the scattered or spiral arrangement observed in the first two groups . In Sphenophyllales the same cyclic arrangement of leaves occurs , and this disposition of the leaves is associated with very distinct differentiation of the stem into nodes and internodes . Such a differentiation means a localization of the power of producing lateral members , which is not generally distributed , but is restricted to the nodes . It is from the nodes , therefore , that the leaves arise , and from the axils of the leaves that the branches arise . The aerial branches may be all alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which case special strobilus-bearing branches mature in the spring , and later the green vegetative branches develop ( figs. 332 , 333 ) ? Stem structure . ? The structure of the stem is remarkably specialized // ( figs. 339 , 340 ) . The outer walls of the epidermal cells are so impreg nated by a deposit of silica as to give the characteristic rough feeling to the stem . The stem is fluted , and within the ridges strands of fibrous cells are developed ; while in the furrows the chlorophyll tissue reaches the epidermis . It follows that the stomata ( see p. 250 ) are in the furrows ( usually along the slopes ) rather than on the ridges . Deeper within the cortex a zone of large air passages occurs , each one lying beneath a furrow . The central cylinder or stele is remarkably reduced , the vas cular bundles being very feebly developed . They are arranged ( usually one beneath each ridge ) so as to outline a hollow cylinder enclosing a pith , which disappears early ; but instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are collateral ; that is , the xylem and phloem strands lie side by side on the same radius , with the xylem towards the center of the stem . In fact , however , in Equi setum the xylem is hardly at all developed , its position being occupied by a small air passage ( fig. 340 ) . Sporangium . ? The sporangia occur in a very distinct strobilus ( fig. 332 ) . The structure usually called a sporophyll has a stalklike base and a peltate top , beneath which five to ten sporangia are borne ( figs. 334 , 335 ) ? To understand this structure it is necessary to be familiar with certain of the extinct Equisetales . A series can be arranged , beginning with Sphenophyllum , passing on to Calamites ( an extinct group of Equisetales ) , and ending with Equise tum , which indicates that in the strobilus of Equisetum the sporopbylls have been suppressed and that the structures bearing sporangia are sporangiophores . In Calamites the strobilus is made up of alternating sets of sporo-phylls and sporangiophores , and the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equisetum , without the alternating sets of spo-rophylls . In Seldginell ? th ere are sporophylls that do not bear sporangia ; and in Equisetum there is apparently a strobilus that does not consist of sporophylls . The sporangium arises from a single superficial cell , and not from a transverse row as among Lycopodiales . There is the usual periclinal wall , setting apart an outer wall cell from an inner sporogenous cell , as in all eusporangiates ( fig. 341 ) . // Several layers of wall cells are formed , and the innermost wall cells by their division add to the sporogenous tissue ( fig. 342 ) . The tapetum investing the sporogenous tissue consists of two or three layers of cells . At least one third of the mother cells do not produce spores , contribut ing to the nutrition of the remaining two thirds . Spores . ? In the development of the spores a remarkable outermost wall layer is formed . In all ordinary spores the wall develops two layers , the inner called intine , the outer exine ; but in Equisetum another layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which cracks into two spirally wound bands that remain connected at one pole of the spore . In shedding , these bands unwind ( figs. 336-338 ) , become entangled with the bands of other spores , and thus the spores fall in clumps . This seems to be advantageous since the gametophytes are mostly dioecious 14$ MORPHOLOGY n a terminal position on the hallus , the superficial initial ell forms first a papillate out-rowth which 1S cut off by a ericlinal wall , and it is this rotruding cell that develops he antheridium ( fig. 346 ) . In his cell an apical cell with hree cutting faces is formed , nd then a domelike cap cell s cut off , leaving a central cell , which produces the spermatogeBELAJEFF. nous tissue , invested by four peripheral cells , which develop the wall of the antheridium . This type of antheridium development is characteristic of certain modern ferns . The sperms are very large , spirally coiled , and multiciliate ( fig- 349 ) ? Archegonium . ? The archegonium always develops from the massive axial region and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other at least it secures the development of male and female gametophytes in close proximity . Gametophyte . ? The gametophyte is a small , green , branching rib-bon , being strictly a thallus , without any of the subterranean develop-ment that characterizes Lycopodium . Although the gametophytes are usually dioecious , and the female gametophytes are larger and more massive than the male ( figs. 343 , 344 ) , the spores are all approximately the same size . Certain of the ancient representatives of the Equise-tales , however , have been found to be heterosporous . Antheridium . ? The antheridium is interesting in that it shows two kinds of development , dependent upon its position . If it occurs in the axial region of the thallus , it develops as usual among eusporangiates ; that is , a superficial nitial cell is divided by a periclinal wall , the outer cell producing the wall of the antherdium , the inner cell producing he spermatogenous tissue ( figs. 45 , 347 , 348 ) ? If it develops // pteridophytes , but is noteworthy in the fact that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embryo.  --  The development of the embryo differs from that of the Lycopodiales in several particulars . There is no suspensor , and the fertilized egg divides into quadrants , among which all the body regions are distributed ; foot and root being developed by the inner quadrants , and stem and leaf by the outer ones ( figs. 350 , 351 ) ? A very heavy calyptra is formed , which is broken through by the vigorous young shoot . Conclusions. ? The sporophyte is to be regarded as highly special-ized in its leaves , stem anatomy , and strobilus ; but its embryogeny appears to be simpler than among Lycopodiales . The gametophyte is entirely aerial ; certain antheridia show a specialized form of develop-ment ; and the archegonia are well advanced , as indicated by the reduction of the neck canal cells . ( 5 ) OPHIOGLOSSALES General character . ? This group of pteridophytes is associated often with Filicales . The three genera usually recognized are Ophioglossum ( adder 's tongue , fig. 352 ) , Botrychium ( moonwort , fig. 353 ) , and Hel-minthostachys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 354 ) ? ' The distinguishing character of the group is the so-called fertile spike ( a stalk bearing the sporangia ) , which arises from the adaxial face of the leaf . Sporophyte. ? The sporophyte consists of a subterranean stem covered by the leaf bases , and there are no aerial branches . The leaves are relatively few in number and large , especially in Botrychium and de-velop very slowly , in some cases becoming aerial only after two or three years of subterranean development . The vascular cylinder is remark-ably advanced in structure . It is not only a siphonostele ( containing
