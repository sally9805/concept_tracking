The Old Virginia Gentleman and Other Sketches . By George W. Bagby . Edited with an introduction by Thomas Nelson Page . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $1.50 net . The author of this book was born in Buckingham County , Virginia , in 1828 . He studied medicine and began to practise it in Lynchburg . But the pen almost at once drew him away from the scalpel . He eventually moved to Richmond and succeeded John R. Thompson as editor of the Southern Literary Messenger . After the civil war-he occasionally appeared on the platform . He died in 1883 . This collection of his better-known writings is put before the public distinctly in the hope of winning for him a place among American men of letters . Mr. Page is quite right in holding the sketches worth preserving . For the life they depict had not merely historical interest , but also , undeniably , a great charm . No one , probably , ever felt this charm more keenly than Dr. Bagby , and no one except , perhaps , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Dr. Bagby had a distinct literary gift ; not a great or impressive gitt , but such a gift in prose as may be compared to that in verse of the minor poet who 13 as safe in his own limited sphere as the great poet is in his . To characterize his writing is difficult. - Perhaps the best adjective for his distinctive quality is whimsical ; but unfortunately the dictionaries do not supply a noun to correspond to it . The English writers of whom he oftenest reminds one are Addison , in the Sir Roger de Coverley papers , and Lamb , in his personal sketches . We do not mean that his achievement entitles him to rank with either . But there are passages in the title essay which would have done no discredit to Addison . " My Wife and My Theory of Wives " might have been written , almost in toto , by Lamb . Some of the other papers are less successful . The liutabr of " My Vile Beard , " undeniably flinny as it is , does not rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often perceptible . Many of the allusions are hopelessly local or personal . Now and then a Northern . reader will doubtless be moved to mild resentments  --  though never , probably , to real wrath . If one looks for anything in the nature of a coldly dispassionate estimate of the bygone civilization one is reading about , one will be disappointed . It is of the essence of Dr. Bagby 's mood to be resolutely and consistently , , even if at times a bit satirically , parti- san and provincial . - Occasionally , too , we are bound to confess , the chord of sentiment seems to us to be a little over-strained , and the pathetic note dwelt upon a trifle too insistently . But there is not a heavy , unreadable page in the book . And naturally . For Dr. Bagby , truly as Mr. Page can dectaie mat " God made him a man of letters , " was also , nevertheless , a newspaper writer , and a successful one . That was his chief vocation . Most of these sketches have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely read in newspapers . In the matter of readableness , they are not experiments . At least ' one , " How Rubinstein Played , " is known to millions  --  of whom the great majority have probably never heard the author 's name . To endeavor to secure , at this late day , a wider recognition and reputation for such a writer is , we repeat , worth while . For there is here a genuine contribution to our store of sympathies and appreciations ; -a true transcript of a far from negligible volume of American life ; something in its way as original and sincere as is to be found in any American writing whatsoever . A vast deal has been written about Virginia and about the South , and much , particularly of late years , has been written in the South by Southerners . But out of the old South , the South before the war , there came extremely little that had the quality of human verity . The best material we have for a critical view of the ante-bellum Southern civilization , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel of Frederick Law Olmsted , an outsider . It is true that in recent years there have appeared a number of volumes of reminiscence of that period , and some of them have decided value . But Dr. Bagby wrote out of the heart of it . What he wrote and what is here preserved is not so much a view or description or account of the old Southern life as it is an expression of it  --  and an expression of it in very intimate moods . To read his unpretentious sketches is , therefore , to come as near as one can come to re-entering that vanished order , that extinct civilization . It is , of course , the civilization that was largely built upon slavery as an- economic basis ; a civilization out of touch and out of sympathy with modern life in many ways , some of which are here amusingly exhibited . But it was also a civilization , in which many fore* observerS found more attraction ' than in anything else that the Ameridan of that day has to offer .

Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. $2.50 net . This is one of the most important books on the psychology of religion that have appeared since James 's " Varieties of Religious Experience . " It covers a larger portion of the whole field than any other book on the subject that has yet been written , and it is scholarly in tone , clear in expression , liberal and unprejudiced in attitude . Its author , being both a professional psychologist and a minister , has the unusual advantage of seeing his subject from two somewhat distinct points of view , and hence avoids the limitations of either . The book may be divided into two chief parts , one dealing with primitive religion , the other with the religion of today ; and the two are unified by the application of functional psychology to the interpretation of both , and by the thesis which runs through the entire work , that " religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive life , our author points out , religion was a matter of social custom . And not only in a general way is this true ; it is seen in all the details of religious expression . " Religion in Its first fcirm is a reflection of the most important group interests through symbols and ceremonials based upon the activities incident to such interests . " These social symbols , once established , " tend to become fixed and to secure themselves against change by natural safeguards . " This point of view as to social expression and custom is now applied , often most ingeniously , to several primitive phenomena such as taboo , magic , belief in spirits , sacrifice , prayer , mythology . In general , it may be said that the treatment of these phenomena is a systematic attack upon the older intellectualistic interpretation such as one finds in Tylor , Spencer , Jevons , etc. , and an attempt to explain them in terms of functional psychology , as social reactions upon the environment . Belief does not come first , but arises rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the god , but is rather a ceremonial eating of the useful animal which thereupon or thereafter becomes the god . Prayer does not presuppose a " spirit " to ? whom it Shall be made ; it arises " rather from something like interjection and the common habit of thinking in social terms . If space permitted , it would be interesting to examine in detail Professor Ames's-various conclushins ' and his grounds for them . Certainly ? some of his conclusion'snaust be adcepted. , : , and : all of them are stiggesti 've ; - something , however , - might still be said in defence of the older view , and it seems probable to the reviewer at least that belief in spirits had considerably more to do in the development of primitive religion than Professor Ames is willing to admit . The last part of the book is given up to the religion of to-day , especially as found in America  --  its growth in the individual and its relation to various aspects of modern life . An excellent re- view is presented of the religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express in no uncertain tones his disapproval of the artificial conversion and the induced revival , and to urge the importance of education in the religious life . Three excellent chapters are devoted to the place of religion in psychical experience , in which the functional point of view is again emphasized , the most important thing in religion as in life being neither ideation nor feeling , but the basal reactions from which both of these arise . The book ends with a chapter on The Religious Consciousness in Relation to Democracy and Science , the author pointing out the necessity of elasticity and growth in religion and the consequent need of new ' forms and symbols to express adequately the religious consciousness of the modern world . Excellent as this book is , one closes it with a feeling that is akin to surprise , considering its large scope and its seeming thoroughness . The reader has , namely , the impression that one who should look to it for his idea of what religion is like , would come away with a very partial , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that this peculiarity is due to the extremely external point of view from which the whole book is written . Thus , there is no mention of mysticism , scant description of the inner experience of the religious individual , and slight reference to religious beliefs , the idea of " God " being treated altogether pragmatically and disposed of in a few pages , while the belief in immortality is not once mentioned . In short , one might Indeed derive from the book a good idea of the ways in which religion gets itself expressed in society , but not much notion as to how religion feels to the individual . This external treatment , in its turn , seems to be due to the author 's consistent and invariable use of functional psychology . Such a result is , of course , not absolutely inevitable , but it is certainly extremely natural . Functional psychology is so interested in the outcome of conscious states and their biological , sociological , and ethical consequences that it often forgets to consider , the conscious state itself. , As con- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all of the emphasis . Thug the inner life is slighted ; and functional psychology which seeks ( as Pro . lessor Ames explicitly shows ) to absorb almost ends by becoming almost everything  --  except psychology . - Another reason why one feels that Professor- Ames 's book is inadequate as a description of religion is to be found in. his fundamental thesis as to what religion is . To say that " religion is the consciousness of the highest social values , " if it Means anything at all , certainly Indicates that religion is not what most of us have understood ' by it . but is simply and solely social morality . In fact , Professor Ames more than once explicitly says as much . And he illustrates his meaning in various ways  --  for instance , by insisting that " non-religious persons " are not the unbelieving or the non-mystical , but simply those who for lack of some mental endowment are not interested in the welfare of society , whereas the typically religious people are those who work for social improvement . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout our lives been using the word religion in quite the wrong sense , and that it really means something altogether different from what we had all supposed . Of course , Professor Ames has a right to define his terms as he likes ; but it should seem that before appropriating a common and useful , though indefinite , old word such as religion , and making it synonymous with another common word , he should at least have coined for us a new word which we might use in place of the old one . For whatever one calls it , there is in most human lives a call for help outside one 's self , an upward look , a despair of the merely ethical and the merely human , and a corresponding source of " horizon , stability , and hope , " not given by morality or by other ideals , and not to be described as consciousness of the higher values of society . This thing , call it what you will and value it as you will , is certainly worthy of the psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find so little reference to it in Professor Ames 's admirable book . The Shifting and Incidence of Taration , . By Edwin R. A. Seligman , McVickar Professor of Political Economy , Columbia University . New York- The Columbia University Press . $3 net . This is the third edition of this work , revised and enlarged to 395 pages , whereas the original of 1892 covered but 184 pages It has proved throughout this period a particularly serviceable treatise to the students of public finance . The earlier multiplication of various types of theory upon this aspect of taxation persists in this last edition . Moderns are subdivided into ( 1 ) the physiocrats ; , ( 2 ) adherents of the absolute theory ; i. e. , Adam Smith and RiCardo ; ( i ) - believers in the equal ditfilSion of taxes ; ( 4 ) capitalizers ' Of " taxes ; ( 5 ) eclectics ; ( 6 ) agnostics ; ( 7 ) - socialists ; and ( 8 ) those using mathematical analysis in their discussions . This affords an ample frame on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a hopeless hodge-podge . At least three or four ddferent bases of classification  --  such as scientific methods , agreement In conclu-i sions , partisan attitude  --  are simultaneously employed to effect a single classifi-caticin , The analytic part of the work reproduces the many excellences of the earlier editions . If any of the topics should be singled out for discussion , perhaps the treatment of the capitalization of taxation ( especially pp. 221-226 ) is the most tempting : When a special tax is imposed on any one class of commodities , . . the tax will . . fall entirely on the original owner . . . for the tax will be discounted through a depreciation of the capital value of the article by a sum equal to the capitalized value of the tax ( p. 221 ) . Thus  --  the example is our own  --  if suddenly an annual dog tax of five dollars is levied , and the dog 's owner , influenced thereto by the tax in question , and finding the dog of no further use to him , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter the annual ' dog tax so long as the dog shall live , then the " tax falls entirely on the original owner ! " Despite the indubitable evidence of my annual tax receipts , I am told that the depreciated capital value at which I got the dog has " virtually " exempted me from this tax burden ! This is hard for the wayfaring man to credit . Still , when a tax like the English land tax has for generations been fixed in amount , in the sense that each parcel of land is taxed annually for a certain fixed and invariable money sum ; and when the land has been sold and resold subject , as it were , to this perpetual State mortgage , it is difficult to assert that the payer of the rent charge ( for such the tax has become ) is sensible of lessening any income which he ever had or hoped to have for private expenditure . The rarity of taxes similar to the English land tax , however , makes the argument for capitalization seldom applicable to modern taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tortuous and a complicated one . It . is well , therefore , for the student of finance to disclose his hypotheses frankly , and to admit that almost any unforeseen circumstance may invalidate his deductions . One must shun the academic fear- of seeming academic in these matters . The considerations are suggested by Professor Seligman 's statement that a poll tax " is clearly not susceptible of being shifted " ( p. 371 ) . Yet in States where the prepayment of the poll tax is a prerequisite for the exercise of the suffrage , , campaign committees have been known to assume the tax quite readily , The Iliad of Homer . Translated into English hexameter verse by Prentiss Cummings . An abridgment which contains all the main story and the most celebrated passages . In two volumes . Boston : Little , Brown &; Co. $3 net . - Mr. Cummings adds himself to the already exasperating number and variety ' of critics who have propounded sohitions of the Homeric question ; for him , the Iliad is composed of " The Wrath of Achilles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hector by a second , or " Trojan , " Homer , and of still further additions by a third Homer , whose touch is lighter , but whose contributions are episodical and not always relevant , and whose taste falls something short of his execution . These critical findings of the translator are reflected in the character of his abridgment ; it includes most of the first and second Homers , but only the best parts of the third . In the long and not uninteresting , preface containing this contribution to ? - Homeric vexation the author tells also in simple language the story of the - Iliad , devotes a few pages to elementary directions for the pronunciation of proper names , and in the remaining two-thirds discusses the English hexameter . " English hexameter is subject to two inflexible laws : first , that every . foot must begin with an accented syllable ; second , that the several feet properly read must , within the laws of English versification , keep time . " The second law is easily obeyed ; but to the first , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " all monosyllabic connectives , the preposition , the article , and most pronouns and auxiliary verbs are unaccented , " makes the difficulty of observing this law in ? the first foot of the line so great that the translator is aware of " no modern hexameter . . . wherein the law is adhered to rigidly . " Other guiding principles are set-forth , but are not exacting enough to be called laws ; and the largeness of liberty seen to be allowable in English hexameter is so great that one is inclined to agree with the view which Mr. Cummings takes pains to criticise , that " the English language has no prosody , " and to conclude that , after . all , so far as hexameter is concerned , the only rules are those imposed by a delicate sense of the music of language . As to the sum total of Mr. Cum , - mings 's translation , it neither ? descends . to the lowest nor rises to the highest . That it is conscientiously done Is evident enough , but its distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to warrant a hope that it will not take its place with the forty or so un- . successful attempts at hexameter trans. lation which the author tells us have already , appeared in print . Let us choose an example out of a possible great number , copying it without verse division : Now , when a king he zmet , or man of uncommon distinction , him would he flatter in soldierly wise , but admonish him saying : " Sir , it befitteth not thee to play the part ' of a coward ; be an example ; sit dovn , and ? ? make the soldiers ' do likewise . No wise thou knowest the real designs of King Agamemnon ; this is a test , a ruse , that only , and vengeance will follow . Do not we kings who were there know what took , place in the council ? Take care ! Kings , ' vicegerents of Zeus , are highhanded ; and ' this one holdeth his honor from Zeus , and , Zeus , dread Arbiter ; loves him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is good prose , but indifferent poetry . Of course , it would be absurd to demand in a translation of Homer the style of a Milton ; but if verse form is to be used at all , diction and style should distinguish the work from the language of mere ' romantic story-telling , or even of Elizabethan prose :
