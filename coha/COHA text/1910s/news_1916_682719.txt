txt The British " tanks , " the armored motor cars used in recent assaults on German trenches in northern France so successfully as to attract world-wide attention , were built for tho most part in Peoria , Ill. , in the form of caterpillar tractors designed many years before the war began for the purpose of meeting some of the difficult problems of modern farming . Except for their armor , their machine guns and their crews , thousands like them are in use today in the United States , in plowing , digging ditches . and other labors less heroic than war . M. M. Baker , Vice President of the Holt Manufacturing Company , ex- , piained here today that it was machines made by his company at its Peoria plant that had hurdled German trenches , walked through forests and crawled over shell craters in the face of intense gunfire . " We have sold about 1,000 caterpillar tractors to the British Government , " said Mr. Baker . " We have had nothing to do with putting armor on them , or placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eng. , recently were notified that the British Government intended to arm some of the tractors and use them for work other than the usual towing of big guns . " Germany had some of these tractors before the war began , and although I do not understand Just how it occurred , I believe she may have . got others since then . We have sent some to France and some to Russia . So far as I know , up until the recent appearance Of the armored cars the tractors were used only to tow big guns . I understood that Germany used about forty of them in this work before Liege early in the war and-recent photographs show that the British are using some of them now for the same purpose . " No Obstruction Stops Them . Mr. Baker said he did not know how many of the.1,000 tractors sent to England had been armored and put in service as land battleships , nor did he know what equipment the British War Office had placed upon cars to be used in this work . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tractors can go ahead over almost . anything or through almost anything . They can straddle a trench , go through a swamp , sop over logs , or climb through craters like a ground Juggernaut . It looks uncanny to see them crawl ' along the ground Just like a huge caterpillar . In a thick forest , it they encounter trees they could not brush out of their way they could easily be used to uproot them and clear their own paths . " Mr. Baker said the tractors sent to England weigh about 18,000 pounds each , develop 120-horse power and are built of steel . The caterpillar feature , he explained , is of the utmost importance . Speaking broadly , the tractor crawls on - two belts , with corrugated surfaces , on either side of the body . The corrugated surface is on the ground . On the inside of the belts , on each side of the body , are two lines of steel rails , malting four lines in all . These rails are in short sections , Jointed , and operate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt attachment as the tractor moves ahead and picks them up again , so that the car runs on its own self-made track continuously . The short Joints - in the rails make it easy to turn to right or left . Wheel Trucks support Body . The body is supported by trucks with five wheels , something like ' small railroad trucks . These wheels never touch the ground , but run upon the steel rails . In the ordinary tractor about seven feet of belt and rails is on the ground at one time . Mr. Baker said that the machine would bridge any trench that was not wider than the length of track It laid on the ground at one time . The " bow " might hit the far side of the tench far below the top , and the " stern " would.undoubtedly sink a little , but the tenacity of the tractor , he declared , would enable it to go ahead and climb out . The width of track used on the machines sent to England , Mr. Baker said , was 24 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds per square inch where a 30-inch track is used , or less than that of the foot of either man or horse . He suggested that the British authorities probably had lengthened the track on the tractors used in trench work , giving them even greater power to surmount obstacles . " We 've been making these tractors for the British Government for a long time , " said Mr. Baker , " and have not talked much about it . Since their recent use in storming trenches I have seen published reports that led me to believe the secret would come out anyway pretty soon , so I decided it might as well be told now . " Although he would not discuss the matter , it was understood the United States War Department is experimenting with armored tractors like those now in use on the British battle line . HOW THE TRACTOR OPERATES . They Can Be So Modified as to Cross the Widest Trenches . Joseph Connah , manager of the New York branch of the Holt Manufacturing Company , confirmed last night the statement of M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British " tanks " were made out of caterpillar tractors built by the Holt company at Peoria , Ill . Mr. Connah also gave THE TIMES additional information about the latest wonder 7 ? 1 scientific warfare . The British completed car , the American manufacturers believe , is made simply by enlarging the platform on the tractor so that it extends over most of the machinery and furnishes room for machine guns and their crews , and by covering the whole with a tortoise shell of steel armor . The machine has a fore wheel which is used only for guiding purposes , and indeed in the smaller type of farm tractors is absent . No weight rests on this wheel , and it could be removed altogether without causing the frame of the tractor to dip more than a few inches . The weight is carried on the two caterpillars . These consist of two belts with corrugated surfaces , on the inside of each of which are two lines of steel rails , jointed in short sections and operated by sprocket wheels . As the endless belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward sprocket wheel lays down the track , and the rear one picks it up again . On the rails thus laid down roll the wheels on which the machine is supported  --  fire wheels to a side , on trucks something like miniatures of those used on railroad cars . They run only on the steel rails , and the rails are supported on the belt of steel plates , two feet wide . Latest Machines 23 Feet Long . The newest and largest of the machines which are the basis of the " tanks " are about 23 feet long and 9 feet wide over all . The caterpillars , which are well toward the rear , are normally about seven feet long  --  that is to say , about seven feet of belt and rails are on the ground at one time . But Mr. Connah said that it was a simple matter to lengthen the caterpillar by inserting additional trucks , and that quite conceivably they might have been made almost as long as the frame of the car . Each of the caterpillars is under independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless the entire machine can be turned in its own length  --  a chartcteristic which would account for some of the strange manoeuvres which led observers to describe the tanks as wallowing about , " eating houses and pawing the debris under their bellies , " and so on . The pressure on the ground under the caterpillar  --  the string of steel plates seven feet long and two feet wide on which the entire weight of the machine is supported  --  is said to be less than that caused by the foot of a horse or even or a man . And 0. ing to the construction and location of the engines the centre of gravity of the whole machine is near the back of the caterpillar and not more than eighteen inches off the ground . For this reason tile machine can roll along without danger of tipping over on an almost incredible slope , and it can run considerably more than half its length forward over a chasm without any support at all . How a " Tank " Crosses a Trench . When it moves across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests , crosses first . The forward end of the caterpillar would then move forward over the open part of the trench , and the machine would be supported by the rear of the caterpillar , where most of the weight was concentrated . on one side with the guide wheel forward to act as a steadier in front . Then by the time the rear part of the caterpillar had reached the edge of the trench the forward part would already be across and there would be very little displacement of the machine . In this way the machine could cross a trench almost as wide as the ground length of the caterpillar ; and with the prospect that the British have lengthened these for war purposes it should be able to get across almost any trench or shell crater with little difficulty . The machine has been used to knock down trees before the British thought of making a war chariot out of it . The narrow lumber roads through the Florida woods must be widened for the passage of the tractor , and instead of having men go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . road the caterpillars themselves are run against the trees that are in the way . The cogs on the other side of the track plate take hold of the tree and start to run the caterpillar up the bole , but the weight and the force of the . engine are too much Type of American Tractor Used in British " Tanks . " for the resistance of the tree , and it snaps off almost immediately , Can Easily Knock Down Houses . As to knocking down houses , Mr. Connah said that the ordinary frame of the tractor would easily run through a brick wall . " The machine weighs about 25.000 ncunds , " he said , " as we ship it over . With the armor and armament it would probably come , to about MAYA Take a machine of this weight and drive it with a motor of not less than 120-1e.rse power and it will take something pretty stout to resist it . " The machine has two speeds  --  one of about two and a half miles an hour and the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , Mr. Connah said , can be used to chase a man around in a field and follow almost at his hccls , no matter how he turns . ' elle armor and armament , it is believed . have been put on the cars by the British Government , and the officials of the Holt Manufacturing Company know nothing about this part of it . It has been suggested , however . that an " apron armor. " something like the . lid of a dish , put down over the entire vehicle . must have been used , and that the platform on which the operator moves about must have been extended to corer all the ' machinery . Such im apron armor , said the officers of the company . could be run down to within about six inches of the ground without injuring the mobility of the tractors . But from some of the published descriptions it remains doubtral whether the armor has actually been applied in such a way as to cover the caterpillars . It has been estimated that . armor of half-inch steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shell splinters , so that . as the war correspondents report , nothing but a shell striking fairly would put the " tank " out of action . Austria Tried to Get Some of Them . . For twenty years caterpillars have been used for plowing , digging ditches . breaking or pulling down trees , and other sorts of heavy farm work . Just before the war broke out some of the 75-horse-power model , at That time the largest size made , were bought by the Austrian army for the purpose of dragging heavy artillery and transport wagons , but the Austrian officials who brought an army transport over to take the tractors heels were caught here by the outbreak of the war and have been here ever since . Germany , according to Mr. Baker . had some of them before the war began . The French and Russian Governments have bought many of them , and the British Government has ordered two a day until the end of the war , and may perhaps let further contracts . So far about 1,000 of the machines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British .
