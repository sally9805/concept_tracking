VEN an imaginative American , I suppose , must find it very hard to form anything like a just idea of the tremendous adventure involved in the act of Immigration . The alien in our midst is too elusive an object for satisfactory study . He changes too rapidly . But yesterday he was a solid citizen in his particular village of Sicily or Rumania , of a piece with his ancestral background , surrounded by friends and kindred , apparently rooted in his native soil . Today he is adrift in a foreign world , mute and helpless and tragically ridiculous ? a soul in purgatory , a human creature cut from its moorings , the most pitiable sight to be met on this earth . Tomorrow ? Who knows ? To-morrow very probably you will find him a prosperous citizen again , very earnestly devoting himself to some strange , until recently undreamedof , business , giving orders or taking them , even now perhaps a bit discordant against his new setting , and , except for one or two well-hidden scars , none the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him in his tortuous career ? What is surely most amazing is that he should have started out at all . Considering the pangs of separation and the risks that warn and threaten him and beset his path , why , you might ask , should he want to emigrate ? Is it the dream of riches ? Yes , in part . And the hope of freedom ? Without a doubt . But these are general motives and remote . The far-flung clarion call of American Liberty and her promise of equal opportunity are the'powerful lodestones that draw all immigrants alike . There are more particular motives than these to spur him on . Even freedom and economic independence have a varying meaning to individual aliens . Station in life , and nationality , and age , all play their part in composing his mental picture of America . And , as in war , so also in emigration , there are always immediate causes as well as remote and general ones . I have myself been asked hundreds of times why I have come to America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a rule , I have pointed to the usual reasons . I explained that at home in Vaslui , and in Rumania generally , there was very little opportunity for a young man to make anything of himself . ' My parents had ambitions for me which their clinging , hopeless poverty made impossible of attainment . And I was only a child of sixteen , and I longed for the great world with its rich prizes and its still richer adventures . My soul was thrilled with the dream of conquest and the pious hope of delivering my family from want and oppression . But while all this is true , it was not the whole truth . In fact , I quite omitted from my account the most vital , because it was the most direct , cause of my migration . The remainder of the truth , is that in the year of my departure from Vaslui America had become , as it were , the fashionable place to go to . Hitherto it had been but a name , and by no means a revered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fanned our dormant souls to flames of consuming ambition . All my relatives and all our neighbors ? in fact , everybody who was anybody ? had either gone or was going to New York . I call it New York , but you as Americans ought to be informed that the correct spelling is Nev-York , as every refined person in Vaslui knows . I did not , then , as you see , conic alone to America . I came with the rest of the population of Vaslui . And Vaslui was merely a sort of scouting-party , to be followed directly by the main army . THE PROPHET It has probably been forgotten in this country , if indeed it was generally noted at the time , that about the year 19oo there was what , to my eyes , appeared to be a national migration from Rumania to New York , a migration which , to the inhabitants of Vaslui , seemed literally to include well-nigh the whole Rumanian race . What had so suddenly raised the prestige of New York among the Vasluianders and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relate , for it so happened that the principal agent in this grand scheme of advertising among us the attractions of New York was a not distant relative of my own . I am well aware that such services as his ought not to go unrewarded , and I know that already your curiosity about his identity is getting the better of you , but until a committee of representative NewYorkers assures me of its appreciation of mine and my countrymen 's patronage , I feel in honor bound to respect my kinsman 's modesty and to guard his secret . Meantime you shall know him by the name of Couza . Couza is a royal Rumanian cognomen , and my relative , whether by divine gift or by his own assumption , had an unmistakable royal air , at least while he was in V aslui . Couza , then , put in an appearance in our town during the winter of 1899 , after an absence in America of some fourteen years . For months before , if you had put your ear to the ground , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vaslui held not only its ear to the ground , but its breath . It seemed to us that our life had been hitherto dull and common , but that at last it was to be tipped with glory and romance . Couza 's brother Jacob became overnight the first citizen of the town , and this reflected glory was shared by all our family . Those daily letters that Jacob received were inquired after by the whole community . They became , in the truest sense , Vaslui 's first newspaper , for they contained the only intelligence we cared to hear about . Now he was embarking at Nev-York , and now he had landed at Havre . A long succession of bulletins reported him at the various capitals and great cities of Europe . He was coming , coming , coming . The air was growing too thick for respiration . On the street , in the market , at the synagogue , we kept asking one another the one question , " When will he arrive ? " At last the long-awaited telegram flashed over us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For weeks I had been training in the boys ' chorus which was to welcome the guest on his arrival . And now , at the last moment , he had cold-bloodedly decided to come in on the midnight train . The choral reception had , therefore , to be abandoned . Vaslui must content itself with a mere representative committee of citizens and restrain its pent-up enthusiasm as best it might till the morrow . I have a very vivid recollection of that night of Couza 's arrival , for , although I was deprived of a direct share in the reception , I had a partial reward i for my disappointment in the reflected splendor that fell upon me through my father . He , being one of the guest 's family , was chosen a member of the welcoming committee ; and toward two o'clock in the morning he burst into the house trailing clouds of glory from his rare experience . We had been tossing about for several intolerable hours , wondering whether he ever would get back . No sooner did we hear his key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greeted him with a chorus of inquiry that nearly frightened him . " Is he here ? " we yelled all together . " Is he ? Well , I should say so ! " father cried , breathlessly , and still in the dark . Then followed things amazing . For hours that seemed like brief moments we sat agape , listening to a detailed account of the arrival and a somewhat bewildering word-picture of the personage himself . " You should see the old boy , " my parent began . " It seems only like yesterday when I used to see him in these very streets , a slouchy , unprepossessing youngster , with his toes out at his gaping boot-tips , carrying heavy cans of milk around for his mother . Remember , mamma , he used to leave us our liter every morning at the door ? Ah , this Nev-York must be a wonderful place . Why , I did not know him at all when he stepped off the car , not until Jacob rushed up to him and was followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a rot ) ( rabbi ) , he is so large and stout and dignified . He wore a long , black frock-coat and a high hat ? just the kind that Reb Sander wears on Saturdays at the services . But when I got up nearer to him noticed that he was clean - shaven . Would you believe it ? He did not even have a mustache . I never saw so many trunks and bags in all my life as they unloaded for him . And jewelry ! He had diamonds in his cravat and brilliants on his fingers , and a magnificent gold chain from which hung a great locket stuck full of more diamonds . He is a millionaire , if ever there was one in America . " This was very exciting and altogether astonishing in many ways . It suddenly revealed America to us in a new light . For you must not suppose that we were so ignorant as never to have heard of the place at all . The name Nev-York was , indeed , quite new , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his account . But then you could not expect us to know the whole map of America in detail . Of America , however , we had heard considerable on several occasions . Whenever a Vasluiander went into bankruptcy , and whenever a soldier wearied of the discipline and deserted , it was bruited abroad that he had " run away to America . " There was a female beggar in the town whom mother always singled out for special kindnesses . I used to wonder about her , until one day I learned that she had once been a well-to-do mistress of a home of her own , but that her husband had tired of her and escaped to America . I had thus come to think of the place as a city of refuge , an exile which men fled to only in preference to going to prison . I had heard of people going to Vienna and Germany and Paris , and even to England for business or pleasure , but no one , to my knowledge , had ever gone to America of his own free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances of their departure , none ever returned to tell us what it was like , any more than if they had gone to the other world In fact , a person gone to America was exactly like a person dead . That was why , on those rare occasions when a family followed its breadwinner to that distant land , the whole community turned out and marched in slow time to the station , and wept loudly and copiously , and remembered the unfortunates in its prayer on the next Saturday . I said that no one had ever returned from America . But there was one exception ; and I mention it here because the individual was destined to become the villain in the piece which I am here transcribing . It was commonly gossiped in Vaslui that Itza Baer , who was hand in glove with officialdom and whom every one feared and flattered as a notorious informer , had years before returned from America , where he must have had a stormy and ignominious career , because , whenever anybody ventured to ask him about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term than to live a dog 's life in exile , and forthwith change the subject . This Itza Baer was at first decidedly friendly to the news of Couza 's coming . When the time arrived he even went so far as to consent to serve on the committee , and at the station he was according to father 's report , one of the first to greet the arrival . Father went into circumstantial detail in his account-of this historic greeting . He said that the rest of the committee drew back a step and stood around in solemn awe while the two Americans exchanged compliments in English . But the odd thing was that Itza Baer ever after had an ironical smile about his lips and an impish twinkle in his eye when referring to that English conversation . He was never seen speaking to Couza again , except at the Temple on the Saturday following the event . A mysterious coldness seemed to have developed between the two men almost from the start ; and when Vaslui fell down on its knees and worshiped Couza as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for jealousy is what it was ? turned into whispered threats at first , and finally into open hostility . On the morrow after the arrival I saw him . I saw him on the first of those impressive progresses which were to become a regular , but not a common , sight in the daily life of our town for the next fortnight . He was riding slowly in a droshka , smiling happily , and bowing unpretentiously to the populace . The streets were lined with craning , 1 round-eyed , tiptoeingVasluianders , openmouthed peasants , and gayly attired holiday visitors from neighboring towns who , having heard of the glory that had come to Vaslui , had driven in in their ox-carts and dog-carts to partake of it . I have sometimes seen the king ride in state through these same streets , and have heard the throng shouting , " Treliasca Regele ! " But this occasion was not boisterous , but dignified and solemn . Vaslui seemed too full for idle noisemaking . It seemed to feel that while the king was no doubt a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way from Nev-York , he had not brought with him any dozen trunks , he did not speak English , and wear diamonds , and dress in a different frockcoat every day . Quite the contrary : the king had on the same uniform every time he came to Vaslui . He was , after all , a sort of exaggerated army officer with an unnecessary amount of gold lace and other trappings about his person . He , like all military folk , might care for show and shouts . But an American millionaire was not a clown or a bear to be clapped at . Why , he was the most modest and the simplest of men . Any other man of his great wealth would have put on airs and gone to the Ilote ! Regal , the exclusive stopping-place in Vaslui for all mere aristocrats . Instead , he went to his brother 's home and unassumingly shared the humble quarters of his family . That appeared to be his way . Whatever was good for one man was good enough for every man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed and uncomfortable whenever the subject was alluded to . He positively disliked to talk about himself in any fashion . He let his actions speak for him and all that he represented , and from his actions Vaslui was forced to draw the right conclusion . No one but a millionaire could have behaved , for instance , as he behaved in the synagogue on the Saturday following his arrival . It was the usual custom for a distinguished guest to he honored with a reading of the Law , and it was expected from him , in turn , to make a suitable offering in return for the honor . But when the official reader paused for the donor to fill in the blank , Couza calmly and very distinctly said , " One hundred and twenty-five francs , " and looked modestly about at the astounded faces of the congregation . That donation simply transcended our imagination . The high-water mark until that day and for years past had been recorded by Eliezer Kaufman , the wealthy merchant , now dead , who had once in an extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaslui still talked of it in awed tones . A hundred and twenty-five francs ! Why , even when crops were bumpers , a grain merchant could garner no more than that in a month . The sum would bring a team of oxen , pay two years ' rent for a house in town , or very nearly buy a modest dwelling in the country . From that day on Vaslui became a changed town . Hitherto we had been content to gaze in abstracted admiration at the splendid phenomenon and the dim , romantic land that lay behind him . But now the shimmering apparition had become a solid reality . We had seen with our own eyes , and had heard with our own ears , the concrete thing that it meant to be an American millionaire , and Vaslui suddenly felt a vast ambition stirring in its galloping heart . Gone was the languor , the easy-going indifference , the resignation , the despair , that once dwelt in the lines of our faces . We became a bustling , seething , hopeful community . A star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness . The very next day my father took me by the hand and marched me straight up to great headquarters . He had done some deep thinking all night and had worked up an exceedingly clever scheme . At least I supposed it was clever until we reached our destination . I had been given only the broadest outline of it , but I gathered from that that it was essentially a plan to induce Couza to take me to America with him when he returned , details to be worked out later . When we got within a block of Cousin Jacob 's store my heart sank and father turned very pale . Here was a line of similarly clever fathers with equally shamefaced sons and daughters , extending from Jacob 's store in the front , all the way around the little circular park which was in the center of the shopping district ; and another shorter column in the rear , starting from the back door and ending a block away at the gate of the court-house . The total effect was of two opposing armies struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize within . And every father and son there claimed relationship with Couza , and was ready , I suppose , to back it up with documentary evidence and a flourishing family tree . I had never realized that all of Vaslui belonged to my family . It was just at this time that the notorious Itza Baer entered upon the scene in real earnest . To the shame of Vaslui be it confessed that he had succeeded in gathering about him a very considerable following , and , strangely enough , among men who had hitherto been held in high esteem for their integrity and shrewdness . It is at such stirring times as these that men go astray . When one or two of those whom Couza had felt obliged to discourage in their emigration plans chanced to speak of their disappointment , Itza Baer suggested that they might offer to share their first million with Couza in return for the passage across . He and his followers organized themselves into an anti-Couza committee , which made ridiculous claims of seeking to save Vaslui , and in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . From the day of the great incident at the synagogue rumors of an infinite variety had gained currency regarding certain phases in Couza 's career in America . No one was able to trace them to their source , but they kept issuing with ever-increasing frequency and with the emphasis of unquestionable truth . We tried to discuss them with Couza himself , but he could not be induced either to confirm or to deny them . He would simply smile confusedly and declare that everything was possible in New York . But at the end of that week a report of the most stupendous sort reached our ears . It was to the effect that our guest was not merely a millionaire , but that he held a very high government position in America , something resembling a prefect or a minister . This time we besieged him and insisted on knowing the truth . For this news was no matter of personal glory for an individual . It revealed one side of that wonderful America that we had not thought of before . One could get rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that our people could not only vote , but be voted for and hold office in New York was a revelation of the most startling and inspiriting kind . This time , I say , we would not be put off with modest blushes . Couza , of course , tried to hedge about- by admitting that people of our kind might become members of the Government , that religion in America was a private matter unconnected with politics , and that he had himself heard of an American President by the name of Abraham ( he could not remember his other name ) . But while all this was gratifying to a degree , Vaslui demanded to know the whole truth . Was it true that he himself was the prefect of New York ? If it was , then nothing else mattered , because everything was as clear as day . Finally the conference ended in a compromise . Of the prefecture of New York he could by no means be persuaded to speak , but after long and cruel drilling and cross-examining he did confess that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions in Paris as a special representative of the American Government to the World 's Exposition and the Proces Dreyfus . After that confession Couza 's modesty dropped from him like a mask . Once his mouth had been forced open , he found great difficulty in closing it again until we knew as much about New York as he did , which is to say everything . He seemed eager now to make us realize how dull and circumscribed and enslaving was our existence in Rumania , and then point in contrast to the freedom and the wealth and the beauty of that city of God which was New York . There were many ways of getting rich in America , he told us . People got paid , it seemed , even for voting . A mere slip of a girl could earn fifty francs a week at making blouses . Girls , indeed , were not a burden there as they were in Vaslui . In America the richest young ladies earned their own living , fed and clothed themselves , and saved up the necessary dowry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether an enviable asset to their parents . A man who had a half-dozen grown daughters , or even a skilful wife , could be independent and free for the rest of his natural life . One of the trunks that Couza had brought with him , we were to learn , was filled with American newspapers , and with their help he preached to us the gospel of New York . Seated on the divan in that vast room at the rear of his brother Jacob 's store which constituted the family 's apartment , he would spread before him one of those extensive sheets and delight his open-mouthed callers with a message from the great world he had come from . I do not know what other people got out of those readings , but I myself was terribly excited by them , so that for months afterward I dreamed of nothing but ingenious murders and daring robberies committed in broad daylight by clean-shaven desperadoes in frock-coats and silk hats . I conceived of New York as a brave , ' adventurous sort of place where life 114as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those American newspapers puzzled us considerably . We had expected that they would naturally be in English , but we discovered with surprise that for the most part they were printed in our own humble tongue . Couza laid great emphasis , as was most natural , on the unlimited opportunities for earning money in New York , and to that end he invited our attention to the pages upon pages of frantic appeals from America for every variety of help . It was vastly encouraging to hear him read those appeals and to know how badly we were wanted in America . But we were a little obtuse at times . We could not understand , for instance , why any one should want a dozen girls to keep on working at blouses day after day without end . What did a body want with so many Vor .. CXXXIV. ? No. 501. - 50waists , we asked our interpreter . But we got little satisfaction in this regard . He seemed to delight in filling his mouth with those strange , long words that somehow got into every sentence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , decided resentment at being interrupted with a request to explain . When my father asked to be told what was meant by a stenographer , Couza contented himself with pointing the moral as to the brutalizing effect of living in such a place as Vaslui , where grown men did not know the things that every child in New York knew . That was perhaps a bit hard on father , but even he could not help agreeing with Couza and hoping all the more deeply in consequence that his children at least might some day get out into the civilized world . If any proof were needed of Couza 's high character and noble interests , and if any effective means were to be found to silence the mean slurs of Itza Baer and his anti-Couza party , we got it in Couza 's constant references to education . He pointed with profound scorn to the inferiority of the Rumanian schools , and denounced our Government bitterly for forcing us to pay an annual tuition rate of thirty francs for each pupil in the elementary schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be got altogether without cost , by Jew and Gentile alike , by day or by night . The Government of America not only did not exact charges for instruction ; it compelled parents to send their children to school , and it begged grown-ups to come and be educated when their day 's work was over . Couza cited instances of young men of his acquaintance who had become doctors and lawyers , and of young women who had become teachers by studying at night and earning their living in the daytime . He had himself obtained his remarkable education in that way . After these sessions my father would come away flushed with enthusiasm and repeat , excitedly , " America is good , America is good ! " He had long been cherishing the hope of making a doctor of me , but he had not even succeeded in getting me into the public school . Every fall he would take me around from No. j to No. 2 , and always he would get the same answer : " No room . " I knew of hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to do but to go to the little private institutes and pay heavily for the scanty instruction we got . When we reached the highschool stage matters got even worse . Vaslui did have a gymnasium , but a poor fellow had not a chance in the world of getting in . The tuition was high , the school was overcrowded , and it was necessary to have a certificate of graduation from a public school to be admitted , The nearest university was at Bucharest , and it would take a small fortune to go there and a very large one to make ends meet during the seven or eight years of instruction , supposing that one succeeded in getting in . Father had almost given up the idea in despair when America appeared in the nick of time to save the situation . Unhappily these glorious chats about America were to be cut short with tragic swiftness . Some of our townsfolk were too insistent about their own selfish interests , and kept pestering him with their requests to he taken to America . One night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and coaxed and begged and cried . She promised that she would slave for him , and clean his shoes , and scrub his mansion , and care for his horses , and weed his gardens , if only he would save her from the poverty and the tax-gatherer by taking her and her children away to Nev-York . When poor Couza could no longer endure the painful scene , he ended it by the sacrifice of his own dignity . " My dear woman , " he said , " do you take me for a millionaire ? " Then he grew very confused and grunted something in his deep , bass voice . But I admired him for the splendid way in which he said it . It gave me a last glimpse of the fine modesty of the old Couza . Yet it was very clear that scenes of that sort were dreadfully wearing to his sympathetic spirit and he was getting restless to leave . At the end of Couza 's second week Itza Baer became . shamelessly hostile . He declared that he could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bringing misery and discontent uponpoor people just to feed his own vanity . And he let it be known that he intended to denounce Couza as an old fugitive from the recruiting officer . When Couza heard of this he declared , with a smile , that he would like to see any little Rumanian king lay hands on an American citizen . To which Itza Baer retorted that he was ready to bet his beard and earlocks that the pretended American citizen did not even have his first papers No one took him up on that because of the obvious technical points involved , but the next morning Vaslui awoke to learn with bitter disappointment that a telegram from Paris had recalled the special representative to his duties . He had left in such haste , the official state-ment added , that he had not even taken his trunks . The glory of our city was gone forever , fur , although the hope was held out to us that he would return for another short stay and for his costly baggage as soon as Captain Dreyfus had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even come to get his niece , whom he had promised to take with him to America , but contented himself with meeting her on the Hungarian border . The evident dislike he had taken to Vaslui hurt us sorely and puzzled us not a little , although we might have understood that a man of his caliber could not long put up with the annoyances he had been subjected to . Nothing but fear of the law prevented my infuriated fellosttownsmen from wreaking terrible vengeance on the unspeakable Itza Baer , who had the cheek to go around boasting that we owed him a debt of gratitude for having saved us from a dangerous im-postor ! But if Itza Baer or any one else had imagined that Couza 's mission would end with his departure , he was to learn differently . Indeed , it was only then that our great guest 's preaching and example began to have their real effect . Now that he was gone , Vaslui could stand off and see the vision that had passed over it in true perspective . It became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couza had done something with his fourteen years in America , something very enviable and magnificent . We realized , of course , that he was a fine and clever fellow , and that not every one could aspire to his attainments ; but , we argued , if a man of genius could in so short a time become a millionaire and an ambassador , then an average chap ought at least to have no difficulty in becoming , say , a police commissioner and in keeping his cellar perpetually well stocked with red wine . This much had , at any rate , become certain . There was a country somewhere beyond seas where a man was a man in spite of his religion and his origin . If Couza 's career and transformation proved anything , they proved that in America a human being was given a chance to live his life without interference , to become rich and influential if he could , and to develop whatever talents were in him to the best advantage . Even if the informer were right , and Couza were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message that Couza had conveyed to us was honest . Anyhow , no one from Rumania could go to America and do the things that Couza had done in Vaslui . No , it did no good for Itaa Baer and his mournful followers to go around howling that Couza was an impostor , that New York was not at all what he had cracked it up to be , and that we would find life so hard and so sordid there that we would walk back . We let them talk , and proceeded in feverish haste to put our enthusiasm into acts . Within three months after Couza 's departure the America fever had spread to the confines of the kingdom . The contagion arose simultaneously in Vaslui and Berlad , and stalked with the pace of lightning northward through Jassy to far Dorohoi on the Russian frontier , south and westward through the Danube cities of Galatz , Braila , and Turnu-Severin , to the very doors Of the royal palace in Bucharest . During the early spring Vaslui had the appearance of a town ravaged by war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a sacrifice , household goods were given away or consumed as firewood . The streets witnessed a continual procession of carts bulging with comically shaped bales of feather-bedding , the only mementoes that the poor folk thought it worth while to take with them to their land of promise . Therailway station had never been so crowded before . There were cheerful farewells , and those who stayed behind cried to those who departed , " I 'll see you in Nev-York soon . Rumania was-off to America . And all of it had been accomplished by Couza 's patriotic devotion to the land of his adoption . Now , I must say that I have a very grave doubt as to whether it had been a part of Couza 's original plan to effect this exodus . Those who censure and traduce him have said so ; but I do question it , Surely it was not his fault that my fellow-townsmen were so literal and so simple . Let us remember that he was cautious to the point of taciturnity about his accomplishments , particularly when he perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he could not have resisted the temptation of bragging about his own wealth and influence as he resisted it And let us further remember that it was no voluntary misrepresentation on his part when in a moment of metaphorical excitement he let it be known that he was an envoy of the American Government in Paris ; that the statement was forced upon him by my fellowtownsmen , and that in the deepest spiritual sense it was not a misrepresentation at all . The truth is that he was but a member of the great American democracy on a lark . When I got to New York the next year I found him inhabiting the fraction of a flat on Attorney Street , the remainder of which constituted a thriving dressmaking establishment . Mrs. Couza was making the dresses , and paying the rent , and otherwise attending to the material side of life , while Couza himself was keeping busy as aiforeman in a bed-spring factory , and saving enough from his earnings to get another frock-coat very soon . In a merely literal sense , therefore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been an envoy . But he had been something nobler than that ; he had caught a glorious vision of America where any man might be a millionaire , an ambassador , or a President ? what did it amount to that he , as a matter of crude fact , was not ? ? and he had traveled all the way to Vaslui to share his vision with us.
