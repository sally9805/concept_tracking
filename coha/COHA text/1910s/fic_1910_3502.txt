SETTLERS Above them soars a dazzling sky , In winter blue and clear as steel , In summer like an arctic sea Wherein vast icebergs drift and reel And melt like sudden sorcery . Beneath them plains stretch far and fair , Rich with sunlight and with rain ; Vast harvests ripen with their care And fill with overplus of grain Their square , great bins . Yet still they strive ! I see them rise At dawn-light , going forth to toil : The same salt sweat has filled my eyes , My feet have trod the self-same soil Behind the snarling plough . **71;2944;TOOLONG PREFACE Nearly all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under the same impulse as those which compose its companion volume , Main-Travelled Roads -- and the entire series was the result of a summer-vacation visit to my old home in Iowa , to my father 's farm in Dakota , and , last of all , to my birthplace in Wisconsin . This happened in 1887 . I was living at the time in Boston , and had not seen the West for several years , and my return to the scenes of my boyhood started me upon a series of stories delineative of farm and village life as I knew it and had lived it . I wrote busily during the two years that followed , and in this revised definitive edition of Main-Travelled Roads and its companion volume , Other Main-Travelled Roads ( compiled from other volumes which now go out of print ) , the reader will find all of the short stories which came from my pen between 1887 and 1889 . It remains to say that , though conditions have changed somewhat since that time , yet for the hired man and the renter farm life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My pages present it -- not as the summer boarder or the young lady novelist sees it -- but as the working farmer endures it . Not all the scenes of Other Main-Travelled Roads are of farm life , though rural subjects predominate ; and the village life touched upon will be found less forbidding in color . In this I am persuaded my view is sound ; for , no matter how hard the villager works , he is not lonely . He suffers in company with his fellows . So much may be called a gain . Then , too , I admit youth and love are able to transform a bleak prairie town into a poem , and to make of a barbed-wire lane a highway of romance .

There passed also an occasional flock of geese , cheerful harbingers of spring , and the prairie-chickens had set up their morning symphony , wide-swelling , wonderful with its prophecy of the new birth of grass and grain and the springing life of all breathing things . The crow passed now and then , uttering his resonant croak , but the crane had not yet sent forth his bugle note . Lyman Gilman rested on his axe-helve at the woodpile of Farmer Bacon to listen to the music around him . In a vague way he was powerfully moved by it . He heard the hens singing their weird , raucous , monotonous song , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the young colts and cattle frisking in the sunny space around the straw-stacks , absorbed through his bare arms and uncovered head the heat of the sun , and felt the soft wooing of the air so deeply that he broke into an unwonted exclamation :  --  " Glory ! we 'll be seeding by Friday , sure . " This short and disappointing soliloquy was , after all , an expression of deep emotion . To the Western farmer the very word " seeding " is a poem . And these few words , coming from Lyman Gilman , meant more and expressed more than many a large and ambitious springtime song . But the glory of all the slumbrous landscape , the stately beauty of the sky with its masses of fleecy vapor , were swept away by the sound of a girl 's voice humming , " Come to the Saviour , " while she bustled about the kitchen near by . The windows were open . Ah ! what suggestion to these dwellers in a rigorous climate was in the first unsealing of the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women after their long imprisonment ! As Lyman sat down on his maple log to hear better , a plump face appeared at the window , and a clear , girl-voice said :  --  " Smell anything , Lime ? " He snuffed the air . " Cookies , by the great horn spoons ! " he yelled , leaping up . " Bring me some , an ' see me eat ; it 'll do ye good . " " Come an ' get ' m , " laughed the face at the window . " Oh , it 's nicer out here , Merry Etty . What 's the rush ? Bring me out some , an ' set down on this log . " With a nod Marietta disappeared , and soon came out with a plate of cookies in one hand and a cup of milk in the other . " Poor little man , he 's all tired out , ai n't he ? " Lime , taking the cue , collapsed in a heap , and said feebly , " Bread , bread ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He brushed off the log and motioned her to sit down beside him , but she hesitated a little and colored a little . " Oh , Lime , s'pose somebody should see us ? " " Let ' em . What in thunder do we care ? Sit down an ' gim me a holt o ' them cakes . I 'm just about done up . I could n't ' a ' stood it another minute . " She sat down beside him with a laugh and a pretty blush . She was in her apron , and the sleeves of her dress were rolled to her elbows , displaying the strong , round arms . Wholesome and sweet she looked and smelled , the scent of the cooking round her . Lyman munched a couple of the cookies and gulped a pint of milk before he spoke . " Whadda we care who sees us sittin ' side b ' side ? Ai n't we goin ' t ' be married soon ? " " Oh , them cookies in the oven ! " she shrieked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back as she reached the kitchen door , however , and smiled with a flushed face . Lime slapped his knee and roared with laughter at his bold stroke . " Ho ! ho ! " he laughed . " Did n't I do it slick ? Ai n't nothin ' green in my eye , I guess . " In an intense and pleasurable abstraction he finished the cookies and the milk . Then he yelled :  --  " Hey ! Merry -- Merry Etty ! " " Whadda ye want ? " sang the girl from the window , her face still rosy with confusion . " Come out here and git these things . " The girl shook her head , with a laugh . " Come out an ' git ' m , ' r , by jingo , I 'll throw ' em at ye ! Come on , now ! " The girl looked at the huge , handsome fellow , the sun falling on his golden hair and beard , and came slowly out to him -- came creeping along with her hand outstretched for the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , extended at the full length of his bare arm . The girl made a snatch at it , but his left hand caught her by the wrist , and away went cup and plate as he drew her to him and kissed her in spite of her struggles . " My ! ai n't you strong ! " she said , half ruefully and half admiringly , as she shrugged her shoulders . " If you 'd use a little more o ' that choppin ' wood , Dad would n't ' a ' lost s ' much money by yeh . " Lime grew grave . " There 's the hog in the fence , Merry ; what 's yer dad goin ' t ' say --  " " About what ? " " About our gitt'n married this spring . " " I guess you 'd better find out what I 'm a-goin ' t ' say , Lime Gilman , ' fore you pitch into Dad . " " I know what you 're a-goin ' t ' say . " " No , y ' do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . " " Well , ask me , and see , if you think you 're so smart . Jest as like ' s not , you 'll slip up . " " All right ; here goes . Marietty Bacon , ai n't you an ' Lime Gilman goin ' t ' be married ? " " No , sir , we ai n't , " laughed the girl , snatching up the plate and darting away to the house , where she struck up " Weevily Wheat , " and went busily on about her cooking . Lime threw a kiss at her , and fell to work on his log with startling energy . Lyman looked forward to his interview with the old man with as much trepidation as he had ever known , though commonly he had little fear of anything -- but a girl . Marietta was not only the old man 's only child , but his housekeeper , his wife having at last succumbed to the ferocious toil of the farm . It was reasonable to suppose , therefore , that he would surrender his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he loved Marietta strongly , and would find it exceedingly hard to get along without her . Lyman mused on these things as he drove the gleaming axe into the huge maple logs . He was something more than the usual hired man , being a lumberman from the Wisconsin pineries , where he had sold out his interest in a camp not three weeks before the day he began work for Bacon . He had a nice " little wad o ' money " when he left the camp and started for La Crosse , but he had been robbed in his hotel the first night in the city , and was left nearly penniless . It was a great blow to him , for , as he said , every cent of that money " stood fer hard knocks an ' poor feed . When I smelt of it I could jest see the cold , frosty mornin 's and the late nights . I could feel the hot sun on my back like it was when I worked in the harvest-field . By jingo ! It kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went resolutely out to work again , and here he was chopping wood in old man Bacon 's yard , thinking busily on the talk which had just passed between Marietta and himself . " By jingo ! " he said all at once , stopping short , with the axe on his shoulder . " If I had n't ' a ' been robbed I would n't ' a ' come here -- I never 'd met Merry . Thunder and jimson root ! Was n't that a narrow escape ? " And then he laughed so heartily that the girl looked out of the window again to see what in the world he was doing . He had his hat in his hand and was whacking his thigh with it . " Lyman Gilman , what in the world ails you to-day ? It 's perfectly ridiculous the way you yell and talk t ' y'rself out there on the chips . You beat the hens , I declare if you do n't . " Lime put on his hat and walked up to the window , and , resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin on his arms , said :  --  " Merry , I 'm goin ' to tackle ' Dad ' this afternoon . He 'll be sittin ' up the new seeder , and I 'm goin ' t ' climb right on the back of his neck . He 's jest got t ' give me a chance . " Marietta looked sober in sympathy . " Well ! P'raps it 's best to have it over with , Lime , but someway I feel kind o ' scary about it . " Lime stood for a long time looking in at the window , watching the light-footed girl as she set the table in the middle of the sun-lighted kitchen floor . The kettle hissed , the meat sizzled , sending up a delicious odor ; a hen stood in the open door and sang a sort of cheery half-human song , while to and fro moved the sweet-faced , lithe , and powerful girl , followed by the smiling eyes at the window . " Merry , you look purty as a picture . You look just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure 's shootin ' . " Marietta colored with pleasure . " Does Dad pay you to stand an ' look at me an ' say pretty things t ' the cook ? " " No , he do n't . But I 'm willin ' t ' do it without pay . I could just stand here till kingdom come an ' look at you . Hello ! I hear a wagon . I guess I better hump into that woodpile . " " I think so too . Dinner 's most ready , and Dad ' ll be here soon . " Lime was driving away furiously at a tough elm log when Farmer Bacon drove into the yard with a new seeder in his wagon . Lime whacked away busily while Bacon stabled the team , and in a short time Marietta called , in a long-drawn , musical fashion :  --  " Dinner-r-r ! " After sozzling their faces at the well the two men went in and sat down at the table . Bacon was not much of a talker at any time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in hand ; therefore the meal was a silent one , Marietta and Lime not caring to talk on general topics . The hour was an anxious one for her , and an important one for him . " Wal , now , Lime , seedun ' ' s the nex ' thing , " said Bacon , as he shoved back his chair and glared around from under his bushy eyebrows . " We ca n't do too much this afternoon . That seeder 's got t ' be set up an ' a lot o ' seed-wheat cleaned up . You unload the machine while I feed the pigs . " Lime sat still till the old man was heard outside calling " Oo-ee , poo-ee " to the pigs in the yard ; then he smiled at Marietta , but she said :  --  " He 's got on one of his fits , Lime ; I do n't b'lieve you 'd better tackle him t ' - day . " " Do n't you worry ; I 'll fix him . Come , now , give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You -- took --  " " I know , but I want you to give ' em to me . Just walk right up to me an ' give me a smack t ' bind the bargain . " " I ai n't made any bargain , " laughed the girl . Then , feeling the force of his tender tone , she added : " Will you behave , and go right off to your work ? " " Jest like a little man -- hope t ' die ! " " Lime ! " roared the old man from the barn . " Hello ! " replied Lime , grinning joyously and winking at the girl , as much as to say , " This would paralyze the old man if he saw it . " He went out to the shed where Bacon was at work , as serene as if he had not a fearful task on hand . He was apprehensive that the father might " gig back " unless rightly approached , and so he awaited a good opportunity . The right moment seemed to present itself along about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground under the machine , tightening some burrs . This was a good chance for two reasons . In the first place , the keen , almost savage eyes were no longer where they could glare on him , and in spite of his cool exterior Lime had just as soon not have the old man looking at him . Besides , the old farmer had been telling about his " river eighty , " which was without a tenant ; the man who had taken it , having lost his wife , had grown disheartened and had given it up . " It 's an almighty good chance for a man with a small family . Good house an ' barn , good land . A likely young feller with a team an ' a woman could do tiptop on that eighty . If he wanted more , I 'd let him have an eighty j'inun '  --  " " I 'd like t ' try that m'self , " said Lime , as a feeler . The old fellow said nothing in reply for a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , I 'd jest as lief you 'd have it as anybody . " " Sell me your blacks , and I 'll pay half down -- the balance in the fall . I can pick up some tools , and as for a woman , Merry Etty an ' me have talked that over to-day . She 's ready to -- ready to marry me whenever you say go . " There was an ominous silence under the seeder , as if the father could not believe his ears . " What's -- what 's that ! " he stuttered . " Who 'd you say ? What about Merry Etty ? " " She 's agreed to marry me . " " The hell you say ! " roared Bacon , as the truth burst upon him . " So that 's what you do when I go off to town and leave you to chop wood . So you 're goun ' to git married , hey ? " He was now where Lime could see him , glaring up into his smiling blue eyes . Lime stood his ground . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I guess I 'll have somethin ' t ' say about that , " said Bacon , nodding his head violently . " I rather expected y ' would . Blaze away . Your privilege -- my bad luck . Sail in ol ' man . What 's y'r objection to me fer a son-in-law ? " " Do n't you worry , young feller . I 'll come at it soon enough , " went on Bacon , as he turned up another burr in a very awkward corner . In his nervous excitement the wrench slipped , banging his knuckle . " Ouch ! Thunder -- m-m-m ! " howled and snarled the wounded man . " What 's the matter ? Bark y'r knuckle ? " queried Lime , feeling a mighty impulse to laugh . But when he saw the old savage straighten up and glare at him he sobered . Bacon was now in a frightful temper . The veins in his great , bare , weather-beaten neck swelled dangerously . " Jest let me say right here that I 've had enough o ' you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl another day . " " What makes ye think I ca n't ? " It was now the young man 's turn to draw himself up , and as he faced the old man , his arms folded and each vast hand grasping an elbow , he looked like a statue of red granite , and the hands resembled the paws of a crouching lion ; but his eyes smiled . " I do n't think , I know ye wo n't . " " What 's the objection to me ? " " Objection ? Hell ! What 's the inducement ? My hired man , an ' not three shirts to yer back ! " " That 's another ; I 've got four . Say , old man , did you ever work out for a living ? " " That 's none o ' your business , " growled Bacon a little taken down . " I 've worked an ' scraped , an ' got t'gether a little prop'ty here , an ' they ai n't no sucker like you goun ' to come ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' spend my prop'ty after I 'm dead . You can jest bet high on that . " " Who 's goin ' t ' live on ye ? " " You 're aimun ' to . " " I ai n't , neither . " " Yes , y'are . You 've loafed on me ever since I hired ye . " " That 's a --  " Lime checked himself for Marietta 's sake , and the enraged father went on :  --  " I hired ye t ' cut wood , an ' you 've gone an ' fooled my daughter away from me . Now you just figger up what I owe ye , and git out o ' here . Ye ca n't go too soon t ' suit me . " Bacon was renowned as the hardest man to handle in Cedar County , and though he was getting old , he was still a terror to his neighbors when roused . He was honest , temperate , and a good neighbor until something carried him off his balance ; then he became as cruel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Lime knew , but it did not keep his anger down so much as did the thought of Marietta . His silence infuriated Bacon , who yelled hoarsely :  --  " Git out o ' this ! " " Do n't be in a rush , ol ' man --  " Bacon hurled himself upon Lime , who threw out one hand and stopped him , while he said in a low voice :  --  " Stay right where you are , ol ' man . I 'm dangerous . It 's for Merry 's sake --  " The infuriated old man struck at him . Lime warded off the blow , and with a sudden wrench and twist threw him to the ground with frightful force . Before Bacon could rise , Marietta , who had witnessed the scene , came flying from the house . " Lime ! Father ! What are you doing ? " " I -- could n't help it , Merry . It was him ' r me , " said Lime , almost sadly . " Dad , ai n't you got no sense ? What ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't have it . " He rose while she clung to him ; he seemed a little dazed . It was the first time he had ever been thrown , and he could not but feel a certain respect for his opponent , but he could not give way . " Pack up yer duds , " he snarled , " an ' git off'n my land . I 'll have the money fer ye when ye come back . I 'll give ye jest five minutes to git clear o ' here . Merry , you stay here . " The young man saw it was useless to remain , as it would only excite the old man ; and so , with a look of apology , not without humor , at Marietta , he went to the house to get his valise . The girl wept silently while the father raged up with such a dirty houn ' . " " He ai n't a houn ' , " she blazed forth , " and he 's just as good and clean as you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear another word out o ' your head . I 'm boss here yet , I reckon . " Lime came out with his valise in his hand . " Good-by , Merry , " he said cheerily . She started to go to him , but her father 's rough grasp held her . " Set down , an ' stay there . " Lime was going out of the gate . " Here ! Come and get y'r money , " yelled the old man , extending some bills . " Here 's twenty --  " " Go to thunder with your money , " retorted Lime . " I 've had my pay for my month 's work . " As he said that , he thought of the sunny kitchen and the merry girl , and his throat choked . Good-by to the sweet girl whose smile was so much to him , and to the happy noons and nights her eyes had made for him . He waved his hat at her as he stood in the open gate , and the sun lighted his handsome head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned and walked rapidly off down the road , not looking back . The girl , when she could no longer see him , dashed away , and , sobbing violently , entered the house . II There was just a suspicion of light in the east , a mere hint of a glow , when Lyman walked cautiously around the corner of the house and tapped at Marietta 's window . She was sleeping soundly and did not hear , for she had been restless during the first part of the night . He tapped again , and the girl woke without knowing what woke her . Lyman put the blade of his pocket-knife under the window and raised it a little , and then placed his lips to the crack , and spoke in a sepulchral tone , half groan , half whisper :  --  " Merry ! Merry Etty ! " The dazed girl sat up in bed and listened , while her heart almost stood still . " Merry , it 's me -- Lime . Come to the winder . " The girl hesitated , and Lyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time . This is your last chance t ' see me . It 's now ' r never . " The girl slipped out of bed , and , wrapping herself in a shawl , crept to the window . " Boost on that winder , " commanded Lyman . She raised it enough to admit his head , which came just above the sill ; then she knelt on the floor by the window . Her eyes stared wide and dark . " Lime , what in the world do you mean --  " " I mean business , " he replied . " I ai n't no last year 's chicken ; I know when the old man sleeps the soundest . " He chuckled pleasantly . " How ' d y ' fool old Rove ? " " Never mind about that now ; they 's something more important on hand . You 've got t ' go with me . " She drew back , " Oh , Lime , I ca n't ! " He thrust a great arm in and caught her by the wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'r last chance . If I go off without ye t'night , I never come back . What makes ye gig back ? Are ye ' fraid o ' me ? " " N-no ; but -- but --  " " But what , Merry Etty ? " " It ai n't right to go an ' leave Dad all alone . Where y ' goin ' t ' take me , anyhow ? " " Milt Jennings let me have his horse an ' buggy ; they 're down the road a piece , an ' we 'll go right down to Rock River and be married by sun-up . " The girl still hesitated , her firm , boyish will unwontedly befogged . Resolute as she was , she could not at once accede to his demand . " Come , make up your mind soon . The old man ' ll fill me with buck-shot if he catches sight o ' me . " He drew her arm out of the window and laid his bearded cheek to it . " Come , little one , we 're made for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ' r me . " The girl 's head dropped , consented . " That 's right ! Now a kiss to bind the bargain . There ! What , cryin ' ? No more o ' that , little one . Now I 'll give you jest five minutes to git on your Sunday-go-t ' - meetin ' clo'es . Quick , there goes a rooster . It 's gittin ' white in the east . " The man turned his back to the window and gazed at the western sky with a wealth of unuttered and unutterable exultation in his heart . Far off a rooster gave a long , clear blast -- would it be answered in the barn ? Yes ; some wakeful ear had caught it , and now the answer came faint , muffled , and drowsy . The dog at his feet whined uneasily as if suspecting something wrong . The wind from the south was full of the wonderful odor of springing grass , warm , brown earth , and oozing sap . Overhead , to the west , the stars were shining in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint silvery veil of moisture in the air . The man 's soul grew very tender as he stood waiting for his bride . He was rough , illiterate , yet there was something fine about him after all , a kind of simplicity and a gigantic , leonine tenderness . He heard his sweetheart moving about inside , and mused : " The old man wo n't hold out when he finds we 're married . He ca n't get along without her . If he does , why , I 'll rent a farm here , and we 'll go to work housekeepin ' . I can git the money . She sha n't always be poor , " he ended , and the thought was a vow . The window was raised again , and the girl 's voice was heard low and tremulous :  --  " Lime , I 'm ready , but I wish we didn't --  " He put his arm around her waist and helped her out , and did not put her down till they reached the road . She was completely dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  " My hair is every-which-way ; Lime , how can I be married so ? " They were nearing the horse and buggy now , and Lime laughed . " Oh , we 'll stop at Jennings 's and fix up . Milt knows what 's up , and has told his mother by this time . So just laugh as jolly as you can . " Soon they were in the buggy , the impatient horse swung into the road at a rattling pace , and as Marietta leaned back in the seat , thinking of what she had done , she cried lamentably , in spite of all the caresses and pleadings of her lover . But the sun burst up from the plain , the prairie-chickens took up their mighty chorus on the hills , robins met them on the way , flocks of wild geese , honking cheerily , drove far overhead toward the north , and , with these sounds of a golden spring day in her ears , the bride grew cheerful , and laughed . III At about the time the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the crowing of the chickens on the dry knolls in the fields as well as by those in the barn-yard , rolled out of bed wearily , wondering why he should feel so drowsy . Then he remembered the row with Lime and his subsequent inability to sleep with thinking over it . There was a dull pain in his breast , which made him uncomfortable . As was his usual custom , he went out into the kitchen and built the fire for Marietta , filled the tea-kettle with water , and filled the water-bucket in the sink . Then he went to her bedroom door and knocked with his knuckles as he had done for years in precisely the same fashion . Rap -- rap -- rap . " Hello , Merry ! Time t ' git up . Broad daylight , an ' birds asingun . ' " Without waiting for an answer he went out to the barn and worked away at his chores . He took such delight in the glorious morning and the turbulent life of the farmyard that his heart grew light and he hummed a tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poo-ee , poo-ee , " he called to the pigs as they swarmed across the yard . " Ahrr ! you big , fat rascals , them hams o ' yourn is clear money . One of ye shall go t ' buy Merry a new dress , " he said as he glanced at the house and saw the smoke pouring out the stovepipe . " Merry 's a good girl ; she 's stood by her old pap when other girls ' u 'd ' a ' gone back on ' im . " While currying horses he went all over the ground of the quarrel yesterday , and he began to see it in a different light . He began to see that Lyman was a good man and an able man , and that his own course was a foolish one . " When I git mad , " he confessed to himself , " I do n't know any thin ' . But I wo n't give her up . She ai n't old ' nough t ' marry yet -- and , besides , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to the well and washed his face and hands , then entered the kitchen -- to find the tea-kettle boiling over , and no signs of breakfast anywhere , and no sign of the girl . " Well , I guess she felt sleepy this mornin ' . Poor gal ! Mebbe she cried half the night . " " Merry ! " he called gently , at the door . " Merry , m ' gal ! Pap needs his breakfast . " There was no reply , and the old man 's face stiffened into a wild surprise . He knocked heavily again and got no reply , and , with a white face and shaking hand , he flung the door open and gazed at the empty bed . His hand dropped to his side ; his head turned slowly from the bed to the open window ; he rushed forward and looked out on the ground , where he saw the tracks of a man . He fell heavily into the chair by the bed , while a deep groan broke from his stiff and twitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me ! " For a long half-hour the iron-muscled old man sat there motionless , hearing not the songs of the hens or the birds far out in the brilliant sunshine . He had lost sight of his farm , his day 's work , and felt no hunger for food . He did not doubt that her going was final . He felt that she was gone from him forever . If she ever came back it would not be as his daughter , but as the wife of Gilman . She had deserted him , fled in the night like a thief ; his heart began to harden again , and he rose stiffly . His native stubbornness began to assert itself , the first great shock over , and he went out to the kitchen , and prepared , as best he could , a breakfast , and sat down to it . In some way his appetite failed him , and he fell to thinking over his past life , of the death of his wife , and the early death of his only boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the future without his girl , when two carriages drove into the yard . It was about the middle of the forenoon , and the prairie-chickens had ceased to boom and squawk ; in fact , that was why he knew , for he had been sitting two hours at the table . Before he could rise he heard swift feet and a merry voice and Marietta burst through the door . " Hello , Pap ! How you makin ' out with break --  " She saw a look on his face that went to her heart like a knife . She saw a lonely and deserted old man sitting at his cold and cheerless breakfast , and with a remorseful cry she ran across the floor and took him in her arms , kissing him again and again , while Mr. John Jennings and his wife stood in the door . " Poor ol ' Pap ! Merry could n't leave you . She 's come back to stay as long as he lives . " The old man remained cold and stern . His deep voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , noticing no one else . " But how do you come back t ' me ? " The girl grew rosy , but she stood proudly up . " I come back the wife of a man , Pap ; a wife like my mother , an ' this t ' hang beside hers ; " and she laid down a rolled piece of parchment . " Take it an ' go , " growled he ; " take yer lazy lubber an ' git out o ' my sight . I raised ye , took keer o ' ye when ye was little , sent ye t ' school , bought ye dresses ,  - -  done everythin ' fer ye I could , ' lowin ' t ' have ye stand by me when I got old ,  - -  but no , ye must go back on yer ol ' pap , an ' go off in the night with a good-f'r-nothin ' houn ' that nobuddy knows anything about -- a feller that never done a thing fer ye in the world --  " " What did you do for mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? How much did you have when you took her away from her good home an ' brought her away out here among the wolves an ' Indians ? I 've heard you an ' her say a hundred times that you did n't have a chair in the house . Now , why do you talk so t ' me when I want t ' git -- when Lime comes and asks for me ? " The old man was staggered . He looked at the smiling face of John Jennings and the tearful eyes of Mrs. Jennings , who had returned with Lyman . But his heart hardened again as he caught sight of Lime looking in at him . His absurd pride would not let him relent . Lime saw it , and stepped forward . " Ol ' man , I want t ' take a little inning now . I 'm a fair , square man . I asked ye fer Merry as a man should . I told you I 'd had hard luck , when I first came here . I had five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a thing now except credit , but that 's good fer enough t ' stock a little farm with . Now , I wan ' to be fair and square in this thing .

" There was something winning in the sturdy bearing of the man as he stood before the father , who remained silent and grim . " Or if you do n't do that , why , there 's nothin ' left fer Merry an ' me but to go back to La Crosse , where I can have my choice of a dozen farms . Now this is the way things is standin ' . I do n't want to be underhanded about this thing --  " " That 's a fair offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd better do it , neighbor Bacon . Nobuddy need know how things stood ; they were married in my house -- I thought that would be best . You ca n't live without your girl , " he went on , " any more ' n I could without my boy . You 'd better --  " The figure at the table straightened up . Under his tufted eyebrows his keen gray eyes flashed from one to the other . His hands knotted . " Go slow ! " went on the smooth voice of Jennings , known all the country through as a peacemaker . " Take time t ' think it over . Stand out , an ' you 'll live here alone without chick ' r child ; give in , and this house ' ll bubble over with noise and young ones . Now is short , and forever 's a long time to feel sorry in . " The old man at the table knitted his eyebrows , and a distorted , quivering , ghastly smile broke out on his face . His chest heaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yank them gloves off , an ' git me something to eat -- breakfus ' r dinner , I do n't care which . Lime , you infernal idiot , git out there and gear up them horses . What in thunder you foolun ' round about hyere in seed'n ' ? Come , hustle , all o ' ye ! " And they all shouted in laughter , while the old man strode unsteadily but resolutely out toward the barn , followed by the bridegroom , who was still laughing -- but silently . ELDER PILL , PREACHER I Old man Bacon was pinching forked barbs on a wire fence one rainy day in July , when his neighbor Jennings came along the road on his way to town . Jennings never went to town except when it rained too hard to work outdoors , his neighbors said ; and of old man Bacon it was said he never rested nights nor Sundays . Jennings pulled up . " Good morning , neighbor Bacon . " " Mornin ' , " rumbled the old man without looking up . " Taking it easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear up ? " " May , an ' may not . Do n't make much differunce t ' me , " growled Bacon , discouragingly . " Heard about the plan for a church ? " " Naw . " " Well , we 're goin ' to hire Elder Pill from Douglass to come over and preach every Sunday afternoon at the schoolhouse , an ' we want help t ' pay him -- the laborer is worthy of his hire . " " Sometimes he is an ' then agin he ai n't . Y ' need n't look t ' me f'r a dollar . I ai n't got no intrust in y'r church . " " Oh , yes , you have -- besides , y'r sister --  " " She ai n't got no more time ' n I have t ' go t ' church . We 're obleeged to do ' bout all we c'n stand t ' pay our debts , let alone tryun ' to support a preacher . " And the old man shut the pinchers up on a barb with a vicious grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess you 'll help when the time comes , " he said , and , clucking to his team , drove off . " I guess I wo n't , " muttered the grizzled old giant as he went on with his work . Bacon was what is called land poor in the West , that is , he had more land than money ; still he was able to give if he felt disposed . It remains to say that he was not disposed , being a sceptic and a scoffer . It angered him to have Jennings predict so confidently that he would help . The sun was striking redly through a rift in the clouds , about three o'clock in the afternoon , when he saw a man coming up the lane , walking : on the grass at the side of the road , and whistling merrily . The old man looked at him from under his huge eyebrows with some curiosity . As he drew near , the pedestrian ceased to whistle , and , just as the farmer expected him to pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style :  --  " How de do ? Give me a chaw t'baccer . I 'm Pill , the new minister . I take fine-cut when I can get it , " he said , as Bacon put his hand into his pocket . " Much obliged . How goes it ? " " Tollable , tollable , " said the astounded farmer , looking hard at Pill as he flung a handful of tobacco into his mouth . " Yes , I 'm the new minister sent around here to keep you fellows in the traces and out of hell-fire . Have y ' fled from the wrath ? " he asked , in a perfunctory way . " You are , eh ? " said Bacon , referring back to his profession . " I am , just ! How do you like that style of barb fence ? Ai n't the twisted wire better ? " " I s'pose they be , but they cost more . " " Yes , costs more to go to heaven than to hell . You 'll think so after I board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light , and broad the way that leads -- how 's your soul anyway , brother ? " " Soul 's all right . I find more trouble to keep m ' body go'n . " " Give us your hand ; so do I. All the same we must prepare for the next world . We 're gettin ' old ; lay not up your treasures where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break through and steal . " Bacon was thoroughly interested in the preacher , and was studying him carefully . He was tall , straight , and superbly proportioned ; broad-shouldered , wide-lunged , and thewed like a Chippewa . His rather small steel-blue eyes twinkled , and his shrewd face and small head , set well back , completed a remarkable figure . He wore his reddish beard in the usual way of Western clergymen , with mustache chopped close . Bacon spoke slowly :  --  " You look like a good , husky man to pitch in the barn-yard ; you 've too much muscle f'r preachun ' . " " Come and hear me next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll quit , " replied Mr. Pill , quietly . " I give ye my word for it . I believe in preachers havin ' a little of the flesh and the devil ; they can sympathize better with the rest of ye . " The sarcasm was lost on Bacon , who continued to look at him . Suddenly he said , as if with an involuntary determination :  --  " Where ye go'n ' to stay t'night ? " " I do n't know ; do you ? " was the quick reply . " I reckon ye can hang out with me , ' f ye feel like ut . We ai n't very purty , at our house , but we eat . You go along down the road and tell ' em I sent yeh . Ye 'll find an ' ol ' dusty Bible round some'rs -- I s'pose ye spend y'r spare time read'n ' about Joshua an ' Dan'l --  " " I spend more time reading men . Well , I 'm off ! I 'm hungrier ' n a gray wolf in a bear-trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did not whistle ; he chewed . Bacon felt as if he had made too much of a concession , and had a strong inclination to shout after him , and retract his invitation ; but he did not , only worked on , with an occasional bear-like grin . There was something captivating in this fellow 's free and easy way . When he came up to the house an hour or two later , in singular good humor for him , he found the Elder in the creamery , with his niece Eldora , who was not more won by him than was his sister Jane Buttles , he was so genial and put on so few religious frills . Mrs. Buttles never put on frills of any kind . She was a most frightful toiler , only excelled ( if excelled at all ) by her brother . Unlovely at her best , when about her work in her faded calico gown and flat shoes , hair wisped into a slovenly knot , she was depressing . But she was a good woman , of sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very glad of the chance to take charge of her brother 's household after Marietta married . Eldora was as attractive as her mother was depressing . She was very young at this time and had the physical perfection -- at least as regards body -- that her parents must have had in youth . She was above the average height of woman , with strong swell of bosom and glorious , erect carriage of head . Her features were coarse , but regular and pleasing , and her manner boyish . Elder Pill was on the best terms with them as he watched the milk being skimmed out of the " submerged cans " ready for the " caaves and hawgs , " as Mrs. Buttles called them . " Uncle told you t ' come here ' nd stay t ' supper , did he ? What 's come over him ? " said the girl , with a sort of audacious humor . " Bill has an awful grutch agin preachers , " said Mrs. Buttles , as she wiped her hands on her apron . " I declare , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers , " laughed Pill , in his mellow nasal . " There are preachers , and then again preachers . I 'm one o ' the t' other kind . " " I sh 'd think y ' was , " laughed the girl . " Now , Eldory , you run right t ' the pig-pen with that milk , whilst I go in an ' set the tea on . " Mr. Pill seized the can of milk , saying , with a twang : " Show me the way that I may walk therein , " and , accompanied by the laughing girl , made rapid way to the pig-pen just as the old man set up a ferocious shout to call the hired hand out of the corn-field . " How 'd y ' come to send him here ? " asked Mrs. Buttles , nodding toward Pill . " Damfino ! I kind o ' liked him -- no nonsense about him , " answered Bacon , going into temporary eclipse behind his hands as he washed his face at the cistern . At the supper table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate with his knife , talked about fatting hogs , suggested a few points on raising clover , told of pioneer experiences in Michigan , and soon won them -- hired man and all -- to a most favorable opinion of himself . But he did not trench on religious matters at all . The hired man in his shirt-sleeves , and smelling frightfully of tobacco and sweat ( as did Bacon ) , sat with open mouth , at times forgetting to eat , in his absorbing interest in the minister 's yarns . " Yes , I 've got a family , too much of a family , in fact -- that is , I think so sometimes when I 'm pinched . Our Western people are so indigent -- in plain terms , poor -- they ca n't do any better than they do . But we pull through -- we pull through ! John , you look like a stout fellow , but I 'll bet a hat I can down you three out of five . " " I bet you ca n't , " grinned the hired man . It was the climax of all , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' flop y ' both , " roared Bacon from his lion-like throat , his eyes glistening with rare good-nature from the shadow of his gray brows . But he admired the minister 's broad shoulders at the same time . If this fellow panned out as he promised , he was a rare specimen . After supper the Elder played a masterly game of croquet with Eldora , beating her with ease ; then he wandered out to the barn and talked horses with the hired man , and finished by stripping off his coat and putting on one of Mrs. Buttles 's aprons to help milk the cows . But at breakfast the next morning , when the family were about pitching into their food as usual without ceremony , the visitor spoke in an imperious tone and with lifted hand . " Wait ! Let us look to the Lord for His blessing . " They waited till the grace was said , but it threw a depressing atmosphere over the group ; evidently they considered the trouble begun . At the end of the meal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house ? " " I reckon there 's one around somewhere . Elly , go ' n see ' f y ' ca n't raise one , " said Mrs. Buttles , indifferently . " Have you any objection to family devotion ? " asked Pill , as the book was placed in his hands by the girl . " No ; have all you want , " said Bacon , as he rose from the table and passed out the door . " I guess I 'll see the thing through , " said the hand . " It ai n't just square to leave the women folks to bear the brunt of it . " It was shortly after breakfast that the Elder concluded he 'd walk up to Brother Jennings 's and see about church matters . " I shall expect you , Brother Bacon , to be at the service at 2.30 . " " All right , go ahead expectun ' , " responded Bacon , with an inscrutable sidewise glance . " You promised , you remember ? " " The -- devil -- I did ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile , and went off whistling in the warm , bright morning . II The schoolhouse down on the creek was known as " Hell 's Corners " all through the county , because of the frequent rows that took place therein at " corkuses " and the like , and also because of the number of teachers that had been " ousted " by the boys . In fact , it was one of those places still to be found occasionally in the West , far from railroads and schools , where the primitive ignorance and ferocity of men still prowl , like the panthers which are also found sometimes in the deeps of the Iowa timber lands . The most of this ignorance and ferocity , however , was centred in the family of Dixons , a dark-skinned , unsavory group of Missourians . It consisted of old man Dixon and wife , and six sons , all man-grown , great , gaunt , sinewy fellows , with no education , but superstitious as savages . If anything went wrong in " Hell 's Corners " everybody knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The school-teachers were warned against the Dixons , and the preachers were besought to convert the Dixons . In fact , John Jennings , as he drove Pill to the schoolhouse next day , said :  --  " If you can convert the Dixon boys , Elder , I 'll give you the best horse in my barn . " " I work not for such hire , " said Mr. Pill , with a look of deep solemnity on his face , belied , indeed , by a twinkle in his small , keen eye -- a twinkle which made Milton Jennings laugh candidly . There was considerable curiosity , expressed by a murmur of lips and voices , as the minister 's tall figure entered the door and stood for a moment in a study of the scene before him . It was a characteristically Western scene . The women sat on one side of the schoolroom , the men on the other ; the front seats were occupied by squirming boys and girls in their Sunday splendor . On the back , to the right , were the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and butterfly neckties , with their coats unbuttoned , their hair plastered down in a fascinating wave on their brown foreheads . Not a few were in their shirt-sleeves . The older men sat immediately between the youths and boys , talking in hoarse whispers across the aisles about the state of the crops and the county ticket , while the women in much the same way conversed about the children and raising onions and strawberries . It was their main recreation , this Sunday meeting . " Brethren ! " rang out the imperious voice of the minister , " let us pray . " The audience thoroughly enjoyed the Elder 's prayer . He was certainly gifted in that direction , and his petition grew genuinely eloquent as his desires embraced the " ends of the earth and the utterm'st parts of the seas thereof . " But in the midst of it a clatter was heard , and five or six strapping fellows filed in with loud thumpings of their brogans . Shortly after they had settled themselves with elaborate impudence on the back seat , the singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every individual voice wavered and all but died out in astonishment to see William Bacon come in -- an unheard-of thing ! And with a clean shirt , too ! Bacon , to tell the truth , was feeling as much out of place as a cat in a bath-tub , and looked uncomfortable , even shamefaced , as he sidled in , his shapeless hat gripped nervously in both hands ; coatless and collarless , his shirt open at his massive throat . The girls tittered , of course , and the boys hammered each other 's ribs , moved by the unusual sight . Milton Jennings , sitting beside Bettie Moss , said :  --  " Well ! may I jump straight up and never come down ! " And Shep Watson said : " May I never see the back o ' my neck ! " Which pleased Bettie so much that she grew quite purple with efforts to conceal her laughter ; she always enjoyed a joke on her father . But all things have an end , and at last the room became quiet as Mr. Pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commotion . He suspected that those dark-skinned , grinning fellows on the back seat were the Dixon boys , and knew they were bent on fun . The physique of the minister being carefully studied , the boys began whispering among themselves , and at last , just as the sermon opened , they began to push the line of young men on the long seat over toward the girls ' side , squeezing Milton against Bettie . This pleasantry encouraged one of them to whack his neighbor over the head with his soft hat , causing great laughter and disturbance . The preacher stopped . His cool , penetrating voice sounded strangely unclerical as he said :  --  " There are some fellows here to-day to have fun with me . If they do n't keep quiet , they 'll have more fun than they can hold . " ( At this point a green crab-apple bounded up the aisle . ) " I 'm not to be bulldozed . " He pulled off his coat and laid it on the table before him , and , amid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying :  --  " I can preach the word of the Lord just as well without my coat , and I can throw rowdies out the door a little better in my shirt-sleeves . " Had the Dixon boys been a little shrewder as readers of human character , or if they had known why old William Bacon was there , they would have kept quiet ; but it was not long before they began to push again , and at last one of them gave a squeak , and a tussle took place . The preacher was in the midst of a sentence :  --  " An evil deed , brethren , is like unto a grain of mustard seed . It is small , but it grows steadily , absorbing its like from the earth and air , sending out roots and branches , till at last --  " There was a scuffle and a snicker . Mr. Pill paused , and gazed intently at Tom Dixon , who was the most impudent and strongest of the gang ; then he moved slowly down on the astonished young savage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eagle in battle , steady , remorseless , unwavering , at the same time that his brows shut down over them -- a glance that hushed every breath . The awed and astonished ruffians sat as if paralyzed by the unuttered yet terribly ferocious determination of the preacher 's eyes . His right hand was raised , the other was clenched at his waist . There was a sort of solemnity in his approach , like a tiger creeping upon a foe . At last , after what seemed minutes to the silent , motionless congregation , his raised hand came down on the shoulder of the leader with the exact , resistless precision of the tiger 's paw , and the ruffian was snatched from his seat to the floor sprawling . Before he could rise , the steel-like grip of the roused preacher sent him halfway to the door , and then out into the dirt of the road . Turning , Pill strode down the aisle once more . The half-risen congregation made way for him , curiously . When he came within reach of Dick , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his blow avoided by a lithe , lightning-swift movement of the body above the hips ( a trained boxer 's trick ) , and to find himself lying bruised and dazed on the floor . By this time the other brothers had recovered from their stupor , and , with wild curses , leaped over the benches toward the fearless preacher . But now a new voice was heard in the sudden uproar -- a new but familiar voice . It was the mighty voice of William Bacon , known far and wide as a terrible antagonist , a man who had never been whipped . He was like a wild beast excited to primitive savagery by the smell of blood . " Stand back , you hell-hounds ! " he said , leaping between them and the preacher . " You know me . Lay another hand on that man an ' , by the livun ' God , you answer t ' me . Back thear ! " Some of the men cheered , most stood irresolute . The women crowded together , the children began to scream with terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door . Bacon made his way down to where the Dixons had halted , undecided what to do . If the preacher had the air and action of the tiger , Bacon looked the grisly bear -- his eyebrows working up and down , his hands clenched into frightful bludgeons , his breath rushing through his hairy nostrils . " Git out o ' hyare , " he growled . " You 've run things here jest about long enough . Git out ! " His hands were now on the necks of two of the boys and he was hustling them toward the door . " If you want ' o whip the preacher , meet him in the public road -- one at a time ; he 'll take care o ' himself . Out with ye , " he ended , kicking them out . " Show your faces here agin , an ' I 'll break ye in two . " The non-combative farmers now began to see the humor of the whole transaction , and began to laugh ; but they were cut short by the calm voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deed , brethren , is like unto a grain of wheat planted in good earth , that bringeth forth fruit in due season an hundred fold . " III Mr. Pill , with all his seeming levity , was a powerful hand at revivals , as was developed at the " protracted " meetings at the Grove during December . Indeed , such was the pitiless intensity of his zeal that a gloom was cast over the whole township ; the ordinary festivities stopped or did not begin at all . The lyceum , which usually began by the first week in December , was put entirely out of the question , as were the spelling-schools and " exhibitions . " The boys , it is true , still drove the girls to meeting in the usual manner ; but they all wore a furtive , uneasy air , and their laughter was not quite genuine at its best , and died away altogether when they came near the schoolhouse , and they hardly recovered from the effects of the preaching till a mile or two had been spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jingle of the bells and the musical creak of the polished steel on the snow to win them back to laughter . As for Elder Pill , he was as a man transformed . He grew more intense each night , and strode back and forth behind his desk and pounded the Bible like an assassin . No more games with the boys , no more poking the girls under the chin ! When he asked for a chew of tobacco now it was with an air which said : " I ask it as sustenance that will give me strength for the Lord 's service , " as if the demands of the flesh had weakened the spirit . Old man Bacon overtook Milton Jennings early one Monday morning , as Milton was marching down toward the Seminary at Rock River . It was intensely cold and still , so cold and still that the ring of the cold steel of the heavy sleigh , the snort of the horses , and the old man 's voice came with astonishing distinctness to the ears of the hurrying youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man came up . " Climb on ! " he yelled , out of his frosty beard . He was seated on the " hind bob " of a wood-sleigh , on a couple of blankets . Milton clambered on , knowing well he 'd freeze to death there . " Reckon I heerd you prowlun ' around the front door with my girl last night , " Bacon said at length . " The way you both ' tend out t ' meetun ' ought ' o sanctify yeh ; must ' a ' stayed to the after-meetun ' , did n't yeh ? " " Nope . The front part was enough for --  " " Danged if I was any more fooled with a man in m ' life . I b'lieve the whole thing is a little scheme on the bretheren t ' raise a dollar . " " Why so ? " " Waal , y ' see , Pill ai n't got much out o ' the app'intment thus fur , and he ai n't likely to , if he do n't shake ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t' other day . " Well , thought Milton , whatever his real motive is , Elder Pill is earning all he gets . Standing for two or three hours in his place night after night , arguing , pleading , even commanding them to be saved . Milton was describing the scenes of the meeting to Bradley Talcott and Douglas Radbourn the next day , and Radbourn , a young law student , said :  --  " I 'd like to see him . He must be a character . " " Let 's make up a party and go out , " said Milton , eagerly . " All right ; I 'll speak to Lily Graham . " Accordingly , that evening a party of students , in a large sleigh , drove out toward the schoolhouse , along the drifted lanes and through the beautiful aisles of the snowy woods . A merry party of young people , who had no sense of sin to weigh them down . Even Radbourn and Lily joined in the songs which they sang to the swift clanging of the bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frosty air . Not a few of the older people present felt scandalized by the singing and by the dancing of the " town girls , " who could not for the life of them take the thing seriously . The room was so little , and hot , and smoky , and the men looked so queer in their rough coats and hair every-which-way . But they took their seats demurely on the back seat , and joined in the opening songs , and listened to the halting prayers of the brethren and the sonorous prayers of the Elder , with commendable gravity . Miss Graham was a devout Congregationalist , and hushed the others into gravity when their eyes began to dance dangerously . However , as Mr. Pill warmed to his work , the girls grew sober enough . He awed them , and frightened them with the savagery of his voice and manner . His small gray eyes were like daggers unsheathed , and his small , round head took on a cat-like ferocity , as he strode to and fro , hurling out his warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drew " amens " of admiration from the saints . " Atavism ; he has gone back to the era of the medicine man , " Radbourn murmured . As the speaker went on , foam came upon his thin lips ; his lifted hand had prophecy and threatening in it . His eyes reflected flames ; his voice had now the tone of the implacable , vindictive judge . He gloated on the pictures that his words called up . By the power of his imagination the walls widened , the floor was no longer felt , the crowded room grew still as death , every eye fixed on the speaker 's face . " I tell you , you must repent or die . I can see the great judgment angel now ! " he said , stopping suddenly and pointing above the stovepipe . " I can see him as he stands weighing your souls as a man ' ud weigh wheat and chaff . Wheat goes into the Father 's garner ; chaff is blown to hell 's devouring flame ! I can see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul by the neck , he holds him over the flaming forge of hell till his bones melt like wax ; he shrivels like thread in the flame of a candle ; he is nothing but a charred husk , and the angel flings him back into outer darkness ; life was not in him . " It was this astonishing figure , powerfully acted , that scared poor Tom Dixon into crying out for mercy . The effect upon others was painful . To see so great a sinner fall terror-stricken seemed like a providential stroke of confirmatory evidence , and nearly a dozen other young people fell crying , whereat the old people burst out into amens of spasmodic fervor , while the preacher , the wild light still in his eyes , tore up and down , crying above the tumult :  --  " The Lord is come with power ! His hand is visible here . Shout aloud and spare not . Fall before him as dust to his feet ! Hypocrites , vipers , scoffers ! the lash o ' the Lord is on ye ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with expectant , uplifted face -- a pause so deep even the sobbing sinners held their breath -- a dry , drawling , utterly matter-of-fact voice broke the intense hush . " S-a-y , Pill , ai n't you a-bearun ' down on the boys a leetle too hard ? " The preacher 's extended arm fell as if life had gone out of it . His face flushed and paled ; the people laughed hysterically , some of them with the tears of terror still on their cheeks ; but Radbourn said , " Bravo , Bacon ! " Pill recovered himself . " Not hard enough for you , neighbor Bacon . " Bacon rose , retaining the same dry , prosaic tone :  --  " I ai n't bitin ' that kind of a hook , an ' I ai n't goin ' to be yanked into heaven when I c'n slide into hell . Waal ! I must be goin ' ; I 've got a new-milk 's cow that needs tendin ' to . " The effect of all this was very great . From being at the very mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morbid imaginings , Bacon 's dry intonation brought them all back to earth again . They perceived something of the absurdity of the whole situation . Pill was beaten for the first time in his life . He had been struck below the belt by a good-natured giant . The best he could do , as Bacon shuffled calmly out , was to stammer : " Will some one please sing ? " And while they sang , he stood in deep thought . Just as the last verse was quivering into silence , the full , deep tones of Radbourn 's voice rose above the bustle of feet and clatter of seats :  --  " And all that he preaches in the name of Him who came bringing peace and good-will to men . " Radbourn 's tone had in it reproach and a noble suggestion . The people looked at him curiously . The deacons nodded their heads together in counsel , and when they turned to the desk Pill was gone ! " Gee whittaker ! That was tough , " said Milton to Radbourn ; " knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 'll he do now ? " " He ca n't do anything but acknowledge his foolishness . " " You no business t ' come here an ' ' sturb the Lord 's meetin ' , " cried old Daddy Brown to Radbourn . " You 're a sinner and a scoffer . " " I thought Bacon was the disturbing ele --  " " You 're just as bad ! " " He 's all right , " said William Councill . " I 've got sick , m'self , of bein ' scared into religion . I never was so fooled in a man in my life . If I 'd tell you what Pill said to me the other day , when we was in Robie 's store , you 'd fall in a fit . An ' to hear him talkin ' here t'night , is enough to make a horse laugh . " " You 're all in league with the devil , " said the old man , wildly ; and so the battle raged on . Milton and Radbourn escaped from it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The heat of the furnace does n't reach as far as the horses , " Radbourn moralized , as he aided in unhitching the shivering team . " In the vast , calm spaces of the stars , among the animals , such scenes as we have just seen are impossible . " He lifted his hand in a lofty gesture . The light fell on his pale face and dark eyes . The girls were a little indignant and disposed to take the preacher 's part . They thought Bacon had no right to speak out that way , and Miss Graham uttered her protest , as they whirled away on the homeward ride with pleasant jangle of bells . " But the secret of it all was , " said Radbourn in answer , " Pill knew he was acting a part . I do n't mean that he meant to deceive , but he got excited , and his audience responded as an audience does to an actor of the first class , and he was for the time in earnest ; his imagination did see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . But when Bacon spoke , his dry tone and homely words brought everybody , preacher and all , back to the earth with a thump ! Everybody saw , that after weeping and wailing there for an hour , they 'd go home , feed the calves , hang up the lantern , put out the cat , wind the clock , and go to bed . In other words , they all came back out of their barbaric powwow to their natural modern selves . " This explanation had palpable truth , but Lily perceived that it had wider application than to the meeting they had just left . " They 'll be music around this clearing to-morrow , " said Milton , with a sigh ; " wish I was at home this week . " " But what 'll become of Mr. Pill ? " " Oh , he 'll come out all right , " Radbourn assured her , and Milton 's clear tenor rang out as he drew Eileen closer to his side :  --  " O silver moon , O silver moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far away , The night is but begun . " IV The news , grotesquely exaggerated , flew about the next day , and at night , though it was very cold and windy , the house was jammed to suffocation . On these lonely prairies life is so devoid of anything but work , dramatic entertainments are so few , and appetite so keen , that a temperature of twenty degrees below zero is no bar to a trip of ten miles . The protracted meeting was the only recreation for many of them . The gossip before and after service was a delight not to be lost , and this last sensation was dramatic enough to bring out old men and women who had not dared to go to church in winter for ten years . Long before seven o'clock , the schoolhouse blazed with light and buzzed with curious speech . Team after team drove up to the door , and as the drivers leaped out to receive the women , they said in low but eager tones to the bystanders :  --  " Meeting begun yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time y ' havin ' over here , any way ? " " A mighty solumn time , " somebody would reply with a low laugh . By seven o'clock every inch of space was occupied ; the air was frightful . The kerosene lamps gave off gas and smoke , the huge stove roared itself into an angry red on its jack-oak grubs , and still people crowded in at the door . Discussion waxed hot as the stove ; two or three Universalists boldly attacked everybody who came their way . A tall man stood on a bench in the corner , and , thumping his Bible wildly with his fist , exclaimed , at the top of his voice :  --  " There is no hell at all ! The Bible says the wicked perish utterly . They are consumed as ashes when they die . They perish as dogs ! " " What kind o ' docterin ' is that ? " asked a short man of Councill . " I d'know . It 's ol ' Sam Richards . Calls himself a **26;3163;TOOLONG ' r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire , " Well , ai n't he comin ' ? " " Most time f'r the Elder to come , ai n't it ? " " Oh , I guess he 's preparin ' a sermon . " John Jennings pushed anxiously to Daddy Brown . " Ai n't the Elder comin ' ? " " I d'know . He did n't stay at my house . " " He did n't ? " " No . Thought he went home with you . " " I ai n't see ' im ' t all . I 'll ask Councill . Brother Councill , seen anything of the Elder ? " " No . Did n't he go home with Bensen ? " " I d'n know . I 'll see . " This was enough to start the news that " Pill had skipped . " This the deacons denied , saying " he 'd come or send word . " Outside , on the leeward side of the house , the young men who could n't get in stood restlessly , now dancing a jig , now kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They talked spasmodically as they swung their arms about their chests , speaking from behind their huge buffalo-coat collars . The wind roared through the creaking oaks ; the horses stirred complainingly , the bells on their backs crying out querulously ; the heads of the fortunates inside were shadowed outside on the snow , and the restless young men amused themselves betting on which head was Bensen and which Councill . At last some one pounded on the desk inside . The suffocating but lively crowd turned with painful adjustment toward the desk , from whence Deacon Bensen 's high , smooth voice sounded :  --  " Brethren an ' sisters , Elder Pill hai n't come -- and , as it 's about eight o'clock , he probably wo n't come to-night . After the disturbances last night , it's -- a -- a -- we 're all the more determined to -- the -- a -- need of reforming grace is more felt than ever . Let us hope nothing has happened to the Elder . I 'll go see to-morrow , and if he is unable to come -- I 'll see Brother Wheat , of Cresco . After prayer by Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennings , will you lead us in prayer ? " ( Some one snickered . ) " I hope the disgraceful -- a -- scenes of last night will not be repeated . " " Where 's Pill ? " demanded a voice in the back part of the room . " That 's what I want to know . " " He 's a bad pill , " said another , repeating a pun already old . " I guess so ! He borrowed twenty dollars o ' me last week , " said the first voice . " He owes me for a pig , " shouted a short man , excitedly . " I believe he 's skipped to get rid o ' his debts . " " So do I. I always said he was a mighty queer preacher . " " He 'd bear watchin ' was my idee fust time I ever see him . " " Careful , brethren -- careful . He may come at any minute . " " I do n't care if he does . I 'd bone him f'r pay f'r that shote , preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nervously . High words followed this , and there was prospect of a fight . The pressure of the crowd , however , was so great it was well-nigh impossible for two belligerents to get at each other . The meeting broke up at last , and the people , chilly , soured , and disappointed at the lack of developments , went home saying Pill was scaly ; no preacher who chawed terbacker was to be trusted , and when it was learned that the horse and buggy he drove he owed Jennings and Bensen for , everybody said , " He 's a fraud . " V In the meantime , Andrew Pill was undergoing the most singular and awful mental revolution . When he leaped blindly into his cutter and gave his horse the rein , he was wild with rage and shame , and a sort of fear . As he sat with bent head , he did not hear the tread of the horse , and did not see the trees glide past . The rabbit leaped away under the shadow of the thick groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perch , went fluttering off into the cold , crisp air ; but he saw only the contemptuous , quizzical face of old William Bacon -- one shaggy eyebrow lifted , a smile showing through his shapeless beard . He saw the colorless , handsome face of Radbourn , and his look of reproach and note of suggestion -- Radbourn , one of the best thinkers in Rock River , and the most generally admired young man in Rock County . When he saw and heard Bacon , his hurt pride flamed up in wrath , but the calm voice of Radbourn , and the look in his stern , accusing eyes , made his head fall in thought . As he rode , things grew clearer . As a matter of fact , his whole system of religious thought was like the side of a shelving sand-bank -- in unstable equilibrium -- needing only a touch to send it slipping into a shapeless pile at the river 's edge . That touch had been given , and he was now in the midst of the motion of his falling faith . He did n't know how much would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of things , a farmer , a dry-goods merchant , and a travelling salesman , but in a revival quite like this of his own , he had been converted and his life changed . He now desired to help his fellow-men to a better life , and willingly went out among the farmers , where pay was small . It was not true , therefore , that he had gone into it because there was little work and good pay . He was really an able man , and would have been a success in almost anything he undertook ; but his reading and thought , his easy intercourse with men like Bacon and Radbourn , had long since undermined any real faith in the current doctrine of retribution , and to-night , as he rode into the night , he was feeling it all and suffering it all , forced to acknowledge at last what had been long moving . The horse took the wrong road , and plodded along steadily , carrying him away from his home , but he did not know it for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the road leading out upon the wide plain between the belts of timber , leading away to Rock River , he gave a sigh of relief . He could not meet his wife then ; he must have a chance to think . Over him , the glittering , infinite sky of winter midnight soared , passionless , yet accusing in its calmness , sweetness , and majesty . What was he that he could dogmatize on eternal life and the will of the Being who stood behind that veil ? And then would come rushing back that scene in the schoolhouse , the smell of the steaming garments , the gases from the lamps , the roar of the stove , the sound of his own voice , strident , dominating , so alien to his present mood , he could only shudder at it . He was worn out with thinking when he drove into the stable at the Merchants ' House and roused up the sleeping hostler , who looked at him suspiciously and demanded pay in advance . This seemed right in his present mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself face downward on his bed , the turmoil in his brain was still going on . He could n't hold one thought or feeling long ; all seemed slipping like water from his hands . He had in him great capacity for change , for growth . Circumstances had been against his development thus far , but the time had come when growth seemed to be defeat and failure . VI Radbourn was thinking about him , two days after , as he sat in his friend Judge Brown 's law office , poring over a volume of law . He saw that Bacon 's treatment had been heroic ; he could n't get the pitiful confusion of the preacher 's face out of his mind . But , after all , Bacon 's seizing of just that instant was a stroke of genius . Some one touched him on the arm and he turned . " Why -- Elder -- Mr . Pill , how de do ? Sit down . Draw up a chair . " There was trouble in the preacher 's face . " Can I see you , Radbourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room . No one will disturb us there . " " Now , what can I do for you ? " he said , as they sat down . " I want to talk to you about -- about religion , " said Pill , with a little timid pause in his voice . Radbourn looked grave . " I 'm afraid you 've come to a dangerous man . " " I want you to tell me what you think . I know you 're a student . I want to talk about my case , " pursued the preacher , with a curious hesitancy . " I want to ask a few questions on things . " " Very well ; sail in . I 'll do the best I can , " said Radbourn . " I 've been thinking a good deal since that night . I 've come to the conclusion that I do n't believe what I 've been preaching . I thought I did , but I did n't . I do n't know what I believe . Seems as if the land had slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Say so , " replied Radbourn , his eyes kindling . " Say so , and get out of it . There 's nothing worse than staying where you are . What have you saved from the general land-slide ? " Pill smiled a little . " I do n't know . " " Want me to cross-examine you and see , eh ? Very well , here goes . " He settled back with a smile . " You believe in square dealing between man and man ? " " Certainly . " " You believe in good deeds , candor , and steadfastness ? " " I do . " " You believe in justice , equality of opportunity , and in liberty ? " " Certainly I do . " " You believe , in short , that a man should do unto others as he 'd have others do unto him ; think right and live out his thoughts ? " " All that I steadfastly believe . " " Well , I guess your land-slide was mostly imaginary . The face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at first , that 's all . One question more . You believe in getting at truth ? " " Certainly . " " Well , truth is only found from the generalizations of facts . Before calling a thing true , study carefully all accessible facts . Make your religion practical . The matter-of-fact tone of Bacon would have had no force if you had been preaching an earnest morality in place of an antiquated terrorism . " " I know it , I know it , " sighed Pill , looking down . " Well , now go back and tell ' em so . And then , if you ca n't keep your place preaching what you do believe , get into something else . For the sake of all morality and manhood , do n't go on cursing yourself with hypocrisy . " Mr. Pill took a chew of tobacco rather distractedly , and said :  --  " I 'd like to ask you a few questions . " " No , not now . You think out your present position yourself . Find out just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder man rose ; he hardly seemed the same man who had dominated his people a few days before . He turned with still greater embarrassment . " I want to ask a favor . I 'm going back to my family . I 'm going to say something of what you 've said , to my congregation -- but -- I 'm in debt -- and the moment they know I 'm a backslider , they 're going to bear down on me pretty heavy . I 'd like to be independent . " " I see . How much do you need ? " mused Radbourn . " I guess two hundred would stave off the worst of them . " " I guess Brown and I can fix that . Come in again to-night . Or no , I 'll bring it round to you . " The two men parted with a silent pressure of the hand that meant more than any words . When Mr. Pill told his wife that he could preach no more , she cried , and gasped , and scolded till she was in danger of losing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Councill called her . " She can talk more an ' say less ' n any woman I ever see , " was Bacon 's verdict , after she had been at dinner at his house . She was a perpetual irritant . Mr. Pill silenced her at last with a note of impatience approaching a threat , and drove away to the Corners to make his confession without her . It was Saturday night , and Elder Wheat was preaching as he entered the crowded room . A buzz and mumble of surprise stopped the orator for a few moments , and he shook hands with Mr. Pill dubiously , not knowing what to think of it all , but as he was in the midst of a very effective oratorical scene , he went on . The silent man at his side felt as if he were witnessing a burlesque of himself as he listened to the pitiless and lurid description of torment which Elder Wheat poured forth ,  - -  the same figures and threats he had used a hundred times . He stirred uneasily in his seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little orator finally called for a hymn , saying :  --  " Elder Pill has returned from his unexpected absence , and will exhort in his proper place . " When the singing ended , Mr. Pill rose , looking more like himself than since the previous Sunday . A quiet resolution was in his eyes and voice as he said :  --  " Elder Wheat has more right here than I have . I want ' o say that I 'm going to give up my church in Douglass and --  " A murmur broke out , which he silenced with his raised hand . " I find I do n't believe any longer what I 've been believing and preaching . Hold on ! let me go on . I do n't quite know where I 'll bring up , but I think my religion will simmer down finally to about this : A full half-bushel to the half-bushel and sixteen ounces to the pound . " Here two or three cheered . " Do unto others as you 'd have others do unto you . " Applause from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat listening as if petrified , with his mouth open . " I 'm going out of preaching , at least for the present . After things get into shape with me again , I may set up to teach people how to live , but just now I ca n't do it . I 've got all I can do to instruct myself . Just one thing more . I owe two or three of you here . I 've got the money for William Bacon , James Bartlett , and John Jennings . I turn the mare and cutter over to Jacob Bensen , for the note he holds . I hai n't got much religion left , but I 've got some morality . That 's all I want to say now . " When he sat down there was a profound hush ; then Bacon arose . " That 's man 's talk , that is ! An ' I jest want ' o say , Andrew Pill , that you kin jest forgit you owe me anything . An ' if ye want any help come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach , ' n ' I 'm ready to give ye my support . " " That 's the talk , " said Councill . " I 'm with ye on that . " Pill shook his head . The painful silence which followed was broken by the effusive voice of Wheat :  --  " Let us pray -- and remember our lost brother . " * * * * * The urgings of the people were of no avail . Mr. Pill settled up his affairs and moved to Cresco , where he went back into trade with a friend , and for three years attended silently to his customers , lived down their curiosity , and studied anew the problem of life . Then he moved away , and no one knew whither . One day last year Bacon met Jennings on the road . " Heerd anything o ' Pill lately ? " " No , have you ? " " Waal , yes . Brown told me he ran acrost him down in Eelinoy , doun ' well , too . " " In dry goods ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So Brown said . Kind of a free-f'r-all church , I reckon , from what Jedge told me . Built a new church ; fills it twice a Sunday . I 'd like to hear him , but he 's got t ' be too big a gun f'r us . Ben studyun ' , they say ; went t ' school . " Jennings drove sadly and thoughtfully on . " Rather stumps Brother Jennings , " laughed Bacon , in a good-humored growl . A DAY OF GRACE Sunday is the day for courtship on the prairie . It has also the piety of cleanliness . It allows the young man to get back to a self-respecting sweetness of person , and enables the girls to look as nature intended , dainty and sweet as posies . The change from everyday clothing on the part of young workmen like Ben Griswold was more than change ; it approached transformation . It took more than courage to go through the change , it required love . Ben arose a little later on Sunday morning than on weekdays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horses must be watered , fed , and curried , and the cows were to milk , but after breakfast Ben threw off the cares of the hired hand . When he came down from the little garret into which the hot August sun streamed redly , he was a changed creature . Clean from tip to toe , newly shaven , wearing a crackling white shirt , a linen collar and a new suit of store clothes , he felt himself a man again , fit to meet maidens . His partner , being a married man , was slouching around in his tattered and greasy brown denim overalls . He looked at Ben and grinned . " Got a tag on y'rself ? " " No , why ? " " Nobod'y know ye , if anything happened on the road . There 's thirty dollars gone to the dogs . " He sighed . " Oh , well , you 'll get over that , just as I did . " " I hope I wo n't get over liking to be clean , " Ben said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to milk . " " Did n't expect ye . That 's the very time o ' day the girls are purtiest ,  - -  just about sundown . Better take Rock . I may want the old team myself . " Ben hitched up and drove off in the warm bright morning , with wonderful elation , clean and self-respecting once more . His freshly shaven face felt cool , and his new suit fitted him well . His heart took on a great resolution , which was to call upon Grace . The thought of her made his brown hands shake , and he remembered how many times he had sworn to visit her , but had failed of courage , though it seemed she had invited him by word and look to do so . He overtook Milton Jennings on his way along the poplar-lined lane . " Hello , Milt , where you bound ? " Milton glanced up with a curious look in his laughing eyes . From the pockets of his long linen duster he drew a handful of beautiful scarlet and yellow Siberian crab-apples . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . " Milton drew a similar handful out of his left pocket . " See those ? " " What y ' going to do with ' em ? " " Take ' em home again . " Something in Milton 's voice led him to ask soberly :  --  " What did you intend doing with ' em ? " " Present ' em to Miss Cole . " " Well , why did n't y ' do it ? " Milton showed his white teeth in a smile that was frankly derisive of himself . " Well , when I got over there I found young Conley 's sorrel hitched to one post and Walt Brown 's gray hitched to the other . I went in , but I did n't stay long ; in fact , I did n't sit down . I was afraid those infernal apples would roll out o ' my pockets . I was afraid they 'd find out I brought ' em over there for Miss Cole , like the darn fool I was . " They both laughed heartily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else . " That 's tough , " said Ben , " but climb in , and let 's go to Sunday-school . " Milton got in , and they ate the apples as they rode along . The Grove schoolhouse was the largest in the township , and was the only one with a touch of redeeming grace . It was in a lovely spot ; great oaks stood all about , and back of it the woods grew thick , and a clear creek gurgled over its limestone bed not far away . To Ben and Milton there was a wondrous charm about the Grove schoolhouse . It was the one place where the boys and girls met in garments disassociated from toil . Sundays in summer , and on winter nights at lyceums or protracted meetings , the boys came to see the girls in their bright dresses , with their clear and ( so it seemed ) scornful bright eyes . All through the service Ben sat where he could see Grace by turning his head , but he had not the courage to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve of her cheek and the delicate lines of her ear , and a suffocating throb came into his throat . He wanted to ask her to go with him down to Cedarville to the Methodist camp-meeting , but he knew it was impossible . He could not even say " good day " when she took pains to pass near him after church . He nodded like a great idiot , all ease and dignity lost , his throat too dry and hot to utter a sound . He cursed his shyness as he went out after his horse . He saw her picking her dainty way up the road with Conrad Sieger walking by her side . What made it worse for Ben was a dim feeling that she liked him , and would go with him if he had the courage to ask her . " Well , Ben , " said Milton , " it 's settled , we go to Rock River to-night to the camp-meeting . Did you ask Grace ? " " No , she 's going with Con . It 's just my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , come with us . Take Maud . " As he rode away Ben passed Grace on the road . " Going to the camp-meeting , Con ? " asked Milton , in merry voice . " I guess so , " said Conrad , a handsome , but slow-witted German . As they went on Ben could have wept . His keener perception told him there was a look of appeal in Grace 's upturned eyes . He made a poor companion at dinner , and poor plain Maud knew his mind was elsewhere . She was used to that and accepted it with a pathetic attempt to color it differently . They got away about five o'clock . Ben drove the team , driving took his mind off his weakness and failure ; while Milton in the seclusion of the back seat of the carryall was happy with Amelia Turner . It was growing dark as they entered upon the curving road along the river which was a relief from the rectangular and sun-smitten roads of the prairie . They lingered under the great oaks and elms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Grace had been beside him in Maud 's place . He wondered how he should manage to speak to Grace . There was a time when it seemed easier . Now the consciousness of his love made the simplest question seem like the great question of all . Other teams were on the road , some returning , some going . A camp-meeting had come to be an annual amusement , like a circus , and young people from all over the country drove down on Sundays , as if to some celebration with fireworks . " There 's the lane , " said Milton . " See that team goin ' in ? " Ben pulled up and they looked at it doubtfully . It looked dangerously miry . It was quite dark now and Ben said :  --  " That 's a scaly piece of road . " " Oh , that 's all right . Hark ! " As they listened they could hear the voice of the exhorter nearly a mile away . It pushed across the cool spaces with a wild and savage sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing in the grass . Frogs with deepening chorus seemed to announce the coming of night , and above these peaceful sounds came the wild shouts of the far-off preacher , echoing through the cool green arches of the splendid grove . The girls became silent , as the voice grew louder . Lights appeared ahead , and the road led up a slight hill to a gate . Ben drove on under a grove of oaks , past dimly lighted tents , whose open flaps showed tumbled beds and tables laden with crockery . Heavy women were moving about inside , their shadows showing against the tent walls like figures in a pantomime . The young people alighted in curious silence . As they stood a moment , tying the team , the preacher lifted his voice in a brazen , clanging , monotonous reiteration of worn phrases . " Come to the Lord ! Come now ! Come to the light ! Jesus will give it ! Now is the appointed time ,  - -  come to the light ! " From a tent near by arose the groaning , gasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O my God ! " It was charged with the most piercing distress . It cut to the heart 's palpitating centre like a poniard thrust . It had murder and outrage in it . The girls clutched Ben and Milton . " Oh , let 's go home ! " " No , let 's go and see what it all is . " The girls hung close to the arms of the young men and they went down to the tent and looked in . It was filled with a motley throng of people , most of them seated on circling benches . A fringe of careless or scoffing onlookers stood back against the tent wall . Many of them were strangers to Ben . Occasionally a Norwegian farm-hand , or a bevy of young people from some near district , lifted the flap and entered with curious or laughing or insolent faces . The tent was lighted dimly by kerosene lamps , hung in brackets against the poles , and by stable lanterns set here and there upon the benches . Ben and Milton ushered the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls smiled , but only faintly . The undertone of women 's cries moved them in spite of their scorn of it all . " What cursed foolishness ! " said Ben to Milton . Milton smiled , but did not reply . He only nodded toward the exhorter , a man with a puffy jumble of features and the form of a gladiator , who was uttering wild and explosive phrases . " Oh , my friends ! I bless the Lord for the SHALL in the word . You SHALL get light . You SHALL be saved . Oh , the SHALL in the word ! You SHALL be redeemed ! " As he grew more excited , his hoarse voice rose in furious screams , as if he were defying hell 's legions . Foam lay on his lips and flew from his mouth . At every repetition of the word " shall " he struck the desk a resounding blow with his great palm . " He 's a hard hitter , " said Milton . At length he leaped , apparently in uncontrollable excitement , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the listening , moaning audience . He walked with a furious rhythmic , stamping action , like a Sioux in the war dance . Wild cries burst from his audience , antiphonal with his own . " He ' SHALL ' send light ! " " Send Thy arrows , O Lord . " " O God , come ! " " He ' SHALL ' keep His word ! " One old negro woman , fat , powerful , and gloomy , suddenly arose and uttered a scream that had the dignity and savagery of a mountain lion 's cry . It rang far out into the night . The exhorter continued his mad , furious , thumping , barbaric walk . Behind him a row of other exhorters sat , a relay ready to leap to his aid . They urged on the tumult with wild cries . " A-men , brother . " " YES , brother , YES ! " clapping their hands in rhythm . The exhorter redoubled his fury . He was like a jaded actor rising at applause , carried out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tossing hands there came at last certain recognizable features . The people were mainly farming folks of the more ignorant sort , rude in dress and bearing , hard and bent with toil . They were recognizably of a class subject to these low forms of religious excitement which were once well-nigh universal . The outer fringe continued to smile scornfully and to jest , yet they were awed , in a way , by this suddenly revealed deep of barbaric emotion . The girls were appalled by the increasing clangor . Milton was amused , but Ben grew bitter . Something strong came out in him , too . His lip curled in disgust . Suddenly , out of the level space of bowed shoulders , tossing hands , and frenzied , upturned faces , a young girl leaped erect . She was strong and handsome , powerful in the waist and shoulders . Her hair was braided like a child 's , and fell down her back in a single strand . Her head was girlish , but her face looked old and drawn and tortured . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ending in a quivering motion . The action grew to lightning-like quickness . Her head seemed to set in its socket . Her whole body stiffened . Gasping moans came from her clenched teeth as she fell to the ground and rolled under the seats , wallowing in the muddy straw and beating her feet upon the ground like a dying partridge . The people crowded about her , but the preacher , roared above the tumult :  --  " Si ' down ! Never mind that party . She 's all right ; she 's in the hands of the Lord ! " The people settled into their seats , and the wild tumult went on again . Ben rose to go over where the girl was and the others followed . A young man seated by the struggling sinner held her hand and fanned her with his hat , while some girl friends , scared and sobbing , kept the tossing limbs covered . She rolled from side to side restlessly , thrusting forth her tongue as if her throat were dry . She looked like a dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't something be done ? " " Her soul is burdened for you ! " cried a wild old woman to the impassive youth who clung to the frenzied girl 's hand . A moment later , as the demoniacal chorus of yells , songs , incantations , shrieks , groans , and prayers swelled high , a farmer 's wife on the left uttered a hoarse cry and stiffened and fell backward upon the ground . She rolled her head from side to side . Her eyes turned in ; her lips wore a maniac 's laugh , and her troubled brow made her look like the death mask of a tortured murderer , the hell horror frozen on it . She sank at last into a hideous calm , with her strained and stiffened hands pointing weirdly up . She was like marble . She did not move a hair 's breadth during the next two hours . Over to the left a young man leaped to his feet with a scream :  --  " Jesus , Jesus , JESUS ! " The great negress caught him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then leaped up and down , shrieking :  --  " O Jesus , come . Come , God 's Lamb ! " Around her a dozen women took up her cry . Most of them had no voices . Their horrifying screams had become hoarse hisses , yet still they strove . Scores of voices were mixed in the pandemonium of prayer . All order was lost . Three of the preachers now stood shouting before the mourners ' bench , two were in the aisles . One came down the aisle toward the girl with the braided hair . As he came he prayed . Foam was on his lips , but his eyes were cool and calculating ; they betrayed him . As he came he fixed his gaze upon a woman seated near the prostrate girl , and with a horrible outcry the victim leaped into the air and stiffened as if smitten with epilepsy . She fell against some scared boys , who let her fall , striking her head against the seats . She too rolled down upon the straw and lay beside her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Milton 's party retreated . They smiled no more ; they were horror-stricken . Squads of " workers " now moved down the aisles ; in one they surrounded two people , a tall , fair girl and a young man . " Why , it 's Grace ! " exclaimed Maud . Ben turned quickly , " Where ? " They pointed her out . " She ca n't get away . See ! Oh , boys , do n't let them --  " Ben pushed his way toward her , his face set in a fierce frown , bitter , desperate . Grace stood silently beside one of the elders ; a woman exhorter stood before her . Conrad , overawed , had fallen into a trembling stupor ; Grace was defenseless . The elder 's hand hovered over her head , on her face a deadly pallor had settled , her eyes were cast down , she breathed painfully and trembled from head to foot . She was about to fall , when Ben set his eyes upon her . " Get out o ' my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had oaths , his fists were like mauls . " Grace ! " he cried , and she heard . She looked up and saw him coming ; the red flamed over her face . The power of the preacher was gone . " Let me go , " she cried , trying to wring herself loose . " You are going to hell . You are lost if you do not --  " " God damn ye . Get out o ' way . I 'll kill ye if you lay a hand on her . " With one thrust Ben cleared her tormentor from her arm . For one moment the wordless young man looked into her eyes ; then she staggered toward him . He faced the preacher . " I 'd smash hell out o ' you for a leather cent , " he said . In the tumult his words were lost , but the look on his face was enough . The exhorter fell away . Their retreat was unnoted in the tumult . At the door they looked back for an instant at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all stages of induced catalepsy , one man with head flung back , one with his hands pointing , fixed in furious appeal . Another with bowed head was being worked upon by a brother of hypnotic appeal . He struck with downward , positive gestures on either side of the victim 's head . Over another the negress towered , screaming with panther-like ferocity :  --  " Git under de blood ! Git under de blood ! " As she screamed she struck down at the mourner with her clenched fist . On her face was the grin of a wildcat . Out under the cool , lofty oaks , the outcry was more inexpressibly hellish , because overhead the wind rustled the sweet green leaves , crickets were chirping , and the scent of flowering fields of buckwheat was in the air . Grace grew calmer , but she clung with strange weakness to her lover . She felt he had saved her from something , she did not know what , but it was something terrifying to look back upon . Conrad was forgotten -- set aside . Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace . He no longer hesitated , argued , or apologized . He had claimed his own . On the long ride home , Grace lay within his right arm , and the young man 's tongue was unchained . He talked , and his spirit grew tender and manly and husbandlike , as he told his plans and his hopes . Hell was very far away , and Heaven was very near . LUCRETIA BURNS I Lucretia Burns had never been handsome , even in her days of early girlhood , and now she was middle-aged , distorted with work and child-bearing , and looking faded and worn as one of the boulders that lay beside the pasture fence near where she sat milking a large white cow . She had no shawl or hat and no shoes , for it was still muddy in the little yard , where the cattle stood patiently fighting the flies and mosquitoes swarming into their skins , already wet with blood . The evening was oppressive with its heat , and a ring of just-seen thunderheads gave premonitions of an approaching storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , taking her pails of foaming milk , staggered toward the gate . The two pails hung from her lean arms , her bare feet slipped on the filthy ground , her greasy and faded calico dress showed her tired and swollen ankles , and the mosquitoes swarmed mercilessly on her neck and bedded themselves in her colorless hair . The children were quarrelling at the well , and the sound of blows could be heard . Calves were querulously calling for their milk , and little turkeys , lost in a tangle of grass , were piping plaintively . The sun just setting struck through a long , low rift , like a boy peeping beneath the eaves of a huge roof . Its light brought out Lucretia 's face as she leaned her sallow forehead on the top bar of the gate and looked toward the west . It was a pitifully worn , almost tragic face -- long , thin , sallow , hollow-eyed . The mouth had long since lost the power to shape itself into a kiss , and had a droop at the corners which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wail . The collarless neck and sharp shoulders showed painfully . She felt vaguely that the night was beautiful . The setting sun , the noise of frogs , the nocturnal insects beginning to pipe -- all in some way called her girlhood back to her , though there was little in her girlhood to give her pleasure . Her large gray eyes grew round , deep , and wistful as she saw the illimitable craggy clouds grow crimson , roll slowly up , and fire at the top . A childish scream recalled her . " Oh , my soul ! " she half groaned , half swore , as she lifted her milk and hurried to the well . Arriving there , she cuffed the children right and left with all her remaining strength , saying in justification :  --  " My soul ! ca n't you -- you young'uns , give me a minute 's peace ? Land knows , I 'm almost gone up ; washin ' , an ' milkin ' six cows , and tendin ' you , and cookin ' f'r him , ought ' o be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ' r I 'll slap your head off , you hateful thing ! Why ca n't you behave , when you know I 'm jest about dead ? " She was weeping now , with nervous weakness . " Where 's y'r pa ? " she asked after a moment , wiping her eyes with her apron . One of the group , the one cuffed last , sniffed out , in rage and grief :  --  " He 's in the corn-field ; where 'd ye s'pose he was ? " " Good land ! why do n't the man work all night ? Sile , you put that dipper in that milk agin , an ' I 'll whack you till your head 'll swim ! Sadie , le ' go Pet , an ' go ' n get them turkeys out of the grass ' fore it gits dark ! Bob , you go tell y'r dad if he wants the rest o ' them cows milked he 's got ' o do it himself . I jest ca n't , and what 's more , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained the milk and fed the children , she took some skimmed milk from the cans and started to feed the calves bawling strenuously behind the barn . The eager and unruly brutes pushed and struggled to get into the pails all at once , and in consequence spilt nearly all of the milk on the ground . This was the last trial ; the woman fell down on the damp grass and moaned and sobbed like a crazed thing . The children came to seek her and stood around like little partridges , looking at her in scared silence , till at last the little one began to wail . Then the mother rose wearily to her feet , and walked slowly back toward the house . She heard Burns threshing his team at the well , with the sound of oaths . He was tired , hungry , and ill-tempered , but she was too desperate to care . His poor , overworked team did not move quickly enough for him , and his extra long turn in the corn had made him dangerous . His eyes gleamed wrathfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he growled . " Yes , two hours ago . " " Well , I ca n't help it ! " he said , understanding her reproach . " That devilish corn is gettin ' too tall to plough again , and I 've got ' o go through it to-morrow or not at all . Cows milked ? " " Part of ' em . " " How many left ? " " Three . " " Hell ! Which three ? " " Spot , and Brin , and Cherry . " " Of course , left the three worst ones . I 'll be damned if I milk a cow to-night . I do n't see why you play out jest the nights I need ye most . " Here he kicked a child out of the way . " Git out o ' that ! Hai n't you got no sense ? I 'll learn ye --  " " Stop that , Sim Burns , " cried the woman , snatching up the child . " You 're a reg'lar ol ' hyeny ,  - -  that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her lethargy . " You 're a -- beauty , that 's what you are , " he said , pitilessly . " Keep your brats out f'um under my feet . " And he strode off to the barn after his team , leaving her with a fierce hate in her heart . She heard him yelling at his team in their stalls : " Git around there , damn yeh . " The children had had their supper ; so she took them to bed . She was unusually tender to them , for she wanted to make up in some way for her previous harshness . The ferocity of her husband had shown up her own petulant temper hideously , and she sat and sobbed in the darkness a long time beside the cradle where little Pet slept . She heard Burns come growling in and tramp about , but she did not rise . The supper was on the table ; he could wait on himself . There was an awful feeling at her heart as she sat there and the house grew quiet . She thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in her arms and sinking into a lake somewhere , where she would never more be troubled , where she could sleep forever , without toil or hunger . Then she thought of the little turkeys wandering in the grass , of the children sleeping at last , of the quiet , wonderful stars . Then she thought of the cows left unmilked , and listened to them stirring uneasily in the yard . She rose , at last , and stole forth . She could not rid herself of the thought that they would suffer . She knew what the dull ache in the full breasts of a mother was , and she could not let them stand at the bars all night moaning for relief . The mosquitoes had gone , but the frogs and katydids still sang , while over in the west Venus shone . She was a long time milking the cows ; her hands were so tired she had often to stop and rest them , while the tears fell unheeded into the pail . She saw and felt little of the external as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sweet it seemed the first time Sim came to see her ; of the many rides to town with him when he was an accepted lover ; of the few things he had given her -- a coral breastpin and a ring . She felt no shame at her present miserable appearance ; she was past personal pride . She hardly felt as if the tall , strong girl , attractive with health and hope , could be the same soul as the woman who now sat in utter despair listening to the heavy breathing of the happy cows , grateful for the relief from their burden of milk . She contrasted her lot with that of two or three women that she knew ( not a very high standard ) , who kept hired help , and who had fine houses of four or five rooms . Even the neighbors were better off than she , for they did n't have such quarrels . But she was n't to blame -- Sim didn't -- Then her mind changed to a dull resentment against " things . " Everything seemed against her . She rose at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , strained it , washed out the pails , and , after bathing her tired feet in a tub that stood there , she put on a pair of horrible shoes , without stockings , and crept stealthily into the house . Sim did not hear her as she slipped up the stairs to the little low unfinished chamber beside her oldest children . She could not bear to sleep near him that night , she wanted a chance to sob herself to quiet . As for Sim , he was a little disturbed , but would as soon have cut off his head as acknowledged himself in the wrong . As he went to bed , and found her still away , he yelled up the stairway :  --  " Say , old woman , ai n't ye comin ' to bed ? " Upon receiving no answer he rolled his aching body into the creaking bed . " Do as y ' damn please about it . If y ' want to sulk y ' can . " And in such wise the family grew quiet in sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceaseless chime of the crickets . II When Sim Burns woke the next morning he felt a sharper twinge of remorse . It was not a broad or well-defined feeling -- just a sense that he had been unduly irritable , not that on the whole he was not in the right . Little Pet lay with the warm June sunshine filling his baby eyes , curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed around his little mouth . The man thrust his dirty , naked feet into his huge boots , and , without washing his face or combing his hair , went out to the barn to do his chores . He was a type of the average prairie farmer , and his whole surrounding was typical of the time . He had a quarter-section of fine level land , bought with incredible toil , but his house was a little box-like structure , costing , perhaps , five hundred dollars . It had three rooms and the ever-present summer kitchen at the back . It was unpainted and had no touch of beauty ,  - -  a mere box . His stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked like a den , was low and long , and had but one door in the end . The cow-yard held ten or fifteen cattle of various kinds , while a few calves were bawling from a pen near by . Behind the barn , on the west and north , was a fringe of willows forming a " wind-break . " A few broken and discouraged fruit trees , standing here and there among the weeds , formed the garden . In short , he was spoken of by his neighbors as " a hard-working cuss , and tol'ably well fixed . " No grace had come or ever could come into his life . Back of him were generations of men like himself , whose main business had been to work hard , live miserably , and beget children to take their places when they died . His courtship had been delayed so long on account of poverty that it brought little of humanizing emotion into his life . He never mentioned his love-life now , or if he did , it was only to sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss his wife or even speak kindly to her . There was no longer any sanctity to life or love . He chewed tobacco and toiled on from year to year without any very clearly defined idea of the future . His life was mainly regulated from without . He was tall , dark , and strong , in a flat-chested , slouching sort of way , and had grown neglectful of even decency in his dress . He wore the American farmer 's customary outfit of rough brown pants , hickory shirt , and greasy wool hat . It differed from his neighbors ' mainly in being a little dirtier and more ragged . His grimy hands were broad and strong as the clutch of a bear , and he was a " terrible feller to turn off work , " as Councill said . " I 'd ruther have Sim Burns work for me one day than some men three . He 's a linger . " He worked with unusual speed this morning , and ended by milking all the cows himself as a sort of savage penance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  " Seems ' s if ever ' cussid thing piles on to me at once . That corn , the road-tax , and hayin ' comin ' on , and now she gits her back up --  " When he went back to the well he sloshed himself thoroughly in the horse-trough and went to the house . He found breakfast ready , but his wife was not in sight . The older children were clamoring around the uninviting breakfast table , spread with cheap ware and with boiled potatoes and fried salt pork as the principal dishes . " Where 's y'r ma ? " he asked , with a threatening note in his voice , as he sat down by the table . " She 's in the bedroom . " He rose and pushed open the door . The mother sat with the babe in her lap , looking out of the window down across the superb field of timothy , moving like a lake of purple water . She did not look around . She only grew rigid . Her thin neck throbbed with the pulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into you now ? " he said , brutally . " Do n't be a fool . Come out and eat breakfast with me , an ' take care o ' y'r young ones . " She neither moved nor made a sound . With an oath he turned on his heel and went out to the table . Eating his breakfast in his usual wolfish fashion , he went out into the hot sun with his team and riding-plough , not a little disturbed by this new phase of his wife 's " cantankerousness . " He ploughed steadily and sullenly all the forenoon , in the terrific heat and dust . The air was full of tempestuous threats , still and sultry , one of those days when work is a punishment . When he came in at noon he found things the same -- dinner on the table , but his wife out in the garden with the youngest child . " I c'n stand it as long as she can , " he said to himself , in the hearing of the children , as he pushed back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished the field of corn it was after sundown , and he came up to the house , hot , dusty , his shirt wringing wet with sweat , and his neck aching with the work of looking down all day at the corn-rows . His mood was still stern . The multitudinous lift , and stir , and sheen of the wide , green field had been lost upon him . " I wonder if she 's milked them cows , " he muttered to himself . He gave a sigh of relief to find she had . But she had done so not for his sake , but for the sake of the poor , patient dumb brutes . When he went to the bedroom after supper , he found that the cradle and his wife 's few little boxes and parcels -- poor , pathetic properties ! had been removed to the garret , which they called a chamber , and he knew he was to sleep alone again . " She 'll git over it , I guess . " He was very tired , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was oppressive . His shirt , wet in places , and stiff with dust in other places , oppressed him more than usual ; so he rose and removed it , getting a clean one out of a drawer . This was an unusual thing for him , for he usually slept in the same shirt which he wore in his day 's work ; but it was Saturday night , and he felt justified in the extravagance . * * * * * In the meanwhile poor Lucretia was brooding over her life in a most dangerous fashion . All she had done and suffered for Simeon Burns came back to her till she wondered how she had endured it all . All day long in the midst of the glorious summer landscape she brooded . " I hate him , " she thought , with a fierce blazing up through the murk of her musing . " I hate t ' live . But they ai n't no hope . I 'm tied down . I ca n't leave the children , and I ai n't got no money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I ai n't never seen anything an ' do n't know anything . " She was too simple and too unknowing to speculate on the loss of her beauty , which would have brought her competency once -- if sold in the right market . As she lay in her little attic bed , she was still sullenly thinking , wearily thinking of her life . She thought of a poor old horse which Sim had bought once , years before , and put to the plough when it was too old and weak to work . She could see her again as in a vision , that poor old mare , with sad head drooping , toiling , toiling , till at last she could no longer move , and lying down under the harness in the furrow , groaned under the whip ,  - -  and died . Then she wondered if her own numbness and despair meant death , and she held her breath to think harder upon it . She concluded at last , grimly , that she did n't care -- only for the children . The air was frightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low mutter of the rising storm in the west . She forgot her troubles a little , listening to the far-off gigantic footsteps of the tempest . Boom , boom , boom , it broke nearer and nearer , as if a vast cordon of cannon was being drawn around the horizon . Yet she was conscious only of pleasure . She had no fear . At last came the sweep of cool , fragrant storm-wind , a short and sudden dash of rain , and then in the cool , sweet hush which followed , the worn and weary woman fell into a deep sleep . III When she woke the younger children were playing about on the floor in their night-clothes , and little Pet was sitting in a square of sunshine , intent on one of his shoes . He was too young to know how poor and squalid his surroundings were ,  - -  the patch of sunshine flung on the floor glorified it all . He -- little animal -- was happy . The poor of the Western prairies lie almost as unhealthily close together as do the poor of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as little chance to escape close and tainting contact as in the coops and dens of the North End of proud Boston . In the midst of oceans of land , floods of sunshine and gulfs of verdure , the farmer lives in two or three small rooms . Poverty 's eternal cordon is ever round the poor . " Ma , why did n't you sleep with Pap last night ? " asked Bob , the seven-year-old , when he saw she was awake at last . She flushed a dull red . " You hush , will yeh ? Because -- I -- it was too warm -- and there was a storm comin ' . You never mind askin ' such questions . Is he gone out ? " " Yup . I heerd him callin ' the pigs . It 's Sunday , ai n't it , ma ? " The fact seemed to startle her . " Why , yes , so it is ! Wal ! Now , Sadie , you jump up an ' dress quick ' s y ' can , an ' Bob an ' Sile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she commanded , in nervous haste , beginning to dress . In the middle of the room there was scarce space to stand beneath the rafters . When Sim came in for his breakfast he found it on the table , but his wife was absent . " Where 's y'r ma ? " he asked , with a little less of the growl in his voice . " She 's upstairs with Pet . " The man ate his breakfast in dead silence , till at last Bob ventured to say :  --  " What makes ma ac ' so ? " " Shut up ! " was the brutal reply . The children began to take sides with the mother -- all but the oldest girl , who was ten years old . To her the father turned now for certain things to be done , treating her in his rough fashion as a housekeeper , and the girl felt flattered and docile accordingly . They were pitiably clad ; like many farm-children , indeed , they could hardly be said to be clad at all . Sadie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton and a faded calico dress , out of which her bare , yellow little legs protruded , lamentably dirty and covered with scratches . The boys also had two garments , a hickory shirt and a pair of pants like their father 's , made out of brown denim by the mother 's never-resting hands -- hands that in sleep still sewed , and skimmed , and baked , and churned . The boys had gone to bed without washing their feet , which now looked like toads , calloused , brown , and chapped . Part of this the mother saw with her dull eyes as she came down , after seeing the departure of Sim up the road with the cows . It was a beautiful Sunday morning , and the woman might have sung like a bird if men had been as kind to her as Nature . But she looked dully out upon the seas of ripe grasses , tangled and flashing with dew , out of which the bobolinks and larks sprang . The glorious winds brought her no melody , no perfume , no respite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw in the town ,  - -  children of the merchant and banker , clean as little dolls , the boys in knickerbocker suits , the girls in dainty white dresses ,  - -  and a vengeful bitterness sprang up in her heart . She soon put the dishes away , but felt too tired and listless to do more . " Taw-bay-wies ! Pet want ta-aw-bay-wies ! " cried the little one , tugging at her dress . Listlessly , mechanically she took him in her arms , and went out into the garden , which was fragrant and sweet with dew and sun . After picking some berries for him , she sat down on the grass under the row of cottonwoods , and sank into a kind of lethargy . A kingbird chattered and shrieked overhead , the grasshoppers buzzed in the grasses , strange insects with ventriloquistic voices sang all about her -- she could not tell where . " Ma , ca n't I put on my clean dress ? " insisted Sadie . " I do n't care , " said the brooding woman , darkly . " Leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , escaping all pain and weariness ! The wind sang in her ears ; the great clouds , beautiful as heavenly ships , floated far above in the vast , dazzling deeps of blue sky ; the birds rustled and chirped around her ; leaping insects buzzed and clattered in the grass and in the vines and bushes . The goodness and glory of God was in the very air , the bitterness and oppression of man in every line of her face . But her quiet was broken by Sadie , who came leaping like a fawn down through the grass . " Oh , ma , Aunt Maria and Uncle William are coming . They 've jest turned in . " " I do n't care if they be ! " she answered in the same dully irritated way . " What 're they comin ' here to-day for , I wan ' to know . " She stayed there immovably , till Mrs. Councill came down to see her , piloted by two or three of the children . Mrs. Councill , a jolly , large-framed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jovial voice . She made the mistake of taking the whole matter lightly ; her tone amounted to ridicule . " Sim says you 've been having a tantrum , Creeshy . Do n't know what for , he says . " " He do n't , " said the wife , with a sullen flash in her eyes . " He do n't know why ! Well , then , you just tell him what I say . I 've lived in hell long enough . I 'm done . I 've slaved here day in and day out f'r twelve years without pay , not even a decent word . I 've worked like no nigger ever worked ' r could work and live . I 've given him all I had , ' r ever expect to have . I 'm wore out . My strength is gone , my patience is gone . I 'm done with it ,  - -  that 's a part of what 's the matter . " " My sakes , Lucreeshy ! You must n't talk that way . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself on one palm and raised the other . " I 've got to talk that way . " She was ripe for an explosion like this . She seized upon it with eagerness . " They ai n't no use o ' livin ' this way , anyway . I 'd take poison if it wa' n't f'r the young ones . " " Lucreeshy Burns ! " " Oh , I mean it . " " Land sakes alive , I b'lieve you 're goin ' crazy ! " " I should n't wonder if I was . I 've had enough t ' drive an Indian crazy . Now you jest go off an ' leave me ' lone . I ai n't no mind to visit ,  - -  they ai n't no way out of it ' and I 'm tired o ' trying to find a way . Go off an ' let me be . " Her tone was so bitterly hopeless that the great , jolly face of Mrs. Councill stiffened into a look of horror such as she had not known for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard rioting . Bees were humming around the clover in the grass , and the kingbird chattered ceaselessly from the Lombardy poplar tip . Both women felt all this peace and beauty of the morning dimly , and it disturbed Mrs. Councill because the other was so impassive under it all . At last , after a long and thoughtful pause , Mrs. Councill asked a question whose answer she knew would decide it all -- asked it very kindly and softly :  --  " Creeshy , are you comin ' in ? " " No , " was the short and sullenly decisive answer . Mrs. Councill knew that was the end , and so rose with a sigh , and went away . " Wal , good-by , " she said , simply . Looking back , she saw Lucretia lying at length , with closed eyes and hollow cheeks . She seemed to be sleeping , half buried in the grass . She did not look up nor reply to her sister-in-law , whose life was one of toil and trouble also , but not so hard and helpless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she seemed comfortable . " Sim Burns , what you ben doin ' to that woman ? " she burst out , as she waddled up to where the two men were sitting under a cottonwood tree , talking and whittling after the manner of farmers . " Nawthin ' ' s fur ' s I know , " answered Burns , not quite honestly , and looking uneasy . " You need n't try t ' git out of it like that , Sim Burns , " replied his sister . " That woman never got into that fit f'r nawthin ' . " " Wal , if you know more about it than I do , whadgy ask me fur ? " he replied , angrily . " Tut , tut ! " put in Councill , " hold y'r horses ! Do n't git on y'r ear , children ! Keep cool , and do n't spile y'r shirts . Most likely you 're all t ' blame . Keep cool an ' swear less . " " Wal , I 'll bet Sim 's more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harder-workin ' woman in the hull State of Ioway than she is --  " " Except Marm Councill . " " Except nobody . Look at her , jest skin and bones . " Councill chuckled in his vast way . " That 's so , mother ; measured in that way , she leads over you . You git fat on it . " She smiled a little , her indignation oozing away . She never " could stay mad , " her children were accustomed to tell her . Burns refused to talk any more about the matter , and the visitors gave it up , and got out their team and started for home , Mrs. Councill firing this parting shot :  --  " The best thing you can do to-day is t ' let her alone . Mebbe the children ' ll bring her round ag'in . If she does come round , you see ' t you treat her a little more ' s y ' did when you was a-courtin ' her . " " This way , " roared Councill , putting his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he guffawed and clucked at his team . Burns took a measure of salt and went out into the pasture to salt the cows . On the sunlit slope of the field , where the cattle came running and bawling to meet him , he threw down the salt in handfuls , and then lay down to watch them as they eagerly licked it up , even gnawing a bare spot in the sod in their eagerness to get it all . Burns was not a drinking man ; he was hard-working , frugal ; in fact , he had no extravagances except his tobacco . His clothes he wore until they all but dropped from him ; and he worked in rain and mud , as well as dust and sun . It was this suffering and toiling all to no purpose that made him sour and irritable . He did n't see why he should have so little after so much hard work . He was puzzled to account for it all . His mind -- the average mind -- was weary with trying to solve an insoluble problem . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , were free with advice and suggestion as to the cause of his persistent poverty . Old man Bacon , the hardest-working man in the county , laid it to Burns 's lack of management . Jim Butler , who owned a dozen farms ( which he had taken on mortgages ) , and who had got rich by buying land at government price and holding for a rise , laid all such cases as Burns 's to " lack of enterprise , foresight . " But the larger number , feeling themselves in the same boat with Burns , said :  --  " I d ' know . Seems as if things get worse an ' worse . Corn an ' wheat gittin ' cheaper ' n ' cheaper . Machinery eatin ' up profits -- got to have machinery to harvest the cheap grain , an ' then the machinery eats up profits . Taxes goin ' up . Devil to pay all round ; I d ' know what in thunder is the matter . " The Democrats said protection was killing the farmers ; the Republicans said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there was n't circulating medium enough , and , in the midst of it all , hard-working , discouraged farmers , like Simeon Burns , worked on , unable to find out what really was the matter . And there , on this beautiful Sabbath morning , Sim sat and thought and thought , till he rose with an oath and gave it up . IV It was hot and brilliant again the next morning as Douglas Radbourn drove up the road with Lily Graham , the teacher of the school in the little white schoolhouse . It was blazing hot , even though not yet nine o'clock , and the young farmers ploughing beside the fence looked longingly and somewhat bitterly at Radbourn seated in a fine top-buggy beside a beautiful creature in lace and cambric . Very beautiful the town-bred " schoolma'am " looked to those grimy , sweaty fellows , superb fellows too , physically , with bare red arms and leather-colored faces . She was as if builded of the pink and white clouds soaring far up there in the morning sky . So cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , their dusty and sweaty shirts grew biting as the poisoned shirt of the Norse myth , their bare feet in the brown dirt grew distressingly flat and hoof-like , and their huge , dirty , brown , chapped and swollen hands grew so repulsive that the mere remote possibility of some time in the far future standing a chance of having an introduction to her , caused them to wipe their palms on their trousers ' legs stealthily . Lycurgus Banks swore when he saw Radbourn : " That cuss thinks he 's ol ' hell this morning . He do n't earn his living . But he 's just the kind of cuss to get holt of all the purty girls . " Others gazed with simple , sad wistfulness upon the slender figure , pale , sweet face , and dark eyes of the young girl , feeling that to have talk with such a fairylike creature was a happiness too great to ever be their lot . And when she had passed they went back to work with a sigh and feeling of loss . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people . She looked at this peculiar form of poverty and hardship much as the fragile , tender girl of the city looks upon the men laying a gas-main in the streets . She felt , sympathetically , the heat and grime , and , though but the faintest idea of what it meant to wear such clothing came to her , she shuddered . Her eyes had been opened to these things by Radbourn , a classmate at the Seminary . The young fellow knew that Lily was in love with him , and made distinct effort to keep the talk upon impersonal subjects . He liked her very much , probably because she listened so well . " Poor fellows , " sighed Lily , almost unconsciously , " I hate to see them working there in the dirt and hot sun . It seems a hopeless sort of life , does n't it ? " " Oh , but this is the most beautiful part of the year , " said Radbourn . " Think of them in the mud , in the sleet ; think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing ; think of them a month later in the harvest ; think of them imprisoned here in winter ! " " Yes , it 's dreadful ! But I never felt it so keenly before . You have opened my eyes to it . Of course , I 've been on a farm but not to live there . " " Writers and orators have lied so long about ' the idyllic ' in farm life , and said so much about the ' independent American farmer , ' that he himself has remained blind to the fact that he 's one of the hardest-working and poorest-paid men in America . See the houses they live in ,  - -  hovels . " " Yes , yes , I know , " said Lily ; a look of deeper pain swept over her face . " And the fate of the poor women ; oh , the fate of the women ! " " Yes , it 's a matter of statistics , " went on Radbourn , pitilessly , " that the wives of the American farmers fill our insane asylums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; no music , no books . Seventeen hours a day in a couple of small rooms -- dens . Now there is Sim Burns ! What a travesty of a home ! Yet there are a dozen just as bad in sight . He works like a fiend -- so does his wife -- and what is their reward ? Simply a hole to hibernate in and to sleep and eat in in summer . A dreary present and a well-nigh hopeless future . No , they have a future , if they knew it , and we must tell them . " " I know Mrs. Burns , " Lily said , after a pause ; " she sends several children to my school . Poor , pathetic little things , half-clad and wistful-eyed . They make my heart ache ; they are so hungry for love , and so quick to learn . " As they passed the Burns farm , they looked for the wife , but she was not to be seen . The children had evidently gone up to the little white schoolhouse at the head of the lane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not look at the girl ; his eyebrows were drawn into a look of gloomy pain . " It is n't so much the grime that I abhor , nor the labor that crooks their backs and makes their hands bludgeons . It 's the horrible waste of life involved in it all . I do n't believe God intended a man to be bent to plough-handles like that , but that is n't the worst of it . The worst of it is , these people live lives approaching automata . They become machines to serve others more lucky or more unscrupulous than themselves . What is the world of art , of music , of literature , to these poor devils ,  - -  to Sim Burns and his wife there , for example ? Or even to the best of these farmers ? " The girl looked away over the shimmering lake of yellow-green corn . A choking came into her throat . Her gloved hand trembled . " What is such a life worth ? It 's all very comfortable for us to say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they feel ? What do we know of their capacity for enjoyment of art and music ? They never have leisure or opportunity . The master is very glad to be taught by preacher , and lawyer , and novelist , that his slaves are contented and never feel any longings for a higher life . These people live lives but little higher than their cattle -- are forced to live so . Their hopes and aspirations are crushed out , their souls are twisted and deformed just as toil twists and deforms their bodies . They are on the same level as the city laborer . The very religion they hear is a soporific . They are taught to be content here that they may be happy hereafter . Suppose there is n't any hereafter ? " " Oh , do n't say that , please ! " Lily cried . " But I do n't know that there is , " he went on remorselessly , " and I do know that these people are being robbed of something more than money , of all that makes life worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all very well , but I prefer to have mine here ; then I 'm sure of it . " " What can we do ? " murmured the girl . " Do ? Rouse these people for one thing ; preach discontent , a noble discontent . " " It will only make them unhappy . " " No , it wo n't ; not if you show them the way out . If it does , it 's better to be unhappy striving for higher things , like a man , than to be content in a wallow like swine . " " But what is the way out ? " This was sufficient to set Radbourn upon his hobbyhorse . He outlined his plan of action : the abolition of all indirect taxes , the State control of all privileges the private ownership of which interfered with the equal rights of all . He would utterly destroy speculative holdings of the earth . He would have land everywhere brought to its best use , by appropriating all ground rents to the use of the state , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , but with only partial comprehension . As they neared the little schoolhouse , a swarm of midgets in pink dresses , pink sun-bonnets , and brown legs , came rushing to meet their teacher , with that peculiar devotion the children in the country develop for a refined teacher . Radbourn helped Lily out into the midst of the eager little scholars , who swarmed upon her like bees on a lump of sugar , till even Radbourn 's gravity gave way , and he smiled into her lifted eyes , an unusual smile , that strangely enough stopped the smile on her own lips , filling her face with a wistful shadow , and her breath came hard for a moment , and she trembled . She loved that cold , stern face , oh , so much ! and to have him smile was a pleasure that made her heart leap till she suffered a smothering pain . She turned to him to say :  --  " I am very thankful , Mr. Radbourn , for another pleasant ride , " adding in a lower tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me so much . I feel stronger and more hopeful . " " I 'm glad you feel so . I was afraid I was prosy with my land doctrine . " " Oh , no ! Indeed no ! You have given me a new hope ; I am exalted with the thought ; I shall try to think it all out and apply it . " And so they parted , the children looking on and slyly whispering among themselves . Radbourn looked back after a while , but the bare white hive had absorbed its little group , and was standing bleak as a tombstone and hot as a furnace on the naked plain in the blazing sun . " America 's pitiful boast ! " said the young radical , looking back at it . " Only a miserable hint of what it might be . " All that forenoon , as Lily faced her noisy group of barefooted children , she was thinking of Radbourn , of his almost fierce sympathy for these poor , supine farmers , hopeless and in some cases content in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who came to them as a revelation of exquisite neatness and taste ,  - -  whose very voice and intonation awed them . They noted , unconsciously of course , every detail . Snowy linen , touches of soft color , graceful lines of bust and side , the slender fingers that could almost speak , so beautifully flexile were they . Lily herself sometimes , when she shook the calloused , knotted , stiffened hands of the women , shuddered with sympathetic pain to think that the crowning wonder and beauty of God 's world should be so maimed and distorted from its true purpose . Even in the children before her she could see the inherited results of fruitless labor , and , more pitiful yet , in the bent shoulders of the older ones she could see the beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent ; and as these thoughts came to her , she clasped the wondering children to her side , with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them . " How is your mother to-day ? " she asked of Sadie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drab-colored table near the open window . " Purty well , " said Sadie , in a hesitating way . Lily was looking out , and listening to the gophers whistling as they raced to and fro . She could see Bob Burns lying at length on the grass in the pasture over the fence , his heels waving in the air , his hands holding a string which formed a snare . It was like fishing to young Izaak Walton . It was very still and hot , and the cheep and trill of the gophers and the chatter of the kingbirds alone broke the silence . A cloud of butterflies were fluttering about a pool near ; a couple of big flies buzzed and mumbled on the pane . " What ails your mother ? " Lily asked , recovering herself and looking at Sadie , who was distinctly ill at ease . " Oh , I du n no , " Sadie replied , putting one bare foot across the other . Lily insisted . " She ' n ' pa 's had an awful row --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what language ! " " I mean they quarrelled , an ' she do n't speak to him any more . " " Why , how dreadful ! " " An ' pa , he 's awful cross ; and she wo n't eat when he does , an ' I haf to wait on table . " " I believe I 'll go down and see her this noon , " said Lily to herself , as she divined a little of the state of affairs in the Burns family . V Sim was mending the pasture fence as Lily came down the road toward him . He had delayed going to dinner to finish his task , and was just about ready to go when Lily spoke to him . " Good morning , Mr. Burns . I am just going down to see Mrs. Burns . It must be time to go to dinner ,  - -  are n't you ready to go ? I want to talk with you . " Ordinarily he would have been delighted with the idea of walking down the road with the schoolma'am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that she knew all about his trouble , and , besides , he was not in good humor . " Yes , in a minnit -- soon 's I fix up this hole . Them shotes , I b'lieve , would go through a keyhole , if they could once get their snoots in . " He expanded on this idea as he nailed away , anxious to gain time . He foresaw trouble for himself . He could n't be rude to this sweet and fragile girl . If a man had dared to attack him on his domestic shortcomings , he could have fought . The girl stood waiting for him , her large , steady eyes full of thought , gazing down at him from the shadow of her broad-brimmed hat . " The world is so full of misery anyway , that we ought to do the best we can to make it less , " she said at last , in a musing tone , as if her thoughts had unconsciously taken on speech . She had always appealed to him strongly , and never more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction added to its power with him . He could find no words for reply , but picked up his hammer and nail-box , and slouched along the road by her side , listening without a word to her talk . " Christ was patient , and bore with his enemies . Surely we ought to bear with our -- friends , " she went on , adapting her steps to his . He took off his torn straw hat and wiped his face on his sleeve , being much embarrassed and ashamed . Not knowing how to meet such argument , he kept silent . " How is Mrs. Burns ! " said Lily at length , determined to make him speak . The delicate meaning in the emphasis laid on is did not escape him . " Oh , she 's all right -- I mean she 's done her work jest the same as ever . I do n't see her much --  " " I did n't know -- I was afraid she was sick . Sadie said she was acting strangely . " " No , she 's well enough -- but --  " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you , wo n't you ? " she pleaded . " Ca n't anybody help us . We 've got ' o fight it out , I s'pose , " he replied , a gloomy note of resentment creeping into his voice . " She 's ben in a devil of a temper f'r a week . " " Have n't you been in the same kind of a temper too ? " demanded Lily , firmly but kindly . " I think most troubles of this kind come from bad temper on both sides . Do n't you ? Have you done your share at being kind and patient ? " They had reached the gate now , and she laid her hand on his arm to stop him . He looked down at the slender gloved hand on his arm , feeling as if a giant had grasped him ; then he raised his eyes to her face , flushing a purplish red as he remembered his grossness . It seemed monstrous in the presence of this girl-advocate . Her face was like silver ; her eyes seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " he said at last , pushing by her . He could not have faced her glance another moment . His whole air conveyed the impression of destructive admission . Lily did not comprehend the extent of her advantage or she would have pursued it further . As it was she felt a little hurt as she entered the house . The table was set , but Mrs. Burns was nowhere to be seen . Calling her softly , the young girl passed through the shabby little living-room to the oven-like bedroom which opened off it , but no one was about . She stood for a moment shuddering at the wretchedness of the room . Going back to the kitchen , she found Sim about beginning on his dinner . Little Pet was with him ; the rest of the children were at the schoolhouse . " Where is she ? " " I d ' know . Out in the garden , I expect . She do n't eat with me now . I never see her . She do n't come near me . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpressibly and began to see more clearly the magnitude of the task she had set herself to do . But it must be done ; she felt that a tragedy was not far off . It must be averted . " Mr. Burns , what have you done ? What have you done ? " she asked in terror and horror . " Do n't lay it all to me ! She hai n't done nawthin ' but complain f'r ten years . I could n't do nothin ' to suit her . She was always naggin ' me . " " I do n't think Lucretia Burns would nag anybody . I do n't say you 're all to blame , but I 'm afraid you have n't acknowledged you were any to blame . I 'm afraid you 've not been patient with her . I 'm going out to bring her in . If she comes , will you say you were part to blame ? You need n't beg her pardon -- just say you 'll try to be better . Will you do it ? Think how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remained silent , and looked discouragingly rude . His sweaty , dirty shirt was open at the neck , his arms were bare , his scraggly teeth were yellow with tobacco , and his uncombed hair lay tumbled about on his high , narrow head . His clumsy , unsteady hands played with the dishes on the table . His pride was struggling with his sense of justice ; he knew he ought to consent , and yet it was so hard to acknowledge himself to blame . The girl went on in a voice piercingly sweet , trembling with pity and pleading . " What word can I carry to her from you ? I 'm going to go and see her . If I could take a word from you , I know she would come back to the table . Shall I tell her you feel to blame ? " The answer was a long time coming ; at last the man nodded an assent , the sweat pouring from his purple face . She had set him thinking ; her victory was sure . Lily almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she found Lucretia in her familiar , colorless , shapeless dress , picking berries in the hot sun , the mosquitoes biting her neck and hands . " Poor , pathetic , dumb sufferer ! " the girl thought as she ran up to her . She dropped her dish as she heard Lily coming , and gazed up into the tender , pitying face . Not a word was spoken , but something she saw there made her eyes fill with tears , and her throat swell . It was pure sympathy . She put her arms around the girl 's neck and sobbed for the first time since Friday night . Then they sat down on the grass under the hedge , and she told her story , interspersed with Lily 's horrified comments . When it was all told , the girl still sat listening . She heard Radbourn 's calm , slow voice again . It helped her not to hate Burns ; it helped her to pity and understand him . " You must remember that such toil brutalizes a man ; it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine nature must either adapt itself to its hard surroundings or die . Men who toil terribly in filthy garments day after day and year after year can not easily keep gentle ; the frost and grime , the heat and cold , will soon or late enter into their souls . The case is not all in favor of the suffering wives and against the brutal husbands . If the farmer 's wife is dulled and crazed by her routine , the farmer himself is degraded and brutalized . " As well as she could Lily explained all this to the woman , who lay with her face buried in the girl 's lap . Lily 's arms were about her thin shoulders in an agony of pity . " It 's hard , Lucretia , I know ,  - -  more than you can bear ,  - -  but you must n't forget what Sim endures too . He goes out in the storms and in the heat and dust . His boots are hard , and see how his hands are all bruised and broken by his work ! He was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The wife remained silent . " Mr. Radbourn says work , as things go now , does degrade a man in spite of himself . He says men get coarse and violent in spite of themselves , just as women do when everything goes wrong in the house ,  - -  when the flies are thick , and the fire wo n't burn , and the irons stick to the clothes . You see , you both suffer . Do n't lay up this fit of temper against Sim -- will you ? " The wife lifted her head and looked away . Her face was full of hopeless weariness . " It ai n't this once . It ai n't that ' t all . It 's having no let-up . Just goin ' the same thing right over ' n ' over -- no hope of anything better . " " If you had hope of another world --  " " Do n't talk that . I do n't want that kind o ' comfert . I want a decent chance here . I want ' o rest an ' be happy now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What should she say to the desperate woman ? " What 's the use ? We might jest as well die -- all of us . " The woman 's livid face appalled the girl . She was gaunt , heavy-eyed , nerveless . Her faded dress settled down over her limbs , showing the swollen knees and thin calves ; her hands , with distorted joints , protruded painfully from her sleeves . All about her was the ever recurring wealth and cheer of nature that knows no favor ,  - -  the bees and flies buzzing in the sun , the jay and the kingbird in the poplars , the smell of strawberries , the motion of lush grass , the shimmer of corn-blades tossed gayly as banners in a conquering army . Like a flash of keener light , a sentence shot across the girl 's mind : " Nature knows no title-deed . The bounty of her mighty hands falls as the sunlight falls , copious , impartial ; her seas carry all ships ; her air is for all lips , her lands for all feet . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was something in the girl 's voice that roused the woman . She turned her dull eyes upon the youthful face . Lily took her hand in both hers as if by a caress she could impart her own faith . " Look up , dear . When nature is so good and generous , man must come to be better , surely . Come , go in the house again . Sim is there ; he expects you ; he told me to tell you he was sorry . " Lucretia 's face twitched a little at that , but her head was bent . " Come ; you ca n't live this way . There is n't any other place to go to . " No , that was the bitterest truth . Where on this wide earth , with its forth-shooting fruits and grains , its fragrant lands and shining seas , could this dwarfed , bent , broken , middle-aged woman go ? Nobody wanted her , nobody cared for her . But the wind kissed her drawn lips as readily as those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to a queen . Lily had said all she could . Her heart ached with unspeakable pity and a sort of terror . " Do n't give up , Lucretia . This may be the worst hour of your life . Live and bear with it all for Christ 's sake , for your children 's sake . Sim told me to tell you he was to blame . If you will only see that you are both to blame and yet neither to blame , then you can rise above it . Try , dear ! " Something that was in the girl imparted itself to the wife , electrically . She pulled herself together , rose silently , and started toward the house . Her face was rigid , but no longer sullen . Lily followed her slowly , wonderingly . As she neared the kitchen door , she saw Sim still sitting at the table ; his face was unusually grave and soft . She saw him start and shove back his chair , saw Lucretia go to the stove and lift the tea-pot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby :  --  " Want some more tea ? " She had become a wife and mother again , but in what spirit the puzzled girl could not say . DADDY DEERING I They were threshing on Farmer Jennings 's place when Daddy made his very characteristic appearance . Milton , a boy of thirteen , was gloomily holding sacks for the measurer , and the glory of the October day was dimmed by the suffocating dust , and poisoned by the smarting beards and chaff which had worked their way down his neck . The bitterness of the dreaded task was deepened also by contrast with the gambols of his cousin Billy , who was hunting rats with Growler amid the last sheaves of the stack bottom . The piercing shrieks of Billy , as he clapped his hands in murderous glee , mingled now and again with the barking of the dog . The machine seemed to fill the world with its snarling boom , which became a deafening yell when the cylinder ran empty for a moment . It was nearly noon , and the men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how near dinner-time it was . The horses , dripping with sweat , and with patches of foam under their harness , moved round and round steadily to the cheery whistle of the driver . The wild , imperious song of the bell-metal cog-wheel had sung into Milton 's ears till it had become a torture , and every time he lifted his eyes to the beautiful far-off sky , where the clouds floated like ships , a lump of rebellious anger rose in his throat . Why should he work in this choking dust and deafening noise while the hawks could sail and sweep from hill to hill with nothing to do but play ? Occasionally his uncle , the feeder , smiled down upon him , his face black as a negro , great goggles of glass and wire-cloth covering his merry eyes . His great good-nature shone out in the flash of his white teeth , behind his dusky beard , and he tried to encourage Milton with his smile . He seemed tireless to the other hands . He was so big and strong . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded back the tears that came into his eyes , and would not let his uncle see how childish he was . A spectator riding along the road would have remarked upon the lovely setting for this picturesque scene -- the low swells of prairie , shrouded with faint , misty light from the unclouded sky , the flaming colors of the trees , the faint sound of cow-bells , and the cheery sound of the machine . But to be a tourist and to be a toiler in a scene like this are quite different things . They were anxious to finish the setting by noon , and so the feeder was crowding the cylinder to its limit , rolling the grain in with slow and apparently effortless swaying from side to side , half buried in the loose yellow straw . But about eleven o'clock the machine came to a stand , to wait while a broken tooth was being replaced , and Milton fled from the terrible dust beside the measuring spout , and was shaking the chaff out of his clothing , when he heard a high , snappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man , with a face completely masked in dust , was speaking to Mr. Jennings :  --  " Say , young man , I guess you 'll haf to send another man up here . It 's poorty stiff work f'r two ; yes , sir , poorty stiff . " " There , there ! I thought you 'd cry ' cavy , ' " laughed Mr. Jennings . " I told you it was n't the place for an old man . " " Old man , " snarled the figure in the straw . " I ai n't so old but I can daown you , sir ,  - -  yessir , condemmit , yessir ! " " I 'm your man , " replied Jennings , smiling up at him . The man rolled down the side of the stack , disappearing in a cloud of dust and chaff . When he came to light , Milton saw a tall , gaunt old man of sixty years of age , or older . Nothing could be seen but a dusty expanse of face , ragged beard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes half hid . Without waiting for ceremony , the men clenched . The crowd roared with laughter , for though Jennings was the younger , the older man was a giant still , and the struggle lasted for some time . He made a gallant fight , but his breath gave out , and he lay at last flat on his back . " I wish I was your age , young man , " he said ruefully , as he rose . " I 'd knock the heads o ' these young scamps t'gether ,  - -  yessir !  - -  I could do it , too ! " " Talk 's a good dog , uncle , " said a young man . The old man turned on him so ferociously that he fled . " Run , condemn yeh ! I own y ' can beat me at that . " His face was not unpleasant , though his teeth were mainly gone , and his skin the color of leather and wrinkled as a pan of cream . His eyes had a certain sparkle of fun that belied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift a boy clean off his feet . His frame was bent and thin , but of great height and breadth , bony and tough as hickory . At some far time vast muscles must have rolled on those giant limbs , but toil had bent and stiffened him . " Never been sick a day ' n my life ; no , sir ! " he said , in his rapid , rasping , emphatic way , as they were riding across the stubble to dinner . " And , by gol ! I c'n stand as long at the tail of a stacker as any man , sir . Dummed if I turn my hand for any man in the state ; no , sir ; no , sir ! But if I do two men 's works , I am goin ' to have two men 's pay -- that 's all , sir ! " Jennings laughed and said : " All right , uncle . I 'll send another man up there this afternoon . " The old man seemed to take a morbid delight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could stand all day at the tail of a stacker , tirelessly pushing the straw away with an indifferent air , as if it were all mere play . He measured the grain the next day , because it promised to be a noisier and dustier job than working in the straw , and it was in this capacity that Milton came to know and to hate him , and to associate him with that most hated of all tasks , the holding of sacks . To a twelve-year-old boy it seems to be the worst job in the world . All day , while the hawks wheel and dip in the glorious air , and the trees glow like banks of roses ; all day , while the younger boys are tumbling about the sunlit straw , to be forced to stand holding sacks , like a convict , was maddening . Daddy , whose rugged features , bent shoulders , and ragged cap loomed through the suffocating , blinding dust , necessarily came to seem like the jailer who held the door to freedom . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear , the old man 's cackling laugh was sure to rise above the howl of the cylinder . " Nem mind , sonny ! Chaff ai n't pizen ; dust wo n't hurt ye a mite . " And when Milton was unable to laugh , the old man tweaked his ear with his leathery thumb and finger . Then he shouted long , disconnected yarns , to which Milton could make neither head nor tail , and which grew at last to be inaudible to him , just as the steady boom and snarl of the great machine did . Then he fell to studying the old man 's clothes , which were a wonder to him . He spent a good deal of time trying to discover which were the original sections of the coat , and especially of the vest , which was ragged and yellow with age , with the cotton batting working out ; and yet Daddy took the greatest care of it , folding it carefully and putting it away during the heat of the day out of reach of the crickets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second day , was his habit of coming to breakfast . But he always earned all he got , and more too ; and , as it was probable that his living at home was frugal , Mrs. Jennings smiled at his thrift , and quietly gave him his breakfast if he arrived late , which was not often . He had bought a little farm not far away , and settled down into a mode of life which he never afterward changed . As he was leaving at the end of the third day , he said :  --  " Now , sir , if you want any bootcherin ' done , I 'm y'r man . I do n't turn m ' hand over f'r any man in the state ; no , sir ! I c'n git a hawg on the gambrils jest a leetle quicker'n any other man I ever see ; yes , sir ; by gum ! " " All right , uncle ; I 'll send for you when I 'm ready to kill . " II Hog-killing was one of the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Daddy was destined to be associated in the minds of Shep and Milton with another disagreeable job , that of building the fire and carrying water . It was very early on a keen , biting morning in November when Daddy came driving into the yard with his rude , long-runnered sled , one horse half his length behind the other in spite of the driver 's clucking . He was delighted to catch the boys behind in the preparation . " A-a-h-h-r-r-h-h ! " he rasped out , " you lazy vagabon 's ? Why ai n't you got that fire blazin ' ? What the devil do y ' mean , you rascals ! Here it is broad daylight , and that fire not built . I vum , sir , you need a thrashin ' , the whole kit an bilun ' of ye ; yessir ! Come , come , come ! hustle now , stir your boots ! hustle y'r boots -- ha ! ha ! ha ! " It was of no use to plead cold weather and damp chips . " What has that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , when I was your age , I could make a fire of green red-oak ; yessir ! Do n't talk to me of colds ! Stir your stumps and get warm , sir ! " The old man put up his horses ( and fed them generously with oats ) , and then went to the house to ask for " a leetle something hot -- mince pie or sassidge . " His request was very modest , but , as a matter of fact , he sat down and ate a very hearty breakfast , while the boys worked away at the fire under the big kettle . The hired man , under Daddy 's direction , drew the bob-sleighs into position on the sunny side of the corn-crib , and arranged the barrel at the proper slant , while the old man ground his knives , Milton turning the grindstone -- another hateful task , which Daddy 's stories could not alleviate . Daddy never finished a story . If he started in to tell about a horse trade , it infallibly reminded him of a cattle trade , and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him of some heavy snow-storm he had known . Each parenthesis outgrew its proper limits , till he forgot what should have been the main story . His stories had some compensation , for when he stopped to try to recollect where he was , the pressure on the grindstone was released . At last the water was hot , and the time came to seize the hogs . This was the old man 's great moment . He stood in the pen and shrieked with laughter while the hired men went rolling , one after the other , upon the ground , or were bruised against the fence by the rush of the burly swine . " You 're a fine lot , " he laughed . " Now , then , sir , grab ' im ! Why do n't ye nail ' im ? I vum , sir , if I could n't do better'n that , sir , I 'd sell out ; I would , sir , by gol ! Get out o ' the way ! " With a lofty scorn he waved aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled in one corner of the pen . And when the selected victim was rushing by him , his long arm and great bony hand swept out , caught him by the ear , and flung him upon his side , squealing with deafening shrillness . But in spite of his smiling concealment of effort , Daddy had to lean against the fence and catch his breath even while he boasted :  --  " I 'm an old codger , sir , but I 'm worth -- a dozen o ' you -- spindle-legged chaps ; dum me if I ai n't , sir ! " His pride in his ability to catch and properly kill a hog was as genuine as the old knight-errant 's pride in his ability to stick a knife into another steel-clothed brigand like himself . When the slain shote was swung upon the planking on the sled before the barrel , Daddy rested , while the boys filled the barrel with water from the kettle . There was always a weird charm about this stage of the work to the boys . The sun shone warm and bright in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white and voluminous , from the barrel ; the eaves dropped steadily ; the hens ventured near , nervously , but full of curiosity , while the men laughed and joked with Daddy , starting him off on long stories , and winking at each other when his back was turned . At last he mounted his planking , selecting Mr. Jennings to pull upon the other handle of the hog-hook . He considered he conferred a distinct honor in this selection . " The time 's been , sir , when I would n't thank any man for his help . No , sir , would n't thank ' im . " " What do you do with these things ? " asked one of the men , kicking two iron candlesticks which the old man laid conveniently near . " Scrape a hawg with them , sir . What do y ' s'pose , you numskull ? " " Well , I never saw anything --  " " You 'll have a chance mighty quick , sir . Grab ahold , sir ! Swing ' im around -- there ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one , two -- that 's right . " While he dipped the porker in the water , pulling with his companion rhythmically upon the hook , he talked incessantly , mixing up scraps of stories and boastings of what he could do , with commands of what he wanted the other man to do . " The best man I ever worked with . Now turn ' im , turn ' im ! " he yelled , reaching over Jennings 's wrist . " Grab under my wrist . There ! wo n't ye never learn how to turn a hawg ? Now out with ' im ! " was his next wild yell , as the steaming hog was jerked out of the water upon the planking . " Now try the hair on them ears ! Beautiful scald , " he said , clutching his hand full of bristles and beaming with pride . " Never see anything finer . Here , Bub , a pail of hot water , quick ! Try one of them candlesticks ! They ai n't no better scraper than the bottom of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-fangled scrapers ! I made a bet once with old Jake Ridgeway that I could scrape the hair off'n two hawgs , by gum , quicker'n he could one . Jake was blowin ' about a new scraper he had .... " Yes , yes , yes , dump it right into the barrel . Condemmit ! Ai n't you got no gumption ? ... So Sim Smith , he held the watch . Sim was a mighty good hand t ' work with ; he was about the only man I ever sawed with who did n't ride the saw . He could jerk a crosscut saw .... Now let him in again , now , he-ho , once again ! Rool him over now ; that foreleg needs a tech o ' water . Now out with him again ; that 's right , that 's right ! By gol , a beautiful scald as ever I see ! " Milton , standing near , caught his eye again . " Clean that ear , sir ! What the devil you standin ' there for ? " He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he scraped away -- hyare ! " he shouted suddenly , " do n't ruggle the skin like that ! Ca n't you see the way I do it ? Leave it smooth as a baby , sir -- yessir ! " He worked on in this way all day , talking unceasingly , never shirking a hard job , and scarcely showing fatigue at any moment . " I 'm short o ' breath a leetle , that 's all ; never git tired , but my wind gives out . Dum cold got on me , too . " He ate a huge supper of liver and potatoes , still working away hard at an ancient horse trade , and when he drove off at night , he had not yet finished a single one of the dozen stories he had begun . III But pitching grain and hog-killing were on the lower levels of his art , for above all else Daddy loved to be called upon to play the fiddle for dances . He " officiated " for the first time at a dance given by one of the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three generations ,  - -  but they seized the opportunity of helping Daddy and at the same time of relieving themselves of the trouble of furnishing the music while the rest danced . Milton attended this dance , and saw Daddy for the first time earning his money pleasantly . From that time on the associations around his personality were less severe , and they came to like him better . He came early , with his old fiddle in a time-worn white-pine box . His hair was neatly combed to the top of his long , narrow head , and his face was very clean . The boys all greeted him with great pleasure , and asked him where he would sit . " Right on that table , sir ; put a chair up there . " He took his chair on the kitchen-table as if it were a throne . He wore huge moccasins of moose-hide on his feet , and for special occasions like this added a paper collar to his red woollen shirt . He took off his coat and laid it across his chair for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but they obeyed him laughingly , and while they " formed on , " he sawed his violin and coaxed it up to concert pitch , and twanged it and banged it into proper tunefulness . " A-a-a-ll ready there ! " he rasped out , with prodigious force . " Everybody git into his place ! " Then , lifting one huge foot , he put the fiddle under his chin , and , raising his bow till his knuckles touched the strings , he yelled , " Already , G'LANG ! " and brought his foot down with a startling bang on the first note . Rye doodle duo , doodle doo . As he went on and the dancers fell into rhythm , the clatter of heavy boots seemed to thrill him with old-time memories , and he kept boisterous time with his foot , while his high , rasping nasal rang high above the confusion of tongues and heels and swaying forms . " Ladies ' gran ' change ! Four hands round ! Balance all ! Elly-man left ! Back to play-cis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he saw all that went on in some miraculous way . " First lady lead to the right -- toodle rum rum ! Gent foller after ( step along thar ) ! Four hands round --  " The boys were immensely pleased with him . They delighted in his antics rather than in his tunes , which were exceedingly few and simple . They seemed never to be able to get enough of one tune which he called " Honest John , " and which he played in his own way , accompanied by a chant which he meant , without a doubt , to be musical . " HON-ers tew your pardners -- tee teedle deedle dee dee dee dee ! Stand up straight an ' put on your style ! Right an ' left four --  " The hat was passed by the floor-manager during the evening , and Daddy got nearly three dollars , which delighted Milton very much . At supper he insisted on his prerogative , which was to take the prettiest girl out to supper . " Look-a-here , Daddy , ai n't that crowdin ' the mourners ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that , sir ? No , sir ! Always done it , in Michigan and Yark State both ; yes , sir . " He put on his coat ceremoniously , while the tittering girls stood about the room waiting . He did not delay . His keen eyes had made selection long before , and , approaching Rose Watson with old-fashioned , elaborate gallantry , he said : " May I have the pleasure ? " and marched out triumphantly , amidst shouts of laughter . His shrill laugh rang high above the rest at the table , as he said : " I 'm the youngest man in this crowd , sir ! Demmit , I bet a hat I c'n dance down any man in this crowd ; yes , sir . The old man can do it yet . " They all took sides in order to please him . " I 'll bet he can , " said Hugh McTurg ; " I 'll bet a dollar on Daddy . " " I 'll take the bet , " said Joe Randall , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing after supper . " All right , sir ; any time , sir . I 'll let you know the old man is on earth yet . " While the girls were putting away the supper dishes , the young man lured Daddy out into the yard for a wrestling-match , but some others objected . " Oh , now , that wo n't do ! If Daddy was a young man --  " " What do you mean , sir ? I am young enough for you , sir . Just let me get ahold o ' you , sir , and I 'll show you , you young rascal ! you dem jackanapes ! " he ended , almost shrieking with rage , as he shook his fist in the face of his grinning tormentors . His friends held him back with much apparent alarm , and ordered the other fellows away . " There , there , Daddy , I would n't mind him ! I would n't dirty my hands on him ; he ai n't worth it . Just come inside , and we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and , having surrendered his violin to Hugh McTurg , was ready for the contest . As he stepped into the middle of the room he was not altogether ludicrous . His rusty trousers were bagged at the knee , and his red woollen stockings showed between the tops of his moccasins and his pantaloon legs , and his coat , utterly characterless as to color and cut , added to the stoop in his shoulders ; and yet there was a rude sort of grace and a certain dignity about his bearing which kept down laughter . They were to have a square dance of the old-fashioned sort . " Farrm on , " he cried , and the fiddler struck up the first note of the Virginia Reel . Daddy led out Rose , and the dance began . He straightened up till his tall form towered above the rest of the boys like a weather-beaten pine tree , as he balanced and swung and led and called off the changes with a voice full of imperious command . The fiddler took a malicious delight toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that put the old man on his mettle . " Go it , ye young rascal ! " he yelled . He danced like a boy and yelled like a demon , catching a laggard here and there , and hurling them into place like tops , while he kicked and stamped , wound in and out and waved his hands in the air with a gesture which must have dated back to the days of Washington . At last , flushed , breathless , but triumphant , he danced a final breakdown to the tune of " Leather Breeches , " to show he was unsubdued . IV But these rare days passed away . As the country grew older it lost the wholesome simplicity of pioneer days , and Daddy got a chance to play but seldom . He no longer pleased the boys and girls -- his music was too monotonous and too simple . He felt this very deeply . Once in a while he broke forth in protest against the changes . " The boys I used to trot on m ' knee are gittin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Deering , and then the preachers are gittin ' thick , and howlin ' agin dancin ' , and the country 's filling up with Dutchmen , so't I 'm left out . " As a matter of fact , there were few homes now where Daddy could sit on the table , in his ragged vest and rusty pantaloons , and play " Honest John , " while the boys thumped about the floor . There were few homes where the old man was even a welcome visitor , and he felt this rejection keenly . The women got tired of seeing him about , because of his uncleanly habits of spitting , and his tiresome stories . Many of the old neighbors died or moved away , and the young people went West or to the cities . Men began to pity him rather than laugh at him , which hurt him more than their ridicule . They began to favor him at threshing or at the fall hog-killing . " Oh , you 're getting old , Daddy ; you 'll have to give up this heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , why , all right ! Like to have you do it , but I guess we 'll have to have a man to do the heavy lifting , I s'pose . " " I s'pose not , sir ! I am jest as able to yank a hawg as ever , sir ; yes , sir , demmit -- demmit ! Do you think I 've got one foot in the grave ? " Nevertheless , Daddy often failed to come to time on appointed days , and it was painful to hear him trying to explain , trying to make light of it all . " M ' caugh would n't let me sleep last night . A goldum leetle , nasty , ticklin ' caugh , too ; but it kept me awake , fact was , an ' well , m ' wife , she said I had n't better come . But do n't you worry , sir ; it wo n't happen again , sir ; no , sir . " His hands got stiffer year by year , and his simple tunes became practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the fiddle was laid away almost altogether , for his left hand got caught in the cog-wheels of the horse-power , and all four of the fingers on that hand were crushed . Thereafter he could only twang a little on the strings . It was not long after this that he struck his foot with the axe and lamed himself for life . As he lay groaning in bed , Mr. Jennings went in to see him and tried to relieve the old man 's feelings by telling him the number of times he had practically cut his feet off , and said he knew it was a terrible hard thing to put up with . " Gol dummit , it ai n't the pain , " the old sufferer yelled , " it 's the dum awkwardness . I 've chopped all my life ; I can let an axe in up to the maker 's name , and hew to a hair-line ; yes , sir ! It was jest them dum new mittens my wife made ; they was s ' slippery , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one accident hinged upon the other . It was the failure of his left hand , with its useless fingers , to do its duty , that brought the axe down upon his foot . The pain was not so much physical as mental . To think that he , who could hew to a hair-line , right and left hand , should cut his own foot like a ten-year-old boy -- that scared him . It brought age and decay close to him . For the first time in his life he felt that he was fighting a losing battle . A man like this lives so much in the flesh , that when his limbs begin to fail him everything else seems slipping away . He had gloried in his strength . He had exulted in the thrill of his life-blood and in the swell of his vast muscles ; he had clung to the idea that he was strong as ever , till this last blow came upon him , and then he began to think and to tremble . When he was able to crawl about again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and morose , snapping and snarling at all that came near him , like a wounded bear . He was alone a great deal of the time during the winter following his hurt . Neighbors seldom went in , and for weeks he saw no one but his hired hand , and the faithful , dumb little old woman , his wife , who moved about without any apparent concern or sympathy for his suffering . The hired hand , whenever he called upon the neighbors , or whenever questions were asked , said that Daddy hung around over the stove most of the time , paying no attention to any one or anything . " He ai n't dangerous ' t all , " he said , meaning that Daddy was not dangerously ill . Milton rode out from school one winter day with Bill , the hand , and was so much impressed with his story of Daddy 's condition that he rode home with him . He found the old man sitting bent above the stove , wrapped in a quilt , shivering and muttering to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed scarcely to comprehend what he said . Milton was much alarmed at the terrible change , for the last time he had seen him he had towered above him , laughingly threatening to " warm his jacket , " and now here he sat , a great hulk of flesh , his mind flickering and flaring under every wind of suggestion , soon to go out altogether . In reply to questions he only muttered with a trace of his old spirit : " I 'm all right . Jest as good a man as I ever was , only I 'm cold . I 'll be all right when spring comes , so ' t I c'n git outdoors . Somethin ' to warm me up , yessir ; I 'm cold , that 's all . " The young fellow sat in awe before him , but the old wife and Bill moved about the room , taking very little interest in what the old man said or did . Bill at last took down the violin . " I 'll wake him up , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now watch ' im . " " Oh , do n't do that ! " Milton said in horror . But Bill drew the bow across the strings with the same stroke that Daddy always used when tuning up . He lifted his head as Bill dashed into " Honest John , " in spite of Milton 's protest . He trotted his feet after a little and drummed with his hands on the arms of his chair , then smiled a little in a pitiful way . Finally he reached out his right hand for the violin and took it into his lap . He tried to hold the neck with his poor , old , mutilated left hand , and burst into tears . " Do n't you do that again , Bill , " Milton said . " It 's better for him to forget that . Now you take the best care of him you can to-night . I do n't think he 's going to live long ; I think you ought to go for the doctor right off . " " Oh , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't sick , he 's jest old , that 's all , " replied Bill , brutally . And the old lady , moving about without passion and without speech , seemed to confirm this ; and yet Milton was unable to get the picture of the old man out of his mind . He went home with a great lump in his throat . * * * * * The next morning , while they were at breakfast , Bill burst wildly into the room . " Come over there , all of you ; we want you . " They all looked up much scared . " What 's the matter , Bill ? " " Daddy 's killed himself , " said Bill , and turned to rush back , followed by Mr. Jennings and Milton . While on the way across the field Bill told how it all happened . " He would n't go to bed , the old lady could n't make him , and when I got up this morning I did n't think nothin ' about it . I s'posed , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I was going out to the barn I stumbled across something in the snow , and I felt around , and there he was . He got hold of my revolver someway . It was on the shelf by the washstand , and I s'pose he went out there so ' t we would n't hear him . I dass n't touch him , " he said , with a shiver ; " and the old woman , she jest slumped down in a chair an ' set there -- would n't do a thing -- so I come over to see you . " Milton 's heart swelled with remorse . He felt guilty because he had not gone directly for the doctor . To think that the old sufferer had killed himself was horrible and seemed impossible . The wind was blowing the snow , cold and dry , across the yard , but the sun shone brilliantly upon the figure in the snow as they came up to it . There Daddy lay . The snow was in his scant hair and in the hollow of his wide , half-naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no mark upon him , and Milton 's heart leaped with quick relief . It was delirium , not suicide . There was a sort of majesty in the figure half buried in the snow . His hands were clenched , and there was a frown of resolution on his face , as if he had fancied Death coming , and had gone defiantly forth to meet him . A STOP-OVER AT TYRE I Albert Lohr was studying the motion of the ropes and lamps , and listening to the rumble of the wheels and the roar of the ferocious wind against the pane of glass that his head touched . It was the midnight train from Marion rushing toward Warsaw like some savage thing unchained , creaking , shrieking , and clattering through the wild storm which possessed the whole Mississippi Valley . Albert lost sight of the lamps at last , and began to wonder what his future would be . " First I must go through the university at Madison ; then I 'll study law , go into politics , and perhaps some time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wonderful city . As a Western boy , Boston to him was historic , New York was the great metropolis , but Washington was the great American city , and political greatness the only fame . The car was nearly empty : save here and there the wide-awake Western drummer , and a woman with four fretful children , the train was as deserted as it was frightfully cold . The engine shrieked warningly at intervals , the train rumbled hollowly over short bridges and across pikes , swung round the hills , and plunged with wild warnings past little towns hid in the snow , with only here and there a light shining dimly . One of the drummers now and then rose up from his cramped bed on the seats , and swore cordially at the railway company for not heating the cars . The woman with the children inquired for the tenth time , " Is the next station Lodi ? " " Yes , ma'am , it is , " snarled the drummer , as he jerked viciously at the strap on his valise ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell yeh ! I 'll be stiff as a car-pin if I stay in this infernal ice-chest another hour . I wonder what the company think --  " At Lodi several people got on , among them a fat man with a pretty daughter , who appeared to be abnormally wide awake -- considering the time of night . She saw Albert for the same reason that he saw her -- they were both young and good-looking . The student began his musings again , modified by this girl 's face . He had left out the feminine element ; obviously he must recapitulate . He 'd study law , yes ; but that would not prevent going to sociables and church fairs . And at these fairs the chances were good for a meeting with a girl . Her father must be influential -- county judge or district attorney . Marriage would open new avenues --  He was roused by the sound of his own name . " Is Albert Lohr in this car ? " shouted the brakeman , coming in , enveloped in a cloud of fine snow . " Yes , here ! " called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Albert snatched the envelope with a sudden fear of disaster at home ; but it was dated " Tyre " : " Get off at Tyre . I 'll be there . " HARTLEY . " " Well , now , that 's fun ! " said Albert , looking at the brakeman . " When do we reach there ? " " About 2.20 . " " Well , by thunder ! A pretty time o ' night ! " The brakeman grinned sympathetically . " Any answer ? " he asked , at length . " No ; that is , none that will do the matter justice . " " Hartley friend o ' yours ? " " Yes ; know him ? " " Yes ; he boarded where I did in Warsaw . " When he came back again , the brakeman said to Albert , in a hesitating way : " Ai n't going t ' stop off long , I s'pose ? " " May an ' may not ; depends on Hartley . Why ? " " Well , I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' like t ' send her one when I can . If you should happen to stay a few days , go an ' see her . She sets up first-class grub , an ' it would n't kill anybody , anyhow , if you went up an ' called . " " Course not . If I stay long enough to make it pay I 'll look her up sure . I 'm no Vanderbilt . I ca n't afford to stop at two-dollar-a-day hotels . " The brakeman sat down opposite , encouraged by Albert 's smile . " Y ' see , my division ends at Warsaw , and I run back and forth here every other day , but I do n't get much chance to see them , and I ai n't worth a cuss f'r letter-writin ' . Y ' see , she 's only aunt by marriage , but I like her ; an ' I guess she 's got about all she can stand up under , an ' so I like t ' help her a little when I can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' that left the old lady t ' rustle f'r her livin ' . Dummed if she ai n't sandy as old Sand . They 're gitt'n ' along purty --  " The whistle blew for brakes , and , seizing his lantern , the brakeman slammed out on the platform . " Tough night for twisting brakes , " suggested Albert , when he came in again . " Yes -- on the freight . " " Good heavens ! I should say so . They do n't run freight such nights as this ? " " Do n't they ? Well , I guess they do n't stop for a storm like this if they 's any money to be made by sending her through . Many 's the night I 've broke all night on top of the old wooden cars , when the wind was sharp enough to shear the hair off a cast-iron mule -- woo-o-o ! There 's where you need grit , old man , " he ended , dropping into familiar speech . " Yes ; or need a job awful bad . " The brakeman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right . A fellow do n't take that kind of a job for the fun of it . Not much ! He takes it because he 's got to . That 's as sure 's you 're a foot high . I tell you , a feller 's got t ' rustle these days if he gits any kind of a job --  " " Toot , too-o-o-o-t , toot ! " The station passed , the brakeman did not return , perhaps because he found some other listener , perhaps because he was afraid of boring this pleasant young fellow . Albert shuddered with a sympathetic pain as he thought of the heroic fellows on the tops of icy cars , with hands straining at frosty brakes , the wind cutting their faces like a sand-blast . Oh , those tireless hands at the wheel and throttle !  --  He looked at his watch ; it was two o'clock ; the next station was Tyre . As he began to get his things together , the brakeman again addressed him : " Oh , I forgot to say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say I sent yeh , and it 'll be all right . " " Sure ! I 'll try her in the morning -- that is , if I find out I 'm going to stay . " Albert clutched his valise , and pulled his cap firmly down on his head . " Here goes ! " he muttered . " Hold y'r breath ! " shouted the brakeman . Albert swung himself to the platform before the station -- a platform of planks along which the snow was streaming like water . " Good-night ! " shouted the brakeman . " Good-night ! " " All-l abo-o-o-ard ! " called the conductor somewhere in the storm . The brakeman swung his lantern , the train drew off into the blinding whirl , and its lights were soon lost in the clouds of snow . No more desolate place could well be imagined . A level plain , apparently bare of houses , swept by a ferocious wind ; a dingy little den called a station -- no other shelter in sight ; no sign of life save the dull glare of two windows to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert 's heart contracted with a sudden fear ; the outlook was appalling . " Where 's the town ? " he asked of a dimly seen figure with a lantern -- a man evidently locking the station door , his only refuge . " Over there , " was the surly reply . " How far ? " " ' Bout a mile . " " A mile ! " " That 's what I said -- a mile . " " Well , I 'll be blanked ! " " Well , y ' better be doing something besides standing here , ' r y ' ' ll freeze t ' death . I 'd go over to the Arteeshun House an ' go t ' bed if I was in your fix . " " Well , where is the Artesian House ? " " See them lights ? " " I see them lights . " " Well , they 're it . " " Oh , would n't your grammar make Old Grammaticuss curl up , though ! " " What say ? " queried the man bending his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow that streamed against them both . " I said I guessed I 'd try it , " grinned the youth , invisibly . " Well , I would if I was in your fix . Keep right close after me ; they 's some ditches here , and the foot-bridges are none too wide . " " The Artesian is owned by the railway , eh ? " " Yup . " " And you 're the clerk ? " " Yup ; nice little scheme , ai n't it ? " " Well , it 'll do , " replied Albert . The man laughed without looking around . In the little bar-room , lighted by a vilely smelling kerosene lamp , the clerk , hitherto a shadow and a voice , came to light as a middle-aged man with a sullen face slightly belied by a sly twinkle in his eyes . " This beats all the winters I ever did see . It do n't do nawthin ' but blow , blow . Want to go to bed , I s'pose . Well , come along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to get more light out of it . " Dummed if a white bean would n't be better . " " Spit on it ! " suggested Albert . " I 'd throw the whole business out o ' the window for a cent ! " growled the man . " Here 's y'r cent , " said the boy . " You 're mighty frisky f'r a feller gitt'n ' off'n a midnight train , " replied the man , as he tramped along a narrow hallway . He spoke in a voice loud enough to awaken every sleeper in the house . " Have t ' be , or there 'd be a pair of us . " " You 'll laugh out o ' the other side o ' y'r mouth when you saw away on one o ' the bell-collar steaks this house puts up , " ended the clerk , as he put the lamp down . " Sufficient unto the morn is the evil thereof , ' " called Albert after him . He was awakened the next morning by the cooks pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty . It was a vile place at any time , but on a morning like this it was appalling . The water was frozen , the floor like ice , the seven-by-nine glass frosted so that he could n't see to comb his hair . " All that got me out of bed , " he remarked to the clerk , " was the thought of leaving . " The breakfast was incredibly bad -- so much worse than he expected that Albert was forced to admit he had never seen its like . He fled from the place without a glance behind , and took passage in an omnibus for the town , a mile away . It was terribly cold , the thermometer registering twenty below zero ; but the sun was very brilliant , and the air still . The driver pulled up before a very ambitious wooden hotel entitled " The Eldorado , " and Albert dashed in at the door and up to the stove , with both hands covering his ears . As he stood there , frantic with pain , kicking his toes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly , insulting chuckle -- turned , and saw Hartley standing in the doorway , visibly exulting over his misery . " Hello , Bert ! that you ? " " What 's left of me . Say , you 're a good one , you are ? Why did n't you telegraph me at Marion ? A deuce of a night I 've had of it ! " " Do ye good , " laughed Hartley , a tall , alert , handsome fellow nearly thirty years of age . After a short and vigorous " blowing up , " Albert asked : " Well , now , what 's the meaning of all this , anyhow ? Why this change from Racine ? " " Well , you see , I got wind of another fellow going to work this county for a Life of Logan , and thinks I , ' By jinks ! I 'd better drop in ahead of him with Blaine 's Twenty Tears . ' I telegraphed f'r territory , got it , and telegraphed to stop you . " " You did it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock . " Albert was getting warmer and better-natured . " Well , I 'm here ; what are you going t ' do with me ? " " I 'll use you some way . First thing is to find a boarding-place where we can work in a couple o ' books on the bill . " " Well , I do n't know about that , but I 'm going to look up a place a brakeman gave me a pointer on . " " All right ; here goes ! " Scarcely any one was stirring on the streets . The wind was pitilessly cold , though not strong . The snow under their feet cried out with a note like glass and steel . The windows of the stores were thick with frost , and Albert shivered with a sense of homelessness . He had never experienced anything like this before . " I do n't want much of this , " he muttered , through his scarf . Mrs. Welsh lived in a large frame house standing on the edge of a bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on the meadow-land , where the river lay blue and hard as steel . A pale little girl , ten or twelve years of age , opened the door . " Is this where Mrs. Welsh lives ? " " Yes , sir . " " Will you ask her to come here a moment ? " " Yes , sir , " piped the little one . " Wo n't you come in and sit down by the fire ? " she added , with a quaint air of hospitality . The room was the usual village sitting-room . A cylinder heater full of wood stood at one side of it . A rag carpet , much faded , covered the floor . The paper on the wall was like striped candy , and the chairs were nondescript ; but everything was clean -- worn more with brushing than with use . A slim woman of fifty , with hollow eyes and a patient smile , came in , wiping her hands on her apron . " How d'ye do ? Did you want to see me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is , we 're book agents , and looking for a place to board . " " Well -- a -- I -- yes , I keep boarders . " " I was sent here by a brakeman on the midnight express , " put in Bert , " Oh , Tom , " said the woman , her face clearing . " Tom 's always sending us people . Why , yes ; I 've got room for you , I guess -- this room here . " She pushed open a folding door leading into what had been her parlor . " You can have this . " " And the price ? " " Four dollars . " " Eight dollars f'r the two of us . All right ; we 'll be with you a week or two if we have luck . " Mrs. Welsh smiled . " Excuse me , wo n't you ? I 've got to be at my baking ; make y'rselves at home . " Bert remarked how much she looked like his own mother in the back . She had the same tired droop in the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Certainly . I feel at home already , " replied Bert . " Now , Jim , " he said , after she left the room , " I 'm going t ' stay right here while you go and order our trunks around -- just t ' pay you off f'r last night . " " All right , " said Hartley cheerily , going out . After getting warm , Bert returned to the sitting-room , and sat down at the parlor organ and played a gospel hymn or two from the Moody and Sankey hymnal . He was in the midst of the chorus of Let Your Lower Lights , etc. , when a young woman entered the room . She had a whisk-broom in her hand , and stood a picture of gentle surprise . Bert wheeled about on his stool . " I thought it was Stella , " she began . " I 'm a book agent , " Bert explained . " I might as well out with it . There are two of us . Come here to board . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was very fair and very slight , almost frail . Her eyes were of the sunniest blue , her face pale and somewhat thin , but her lips showed scarlet , and her teeth were fine . Bert liked her and smiled . " A book agent is the next thing to a burglar , I know ; but still --  " " Oh , I did n't mean that , but I was surprised . When did you come ? " " Just a few moments ago . Am I in your way ? " he inquired , with elaborate solicitude . " Oh no ! Please go on . You play very well . It is seldom young men play at all . " " I had to at college ; the other fellows all wanted to sing . You play , of course . " " When I have time . " She sighed . There was a weary droop in her voice ; she seemed aware of it , and said more brightly : " You mean Madison , I suppose ? " " Yes ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there two years . Then I had to quit and come home to help mother . " " Did you ? That 's why I 'm out here on this infernal book business -- to get money to go on with . " She looked at him with interest now , noticing his fine eyes and waving brown hair . " It 's dreadful , is n't it ? But you 've got a hope to go back . I have n't . " She ended with a sigh , a far-off expression in her eyes . " It almost killed me to give it up . I do n't s'pose I 'd know any of the scholars you know . Even the teachers are not the same . Oh , yes -- Sarah Shaw ; I think she 's back for the normal course . " " Oh yes ! " exclaimed Bert , " I know Sarah . We boarded on the same street ; used t ' go home together after class . An awful nice girl , too . " " She 's a worker . She teaches school . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " There was another pause , broken by the little girl , who called : " Maud , mamma wants you . " Maud rose and went out , with a tired smile on her face that emphasized her resemblance to her mother . Bert could n't forget that smile , and he was still thinking about the girl , and what her life must be , when Hartley came in . " By jinks ! It 's snifty , as dad used to say . You ca n't draw a long breath through your nostrils without freezing y'r nose solid as a bottle , " he announced , throwing off his coat . " By-the-way , I 've just found out why you was so anxious to get into this house . Another case o ' girl , hey ? " Bert blushed ; he could n't help it , notwithstanding his innocence in this case . " I did n't know it myself till about ten minutes ago , " he protested . Hartley winked prodigiously . " Do n't tell me ! Is she pretty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood . " Let me put it in , " cried Hartley , springing up . " Excuse me . My name is Hartley , book agent : Blaine 's Twenty Years , plain cloth , sprinkled edges , three dollars ; half calf , three fifty . This is my friend Mr. Lohr , of Marion ; German extraction , soph at the university . " The girl bowed and smiled , and pushed by him toward the door of the parlor . Hartley followed her in , and Bert could hear them rattling away at the stove . " Wo n't you sit down and play for us ? " asked Hartley , after they returned to the sitting-room . The persuasive music of the book agent was in his fine voice . " Oh no ! It 's nearly dinner-time , and I must help about the table . " " Now make yourselves at home , " said Mrs. Welsh , appearing at the door leading to the kitchen ; " if you want anything , just let me know . " " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner-bell rang they were feeling at home in their new quarters . At the table they met the usual group of village boarders : the Brann brothers , newsdealers ; old man Troutt , who ran the livery-stable -- and smelled of it ; and a small , dark , and wizened woman who kept the millinery store . The others , who came in late , were clerks in the stores near by . Maud served the dinner , while Stella and her mother waited upon the table . Albert admired the hands of the girl , which no amount of work could quite rob of their essential shapeliness . She was not more than twenty , he decided , but she looked older , so wistful was her face . " They 's one thing ag'in ' yeh , " Troutt , the liveryman , remarked to Hartley : " we 've jest been worked for one o ' the goldingedest schemes you ever see ! ' Bout six munce ago s 'm ' fellers come all through here claimin ' t ' be after information about the county and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , an ' wanted all the pitchers of the leading men , old settlers , an ' so on . You paid ten dollars , an ' you had a book an ' your pitcher in it . " " I know the scheme , " grinned Hartley . " Wal , sir , I s'pose them fellers roped in every man in this town . I do n't s'pose they got out with a cent less'n one thousand dollars . An ' when the book come -- wal ! " Here he stopped to roar . " I do n't s'pose you ever see a madder lot o ' men in your life . In the first place , they got the names and the pitchers mixed so that I was Judge Ricker , an ' Judge Ricker was ol ' man Daggett . Did n't the judge swear -- oh , it was awful ! " " I should say so . " " An the pitchers that wa' n't mixed was so goldinged black you could n't tell ' em from niggers . You know how kind o ' lily-livered Lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black Joe ; he was the maddest man of the hull bi'lin ' . He throwed the book in the fire , and tromped around like a blind bull . " " It was n't a success , I take it , then . Why , I should ' a ' thought they 'd ' a ' nabbed the fellows . " " Not much ! They was too keen for that . They did n't deliver the books theirselves ; they hired Dick Bascom to do it f'r them . ' Course , Dick wa' n't t ' blame . " " No ; I never tried it before , " Albert was saying to Maud , at their end of the table . " Hartley offered me a job , and as I needed money , I came . I do n't know what he 's going to do with me , now I 'm here . " Albert did not go out after dinner with Hartley ; it was too cold . He had brought his books with him , planning to keep up with his class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a timid knock came upon the door . " Come ! " he called , student fashion , Maud entered , her face aglow . " How natural that sounds ! " she said . Albert sprang up to take the wood from her arms . " I wish you 'd let me do that , " he said , pleadingly , as she refused his aid . " I was n't sure you were in . Were you reading ? " " Caesar , " he replied , holding up the book . " I am conditioned on Latin . I 'm going over the ' Commentaries ' again . " " I thought I knew the book , " she laughed . " You read Latin ? " " Yes , a little -- Vergil . " " Maybe you can help me out on these oratia obliqua . They bother me yet . I hate these ' Caesar saids . ' I like Vergil better . " She stood at his shoulder while he pointed out the knotty passage . She read it easily , and he thanked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The wind roared outside in the bare maples , and the fire boomed in its pent place within , but these young people had forgotten time and place . The girl sank into a chair almost unconsciously as they talked of Madison -- a great city to them -- of the Capitol building , of the splendid campus , of the lakes , and the gay sailing there in summer and ice-boating in winter . " Oh , it makes me homesick ! " cried the girl , with a deep sigh . " It was the happiest , sunniest time of all my life . Oh , those walks and talks ! Those recitations in the dear , chalky old rooms ! Oh , how I would like to go back over that hollow door-stone again ! " She broke off , with tears in her eyes , and he was obliged to cough two or three times before he could break the silence . " I know just how you feel . The first spring when I went back on the farm it seemed as if I could n't stand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed forty-eight hours long . It was so lonesome , and so dreary on rainy days ! But of course I expected to go back ; that 's what kept me up . I do n't think I could have stood it if I had n't had hope . " " I 've given it up now , " she said , plaintively ; " it 's no use hoping . " " Why do n't you teach ? " he asked , deeply affected by her voice and manner . " I did teach here for a year , but I could n't endure the strain ; I 'm not very strong , and the boys were so rude . If I could teach in a seminary -- teach Latin and English -- I should be happy , I think . But I ca n't leave mother now . " She was a wholly different girl in Albert 's eyes as she said this . Her cheap dress , her check apron , could not hide the pure intellectual flame of her spirit . Her large , blue eyes were deep with thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , was as lovely as a rose . Almost before he knew it , he was telling her of his life . " I do n't see how I endured it as long as I did , " he went on . " It was nothing but work , work , and dust or mud the whole year round ; farm-life , especially on a dairy farm , is slavery . " " Yes , " she agreed , " that is true . Father was a carpenter , and I 've always lived here ; but we have people who are farmers , and I know how it is with them . " " Why , when I think of it now it makes me crawl ! To think of getting up in the morning before daylight , and going out to the barn to do chores , to get ready to go into the field to work ! Working , wasting y'r life on dirt . Waiting and tending on cows seven hundred times a year . Goin ' round and round in a circle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poetry of a farmer 's life . " " It 's just the same for us women , " she corroborated . " Think of us going around the house day after day , and doing just the same things over an ' over , year after year ! That 's the whole of most women 's lives . Dishwashing almost drives me crazy . " " I know it , " said Albert ; " but somebody has t ' do it . And if a fellow 's folks are workin ' hard , why , of course he ca n't lay around and study . They 're not to blame . I do n't know that anybody 's to blame . " " I do n't suppose anybody is , but it makes me sad to see mother going around as she does , day after day . She wo n't let me do as much as I would . " The girl looked at her slender hands . " You see , I 'm not very strong . It makes my heart ache to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so good . " " I know , I know ! I 've felt just like that about my mother and father , too . " There was a long pause , full of deep feeling , and then the girl continued in a low , hesitating voice : " Mother 's had an awful hard time since father died . We had to go to keeping boarders , which was hard -- very hard for mother . " The boy felt a sympathetic lump in his throat as the girl went on again : " But she does n't complain , and she did n't want me to come home from school ; but of course I could n't do anything else . " It did n't occur to either of them that any other course was open , nor that there was any special heroism or self-sacrifice in the act ; it was simply right . " Well , I 'm not going to drudge all my life , " said Albert , at last . " I know it 's kind o ' selfish , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to study law and enter the bar . Lawyers manage to get hold of enough to live on decently , and that 's more than you can say of the farmers . And they live in town , where something is going on once in a while , anyway . " In the pause which followed , footsteps were heard on the walk outside , and the girl sprang up with a beautiful blush . " My stars ! I did n't think -- I forgot -- I must go . " Hartley burst into the room shortly after she left it , in his usual breeze . " Hul-lo ! Still at the Latin , hey ? " " Yes , " said Bert , with ease . " How goes it ? " " Oh , I 'm whooping ' er up ! I 'm getting started in great shape . Been up to the court-house and roped in three of the county officials . In these small towns the big man is the politician or the clergyman . I 've nailed the politicians through the ear ; now you must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How ' m I t ' do it ? " asked Bert , in an anxious tone . " I ca n't sell books if they do n't want ' em . " " Why , cert ! That 's the trick . Offer a big discount . Say full calf , two fifty ; morocco , two ninety . Regular discount to the clergy , ye know . Oh , they 're on to that little racket -- no trouble . If you can get a few of these leaders of the flock , the rest will follow like lambs to the slaughter . Tra-la-la -- who-o-o-ish , whish ! " Albert laughed at Hartley as he plunged his face into the ice-cold water , puffing and wheezing . " Jeemimy Crickets ! but ai n't that water cold ! I worked Rock River this way last month , and made a boomin ' success . If you take hold here in the --  " " Oh , I 'm all ready to stand anything short of being kicked out . " " No danger of that if you 're a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got t ' have some savvy in this , just like any other business . " He stopped in his dressing to say , " We 've struck a great boarding-place , hey ? " " Looks like it . " " I begin t ' cotton to the old lady a'ready . Good ' eal like mother used t ' be ' fore she broke down . Did n't the old lady have a time of it raisin ' me ? Phewee ! Patient ! Job was n't a patchin ' . But the test is goin ' t ' come on the biscuit ; if her biscuit comes up t ' mother 's I 'm hern till death . " He broke off to comb his hair , a very nice bit of work in his case . II There was no discernible reason why the little town should have been called Tyre , and yet its name was as characteristically American as its architecture . It had the usual main street lined with low brick or wooden stores -- a street which developed into a road running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . Being a county town , it had a court-house in a yard near the centre of the town , and a big summer hotel . Curiously shaped and oddly distributed hills rose abruptly out of the valley sand , forming a sort of amphitheatre in which the village lay . These square-topped hills ended at a common level , showing that they were not the result of an upheaval , but were the remains of the original stratification formations left standing after the scooping action of the post-glacial floods had ceased . Some of them looked like ruined walls of castles ancient as hills , on whose massive tops time had sown sturdy oaks and cedars . They lent a distinct air of romance to the landscape at all times ; but when in summer graceful vines clambered over their rugged sides , and underbrush softened their broken lines , it was not at all difficult to imagine them the remains of an unrecorded and very war-like people . Even now , in winter , with yellow-brown and green cedars standing starkly upon their summits , these towers possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees glistened with frost , or at evening when the white light of the sun was softened and violet shadows lay along the snow , the whole valley was a delight to the eye , full of distinct and lasting charm . In the campaign which Hartley began , Albert did his best , and his best was done unconsciously ; for the simplicity of his manner -- all unknown to himself -- was the most potent factor in securing consideration . " I 'm not a book agent , " he said to one of the clergymen to whom he first appealed ; " I 'm a student trying to sell a good book and make a little money to help me to complete my course at the university . " In this way he secured three clergymen to head the list , much to the delight and admiration of Hartley . " Good ! Now corral the alumni of the place . Work the fraternal racket to the bitter end . Oh , say ! there 's a sociable to-morrow night ; I guess we 'd better go , had n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Take some girls . I 'm going to take neighbor Pickett 's daughter ; she 's homely as a hedge fence , but I 'll take her for business reasons . " " Hartley , you 're an infernal fraud ! " " Nothing of the kind -- I 'm a salesman , " ended Hartley , with a laugh . After supper the following day , as Albert was still lingering at the table with the girls and Mrs. Welsh , he said to Maud : " Are you going to the sociable ? " " No ; I guess not . " " Would you go if I asked you ? " " Try me and see ! " answered the girl , with a laugh , her color rising . " All right . Miss Welsh , will you attend the festivity of the evening under my guidance and protection ? " " Yes , thank you ; but I must wash the dishes first . " " I 'll wash the dishes ; you go get ready , " said Mrs. Welsh . Albert felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he led Maud down the floor of the vestry of the church . Her cheeks were glowing , and her eyes shining with maidenly delight as they took seats at the table to sip a little coffee and nibble a bit of cake . Maud introduced him to a number of young people who had been students at the university . They received him cordially , and in a very short time he was enjoying himself very well indeed . He was reminded rather disagreeably of his office , however , by seeing Hartley surrounded by a laughing crowd of the more frolicsome young people . He winked at Albert , as much as to say , " Good stroke of business . " The evening passed away with songs , games , and recitations , and it was nearly eleven o'clock when the young people began to wander off toward home in pairs . Albert and Maud were among the first of the young folks to bid the rest good-night . The night was clear and keen but perfectly still , and the young people , arm in arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship . Albert held Maud 's arm close to his side . " Are you cold ? " he asked , in a low voice . " No , thank you ; the night is lovely , " she replied ; then added , with a sigh , " I do n't like sociables so well as I used to -- they tire me out . " " We stayed too long . " " It was n't that ; I 'm getting so they seem kind o ' silly . " " Well , I feel a little that way myself , " he confessed . " But there is so little to see here in Tyre at any time -- no music , no theatres . I like theatres , do n't you ? " " I ca n't go half enough . " " But nothing worth seeing ever comes into these little towns -- and then we 're all so poor , anyway . " The lamp , turned low , was emitting a terrible odor as they entered the sitting-room . " My goodness ! it 's almost twelve o'clock ! Good-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said , taking it , and giving it a cordial pressure which she remembered long . " Good-night ! " she repeated , softly , going up the stairs . Hartley , who came in a few minutes later , found his partner sitting thoughtfully by the fire , with his coat and shoes off , evidently in deep abstraction . " Well , I got away at last -- much as ever . Great scheme , that sociable , eh ? I saw your little girl introducing you right and left . " " Say , Hartley , I wish you 'd leave her out of this thing ; I do n't like the way you speak of her when --  " " Phew ! You do n't ? Oh , all right ! I 'm mum as an oyster -- only keep it up ! Get into all the church sociables you can ; there 's nothing like it . " * * * * * Hartley soon had canvassers out along the country roads , and was working every house in town . The campaign promised to lengthen into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every one declared there had never been such book agents in the town . " They 're such gentlemanly fellows . They do n't press anybody to buy . They do n't rush about and ' poke their noses where they 're not wanted . ' They are more like merchants with books to sell . " The only person who failed to see the attraction in them was Ed Brann , who was popularly supposed to be engaged to Maud . He grew daily more sullen and repellent , toward Albert noticeably so . One evening about six , after coming in from a long walk about town , Albert entered his room without lighting his lamp , lay down on the bed , and fell asleep . He had been out late the night before with Maud at a party , and slumber came almost instantly . Maud came in shortly , hearing no response to her knock , and after hanging some towels on the rack went out without seeing the sleeper . In the sitting-room she met Ed Brann . He was a stalwart young man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , but set and sullen now . His first words held a menace : " Say , Maud , I want t ' talk to you . " " Very well ; what is it , Ed ? " replied the girl , quietly . " I want to know how often you 're going to be out till twelve o'clock with this book agent ? " Perhaps it was the derisive inflection on " book agent " that woke Albert . Brann 's tone was brutal -- more brutal even than his words , and the girl turned pale and her breath quickened . " Why , Ed , what 's the matter ? " " Matter is just this : you ai n't got any business goin ' around with that feller with my ring on your finger , that 's all . " He ended with an unmistakable threat in his voice . " Very well , " said the girl , after a pause , curiously quiet ; " then I wo n't ; here 's your ring . " The man 's bluster disappeared instantly . Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incredibly great , as he pleaded : " Oh , do n't do that , Maud ; I did n't mean to say that ; I was mad -- I 'm sorry . " " I 'm glad you did it now , so I can know you . Take your ring , Ed ; I never ' ll wear it again . " Albert had heard all this , but he did not know how the girl looked as she faced the man . In the silence which followed she scornfully passed him and went out into the kitchen . Brann went out and did not return at supper . Young people of this sort are not self-analysts , and Maud did not examine closely into causes . She was astonished to find herself more indignant than grieved . She broke into an angry wail as she went to her mother 's bosom : " Mother ! mother ! " " Why , what 's the matter , Maudie ? Tell me . There , there ! do n't cry , pet ! Who 's been hurtin ' my poor little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There , there ! poor child ! Have you been quarrelling again ? Never mind ; it 'll come out all right . " " No , it won't -- not the way you mean , " the girl declared . " I 've given him back his ring , and I 'll never wear it again . " The mother could not understand with what wounding brutality the man 's tone had fallen upon the girl 's spirit , and Maud could not explain sufficiently to justify herself . Mrs. Welsh consoled herself with the idea that it was only a lover 's quarrel -- one of the little jars sure to come when two natures are settling together -- and that all would be mended in a day or two . Albert , being no more of a self-analyst than Maud , simply said , " Served him right , " and dwelt no more upon it for the time . At supper , however , he was extravagantly gay , and to himself unaccountably so . He joked Troutt till Maud begged him to stop , and after the rest had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color in her face and the flash of her infrequent smile , which it was such a pleasure to provoke . He volunteered to help wash the dishes . " Thank you , but I 'm afraid you 'd be more bother than help , " she replied . " Thank you , but you do n't know me . I ai n't so green as I look by no manner o ' means . I 've been doing my own housekeeping for four terms . " " I know all about that , " laughed the girl . " You young men rooming do precious little cooking and no dish-washing at all . " " That 's a base calumny ! I made it a point to wash every dish in the house , except the spider , once a week ; had a regular cleaning-up day . " " And about the spider ? " " I wiped that out nicely with a newspaper every time I wanted to use it . " " Oh , horrors !  - -  Mother , listen to that ! " " Why , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe it six times a day , would you ? " " I wonder it did n't poison you , " commented Mrs. Welsh . " Takes more'n that to poison a student , " laughed Albert , as he went out . The next afternoon he came bursting into the kitchen , where Maud stood with her sleeves rolled up , deep in the dishpan . " Do n't you want a sleigh-ride ? " he asked , boyishly eager . She looked up with shining eyes . " Oh , would n't I ! Can you get along , mother ? " " Certainly , child . Go on . The air will do you good . " " W'y , Maud ! " said the little girl , " you said you did n't want to when Ed --  " Mrs. Welsh silenced her , and said : " Run right along , dear ; it 's just the nicest time o ' day . Are there many teams out ? " " They 're just beginning to come out , " said Albert . " I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand , sure . " Troutt was standing in the sunny doorway of his stable when the young fellow dashed up to him . " Hullo , Uncle Troutt ! Harness your fastest nag into your swellest outfit instanter . " " Aha ! Goin ' t ' take y'r girl out , hey ? " " Yes ; and I want to do it in style . " " I guess ol ' Dan 's the horse for you . Gentle as a kitten and as knowin ' as a fox . Drive him with one hand -- left hand . " The old man laughed till his long , faded beard flapped up and down and quivered with the stress of his enjoyment of his joke . He ended by hitching a vicious-looking sorrel to a gay , duck-bellied cutter , saying , as he gave up the reins : " Now , be keerful . Dan 's foxy ; he 's all right when he sees you 've got the reins , but do n't drop ' em . " " Do n't you worry about me ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaping into the sleigh and gathering up the lines . " Stand aside , my lord , and let the cortege pass . Hoop-la ! " The brute gave a tearing lunge , and was out of the doorway before the old man could utter another word . Albert thrilled with pleasure as he felt the reins stiffen in his hands , and saw the traces swing slack beside the thills . " If he keeps this up he 'll do , " he said aloud . As he turned up at the gate Maud came gayly down the path , muffled to the eyes . " Oh , what a nice cutter ! But the horse -- is he gentle ? " she asked , as she climbed in . " As a cow , " Albert replied  --  " Git out o ' this , Bones ! " The main street was already filled with wood sleighs , bob-sleds filled with children , and men in light cutters , out for a race . Laughter was on the air , and the jingle-jangle of bells . The sun was dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted up the scene with flecks of color . Loafers on the sidewalks fired familiar phrases at the teams as they passed : " Step up , Bones ! " " Let ' er go , Gallagher ! " " Get there , Eli , " and the like . But what cared the drivers ? If the shouts were insolent they laid them to envy , and if they were pleasant they smiled in reply . Albert and Maud had made two easy turns up and down the street when a man driving a span of large Black Hawk horses dashed up a side street and whirled in just before them . The man was a superb driver , and sat with the reins held carelessly but securely in his left hand , guiding the team more by his voice than by the bit . " Hel-lo ! " cried Bert ; " that looks like Brann . " " It is , " said Maud . " Cracky ! that 's a fine team -- Black Hawks , both of them . I wonder if ol ' sorrel can pass ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " pleaded the girl . " Why not ? " " Because -- because I 'm afraid . " " Afraid of what ? " " Afraid something ' ll happen . " " Something is sure to happen ; I 'm goin ' to pass him if old Bones has any git to him . " " It 'll make him mad . " " Who mad ? Brann ? " " Yes . " " Well , s'pose it does , who cares ? " There were a dozen similar rigs moving up or down the street , and greetings passed from sleigh to sleigh . Everybody except Brann welcomed Albert with sincere pleasure , and exchanged rustic jokes with him . As they slowed up at the upper end of the street and began to turn , a man on the sidewalk said , confidentially : " Say , cap ' , if you handle that old rack o ' bones just right , he 'll distance anything on this road . When you want him to do his best let him have the rein ; do n't pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' im . " The old sorrel came round " gauming , " his ugly head thrown up , his great red mouth open , his ears laid back . Brann and the young doctor of the place were turning together , a little farther up the street . The blacks , responding to their driver 's word , came down with flying hoofs , their great glossy breasts flecked with foam , their jaws champing . " Come on , crow-bait ! " yelled Brann , insultingly , as he came down past the doctor , and seemed about to pass Albert and Maud . There was hate in the glare of his eyes . But he did not pass . The old sorrel seemed to lengthen ; to the spectators his nose appeared to be glued to the glossy side of Brann 's off black . " See them blacks trot ! " shouted Albert , in ungrammatical enthusiasm . " See that old sorrel shake himself ! " yelled the loafers . The doctor came tearing down with a spirited bay , a magnificent stepper . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mare 's neck , he thrilled with delight . There was the thoroughbred 's lacing of veins ; the proud fling of her knees and the swell of her neck showed that she was far from doing her best . There was a wild light in her eyes . These were the fast teams of the town . All interest was centred in them . " Clear the track ! " yelled the loafers . " The doc 's good f'r ' em . " " If she do n't break . " Albert was pulling at the sorrel heavily , absorbed in seeing , as well as he could for the flung snowballs , the doctor 's mare draw slowly , foot by foot , past the blacks . Suddenly Brann gave a shrill yell and stood up in his sleigh . The gallant little bay broke and fell behind ; Brann laughed , the blacks trotted on , their splendid pace unchanged . " Let the sorrel out ! " yelled somebody . " Let him loose ! " yelled Troutt on the corner , quivering with excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the fellow had said , let the reins loose . The old sorrel 's teeth came together with a snap ; his head lowered and his tail rose ; he shot abreast of the blacks . Maud , frightened into silence , covered her head with the robe to escape the flying snow . The sorrel drew steadily ahead and was passing the blacks when Brann turned . " Durn y'r old horse ! " he yelled through his shut teeth , and laid the whip across the sorrel 's hips . The blacks broke wildly , but , strange to say , the old sorrel increased his speed . Again Brann struck , but the lash fell on Bert 's outstretched wrists . He did not see that the blacks were crowding him to the gutter , but he heard a warning cry . " Look out , there ! " Before he could turn to look , the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb . He rose in the air like a vaulter , and when he fell the light went out . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of which a sweet , agonized girl-voice broke : " Oh , where 's the doctor ? He 's dead -- oh , he 's dead ! Ca n't you hurry ? " Next came a quick , authoritative voice , still far away , and a hush followed it ; then an imperative order : " Stand out o ' the way ! What do you think you can do by crowding on top of him ? " " Stand back ! stand back ! " other voices called . Then he felt something cold on his scalp : they were taking his cap off and putting snow on his head ; then the doctor -- he knew him now -- said : " Let me take him ! " A dull , throbbing ache came into his head , and as this grew the noise of voices became more distinct , and he could hear sobbing . Then he opened his lids , but the glare of the sunlight struck them shut again ; he saw only Maud 's face , agonized , white , and wet with tears , looking down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he again opened his eyes on the circle of hushed and excited men thronging about him . He saw Brann , with wild , scared face , standing in his cutter and peering over the heads of the crowd . " How do you feel now ? " asked the doctor . " Can you hear us ? Albert , do you know me ? " called the girl . His lips moved stiffly , but he smiled a little , and at length whispered slowly , " Yes ; I guess -- I 'm all -- right . " " Put him into my cutter ; Maud , get in here , too , " the doctor commanded . The crowd opened as the doctor and Troutt helped the wounded man into the sleigh . The pain in his head grew worse , but Albert 's perception of things sharpened in proportion ; he closed his eyes to the sun , but in the shadow of Maud 's breast opened them again and looked up at her . He felt a vague , child-like pleasure in knowing that she was holding him in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would frighten her if she knew . " " Hello ! " called a breathless , hearty voice , " what the deuce y ' been doing with my pardner ? Bert , old fellow , are you there ? " Hartley asked , clinging to the edge of the moving cutter , and peering into his friend 's face . Albert smiled . " I 'm here -- what there is left of me , " he replied , faintly . " Glory ! How did it happen ? " he asked of the girl . " I do n't know -- I could n't see -- we ran into a culvert , " replied Maud . " Were n't you hurt ? " " Not a bit . I stayed in the cutter . " Albert groaned , and tried to rise , but the girl gently yet firmly restrained him . Hartley was walking beside the doctor , talking loudly . " It was a devilish thing to do ; the scoundrel ought to be jugged ! " Albert tried again to rise . " I 'm bleeding yet ; I 'm soaking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but remained firm . " No ; we 're ' most home . " She felt no shame , but a certain exaltation as she looked into the faces about her . She gazed unrecognizingly upon her nearest girl friends , and they , gazing upon her white face and unresponsive eyes , spoke in awed whispers . At the gate the crowd gathered and waited with deepest interest . It was enthralling romance to them . " Ed Brann done it , " said one . " How ? " asked another . " With the butt end of his whip . " " That 's a lie ! His team ran into Lohr 's rig . " " Not much ; Ed crowded him into the ditch . " " What fer ? " " Cause Bert cut him out with Maud . " " Come , get out of the way ! Do n't stand there gabbing , " yelled Hartley , as he took Albert in his arms and , together with the doctor , lifted him out of the sleigh . " Goodness sakes alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked an old lady , peering at him as he passed . On the porch stood Mrs. Welsh , supported by Ed Brann . " She 's all right , I tell you . He ai n't hurt much , either ; just stunned a little , that 's all . " " Maud ! child ! " cried the mother , as Maud appeared , followed by a bevy of girls . " I 'm all right , mother , " she said , running into the trembling arms outstretched toward her ; " but , oh , poor Albert ! " After the wounded man disappeared into the house the crowd dispersed . Brann went off by the way of the alley ; he was not prepared to meet the questions of his accusers . " Now , what in  - -   - -   you been up to ? " was the greeting of his brother , as he re-entered the shop . " Nothing . " " Welting a man on the head with a whip-stock ai n't anything , hey ? " " I did n't touch him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hank says he saw you strike him . " " He lies ! I was strikin ' the horse to make him break ! " " Oh , yeh was ! " sneered the older man . " Well , I hope you understand that this 'll ruin you in this town . If you did n't strike him , they 'll say you run him into the culvert , ' n ' every man , woman , ' n ' child 'll be down on you , and me f'r bein ' related to you . They all know how you feel toward him for cuttin ' you out with Maud Welsh . " " Oh , do n't bear down on him too hard , Joe . He did n't mean t ' do any harm , " said Troutt , who had followed Ed down to the store . " I guess the young feller ' ll come out all right . Just go kind o ' easy till we see how he turns out . If he dies , why , it 'll haf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowed hastily . " If he should die I 'll be a murderer , " he thought . He acknowledged that hate was in his heart , and he shivered as he remembered the man 's white face with the bright red stream flowing down behind his ear and over his cheek . It almost seemed to him that he had struck him , so close had the accident followed upon the fall of his whip . III Albert sank into a feverish sleep that night , with a vague perception of four figures in the room -- Maud , her mother , Hartley , and the young doctor . When he awoke fully in the morning his head felt prodigiously hot and heavy . It was early dawn , and the lamp was burning brightly . Outside , a man 's feet could be heard on the squealing snow -- a sound which told how still and cold it was . A team passed with a jingle of bells . Albert raised his head and looked about . Hartley was lying on the sofa , rolled up in his overcoat and some extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with watching . Albert felt a little weak , and fell back on his pillow , thinking about the strange night he had passed -- a night more filled with strange happenings than the afternoon . As the light grew in the room his mind cleared , and lifting his muscular arm he opened and shut his hand , saying aloud , in his old boyish manner : " I guess I 'm all here . " " What 's that ? " called Hartley , rolling out of bed . " Did you ask for anything ? " " Give me some water , Jim ; my mouth is dry as a powder-mill . " " How yeh feelin ' , anyway , pardner ? " said Hartley , as he brought the water . " First-rate , Jim ; I guess I 'll be all right . " " Well , I guess you 'd better keep quiet . " He threw on his coat next , and went out into the kitchen , returning soon with some hot water , with which he began to bathe his partner 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now I guess you 're in shape f'r grub -- feel any like grub ?  - -  Come in , " he called , in answer to a knock on the door . Mrs. Welsh entered . " How is he ? " she whispered , anxiously . " Oh , I 'm all right , " replied Albert . " I 'm glad to find you so much better , " she said , going to his bedside . " I 've hardly slep ' , I was so much worried about you . Your breakfast is ready , Mr. Hartley . I 've got something special for Albert . " A few minutes later Maud entered with a platter , followed closely by her mother . The girl came forward timidly , but when Albert turned his eyes on her and called , cheerily , " Good morning ! " she flamed out in rosy color and recoiled . She had expected to see him pale , dull-eyed , and with a weak voice , but there was little to indicate invalidism in his firm greeting . She gave place to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb by his tone , and hardly dared look at him as he sat propped up in bed . However , though he was feeling absurdly well , there was a good deal of bravado in his tone and manner , for he ate but little , and soon sank back on the bed . " I feel better when my head is low , " he explained , in a faint voice . " Ca n't I do something ? " asked the girl , her courage reviving as she perceived how ill and faint he really was . " I guess you better write to his folks , " said Mrs. Welsh . " No , do n't do that , " he protested , opening his eyes ; " it will only worry them , and do me no good . I 'll be all right in a few days . You need n't waste your time on me ; Hartley will wait on me . " " Do n't mind him , " said Mrs. Welsh . " I 'm his mother now , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you , Albert ? " He dropped his eyelids in assent , and went off into a doze . It was all very pleasant to be thus waited upon . Hartley was devotion itself , and the doctor removed his bandages with the care and deliberation of a man with a moderate practice ; besides , he considered Albert a personal friend . Hartley , after the doctor had gone , said with some hesitation : " Well , now , pard , I ought to go out and see a couple o ' fellows I promised t ' meet this morning . " " All right , Jim ; all right . You go right ahead on business ; I 'm goin ' t ' sleep , anyway , and I 'll be all right in a day or two . " " Well , I will ; but I 'll run in every hour ' r two and see if you do n't want something . You 're in good hands , anyway , when I 'm gone . " * * * * * " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , when Maud came in with her mother to brush up the room . " It 's getting rather slow business layin ' here like this . " " Shall I , mother ? " " Why , of course , Maud . " So Maud got a book , and sat down over by the stove , quite distant from the bed , and read to him from The Lady of the Lake , while the mother , like a piece of tireless machinery , moved about the house at the never-ending succession of petty drudgeries which wear the heart and soul out of so many wives and mothers , making life to them a pilgrimage from stove to pantry , from pantry to cellar , and from cellar to garret -- a life that deadens and destroys , coarsens and narrows , till the flesh and bones are warped to the expression of the wronged and cheated soul . Albert 's selfishness was in a way excusable . He enjoyed beyond measure the sound of the girl 's soft voice and the sight of her graceful head bent over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the voice and the sunlit head were lost in a deep , sweet sleep . The girl sat with closed book , looking at his face as he slept . It was a curious study to her , a young man -- this young man , asleep . His brown lashes lay on his cheek as placid as those of a child . As she looked she gained courage to go over softly and peer down on him . How boyish he seemed ! How little to be feared ! A boy outside uttered a shout , and she hurried away , pale and breathless . As she paused in the door and looked back at the undisturbed sleeper , she smiled , and the pink came back into her thin face . Albert 's superb young blood began to assert itself , and on the afternoon of the fifth day he was able to sit in his rocking-chair before the fire and read a little , though he professed that his eyes were not strong , in order that Maud should read for him . This she did as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not half often enough , " the invalid grumbled . " More than you deserve , " she found courage to say . Hartley let nothing interfere with the book business . " You take it easy , " he repeated . " Do n't you worry -- your pay goes on just the same . You 're doing well right where you are . By jinks ! biggest piece o ' luck , " he went on , half in earnest . " Why , I ca n't turn around without taking an order -- fact ! Turned in a book on the livery bill , so that 's all fixed . We 'll make a clear hundred dollars out o ' that little bump o ' yours . " " Little bump ! Say , now , that's --  " " Keep it up -- put it on ! Do n't hurry about getting well . I do n't need you to canvass , and I guess you enjoy being waited on . " He ended with a sly wink and cough . Yes , convalescence was delicious , with Maud reading to him , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred his peace was the stream of people who came to inquire how he was getting along . The sympathy was largely genuine , as Hartley could attest , but it bored the invalid . He had rather be left in quiet with Walter Scott and Maud . In the light of common day the accident was hurrying to be a dream . At the end of a week he was quite himself again , though he still had difficulty in wearing his hat . It was not till the second Sunday after the accident that he appeared in the dining-room for the first time , with a large travelling-cap concealing the suggestive bandages . He looked pale and thin , but his eyes danced with joy . Maud 's eyes dilated with instant solicitude . The rest sprang up in surprise , with shouts of delight , as hearty as brethren . " Ginger ! I 'm glad t ' see yeh ! " said Troutt , so sincerely that he looked almost winning to the boy . The rest crowded around , shaking hands . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment later with his brother , and there was a significant little pause -- a pause which grew painful till Albert turned and saw Brann , and called out : " Hello , Ed ! How are you ? Did n't know you were here . " As he held out his hand , Brann , his face purple with shame and embarrassment , lumbered heavily across the room and took it , muttering some poor apology . " Hope y ' do n't blame me . " " Of course not -- fortunes o ' war . Nobody to blame ; just my carelessness.  - -  Yes ; I 'll take turkey , " he said to Maud , as he sank into the seat of honor . The rest laughed , but Brann remained standing near Albert 's chair . He had not finished yet . " I 'm mighty glad you do n't lay it up against me , Lohr ; an ' I want to say the doctor 's bill is all right ; you un'erstand , it 's all right . " Albert looked at him a moment in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brann , meant more than a thousand prayers from a ready apologist . It was a terrible victory , and he was disposed to make it as easy for his rival as he could . " Oh , all right , Ed ; only I 'd calculated to cheat him out o ' part of it -- I 'd planned to turn in a couple o ' Blaine 's Twenty Years on the bill . " Hartley roared , and the rest joined in , but not even Albert perceived all that it meant . It meant that the young savage had surrendered his claim in favor of the man he had all but killed . The struggle had been prodigious , but he had snatched victory out of defeat ; his better nature had conquered . No one ever gave him credit for it ; and when he went West in the spring , people said his passion for Maud had been superficial . In truth , he had loved the girl as sincerely as he had hated his rival . That he could rise out of the barbaric in his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride again , it was on melting snow , with the slowest horse Troutt had . Maud was happier than she had been since she left school , and fuller of color and singing . She dared not let a golden moment pass now without hearing it ring full , and she dared not think how short this day of happiness might be . IV At the end of the fifth week of their stay in Tyre a suspicion of spring was in the wind as it swept the southern exposure of the valley . March was drawing to a close , and there was more than a suggestion of April in the rapidly melting snow which still lay on the hills and under the cedars and tamaracks in the swamps . Patches of green grass , appearing on the sunny side of the road where the snow had melted , led to predictions of spring from the loafers beginning to sun themselves on the salt-barrels and shoe-boxes outside the stores . A group sitting about the blacksmith shop were discussing it . " It 's an early seedin ' now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his knife into the soft ground at his feet . " The sun is crossing the line earlier this spring than it did last . " " Yes ; an ' I heard a crow to-day makin ' that kind of a -- a spring noise that sort o '  - -  I d ' know what -- kind o ' goes all through a feller . " " And there 's Uncle Sweeney , an ' that settles it ; spring 's comin ' sure ! " said Troutt , pointing at an old man , much bent , hobbling down the street . " When he gits out the frogs ai n't fur behind . " " We 'll be gittin ' on to the ground by next Monday , " said Sam Dingley to a crowd who were seated on the newly painted harrows and seeders which Svend &; Johnson had got out ready for the spring trade . " Svend &; Johnson 's Agricultural Implement Depot " was on the north side of the street , and on a spring day the yard was one of the pleasantest loafing-places that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alone . Something in the touch and tone of this spring afternoon made him restless and inclined to strange thoughts . He took his way out along the road which followed the river-bank , and in the outskirts of the village threw himself down on a bank of grass which the snows had protected , and which had already a tinge of green because of its wealth of sun . The willows had thrown out their tiny light-green flags , though their roots were under the ice , and some of the hardwood twigs were tinged with red . There was a faint but magical odor of uncovered earth in the air , and the touch of the wind was like a caress from a moist , magnetic hand . The boy absorbed the light and heat of the sun as some wild thing might . With his hat over his face , his hands folded on his breast , he lay as still as a statue . He did not listen at first , he only felt ; but at length he rose on his elbow and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , hollow , booming crash ; a crow cawed , and a jay answered it from the willows below . A flight of sparrows passed , twittering innumerably . The boy shuddered with a strange , wistful longing , and a realization of the flight of time . He could have wept , he could have sung , but he only shuddered and lay silent under the stress of that strange , sweet passion which quickened his heart , deepened his eyes , and made his breath come and go with a quivering sound . Across the dazzling blue arch of the sky the crow flapped , sending down his prophetic , jubilant note ; the breeze , as soft and sweet as April , stirred in his hair ; the hills , deep in their dusky blue , seemed miles away ; and the voices of the care-free skaters on the melting ice of the river below came to the ear subdued to a unity with the scene . Suddenly a fear seized upon the boy -- a horror ! Life , life was passing ! Life that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Life , that fatal gift of the Invisible Powers to man -- a path , with youth and joy and hope at its eastern gate , and despair , regret , and death at its low western portal ! The boy caught a momentary glimpse of his real significance . " I am only a gnat , a speck in the sun , a youth facing the millions of great and wise and wealthy ! " He leaped up in a frenzy . " Oh , I must n't stay here ! I must get back to my studies . Life is slipping by me , and I am doing nothing , being nothing ! " His face , as pale as death , shone with passionate resolution , and his hands were clinched in silent vow . But on his way back he met the jocund party of skaters going home from the river , and with the easy shift and change of youth joined in their ringing laughter . The weird power of the wind 's voice was gone , and he sank to the level of the unthinking boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not solved . That night Hartley said : " Well , pardner , we 're getting ' most ready to pull out . Someways I always get restless when these warm days begin . " This was as sentimental as Hartley ever got ; or , if he ever felt more sentiment , he concealed it carefully . " I s'pose it must ' a ' been in spring that those old chaps , on their steeds and in their steel shirts , started out for to rescue some damsel , hey ? " he ended , with a grin . " Now , that 's the way I feel -- just like striking out for , say , Oshkosh . That little piece of lofty tumbling of yours was a big boom , and no mistake . Why , your share o ' this campaign will be a hundred and twenty dollars sure . " " More'n I 've earned , " replied Bert . " No , it ai n't . You 've done your duty like a man . Done as much in your way as I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , say so . I 'll make a thousand dollars this year out o ' this thing . " " I guess I 'll go back to school . " " All right ; I do n't blame you for wanting to do that . " " I guess , with what I can earn for father , I can pull through the year . I must get back . I 'm awfully obliged to you , Jim . " " That 'll do on that , " said Hartley , shortly ; " you do n't owe me anything . We 'll finish delivery to-morrow , and be ready to pull out on Friday or Sat . " There was an acute pain in Albert 's breast somewhere ; he had not analyzed his case at all , and did not now , but the idea of going affected him strongly . It had been so pleasant , that daily return to a lovely girlish presence . " Yes , sir , " Hartley was going on , " I 'm going to just quietly leave a book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest her much , but it 'll show we appreciate the grub , and so on . By jinks ! you do n't seem to realize what a worker that woman is ! Up five o'clock in the morning -- By-the-way , you 've been going around with the girl a good deal , and she 's introduced you to some first-rate sales ; now , if you want to leave her a little something , make it a morocco copy , and charge it to the firm . " Albeit knew that he meant well , but he could n't , somehow , help saying , ironically : " Thanks , but I guess one copy of Blaine 's Twenty Years will be enough in the house , especially --  " " Well , give her anything you please , and charge it up to the firm . I do n't insist on Blaine ; only suggested that because --  " " I guess I can stand the expense of a present . " " I did n't say you could n't , man ! But I want a hand in this thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller up , " complained Hartley , turning on him . " What the thunder is the matter of you , anyway ? I like the girl , and she 's been good to us all round ; she tended you like an angel --  " " There , there ! That 's enough o ' that , " put in Albert , hastily . " For God 's sake , do n't whang away on that string forever , as if I did n't know it ! " Hartley stared at him as he turned away . " Well , by jinks ! What is the matter o ' you ? " He was too busy to dwell upon it much , but concluded his partner was homesick . Albert was beginning to have a vague underconsciousness of his real feeling toward the girl , but he fought off the acknowledgment of it as long as possible . His mind moved in a circle , coming back to the one point ceaselessly -- a dreary prospect , in which that slender girl-figure had no place -- and each time the prospect grew more intolerably blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing . When he faced her that night , after they had returned from a final walk down by the river , he was as far from a solution as ever . He had avoided all reference to their separation , and now he stood as a man might at the parting of the ways , saying : " I will not choose ; I can not choose . I will wait for some sign , some chance thing , to direct me . " They stood opposite each other , each feeling that there was more to be said : the girl tender , her eyes cast down , holding her hands to the fire ; he shivering , but not with cold . He had a vague knowledge of the vast importance of the moment , and he hesitated to speak . " It 's almost spring again , is n't it ? And you 've been here " she paused and looked up with a daring smile --  " seems as if you 'd been here always . " It was about half-past eight . Mrs. Welsh was setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving about . Hartley was down-town finishing up his business . They were almost alone in the house . Albert 's throat grew dry and his limbs trembled . His pause was ominous . The girl 's smile died away as he took a seat without looking at her . " Well , Maud , I suppose you know -- we 're going away to-morrow . " " Oh , must you ? But you 'll come back ? " " I do n't expect to -- I do n't see how I can . I may never see you again . " " Oh , do n't say that ! " cried the girl , her face as white as silver , her clasped hands straining . " I must go -- I must ! " he muttered , not daring to look upon her face . " Oh , what can I do -- we do -- without you ! I ca n't bear it ! " She stopped , and sank back into a chair , her breath coming heavily from her twitching lips , the unnoticed tears falling from her staring , pitiful , wild , appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long silence . Each was undergoing a self-revelation ; each was trying to face a future without the other . " I must go ! " he repeated , aimlessly , mechanically . " What can I do here ? " The girl 's heavy breathing deepened into a wild little moaning sound , inexpressibly pitiful , her hungry eyes fixed on his face . She gave way first , and flung herself down upon her knees at his side , her hands seeking his neck . " Albert , I ca n't live without you now ! Take me with you ! Do n't leave me ! " He stooped suddenly and took her in his arms , raised her , and kissed her hair . " I did n't mean it , Maud ; I 'll never leave you -- never ! Do n't cry ! " She drew his head down and kissed his lips , then turned her face to his breast -- then joy and confidence came back to her . " I know now what you meant , " she cried , gayly , raising herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare me ; trying to make me show how much I -- cared for you -- first ! " There was a soft smile on her lips and a tender light in her eyes . " But I do n't mind it . " " I guess I did n't know myself what I meant , " he answered , with a grave smile . When Mrs. Welsh came in , they were sitting on the sofa , talking in low voices of their future . He was grave and subdued , while she was radiant with love and hope . The future had no terrors for her , but the boy unconsciously felt the gravity of life somehow deepened by the revelation of her love . " Why , Maud ! " Mrs. Welsh exclaimed , " what are you doing ? " " Oh , mother , I 'm so happy -- just as happy as a bird ! " she cried , rushing into her mother 's arms . " Why , why !  - -  what is it ? You 're crying , dear ! " " No , I 'm not ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl , who shook the tears from her lashes with the action of a bird shaking water from its wings . She seemed to shake off her trouble at the same moment . Mrs. Welsh understood perfectly . " I 'm very glad , too , dearie , " she said , simply , looking at the young man with motherly love irradiating her worn face . Albert went to her , and she kissed him , while the happy girl put her arms about them both in an ecstatic hug . " Now you 've got a son , mother . " " But I 've lost a daughter -- my first-born . " " Oh , wait till you hear our plans ! He 's going to settle down here -- are n't you , Albert ? " Then she went away and left the young people alone . They had a sweet , intimate talk of an hour , full of plans and hopes and confidences , and then he kissed his radiant love good-night , and , going into his own room , sat down by the stove and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already he sighed with the stress of care , the press of thought , which came upon him . The longing uneasiness of the boy had given place to another unrest -- the unrest of the man who must face the world in earnest now , planning for food and shelter . To go back to school was out of the question . To expect help from his father , overworked and burdened with debt , was impossible . He must go to work , and go to work to aid her . A living must be wrung from this town . All the home and all the property Mrs. Welsh had were here , and wherever Maud went the mother must follow . He was in the midst of his mental turmoil when Hartley came in , humming the Mulligan Guards . " In the dark , hey ? " " Completely in the dark . " " Well , light up , light up ! " " I 'm trying to . " " What the deuce do you mean by that tone ? What 's been going on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hartley shuffled about after a match , lighted the lamp , threw his coat and hat in the corner , and then said : " Well , I 've got everything straightened up . Been freezing out old Daggett ; the old skeesix has been promisin ' f'r a week , and I just said , ' Old man , I 'll camp right down with you here till you fork over , ' and he did . By-the-way , everybody I talked with to-day about leaving said , ' What 's Lohr going to do with that girl ? ' I told ' em I did n't know ; do you ? It seems you 've been thicker'n I supposed . " " I 'm going to marry her , " said Albert , calmly , but his voice sounded strained and hoarse . " What 's that ? " yelled Hartley . " Sh ! do n't raise the neighbors . I 'm going to marry her . " " Well , by jinks ! When ? Say , looky here ! Well , I swanny ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right away ; some time this summer -- June , maybe . " Hartley thrust his hands into his trousers pockets , stretched out his legs , and stared at his friend in vast amaze . " You 're givin ' me guff ! " " I 'm in dead earnest . " " I thought you was going through college all so fast ? " " Well , I 've made up my mind it is n't any use to try , " replied Albert , listlessly . " What y ' goin ' t ' do here , or are y ' goin ' t ' take the girl away with yeh ? " " She ca n't leave her mother . We 'll run this boarding-house for the present . I 'll try for the principalship of the school here . Raff is going to resign , they say . If I ca n't get that , I 'll go into a law office . Do n't worry about me . " " But why go into this so quick ? Why not put it off fifteen or twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful voice . " What would be the use ? At the end of a year I 'd be just about as poor as I am now . " " Ca n't y'r father step in and help you ? " " No . There are three boys and two girls , all younger than I , to be looked out for , and he has all he can carry . Besides , she needs me right here and right now , and if I can do anything to make life easier for her I 'm going t ' do it . Besides , " he ended , in a peculiar tone , " we do n't feel as if we could live apart much longer . " " But , great Scott ! man , you can't --  " " Now , hold on , Jim ! I 've thought this thing all over , and I 've made up my mind . It ai n't any use to go on talking about it . What good would it do me to go to school another year ? I 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning a living for her than I am now ! And , besides all that , I could n't draw a free breath thinking of her workin ' away here to keep things moving , liable at any minute to break down . " Hartley gazed at him in despair , and with something like awe . It was a tremendous transformation in the young , ambitious student . Like most men in America , and especially Western men , he still clung to the idea that a man was entirely responsible for his success or failure in life . He had not admitted that conditions of society might be so adverse that only men of most exceptional endowments , and willing and able to master many of the best and deepest and most sacred of their inspirations and impulses , could succeed . Of the score of specially promising young fellows who had been with him at school , seventeen had dropped out and down . Most of them had married and gone back to farming , or to earn a precarious living in the small , dull towns where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they simply weakened and slipped slowly back into dulness and an ox-like or else a fretful patience . Thinking of these men , and thinking their failure due to themselves alone , Hartley could not endure the idea of his friend adding one more to the list of failures . He sprang up at last . " Say , Bert , you might just as well hang y'rself , and done with it ! Why , it 's suicide ! I ca n't allow it . I started in at college bravely , and failed because I 'd let it go too long . I could n't study -- could n't get down to it ; but you -- why , old man , I 'd bet on you ! " He had a tremor in his voice . " I hate like thunder to see you give up your plans . Say , you ca n't afford to do this ; it 's too much to pay . " " No , it is n't . " " I say it is -- and , besides , you 'd get over this in a week --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . " All right , " said Jim , in the tone of a man who knows it 's all wrong --  " all right ; but the time ' ll come when you 'll wish I'd -- You ai n't doin ' the girl enough good to make up for the harm you 're doin ' yourself . " He broke off again , and said in a tone of finality : " I 'm done . I 'm all through , and I c'n see you 're through with Jim Hartley . All right ! " " Darn curious , " he muttered to himself , " that boy should get caught just at this time , and not with some o ' those girls in Marion . Well , it 's none o ' my funeral , " he ended , with a sigh ; for it had stirred him to the bottom of his sunny nature , after all . A dozen times , as he lay there beside his equally sleepless companion , he started to say something more in deprecation of the step , but each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be true to say that love had come to Albert Lohr as a relaxing influence , but it had changed the direction of his energies so radically as to make his whole life seem weaker and lower . As long as his love-dreams went out toward a vague and ideal woman , supposedly higher and grander than himself , he was spurred on to face the terrible sheer escarpment of social eminence ; but when he met , by accident , the actual woman who was to inspire his future efforts , the difficulties he faced took on solid reality . His aspirations fell to the earth , their wings clipped , and became , perforce , submissive beasts at the plough . The force that moved so much of his thought was transformed into other energy . The table was very gay at dinner next day . Maud was standing at the highest point of her girlhood dreams . Her flushed cheeks and shining eyes made her seem almost a child , and Hartley wondered at her , and relented a little in the face of such happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartley to himself , as he joined in the laughter ; " but that wo n't help ' em any ten years from now . " He could hardly speak next day as he shook hands at the station with his friend . " Good-by , ol ' man ; I hope it 'll come out all right , but I 'm afraid -- But there ! I promised not to say anything about it . Good-by till we meet in Congress , " he ended , in a resolute attempt to conceal his dismay . " Ca n't you come to the wedding , Jim ? We 've decided on June . You see , they need a man around the house , so we -- You 'll come , wo n't you , old fellow ? And do n't mind my being a little crusty last night . " " Oh yes ; I 'll come , " Jim said , in a tone which concealed a desire to utter one more protest , but to himself he said : " That ends him ! He 's jumped into a hole and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry a family like that at his age , and pull out of it . He may , but I doubt it . Well , as I remarked before , it 's none o ' my funeral so long as he 's satisfied . " But he said it with a painful lump in his throat , and he could not bring himself to feel that Albert 's course was right , and felt himself to be somehow culpable in the case . A DIVISION IN THE COOLLY A funeral is a depressing affair under the best circumstances , but a funeral in a lonely farm-house in March , the roads full of slush , the ragged gray clouds leaping the sullen hills like eagles , is tragic . The teams arrived splashed with mud , the women blue with cold under their scanty cotton-quilt lap robes , their hats set awry by the wind . They scurried into the house , to sit and shiver in the best room , where all the chairs that could contrive to stand erect , and all of any sort that could be borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men drove out to the barn , and having blanketed their teams with lap robes , picked their way through the slush of the yard over to the lee side of the haystack , where the pale sun occasionally shone . They spoke of " diseased " Williams , as if Diseased were his Christian name . They whittled shingles or stalks of straw as they talked . Sooner or later , after each new arrival , they branched off upon politics , and the McKinley Bill was handled gingerly . If any one , in his zeal , raised his voice above a certain pitch , some one said " Hish ! " and the newcomer 's voice sank again to that abnormal quiet which falls now and again on these loud-voiced folk of the wind and open spaces . The boys hung around the kitchen and smoke-house , playing sly jokes upon each other in order to provoke that explosion of laughter so thoroughly enjoyed by those who can laugh noiselessly . A snort of this sort brought Deacon Williams out to reprimand them , " Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " The preacher came . The choir raised a wailing chant for the dead , but the group by the haystack did not move . Occasionally they came back , after talking about seeding and the price of hogs , to the discussion of the dead man 's affairs . " I s'pose his property will go to Emmy and Serry , half and half . " " I expec ' so . He always said so , an ' John wa' n't a man to whiffle about every day . " " Well , Emmy wo n't make no fuss , but if Ike do n't git more'n his half , I 'll eat the greaser . " " Who 's ex-ecutor ? " " Deacon Williams , I expect . " " Well , the Deacon 's a slick one , " some one observed , as if that were an excellent quality in an executor . " They ai n't no love lost between Bill Gray and Harkey , I do n't expect . " " No , I do n't think they is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's queer , too . He tries awful hard . " The voice of the preacher within , raised to a wild shout , interrupted them . " The Elder 's gettin ' warmed up , " said one of the story-tellers , pausing in his talk . " And so I told Bill if he wanted the cord-wood --  " The sun shone warmer , and the chickens caw-cawed feebly . The colts whinnied , and a couple of dogs rolled and tumbled in wild frolic , while the voice of the preacher sounded dolefully or in humming monotone . Meanwhile , in the house , in the best room and in the best seats near the coffin , the women , in their black , worn dresses , with wrinkled , sallow faces and gnarled hands , sat shivering . Theirs was to be the luxury of the ceremony . The carpet was damp and muddy , the house was chill , and the damp wind filled them all with ague ; but they had so much to see and talk about , that time passed rapidly . Each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were proper to the occasion or not , and if one of the girls smiled a little as she entered , some one was sure to whisper :  --  " Heartless thing , how can she ? " There were a few young men , only enough to help out on the singing , and they remained mainly in the kitchen where they were seen occasionally in anxious consultation with Deacon Williams . The girls looked serious , but a little sly , as if they could smile if the boys looked their way or if one of the old women should cough her store teeth out . Upstairs the family were seated in solemn silence , the two nieces , Emma and Sarah , and Emma 's husband , Harkey , and Sarah 's children -- deceased Williams had no wife . These people sat in stony immobility , except when Harkey looked at his watch , and said :  --  " Seem slow gitten here . " Occasionally women came up the stairway and flung themselves upon the necks of the mourning nieces , who submitted to it without apparent disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm after their visitors had " straightened their things , " and retired to the reserved seats below . Deacon Williams , small , quick , with sunny blue-gray eyes belying the gloomy curve of his mouth , was everywhere ; arranging for bearers , selecting hymns , conferring with the family , keeping abstracted old women off the seats reserved for the mourners , and maintaining an anxious lookout for the minister . The Deacon was a distant relative of the dead man , and it was generally admitted that he " would have a time of it " in administering upon the estate . At last the word was whispered about that the Elder was coming . Word was sent to the smoke-house and to the haystack to call the stragglers in . They came slowly , and finding the rooms all filled considered themselves absolved from a disagreeable duty , and went back to the sunny side of the haystack , where they smoked their pipes in ruminative enjoyment . The Elder , upon entering , took his place beside the coffin , the foot of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his hymn-book . A noise of whispering , rustling , scraping of feet arose as some old men crowded in among the women , and then the room became silent . The Elder took his seat and glanced round upon them all with solemn unrecognizing severity , while the mourners came down the creaking pine stairway in proper order of procedure . Everybody noticed the luxury of new dresses on the nieces and the new suits on the children . Everybody knew the feeling which led to these extravagances . Death , after all , was a majestic visitor , and money was not to stand in the way of a decent showing . Some of the girls smiled slyly at Isaac 's gloves , which were too small and would go only halfway on , a fact he tried to conceal by keeping his hands folded . Each boy was provided with a large new stiff cotton handkerchief , which occupied immense space in outside pockets , crumpled as they were into a rustling ball with cruel salient angles like a Chinese puzzle . The Elder had attended two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamely to his work . His prayer was not entirely satisfactory to the older people , they had expected a " little more power . " He was a thin-faced man , with weak brown eyes and a mouth like a gopher , that is , with very prominent upper teeth . His black coat was worn and shiny , and hung limply , as if at some other period he had been fatter , or as if it had belonged to some other man . The choir with instinctive skill had selected a wailing hymn , only slightly higher in development than the chant of the Indians , sweet , plaintive at times , barbaric in its moving cadences . They sang it well , in meditative march , looking out of the windows during its interminable length . Then the Elder read some passages of the Scripture in his " funeral voice , " which was entirely different from his " marriage voice " and his " Sunday voice . " It had deep cadences in it and chanting inflections , not unlike the negro preachers or the keeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which all joined in singing , rising to their feet with much trouble . After they had settled down again he took out a large carefully ironed handkerchief and laid it on the coffin as who should say , " If you have tears , prepare to shed them now . " The absurdity of all this did not appear to his listeners , though they well knew he cared very little about the dead man , who was a very retiring person . The Elder on his part understood that his audience was before him for the pleasure of weeping , for the delight of seeing agonized faces and hearing wild grief-laden wailing . They were there to feel the delicious creeping thrill of horror and fear , roused by the presence of the corpse and the near shadow of the hovering angel of death . The Elder led off by some purely perfunctory remarks about the deceased , about his kindness , and his honesty . This caused the nieces to wipe away a sparse tear or two , and he was encouraged as if by slight applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of life we are in death , that no man can tell when his time will come . He told two or three grewsome stories of sudden death . His voice now rose in a wild chant now sank to a hoarse whisper . The blowing of noses , low sobbings , and fervent amens from the old men thickened encouragingly , and he entered upon more impassioned flights . His voice , naturally sonorous , deepened in powerful song till the men seated comfortably on their haunches out by the haystack could plainly hear his words . " Oh , my brethren , what will you do in that last day ? " Sarah 's boys , without in the least understanding what it all meant , began to weep also and to use their handkerchiefs , so smooth and shining they were useless as so much legal-cap writing paper . Their misery would have been enhanced had they known that out in the wagon-shed under cover of the Elder 's voice the other boys were having a game of mummelly peg in the warm , dry ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robins out in the hedge near by defied the winds of March . Having harrowed the poor sensation-loving souls as thoroughly as could be desired , the Elder began the process of " letting them down easy . " He remembered that the Lord was merciful ; that the deceased could approach him with confidence ; that there was a life beyond the tomb , a life of eternal rest ( the allurement of all hard-working humanity ) . Slowly the snuffling and sobbing ceased , the handkerchiefs took longer and longer intervals of rest , and when in conclusion the preacher said , " Let us pray , " the old men looked at each other with fervent satisfaction . " It 's been a blessed time -- a blessed time ! " The pretty girl who sang the soprano looked very interesting with her wet eyelashes , the tears stopped halfway in their course down her rounded cheek . The closing hymn promised endless peace and rest , but was voiced in the same tragic and hopeless music with which the service opened . Deacon Williams came out to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have an opportunity . " He had the hospitable tone of a host inviting his guests in to dinner . Viewing the remains was considered a religious duty , and the men from outside , and even the boys from behind the smoke-house , felt constrained to come in and pass in shuddering horror before the still face whose breath did not dim the glass above it . Most of them hurried by the box with only a swift side glance down at the strange thing within . Then the bearers lifted the coffin and slipped it into the platform-spring wagon , which was backed up to the door . The other teams loaded up , and the procession moved off , down the perilously muddy road toward the village burying-ground . In this way was John Williams , a hard-working , honorable Welshman , buried . His death furnished forth a sombre , dramatic entertainment such as he himself had ceremoniously attended many times . The funeral trotters whom he had seen at every funeral in the valley were now in at his death , and would be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth claimed them all . A ceremony almost as interesting to the gossips as the burial was the reading of the will , to which only the family were invited . After the return of Emma , her husband , and Sarah from the cemetery , Deacon Williams read the dead man 's bequests , seated in the best room , which was still littered with chairs and damp with mud . The will was simple and not a surprise to any one . It gave equal division of all the property to the nieces . " Well , now , when 'll we have the settlement ? " asked the Deacon . " Just 's you say , Deacon , " said Emma , meekly . " Suit yourself , " said Harkey ; " only it ' ad better come soon . Sooner the better -- seedin 's coming on . " " Well , to-morrow is Friday , why not Saturday ? " " All right , Saturday . " All agreed . As Harkey drove off down the road he said to his wife : " The sooner we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The Deacon do n't favor me none , and Bill Gray is sweet on Serry , and he 'll bear watchin ' . " The Deacon on his part took his chin in his fist and looked after Harkey . " Seemed a little bit anxious , ' cordin ' to my notion , " he said , with a smile . II Saturday was deliciously warm and springlike , the hens woke in the early dawn with a jocund note in their throats , and the young cattle frisked about the barn-yard , moved to action by the electrical influences of the south wind . " Clear as a bell overhead , " Deacon Williams said . But Jack Dunlap , Sarah 's hand , said , " Nobody travels that way . " Long before dawn the noise of the melting water could be heard running with musical tinkle under the ice . The ponds crashed and boomed in long reverberating explosions , as the sinking water heaved it up and let it fall with crackling roar ; flights of ducks flashed over , cackling breathlessly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived early and took possession , for Sarah was to have the eighty which included the house . They were busy getting things ready for the partition . The Deacon , assisted by Jack , the hired man , was busy hauling the machinery out of the shed into the open air , while Sarah and a couple of neighbors ' girls , with skirts tucked up and towels on their heads , were scouring up pots and pans and dusting furniture in the kitchen . The girls , strong and handsome in their unsapped animal vigor , enjoyed the innocent display of their bare arms and petticoats . People from Sand Lake passing by wondered what was going on . Gideon Turner had the courage to pull up and call out , for the satisfaction of his wife :  --  " What 's going on here this fine morning ? " " Oh , we 're goin ' to settle up the estate ! " said Sarah . " Why ! how de do , Mrs. Turner ? " " W'y , it 's you , is it , Serry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they is left of me . I been here sence six o'clock . I 'm getting things ready for the division . Deacon Williams is the ex-ecutor , you know . " " Aha ! Less see , you divide equally , I hear . " " Near 's we can get at it . Uncle left me the house eighty , and the valley eighty to Emmy . Deacon 's goin ' to parcel out the belongin 's . " Turner looked sly . " How 'd Harkey feel ? " Sarah smiled . " I do n't know and care less . He 'll make trouble if he can , but I do n't see how he can . He agreed to have the Deacon do the dividin ' , and he 'll have to stand by it so far as I can see . " Mrs. Turner looked dubious . " Well , you know Ike Harkey . He looks as though sugar would n't melt in his mouth , but I tell you I 'd hate to have dealin 's with him . " Turner broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I s'pose you 'll move right in ? " " Yes . Just as soon 's as this thing 's settled . " " Well , good-by . Come up . " " You come down . " Sarah was a heavy , good-natured woman , a widow with " a raft of children . " Probably for that reason her uncle had left her the house , which was large and comfortable . As she stood looking down the road , one of the girls came out to the gate . She was a plump , strong creature , a neighbor 's girl who had volunteered to help . " Anybody coming ? " " Yes . I guess -- no , it 's going the other way . Ai n't it a nice day ? " That was as far as she could carry the utterance of her feeling , but all the morning she had felt the wonderful power of the air . The sun had risen incredibly warm . The wind was in the south , and the crackling , booming roar of ice in the ponds and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the land . Even the old cows shook their horns , and made comical attempts to frisk with the yearlings . Sarah knew it was foolish , but she felt like a girl that morning -- and Bill was coming up the road . In the midst of the joy of the spring day stood the house , desolate and empty , out of which its owner had been carried to a bed in the cold , clinging clay of the little burying-ground . The girls and Sarah worked swiftly , brushing , cleaning , setting aside , giving little thought to even the beauty of the morning , which entered their blood unconsciously . " Well , how goes it ? " asked a quick , jovial voice . The girls gave screams of affected fright . " Why , Deacon ! You nearly scared the life out of us . " Deacon Williams was always gallant . " I did n't know I was given to scaring the ladies , " he said . " Well , who 's here ? " " Nobody but us so far . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a thing . He sent word he 'd be on hand , though . " " M --  , well , we 've got the machinery invoiced . Guess I 'll look around and kind o ' get the household things in my mind 's eye , " said the Deacon , taking on the air of a public functionary . " All right . We 'll have everything ready here in a few minutes . " They returned to work , dusting and scrubbing . The girls with their banter put death into the background as an obscure and infrequent incident of old age . Sarah again studied the road down the Coolly . " Well there ! I see a team coming up the Coolly now ; wonder if it 's Emmy . " " Looks more like Bill Gray 's team , " said one of the girls , looking slyly at Sarah , who grew very red . " Oh , you 're too sharp , ai n't you ? " It was perfectly ridiculous ( to the young people ) to see these middle-aged lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either Bill or Sarah . Bill drove up in leisurely way , his horses steaming , his wagon-wheels loaded with mud . Mrs. Gray was with him , her jolly face shining like the morning sun . " Hello , folkses , are you all here ? " " Good morning , Mrs. Gray , " said the Deacon , approaching to help her out . " Hello , Bill , nice morning . " Bill looked at Sarah for a moment . " Bully good , " he said , leaving his mother to scramble down the wagon-wheel alone -- at least so far as he was concerned , but the Deacon stood below courageously . Mrs. Gray cried out in her loud good humor : " Look out , Deacon , do n't git too near me -- if I should fall on you there would n't be a grease spot left . There ! I 'm all right now , " she said , having reached ground without accident . She shook her dress and looked briskly around . " Wal , what you done , anyway ? Emmy 's folks come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's them comin ' now . I hope Ike wo n't come , though . " Mrs. Gray stared at the Deacon . " Why not ? " " Well , he 's just sure to make a fuss , " said Jack , " he 's so afraid he wo n't get his share . " Bill chewed on a straw and looked at Sarah abstractedly . " Well , what 's t ' be done ? " inquired Mrs. Gray , after a pause . " Ca n't do much till Emmy gets here , " said Sarah . " Oh , I guess we can . Bill , you put out y'r team , we wo n't get away ' fore dinner . " The men drove off to the barn , leaving the women to pick their way on chips and strips of board laid in the mud , to the safety of the chip-pile , and thence to the kitchen , which was desolately littered with utensils . Deacon assumed command with the same alertness , and with the same sunny gleam in his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , Bill , put out your team and help Jack and me pen them hogs . Women folks ' ll git things ready here . " Emma came at last , driven by Harkey 's brother and his hired man . They were both brawny fellows , rude and irritable , and the Deacon lifted his eyebrows and whistled when he saw them drive in with a lumber wagon . The women swarmed out to greet Emma , who was a thin , irritable , feeble woman . " Better late than never . Where 's Ike ? " inquired Mrs. Gray . " Well , he -- could n't git away very well -- he 's got t ' clean up some seed-oats , " she answered nervously . After the men drove off , however , she added : " He thought he had n't ought to come ; he did n't want to cause no aidgewise feelin 's , so he thought he had n't better come -- he 'd just leave it to you , Deacon . " The Deacon said , " All right , all right ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel so sure of it after that , though he set to work bravely . The sun , growing warmer , fell with pleasant gleam around the kitchen door and around the chip-pile where the hens were burrowing . The men worked in their shirt-sleeves . " Well , now , we 'll share the furniture an ' stuff next , " said the Deacon , looking around upon his little interested semicircle of spectators . " Now , put Emmy 's things over there and Serry 's things over here . I 'll call ' em off , and , if they 's no objection , you girls can pass ' em over . " He cleared his throat and began in the voice of one in authority :  --  " Thirteen pans , six to Emmy , seven to Serry ; " then hastened to add : " I 'll balance that by giving the biggest of the two kittles to Emmy . Rollin ' pin and cake board to Serry , two flat-irons to Emmy , small tub to Emmy , large one to Serry , balanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' half , six o ' one , half-dozen t' other , " he said with a smile at his own joke , while the others actively placed the articles in separate piles . " Stove to Serry , because she has the house , bureau to Emmy . " At this point Mrs. Gray said , " I guess that ai n't quite even , Deacon ; the bureau ai n't worth much . " " Oh , no , no , that 's all right ! Let her have it , " Emma protested nervously . " Give her an extry tick , anyway , " said Sarah , not to be outdone in magnanimity . " Settle that between ye , " said the Deacon . He warmed to his work now , and towels , pans , crockery , brooms , mirrors , pillows , and bedticks were rapidly set aside in two groups on the soft soil . The poverty of the home could best be seen in the display of its pitiful furniture . The two nieces looked on impassively , standing side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy things and looked on , while the lighter things were being handed over by Mrs. Gray and the girls . At noon they sat down in the empty kitchen and ate a cold snack -- at least , the women took seats , the men stood around and lunched on hunks of boiled beef and slices of bread . There was an air of constraint upon the male portion of the party not shared by Mrs. Gray and the girls . " Well , that settles things in the house , " beamed the Deacon as he came out with the women trailing behind him ; " an ' now in about two jerks of a dead lamb 's tail , we 'll git at the things out in the barn . " " Wal , we do n't know much about machines and things , but I guess we 'd better go out and keep you men from fightin ' , " said Mrs. Gray , shaking with fun ; " Ike did n't come because he did n't want to make any trouble , but I guess he might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critters as Jim ' n ' Hank . " The women laughed at her frankness , and in very good humor they all went out to the barn-yard . " Now , these things ca n't be laid out fast as I call ' em off , but we 'll do the best we can . " " Let 's try the stawk first , " said Jim . The women stood around with shawls pinned over their heads while the division of the stock went forward . The young men came often within chaffing distance of the girls . There were nine shotes nearly of a size , and the Deacon said , " I 'll give Serry the odd shote . " " Why so ? " asked Jim Harkey , a sullen-faced man of thirty . " Because a shote is hard to carry off and I can balance --  " " Well , I guess you can balance f'r Em ' bout as well as f'r Serry . " The Deacon was willing to yield a point . " Any objection , Bill ? If not , why --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill . " What ' ave you got to say ' bout it ? " asked Jim , insolently . Bill turned his slow bulk . " I guess I 've a good ' eal to say -- have n't I , Serry ? " Sarah reddened , but stood beside him bravely . " I guess you have , Bill , about as much as I have . " There was a moment of dramatic tension and the girls tingled with sympathy . " Let ' er go , " said Bill , splitting a straw with his knife . He had not proposed to Sarah before and he felt an unusual exaltation to think it came so easy after all . When they reached the cattle , Jim objected to striking a balance with a " farrer cow , " and threw the Deacon 's nice calculation all out of joint . " Let it go , Jim , " pleaded Emma . " I wo n't do it , " Ike said --  " I mean I know he do n't want no farrer cow , he 's got two now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess that 's going to stand , " he said sharply . Jim swore a little but gave in , and came back with an access of ill humor on a division of the horses . " But I 've give you the four heavy horses to balance the four others and the two-year-old , " said the Deacon . " I 'll be damned if I stand that , " said Jim . " I guess you 'll have to , " said the Deacon . Emma pleaded , " Let it go , Jim , do n't make a fuss . " Jim raged on , " I 'll be cawn-demmed if I 'll stand it . I don't -- Ike do n't want them spavined old crows ; they 're all ring-boned and got the heaves . " His long repressed ill-nature broke out . " Toh , toh ! " said the Deacon , " Do n't kick over the traces now . We 'll fix it up some way . " Emma tried to stop Jim , but he shook her off and continued to walk back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any dispute about their value . Bill sat on the oat box in his hulking way , his heels thumping a tune , his small gray eyes watching the angry man . " Do n't make a darn fool of yourself , " he said placidly . Jim turned , glad of the chance for a row , " You better keep out of this . " Bill continued to thump , the palms of his big hands resting on the edge of the box . " I 'm in it , " he said conclusively . " Well , you git out of it ! I ai n't goin ' to be bulldozed -- that ai n't what I come here for . " " No , I see it ai n't , " said Bill . " If you 're after a row you can have it right here . You wo n't find a better place . " " There , there , " urged the Deacon . " What 's the use ? Keep cool and do n't tear your shirts . " Mrs. Gray went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a good spankin ' to make you good-natured , " she said . " I think the Deacon has done first rate , and you ought ' o --  " " Let go o ' me , " he snarled , raising his hand as if to strike her . Bill 's big boot lunged out , catching Harkey in the ribs , and if the Deacon had not sprung to his assistance Jim would have been trampled to pieces by the scared horse under whose feet he found himself . He was wild with dizzy , breathless rage . " Who hit me ? " he demanded . Bill 's shapeless hulk straightened up and stood beside him as if his pink flesh had suddenly turned to oak . Out of his fat cheeks his gray eyes glared . " I did . Want another ? " The Deacon and Jack came between and prevented the encounter which would have immediately followed . Bill went on :  --  " They cai n't no man lay a hand on my mother and live long after it . " He was thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment , and Jim was secretly pleased to have the encounter go by . " You come here for a fuss and you can have it , both of you , " Bill went on in unusual eloquence . " Deacon 's tried to do the square thing , Emmy 's tried to do the square thing , and Serry 's kep ' quiet , but you 've been sour and ugly the whole time , and now it 's goin ' to stop . " " This ai n't the last of this thing , " said Jim . " You never 'll have a better time , " said Bill . Mrs. Gray and the Deacon turned in now to quiet Bill , and the settlement went on . Jim kept close watch on the proceedings , and muttered his dissent to his friends , but was careful not to provoke Bill further . In dividing the harnesses they came upon a cow-bell hanging on a nail . The Deacon jingled it as he passed . " Goes with the bell-cow , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consider it worth quarrelling about . At last the work was done , a terribly hard day 's work . The machines and utensils were piled in separate places , the cattle separated , and the grain measured . As they were about to leave , the Deacon said finally :  --  " If there 's any complaint to make , let 's have it right now . I want this settlement to be a settlement . Is everybody satisfied ? " " I am , " said Emmy . " Ai n't you , Serry ? " " Why , of course , " said Sarah , who was a little slower of speech . " I think the Deacon has done first rate . I ai n't a word of fault to find , have you , Bill ? " " Nope , not an ioty , " said Bill , readily . Jim did not agree in so many words , but , as he said nothing , the Deacon ended :  --  " Well , that settles it . It ai n't goin ' to rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday . I guess I 'll be gettin ' out for home . Good evening , everybody . " Emma drove away down the road with Jim , but Sarah remained to straighten up the house . Harkey 's hired hand went home with Dade Walker who considered that walk the pleasant finish to a very interesting day 's work . She sympathized for the time with the Harkey faction . Sunday forenoon , when Bill and Sarah drove up to the farm to put things in order in the house , they found Ike Harkey walking around with that queer side glance he had , studying the piles of furniture , and mentally weighing the pigs . He greeted them smoothly : " Yes , yes , I 'm purrfickly satisfied , purrfickly ! Not a word to say -- better'n I expected , " he added . Bill was not quite keen enough to perceive the insult which lay in that final clause , and Sarah dared not inform him for fear of trouble . As Harkey drove away , however , Bill had a dim feeling of dissatisfaction with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ; I do n't like such butter-mouth chaps -- they 'd steal the cents off'n a dead nigger 's eyes . " III The second Sunday after the partition of goods the entire Coolly turned out to church in spite of the muddy road . The men , after driving up to the door of the little white church and helping the women to alight , drove out to the sheds along the fence and gathered in knots beside their wagons in the warm spring sun . It was very pleasant there , and the men leaned with relaxed muscles upon the wagon-wheels , or sat on the fence with jack-knives in hand . The horses , weary with six days seeding , slept with closed eyes and drooping lips . Generally the talk was upon spring work , each man bragging of the number of acres he had sown during the week , but this morning the talk was all about the division which had come between the nieces of " deceased Williams . " They discussed it slowly as one might eat a choice pudding in order to extract the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , anyhow ? " asked Jim Cranby . " I ai n't heard nothing about it . " He had stood in open-mouthed perplexity trying to catch a clew . Coming late , he found it baffling . " That shows where he lives ; a man might as well live in a well as up in Molasses Gap , " said one of the younger men , pointing up to the Coolly . " Why , Ike Harkey is kicking about the six shotes the Deacon put off on him . " " No , it was n't the shotes , it was a farrer cow , " put in Clint Stone . " Well , I heard it was a shote . " " So did I , " said another . " Well , Bill Gray told Jinks Ike had stole a cow-bell that belonged to the black farrer cow , " said another late comer . " Stole a cow-bell , " and they all drew closer together . This was really worth while ! " Yes , sir ; Jinks told me he heard Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Well , I 'll be cussed , if that ai n't small business for Ike Harkey ! " " How did it happen ? " asked Cranby , with sharpened appetite . " Well , I did n't hear no p'rtic'lars , but it seems the bell was hangin ' on a peg in the barn , and when they got home from church it was gone , hide an ' hair . Bill is dead sure Ike took it . " " Say , there 'll be fun over that yet , wo n't they , " said one of the fellows , with a grin . " Well , Ike better keep out of Bill 's way , that 's all . " " Well -- I ai n't takin ' sides . Some young'un may have took it . " " Well , let 's go in , boys ; I see the Elder 's come . By gum , there 's Harkey ! " They all looked toward Harkey , who had just driven up to the door . Harkey came into church holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual way , quiet and dignified , as if he were living up to his Sunday suit of clothes . He seemed to be unconscious of the attitude in which he stood toward most of his neighbors . Bill and Sarah were not present , and that gave additional color to the story of trouble between the sisters . After the sermon Deacon Harkey led the Sunday School , and the critics of his action were impressed more than usual with his smooth and quiet utterance . Emma seemed more than ordinarily worn and dispirited . It was perfectly natural that Mrs. Gray should be the last person to know of the division which had slowly set in between the two sisters and their factions . Charitable and guileless herself , it was difficult for her to conceive of slander and envy . Nevertheless , a division had come about , slowly , but decisively . The entire Coolly was involved in the discussion before Mrs. Gray gave it any serious attention , but one day , when Sarah came in upon her and poured out a mingled flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , well , I swan ! There , there ! I would n't make so much fuss over it ! " she said , stripping her hands out of the biscuit dough in order to go over and pat Sarah on the shoulder . " After all that to-do gettin ' settled , seems ' s if you ought ' o stay settled . Good land ! It ai n't anything to have a fuss over , anyway ! " " But it is our cow-bell . It belonged on the black farrer cow , that Jim turned his nose up at , and he sneaked around and got it just to spite us . " " Oh , I guess not , " she replied incredulously . " Well , he did ; and Emmy put him up to it , and I know she did , " said Sarah in a lamentable voice . " Sary Ann , " said Mrs. Gray , as sharply as any one ever heard her speak , " that 's a pretty way to talk about your sister , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You never mind what Mrs. Jim Harkey said ; she 's a snoop and everybody knows it . " " But she would n't tell that , if it were n't so . " " Well , I tell you , I would n't pay no attention to what she said , and I would n't make such a fuss over an old cow-bell , anyway . " " But the cow-bell is only the starting point ; she ai n't been near the house since , and she says all kinds of mean , nasty things about us . " " All comes through Mrs. Jim , I suppose , " said Mrs. Gray , with some sarcasm . " No , it do n't . She told Dade Walker that I got all the biggest flat-irons , when she knows I offered her the bureau . I did everything I could to make her feel satisfied . " " I know you did , and now you must just keep cool till I see Emmy myself . " When Mrs. Gray started out on her mission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her control . The Coolly was actively partisan . One party stood by the Harkeys , and another took Sarah 's part , while the tertium quid said it was " all darn foolishness . " Mrs. Gray was appalled at the state of affairs , but struggled to maintain a neutral position . In May , when Bill and Sarah were married , things had reached such a stage that Emma was not invited to the wedding supper . Nothing could have cut deeper than this neglect , and thereafter adherents of the third remove declined to speak when passing ; some even refused to nod . The Harkey faction also condemned the early marriage of Bill and Sarah as unseemly . Soon after , Emma came again to see Mrs. Gray , salty with tears , and crushed with the slight Sarah had put upon her . She was a plain pale woman , anyway , and weeping made her pitiable . She explained the situation with her head on Mrs. Gray 's lap :  --  " She never has been to see me since that day , and -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never sent me any invitation to her wedding . " She choked with sobs at the memory of it . Mrs. Gray realized the enormity of the offence , and she could only put her arms around Emma 's back and say , " There , there , I would n't take on so about it . " As a matter of fact , she had striven to have Bill send an invitation to his brother-in-law , but Bill was inflexible on that point . With the sound of the stolen cow-bell ringing in his ears , he could not bring himself to ask Ike Harkey into his house . After Emma grew a little calmer , Mrs. Gray tried again to bridge the chasm . " Now , I just believe if you would go to Sarah --  " " I ca n't do that ! She 'd slam the door in my face . Jim 's wife says Sarah said I should n't pick a single currant out of the garden this year ! " " I do n't go much on what Jim 's wife says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that Jim 's wife was the main disturbing element . The sisters really suffered from their separation . They had been so used to running in at all times of the day that each missed the other wofully . It had been their habit whenever they needed each other to help cook , or cut a dress , to hang a cloth out of the chamber window , a sign which was sure to bring help post-haste ; but now nothing would induce either of them to make the first concession . Two or three times when Emma , feeling especially lonely , was on the point of hanging out the signal , she was prevented by the thought of some cruel message Mrs. Jim had brought . Jim lived on Ike 's farm in a small house that had been Emma 's first home , and Mrs. Jim was almost as much in her house as in her own . She had no children , and was a mischief-maker , not so much from ill will as from a love of dramatic situations ; it was her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors . Emma feared her husband , too ; he was so self-contained , and so inexorably moral , at least in appearance . He sweetly said he bore no ill will toward the Grays , but he must insist that his wife should not visit them until they apologized . He took the matter very serenely , however . The sound of the cow-bell was a constant daily irritation to Bill ; he was slow to wrath , but the bell seemed to rasp on his tenderest nerve ; it had a curiously exultant sound heard in the early morning -- it seemed to voice Harkey 's triumph . Bill 's friends were astonished at the change in him . He grew dark and thunderous with wrath whenever Harkey 's name was mentioned . One day Ike 's cattle broke out of the pasture into Bill 's young oats , and though Ike hurried after them , it seemed to Bill he might have got them out a little quicker than he did . He said nothing then , however , but when a few days later they broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want this thing stopped , " he said . Ike was mending the fence . He smiled in his sweet way , and said smoothly , " I 'm sorry , but when they once git a taste of grain it 's pretty hard to keep ' em --  " " Well , there ought to be a new fence here , " said Bill . " That fence is as rotten as a pumpkin . " " I s'pose they had ; yes , sir , that 's so , " Harkey assented quickly . " I 'm ready to build my half , you know , " he said , " any time -- any time you are . " " Well , I 'll build mine to-morrow , " said Bill . " I ca n't have your cattle pasturing on my oats . " " All right , all right . I 'll have mine done as quick as yourn . " " Well , see't you do ; I do n't want my grain all tramped into the ground and I ai n't a-goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Yes , yes , all right . " " You might send home that cow-bell of mine while you 're about it , " Bill called after him , but Harkey did not reply or turn around . IV The line fence ran up the bluff toward the summit of the ridge to the east . On each side it was set with smooth green slopes of pasture and pleasant squares of wheat , until it reached the woods and ran under the oaks and walnuts and birches to the cliffs of lichen-spotted stone which topped the summit . Bill walked the full length of the fence to see how much of the old material could be used . He recognized the bell on one of Harkey 's cattle , and he grew wrathful at the sight of another cow peacefully gnawing the fresh , green grass , with the bell , which belonged to the black cow , on her neck . It was mid-spring . Everywhere was the vivid green of the Wisconsin landscape ; the slopes were like carefully tended lawns , without stumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and gray and green in softly rounded billows of cherry bloom and tender oak and elm foliage . Here and there under the forest tender plants and flowers had sprung up , slender and succulent like all productions of a rich and shadowed soil . Early the next morning Bill and his two hands began to work in the meadow , working toward the ridge ; Harkey and his brother and their hands began at the ridge and worked down toward the meadow ; each party could hear the axes of the other ringing in the still , beautiful spring air . Bill 's hired hand , on his way to the spring about the middle of the forenoon , met Jim Harkey , who said wickedly in answer to a jocular greeting :  --  " Do n't give me none of your lip now ; we 'll break your necks for two cents . " The hand came to Bill with the story . " Bill , they 're on the fight . " " Oh , I guess not . " " Well , they be . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want trouble . " " Well , I ai n't goin ' to dodge ' em , " said Bill ; " I ai n't in that business ; if they want fight , we 'll accommodate ' em with the best we 've got in the shop . " At noon , Harkey 's gang went to dinner a little earlier , and , as they came down the path quite near , Jim said with a sneer :  --  " You managed to git the easiest half of the fence , did n't yeh ? " " We took the half that belongs to us , " said Bill . " We do n't take what do n't belong to us . " " Cow-bells , for instance , " put in Bill 's hired hand , with a provoking intonation . Jim stopped and his face twisted with rage ; Ike paused a little farther on down the path . Jim came closer . " Say , I know what you 're driving at and you 're a liar , and for a leather cent I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . You do n't weigh enough . " " Oh , shut up , Jack , " called Bill . " Go about y'r business , " he said to Jim , " or I 'll take a hand . " Jim 's face flamed into a wild wrath . His lips lifted at the corners like a wolf 's as he leaped the fence with a wild spring and lunged against Bill 's breast . The larger man went down , but his great arms closed about his assailant 's neck with a bear-like grip . Jim could neither rise nor strike ; with a fury no animal could equal he pressed his hands upon Bill 's throat and thrust his elbow into his mouth in the attempt to strangle him . He meant murder . Jack faced the other men , who came running up . Ike seized a stake , and was about to leap over , when Jack raised an axe in the air . " Stand off ! " he yelled , and his voice rang through the woods ; he noticed how harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grunting sound , and gave one glance at the two men writhing amid the ferns silent as grappling bull-dogs . Bill had fallen in the brake and seemed wedged in . At last there came into his heart a terrible shiver , a blind desperation that uncoiled all the strength in his great bulk . Then he seemed to bound from the ground , as he twisted the other man under him , and shook himself free . He dragged one great maul of a fist free and drove it at the face beneath him . Jim saw it coming and turned his head . The blow fell on his neck and his carnivorous grin smoothed out as if sleep had suddenly fallen upon him . He drew a long , shuddering breath , his muscles quivered , and his clenched hands fell open . Bill rose upon his knees and looked at him . A deep awe fell upon him . In the pause he heard the robins rioting from the trees in the lower valley , and the woodpecker cried resoundingly . " You 've killed him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . Bill did not reply . The men faced each other in solemn silence , all wish for murder going out of their hearts . The sobbing cry of the mourning dove , which they had been hearing all day , suddenly assumed new meaning . " Ah , woe , woe is me ! " it cried . " Bring water ! " shouted Ike , kneeling beside his brother . Bill knelt there with him , while the rest dashed water upon Jim 's face . At last he began to breathe like a fretful , waking child , and looking up into the scared faces above him , motioned the water away from him . The angry look came back into his face , but it was mixed with perplexity . He touched his hand to his face and brought it down covered with blood . " How much am I hurt ? " he said fiercely . " Oh , nothing much , " Ike hastened to say ; " it 's just a scratch . " Jim struggled to his elbow and looked around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did he do it fair ? " he demanded of his companions . " Oh , yes ; it was fair enough , " said Ike . Jim looked at Jack . " That thing did n't hit me with his axe , did he ? " Jack grinned . " No , but I was just a-goin ' to when Bill belted you one , " was the frank and convincing reply . Jim got up slowly and faced Bill . " Well , that settles it ; it 's all right ! You 're a better man than I am . That 's all I 've got to say . " He climbed back over the fence and led the way down to dinner without looking back . " What give ye that lick on the side o ' the head , Jim ? " his wife asked , when he sat down at the dinner-table . " Never you mind , " he replied surlily , but he added , " Ike 's axe come off , and give me a side-winder . " Bill carefully removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all muscle gone out of his bulk of fat . His sudden return to primeval savagery grew monstrous in the cheerful kitchen , with its noise of hearty children , sizzling meat , and the clatter of dishes . The stove was not drawing well and Sarah did not notice anything out of the way with Bill . " I never see such a hateful thing in all my life , " she said , referring to the stove . " That rhubarb duff wo n't be fit for a hog to eat ; the undercrust ai n't baked the least bit yet , and I have had it in there since fifteen minutes after ' leven . " Bill said generously , " Oh , well , never mind , Serry ; we 'll worry it down some way . " V All through July and August Mrs. Jim Harkey seemed to renew her endeavors to keep the sisters apart ; she still carried spiteful tales to and fro , amplifying them with an irresistible histronic tendency . It had become a matter of self-exoneration with her then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been mischief-making in the past . If the sisters should come together , her lies would instantly appear . Emma grew morose , irritable , and melancholy ; she was suffering for her sister 's wholesome presence , and yet , being under the dominion of the mischief-maker , dared not send word or even mention the name of her sister in the presence of the Harkeys . Mrs. Jim came up to the house to stay as Emma got too ill to work , and took charge of the house . The children hated her fiercely , and there were noisy battles in the kitchen constantly wearing upon the nerves of the sick woman who lay in the restricted gloom of the sitting room bed-chamber , within hearing of every squall . There were moments of peace only when Ike was in the house . Smooth as he was , Jim 's wife was afraid of him . There was something compelling in his low-toned voice ; his presence subdued but did not remove strife . His silencing of the tumult hardly arose out of any consideration for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper while the clamor of war was going on about him . He was not a tender man , and yet he prided himself on being a very calm and even-tempered man . He kept out of Bill 's way , and considered himself entirely justified in his position regarding the cow-bell . It is doubtful if he would have accepted an apology . Emma suffered acutely from Mrs. Harkey 's visits . Something mean and wearying went out from her presence , and her sharp , bold face was a constant irritation . Sometimes when she thought herself alone , Emma crawled to the window which looked up the Coolly , toward Sarah 's home , and sat there silently longing to send out a cry for help . But at the sound of Jane Harkey 's step she fled back into bed like a frightened child . She became more and more childish and more flighty in her thoughts as her time of trial drew near , and she became more subject to her jailer . She grew morbidly silent , and her large eyes were restless and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the kitchen . " How is Emmy to-day , Mrs. Jim ? " " Well , not extry . She ai n't likely to come out as well as usual this time , I do n't think , " was the brutally incautious reply ; " she 's pretty well run down , and I would n't be surprised if she had some trouble . " " I suppose Sarah will be down to help you , " said Mrs. Smith . " Well , I guess not -- not after what she 's told . " " What has she told ? " asked Mrs. Smith , in her sweet and friendly voice . " Why , she said she would n't set foot in this house if we all died . " " I never heard her say that , and I do n't believe she ever did say it , " said Mrs. Smith , firmly . Emma 's heart glowed with a swift rush of affection toward her sister and Mrs. Smith ; she wanted to cry out her faith in Sarah , but she dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you can believe it or not , just as you like ; I heard her say it . " " Well , I did n't , so I ca n't believe it . " When Mrs. Smith came in , Emma was ready to weep , so sweet and cheery was her visitor 's face . She found no chance to talk with her , however , for Mrs. Harkey kept near them during her visit . Once , while Mrs. Jim ran out to look at the pies , Mrs. Smith whispered : " Do n't you believe what they say about Sarah . She 's just as kind as can be -- I know she is . She 's looking down this way every day , and I know she 'd come down instanter if you 'd send for her . I 'm going up that way , and --  " She found no further chance to say anything , but from that moment Emma began to think of letting Sarah know how much she needed her . She planned to hang out the cloth as she used to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it attained the significance of an act of treason . She felt like a criminal even in thinking about it . Several times in the night she dreamed she had put the cloth out and that Jim and his wife had seen it and torn it down . She awoke two or three times to find herself sitting up in bed staring out of the window , through which the moon shone and the multitudinous sounds of the mid-summer insects came sonorously . Once her husband said , " What 's the matter ? It seems to me you 'd rest better if you 'd lay down and keep quiet . " His voice was low enough , but it had a peculiar inflection , which made her sink back into bed by his side , shivering with fear and weeping silently . The next day Jim and her husband both went off to town , and Jim 's wife , after about ten o'clock , said :  --  " Now , Emmy , I 'm going down to Smith 's to get a dress pattern , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be right back ; I 'll set some water here , and I guess you wo n't want anything else until I get back . I 'll run right down and right back . " After hearing the door close , Emma lay for a few minutes listening , waiting until she felt sure Mrs. Harkey was well out of the yard , then she crept out of bed and crawled to the window . Mrs. Jim was far down the road ; she could see her blue dress and her pink sunbonnet . The sick woman seized the sheet and pulled it from the bed ; the clothes came with it , but she did not mind that . She pulled herself painfully up the stairway and across the rough floor of the chamber to the window which looked toward her sister 's house , and with a wild exultation flung the sheet far out and dropped on her knees beside the open window . She moaned and cried wildly as she waved the sheet . The note of a scared child was in her voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you , Serry ! I did n't mean to be mean ; I want to see you so ! Oh , dear , oh , dear ! Oh , Serry , come quick ! " Then space and the world slipped away , and she knew nothing of time again until she heard the anxious voice of Sarah below . " Emmy , where are you , Emmy ? " " Here I be , Serry . " With swift , heavy tread Sarah hurried up the stairs , and the dear old face shone upon her again ; those kind gray eyes full of anxiety and of love . Emma looked up like a child entreating to be lifted . Her look so pitifully eager went to the younger sister 's maternal heart . " You poor , dear soul ! Why did n't you send for me before ? " " Oh , Serry , do n't leave me again , will you ? " When Mrs. Harkey returned she found Sarah sitting by Emma 's side in the bed-chamber . Sarah looked at her with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't needed here , " she said coldly . " If you want to do anything , find a man and send him for the Doctor -- quick . If she dies you 'll be her murderer . " Mrs. Harkey was subdued by the bitterness of accusation in Sarah 's face as well as by Emma 's condition . She hurried down the Coolly and sent a boy wildly galloping toward the town . Then she went home and sat down by her own hearthstone feeling deeply injured . When the Doctor came he found a poor little boy baby crying in Sarah 's arms . It was Emma 's seventh child , but the ever sufficing mother-love looked from her eyes undimmed , limitless as the air . " Will it live , Doctor ? It 's so little , " she said , with a sigh . " Oh , yes , I suppose so ! " said the Doctor , as if its living were not entirely a blessing to itself or others . " Yes , I 've seen lots of lusty children begin life like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , " she needs better care than the babe ! " " She 'll git it , " said Sarah , with deep solemnity , " if I have to move over here -- and live . " A FAIR EXILE The train was ambling across the hot , russet plain . The wind , strong and warm and dry , sweeping up from the south , carried with it the subtle odor of September grass and gathered harvests . Out of the unfenced roads the dust arose in long lines , like smoke from some hidden burning which the riven earth revealed . The fields were tenanted with thrashing crews , the men diminished by distance to pygmies , the long belt of the engine flapping and shining like a ribbon in the flaming sunlight . The freight-cars on the accommodation train jostled and rocked about and heaved up laterally till they resembled a long line of awkward , frightened , galloping buffaloes . The one coach was scantily filled with passengers , mainly poorly clothed farmers and their families . A young man seated well back in the coach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a keen-eyed young fellow , after passing him several times , said , in a friendly way : " Going up to Boomtown , I imagine . " " Yes -- if we ever get there . " " Oh , we 'll get there . We wo n't have much more switching . We 've only got an empty car or two to throw in at the junction . " " Well , I 'm glad of that . I 'm a little impatient , because I 've got a case coming up in court , and I 'm not exactly fixed for it . " " Your name is Allen , I believe . " " Yes ; J. H. Allen , of Sioux City . " " I thought so . I 've heard you speak . " The young lawyer was a tall , slender , dark-eyed man , rather sombre in appearance . He did not respond to the invitation in the conductor 's voice . " When do you reach the junction ? " " Next stop . We 're only a few minutes late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd get a lunch , that 's all . " At the junction the car became pretty well filled with people . Two or three Norwegian families came clattering in , the mothers clothed in heavy shawls and cheap straw hats , the flaxen-haired children in faded cottonade and blue denims . They filled nearly half the seats . Several drummers came in , laughing loudly , bearing heavy valises . Then Allen heard , above the noise , the shrill but sweet voice of a girl , and caught the odor of violets as two persons passed him and took a seat just before him . The man he knew by sight and reputation as a very brilliant young lawyer -- Edward Benson , of Heron Lake . The girl he knew instantly to be utterly alien to this land and people . She was like a tropic bird seen amid the scant foliage of northern hills . There was evidence of great care and taste in every fold of her modish dress . Her hat was simple but in the latest city fashion , and her gloves were spotless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was very young and slender . Her face was piquant but not intellectual , and scarcely beautiful . It pleased rather by its life and motion and oddity than by its beauty . She looked at her companion in a peculiar way -- trustfully , almost reverently -- and yet with a touch of coquetry which seemed perfectly native to every turn of her body or glance of her eyes . Her companion was a fine Western type of self-made man . He was tall and broad-shouldered , but walked a little stooping , like a man of fifty . He wore a long Prince Albert frock-coat , hanging loosely from his rather square shoulders . His white vest was noticeably soiled by his watch chain , and his tie was disarranged . His face was very fine and good . His eyes were gray-blue , deep and quiet , but slightly smiling , as were his lips , which his golden-brown mustache shaded but did not hide . He was kept smiling in this quizzical way by the nervous chatter of the girl beside him . His profile , which was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , straight nose and abrupt forehead formed a marked contrast to the rather characterless nose and retreating forehead of the girl . The first words that Allen distinguished out of the merry war in which they seemed engaged were spoken in the tone of pretty petulance such women use -- a coquette 's defence . " You did ! you did ! you did ! Now ! You know you did ! You told me that ! You told me you despised girls like me ! " " I said I despised women who had no object in life but dress , " he replied , rather soberly . " But you were hopping on me ; you meant me , now ! You ca n't deny it ! You despise me , I know you do ! " She challenged his flattery in her pouting self-depreciation . The young man tried to stop her in her course , to change her mood , which was descending to real feeling . His low words were lost in the rumble of the car . " Yes , yes , try to smooth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't want you to flatter me and lie to me the way Judge Stearns did , " she added , with a sudden change of manner . " I like you because you 're straight . " The phrase with which she ended seemed to take on a new meaning , uttered by those red lips in childish pout . " Now , why are you down on the judge ? I do n't see , " said the man , as if she had gone back to an old attack . " Well , if you 'd seen what I have , you 'd understand . " She turned away and looked out of the window . " Oh , this terrible country ! I 'd die out here in six weeks . I know I should . " The young lawyer was not to be turned aside . " Of course , I 'm pleased to have you throw the judge over and employ me , but , all the same , I think you do him an injustice . He 's a good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , turning to him with a sudden fury in her eyes . " Do you call it square for a man -- married , and gray-haired , too -- to take up with a woman like Mrs. Shellberg ? Say , do you , now ? " " Well , I do n't quite believe --  " " Oh , I lie , do I ? " she cried , with another swift change to reproach . " You ca n't take my word for Mrs. Shellberg 's visits to his office . " " But he was her lawyer . " " But you know what kind of a woman she is ! She did n't need to go there every day or two , did she ? What did he always receive her in his private office for ? Come , now , tell me that ! " " I do n't know that he did , " persisted the lawyer . A sort of convulsion passed over her face , her little hands clinched , and the tears started into her eyes . Her voice was very quiet . " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mistaken , just as other jealous women have --  " " You think I 'm jealous , do you ? " " You act like a jeal --  " " Jealous of that gray-haired old wretch ? No , sir ! I -- I --  " She struggled to express herself . " I liked him , and I hated to lose all my faith in men . I thought he was good and honest when he prayed -- Oh , I 've seen him pray in church , the old hypocrite ! " Her fury returned at the recollection . Her companion 's face grew grave . The smile went out of his eyes , leaving them dark and sorrowful . " I understand you now , " he said , at last . She turned to look at him . " My practice in the divorce business out here has almost destroyed my faith in women . If it were n't for my wife and sister --  " She broke in eagerly : " Now I know you know what I mean . Sometimes I think men are -- devils ! " She thrust this word forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the judge kept me from thinking -- I never loved my father ; he did n't care for me ; all he wanted to do was to make ten thousand barrels of beer a year and sell it ; and the judge seemed like a father to me till she came and destroyed my faith in him . " " But -- well , let Mrs. S. go . There are lots of good men and pure women in the world . It 's dangerous to think there aren't -- especially for a handsome young woman like you . You ca n't afford to keep in that kind of a mood long . " She looked at him curiously . " That 's what I like about you , " she said , soberly . " You talk to me as if I had some sense -- as if I were a human being . If you were to flatter me , now , and make love to me , I never would believe in any man again . " He smiled again in his frank , good way , and drew a picture from his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laughing , naked child , sprawling frogwise in her lap . The woman 's face was broad and intellectual and handsome . The look of splendid maternity was in her eyes . They both looked at the picture in silence . The girl sighed . " I wish I was as good as that woman looks . " " You can be if you try . " " Not with a big Chicago brewer for a father , and a husband that beats you whenever the mood takes him . " " I admit that 's hard . I think the atmosphere of that Heron Lake hotel is n't any great help to you . " " Oh , they 're a gay lot there ! We fight like cats and dogs . " A look of slyness and boldness came over her face . " Mrs. Shellberg hates me as hard as I do her . She used to go around telling : ' It 's very peculiar , you know ' " she imitated her rival 's voice --  " ' but no matter which end of the dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " The young lawyer laughed at her in spite of himself . And she went on : " But they do n't , now . That 's the reason she hates me , " she said , in conclusion . " The men do n't notice her when I 'm around . " To hear her fresh young lips utter those words with their vile inflections was like taking a sudden glimpse into the underworld , where harlots dwell and the spirits of unrestrained lusts dance in the shadowy recesses of the human heart . Allen , hearing this fragmentary conversation , fascinated yet uneasy , looked at the pair with wonder . They seemed quite unconscious of their public situation . The young lawyer looked straight before him , while the girl , swept on by her ignoble rage , displayed still more of the moral ulceration which had been injected into her young life . " I do n't see what men find about her to like -- unless it is her eyes . She 's got beautiful eyes . But she 's vulgar -- ugh ! The stories she tells -- right before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ahead of her , that woman would ! And yet she 'll come into my room and cry and cry , and say : ' Do n't take him away from me ! Leave him to me ! ' Ugh ! It makes me sick . " She stamped her foot , then added , irrelevantly : " She wears a wig , too . I suppose that old fool of a judge thinks it 's her own hair . " The lawyer sat in stony silence . His grave face was accusing in its set expression , and she felt it , and was spurred on to do still deeper injustice to herself -- an insane perversity . " Not that I care a cent -- I 'm not jealous of her . I ai n't so bad off for company as she is . She ca n't take anybody away from me , but she must go and break down my faith in the judge . " She bit her lips to keep from crying out . She looked out of the window again , seeking control . The " divorce colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when delineated by this dainty young girl . Allen could see the swarming men about the hotels ; he could see their hot , leering eyes and smell their liquor-laden breaths as they named the latest addition to the colony or boasted of their associations with those already well known . The girl turned suddenly to her companion . " How do those people live out here on their farms ? " She pointed at a small shanty where the whole family stood to watch the train go by . " By eating boiled potatoes and salt pork . " " Salt pork ! " she echoed , as if salt pork were old boot-heels or bark or hay . " Why , it takes four hours for salt pork to digest ! " He laughed again at her childish irrelevancy . " So much the better for the poor . Where 'd you learn all that , anyway ? " " At school . Oh , you need n't look so incredulous ! I went to boarding-school . I learned a good deal more than you think . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said pork digested in three hours , speaking from experience . " " Well , it do n't . What do the women do out here ? " " They work like the men , only more so . " " Do they have any new things ? " " Not very often , I 'm afraid . " She sighed . After a pause , she said : " You were raised on a farm ? " " Yes . In Minnesota . " " Did you do work like that ? " She pointed at a thrashing-machine in the field . " Yes , I ploughed and sowed and reaped and mowed . I was n't on the farm for my health . " " You 're very strong , are n't you ? " she asked , admiringly . " In a slab-sided kind of a way -- yes . " Her eyes grew abstracted . " I like strong men . Ollie was a little man , not any taller than I am , but when he was drunk he was what men call a -- a holy terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby was born . I wish he 'd killed me . " She ended in a sudden reaction to hopeless bitterness . " It would have saved me all these months of life in this terrible country . " " It might have saved you from more than you think , " he said , quietly , tenderly . " What do you mean ? " " You 've been brought up against women and men who have defiled you . They 've made your future uncertain . " " Do you think it 's so bad as that ? Tell me ! " she insisted , seeing his hesitation . " You 're on the road to hell ! " he said , in a voice that was very low , but it reached her . It was full of pain and grave reprimand and gentleness . " You 've been poisoned . You 're in need of a good man 's help . You need the companionship of good , earnest women instead of painted harlots . " Her voice shook painfully as she replied : " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not bad at all -- you 're simply reckless . You are not to blame . It depends upon yourself now , though , whether you keep a true woman or go to hell with Mrs. Shellberg . " The conductor eyed them , as he passed , with an unpleasant light in his eyes , and the drummers a few seats ahead turned to look at them . The tip had passed along from lip to lip . They were like wild beasts roused by the presence of prey . Their eyes gleamed with relentless lust . They eyed the little creature with ravening eyes . Her helplessness was their opportunity . Allen , sitting there , entered into the terror and the tragedy of the girl 's life . He imagined her reckless , prodigal girlhood ; the coarse , rich father ; the marriage , when a thoughtless girl , with a drunken , dissolute boy ; the quarrels , brutal beatings ; the haste to secure a divorce ; the contamination of the crowded hotels in Heron Lake , where this slender young girl -- naturally pure , alert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His heart ached for her . The deep , slow voice of the lawyer sounded on . His eyes , turned toward her , had no equivocal look . He was a brother speaking to a younger sister . The tears fell down her cheeks , upon her folded hands . Her widely opened eyes seemed to look out into a night of storms . " Oh , what shall I do ? " she moaned . " I wish I was dead -- and baby , too ! " " Live for the baby -- let him help you out . " " Oh , he ca n't ! I do n't care enough for him . I wish I was like other mothers , but I 'm not . I ca n't shut myself up with a baby . I 'm too young . " He saw that . She was seeking the love of a man , not the care of a child . She had the wifely passion , but not the mother 's love . He was silent ; the case baffled him . " Oh , I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me all the time ! I do ! I do n't care what you think -- I do ! I do ! " " Our home is open to you and baby , too , " he said , slowly . " My wife knows about you , and --  " " Who told her -- did you ? " she flashed out again , angrily , jealously . " Yes . My wife is my other self , " he replied , quietly . She stared at him , breathing heavily , then looked out of the window again . At last she turned to him . She seemed to refer to his invitation . " Oh , this terrible land ! Oh , I could n't stay here ! I 'd go insane . Perhaps I 'm going insane , anyway . Do n't you think so ? " " No , I think you 're a little nervous , that 's all . " " Oh ! Do you think I 'll get my divorce ? " " Certainly , without question . " " Can I wait and go back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Perhaps you could n't bear to wait in this little town ; it 's not much like the city . " " Oh , dear ! But I ca n't go about alone . I hate these men , they stare at me so ! I wish I was a man . It 's awful to be a woman , do n't you think so ? Please do n't laugh . " The young lawyer was far from laughing , but this was her only way of defending herself . These pert , bird-like ways formed her shield against ridicule and misprision . He said , slowly , " Yes , it 's an awful thing to be a woman , but then it 's an awful responsibility to be a man . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean that we are responsible , as the dominant sex , for every tragic , incomplete woman 's life . " " Do n't you blame Mrs. Shellberg ? " she said , forcing him to a concrete example with savage swiftness . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she must earn her own living some way . " " She could cook , or nurse , or something like that . " " It is n't easy to find opportunity to cook or nurse . If it were as easy to earn a living in a pure way as it is in a vicious way , all men would be rich and virtuous . But what had you planned to do after your divorce ? " " Oh , I 'm going to travel for two years . Then I 'll try to settle down . " " What you need is a good husband , and a little cottage where you 'd have to cook your own food -- and tend the baby . " " I would n't cook for any man living , " she broke in , to express her bitterness that he could so coldly dispose of her future . " Oh , this terrible train ! Ca n't it go faster ? If I 'd realized what a trip this was , I would n't have started . " " This is the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , and his words pictured a ceaseless stream of divorcees . She resented his classing her with the rest , but she simply said : " You despise me , do n't you ? But what can we do ? You ca n't expect us to live with men we hate , can you ? That would be worse than Mrs. Shellberg . " " No , I do n't expect that of you . I 'd issue a divorce coupon with every marriage certificate , and done with it , " he said , in desperate disgust . " Then this whole cursed business would be done away with . It is n't a question of our laxity of divorce laws , " he said , after a pause , " it 's a question of the senseless severity of the laws in other States . That 's what throws this demoralizing business into our hands here . " " It pays , do n't it ? I know I 've paid for everything I 've had . " " Yes , that 's the demoralizing thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws us who belong here off into dirty work , and it brings us into contact with men and women -- I 'm sick of the whole business . " She had hardly followed him in his generalizations . She brought him back to the personal . " You 're sick of me , I know you are ! " She leaned her head on the window-pane . Her eyes closed . " Oh , I wish my heart would stop beating ! " she said , in a tense , profoundly significant tone . Allen , sitting so close behind them , was forced to overhear , so piercingly sweet was her voice . He trembled for fear some one else might hear her . It seemed like profanation that any one but God should listen to this outcry of a quivering , writhing soul . She faced her companion again . " You 're the only man I know , now , that I respect , and you despise me . " " No , I do n't ; I pity you . " " That 's worse . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with me , or if I could be with you ! " Her gloved hands strained together in the agony of her desire . His calm lips did not waver . He did not smile , even about the eyes . He knew her cry sprang from her need of a brother , not from the passion of a woman . " Our home is yours just as long as you can bear the monotony of our simple lives , " he said , in his quiet way , but it was deep-throated and unmistakable in its sincerity . She laid her hand on his arm and clasped it hard , then turned away her head , and they rode in silence . After they left the car Allen sat , with savage eyes and grimly set mouth , going over the problem again and again . He saw that young and helpless creature walking the gantlet between endless ranks of lustful , remorseless men , snatching at her in selfish , bestial desire . It made him bitter and despairing to think that women should be helpless -- that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He cursed the laws and traditions that had kept women subordinate and trivial and deceptive and vacillating . He wished they could be raised to the level of the brutes till , like the tigress or she-wolf , they could not only defend themselves , but their young . He tried to breathe a sigh of relief that she had gone out of his life , but he could not . It was not so easy to shake off the shadow of his responsibility . He followed her in imagination on her downward path till he saw her stretching out her hands in pitiful need to casual acquaintances -- alone and without hope ; still petite , still dainty in spite of all , still with flashes of wit , and then --  He shuddered . " O my God ! Upon whom does the burden of guilt lie ? " * * * * * On the night of his return he sat among his romping babes , debating whether he should tell the story to his wife or not . As the little ones grew weary the noise of the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and he shuddered . His wife observed it . " What is it , Joe ? Did you get a chill ? " " Oh no . The wind sounds a little lonesome to-night , that 's all . " But he took his little girl into his arms and held her close . AN ALIEN IN THE PINES I A man and a woman were pacing up and down the wintry station platform , waiting for a train . On every side the snow lay a stained and crumpled blanket , with here and there a light or a chimney to show the village sleeping beneath . The sky was a purple-black hemisphere , out of which the stars glittered almost white . The wind came out of the west , cold but amiable ; the cracked bell of a switch-engine gurgled querulously at intervals , followed by the bumping of coupling freight-cars ; roosters were crowing , and sleepy train-men were assembling in sullen silence . The couple walked with arms locked like lovers , but the tones of their voices had the quality which comes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clear voice arose . " Oh , Ed , is n't this delicious ? What one misses by not getting up early ! " " Sleep , for instance , " laughed her husband . " Do n't drag me down . You know what I mean . Let 's get up early every morning while we 're up here in the woods . " " Should n't wonder if we had to . There 'll be a lot to do , and I want to get back to Chicago by the 1st of February . " " This is an experience ! Is n't it still ? When is our train due ? " " Due now ; I think that is our headlight up the track . " As he spoke an engine added its voice to the growing noise of the station , and drew solemnly down the frosty steel . An eruption of shapeless forms of men from the depot filled the one general coach of the train . They nearly all were dressed in some sort of fur coat , and all had the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were , in fact , travelling men , business men , the owners of mills or timber . The stolid or patient ox-like faces of some Norwegian workmen , dressed in gay Mackinac jackets , were sprinkled about . The young wife was a fine type of woman anywhere , but these surroundings made her seem very dainty and startlingly beautiful . Her husband had the fair skin of a city man , but his powerful shoulders and firm step denoted health and wholesome living . They were both good to look at . They soon felt the reaction to sleepiness which comes to those not accustomed to early rising , and the wife , soothed by the clank of the train , leaned her head on her husband 's shoulder and dozed . He looked out upon the landscape , glad that his wife was not observing it . He did not know such desolation existed in Wisconsin . On every side were the evidences of a ruined forest land . A landscape of flat wastes , of thinned and burned and uprooted trees . A desolate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray and sagging , surrounded by little cabins of unpainted wood , to testify to the time when great pines stood all about , and the ring of the swamper 's axe was heard in the intervals of silence between the howls of a saw . To the north the swells grew larger . Birch and tamarack swamps alternated with dry ridges on which an inferior pine still grew . The swamps were dense tangles of broken and uprooted trees . Slender pike-like stumps of fire-devastated firs rose here and there , black and grim skeletons of trees . It was a land that had been sheared by the axe , torn by the winds , and blasted by fire . Off to the west low blue ridges rose , marking the boundaries of the valley which had been washed out ages ago by water . After the floods pine forest had sprung up , and these in their turn had been sheared away by man . It lay now awaiting the plough and seeder of the intrepid pioneer . Suddenly the wife awoke and sat up . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her childish look of bewilderment . " I 've been painfully aware of it for some time back . I 've been suffering for food while you slept . " " Why did n't you get into the basket ? " " How could I , with you on my manly bosom ? " She colored up a little . They had not been married long , evidently . " How considerate you are ! " They were soon eating a breakfast with the spirit of picnickers . Occasionally she looked out of the window . " What a wild country ! " she said . He did not emphasize its qualities to her ; rather , he distracted her attention from its desolation . The train roared round its curves , conforming with the general course of the river . On every hand were thickening signs of active lumber industry . They flashed by freight trains loaded with logs or lumber or ties . Mills in operation grew thicker . The car echoed with the talk of lumber . A brisk man with a red mustache was exhibiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of " two by fours . " Another was describing a new shingle-mill he had just built . A couple of elderly men , one a German , were discussing the tariff on lumber . The workmen mainly sat silent . " It 's all so strange ! " the young wife said , again and again . " Yes , it is n't exactly the Lake Shore Drive . " " I like it . I wish I could smell the pines . " " You 'll have all the pines you can stand before we get back to Chicago . " " No , sir ; I 'm going to enjoy every moment of it ; and you 're going to let me help , you know -- look over papers , and all that . I 'm the heiress , you must remember , " she added , wickedly . " Well , we wo n't quarrel about that until we see how the legacy turns out . It may not be worth my time up here . I shall charge you roundly as your lawyer , depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train sped on . Old Mosinee rose , a fine rounded blue shape , on the left . " Why , there 's a mountain ! I did n't know Wisconsin had such a mountain as that . " " Neither did I. This valley is fine . Now , if your uncle 's estates only included that hill ! " The valley made off to the northwest with a bold , large , and dignified movement . The coloring , blue and silver , purple-brown and bronze-green , was harmonious with the grouping of lines . It was all fresh and vital , wholesome and very impressive . From this point the land grew wilder -- that is to say , more primeval . There was more of Nature and less of man . The scar of the axe was here and there , but the forest predominated . The ridges of pine foliages broke against the sky , miles and miles , in splendid sweep . " This must be lovely in summer , " the wife said , again and again , as they flashed by some lake set among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , feeling the thrill of the sportsman . " I 'd like to shoulder a rifle and plunge into those snowy vistas . How it brings the wild spirit out in a man ! Women never feel that delight . " " Oh , yes , we do , " she replied , glad that something remained yet unexplained between them . " We feel just like men , only we have n't the strength of mind to demand a share of it with you . " " Yes , you feel it at this distance . You 'd come back mighty quick the second night out . " She did not relish his laughter , and so looked away out of the window . " Just think of it -- Uncle Edwin lived here thirty years ! " He forebore to notice her inconsistency . " Yes , the wilderness is all right for a vacation , but I prefer Chicago for the year round . " When they came upon Ridgeley , both cried out with delight . " Oh , what a dear , picturesque little town ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how they came to build a town without a row of battlemented stores ? " It lay among and upon the sharp , low , stumpy pine ridges in haphazard fashion , like a Swiss village . A small brook ran through it , smothered here and there in snow . A sawmill was the largest figure of the town , and the railway station was the centre . There was not an inch of painted board in the village . Everywhere the clear yellow of the pine flamed unstained by time . Lumber piles filled all the lower levels near the creek . Evidently the town had been built along logging roads , and there was something grateful and admirable in its irregular arrangement . The houses , moreover , were all modifications of the logging camps ; even the drug store stood with its side to the street . All about were stumps and fringes of pines , which the lumbermen , for some good reason , had passed by . Charred boles stood purple-black out of the snow . It was all green and gray and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illimitable than the rugged forest which extended on every hand . " Oh , this is glorious -- glorious ! " said the wife . " Do I own some of this town ? " she asked , as they rose to go out . " I reckon you do . " " Oh , I 'm so glad ! " As they stepped out on the platform , a large man in corduroy and wolf-skin faced them like a bandit . " Hello , Ed ! " " Hello , Jack ! Well , we 've found you . My wife , Mr. Ridgeley . We 've come up to find out how much you 've embezzled , " he said , as Ridgeley pulled off an immense glove to shake hands all round . " Well , come right over to the hotel . It ai n't the Auditorium , but then , again , it ai n't like sleeping outdoors . " As they moved along they heard the train go off , and then the sound of the saw resumed its domination of the village noises . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ? " asked Field . " Named after me . Old man did n't want it named after him ; would kill it , " he said . Mr. and Mrs. Field found the hotel quite comfortable and the dinner wholesome . They beamed upon each other . " It 's going to be delightful , " they said . Ridgeley was a bachelor , and made his home at the hotel also . That night he said : " Now we 'll go over the papers and records of your uncle 's property , and then we 'll go out and see if the property is all there . I imagine this is to be a searching investigation . " " You may well think it . My wife is inexorable . " As night fell , the wife did not feel so safe and well pleased . The loud talking in the office below and the occasional whooping of a crowd of mill-hands going by made her draw her chair nearer and lay her fingers in her husband 's palm . He smiled indulgently . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half so bad as they sound . " II Mrs. Field sat in the inner room of Ridgeley 's office , waiting for the return of her husband with the team . They were going out for a drive . Ridgeley was working at his books , and he had forgotten her presence . She could not but feel a deep admiration for his powerful frame and his quick , absorbed action as he moved about from his safe to his desk . He was a man of great force and ready decision . Suddenly the door opened and a stranger entered . He had a sullen and bitter look on his thin , dark face . Ridgeley 's quick eyes measured him , and his hand softly turned the key in his money drawer , and as he faced about he swung shut the door of the safe . The stranger saw all this with eyes as keen as Ridgeley 's . A cheerless and strange smile came upon his face . " Do n't be alarmed , " he said . " I 'm low , but I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , what can I do for you ? " asked Ridgeley . Mrs. Field half rose , feeling something tense and menacing in the attitude of the two men . But the intruder quietly answered , " You can give me a job if you want to . " Ridgeley remained alert . His eyes ran over the man 's tall frame . He looked strong and intelligent , although his eyes were fevered and dull . " What kind of a job ? " " Any kind that will take me out into the woods and keep me there . " There was a self-accusing tone in his voice that Ridgeley felt . " What 's your object ? You look like a man who could do something else . What brings you here ? " The man turned with a sudden resolution to punish himself . His voice expressed a terrible loathing . " Whiskey , that 's what . It 's a hell of a thing to say , but I ca n't let liquor alone when I can smell it . I 'm no common hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I can swing an axe , and I 'm ready to work . That 's enough . Now the question is , can you find a place for me ? " Ridgeley mused a little . The young fellow stood there , statuesque , rebellious . Then Ridgeley said , " I guess I can help you out that much . " He picked up a card and a pencil . " What shall I call you ? " " Oh , call me Williams ; that ai n't my name , but it 'll do . " " What you been doing ? " " Everything part of the time , drinking the rest . Was in a livery-stable down at Wausau last week . It came over me , when I woke yesterday , that I was gone to hell if I stayed in town . So I struck out ; and I do n't care for myself , but I 've got a woman to look out for --  " He stopped abruptly . His recklessness of mood had its limits , after all . Ridgeley pencilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of No. 6 . The men over at the mill will show you the teams . " The man started toward the door with the card in his hand . He turned suddenly . " One thing more . I want you to send ten dollars of my pay every two weeks to this address . " He took an envelope out of his pocket . " It do n't matter what I say or do after this , I want that money sent . The rest will keep me in tobacco and clothing . You understand ? " Ridgeley nodded . " Perfectly . I 've seen such cases before . " The man went out and down the walk with a hurried , determined air , as if afraid to trust his own resolution . As Ridgeley turned toward his desk he met Mrs. Field , who faced him with tears of fervent sympathy in her eyes . " Is n't it awful ? " she said , in a half whisper . " Poor fellow , what will become of him ? " " Oh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such fellows do . I 've had ' em before . They try it awhile here ; then they move . I ca n't worry about them . " Mrs. Field was not listening to his shifty words . " And then , think of his wife -- how she must worry . " Ridgeley smiled . " Perhaps it 's his mother or a sister . " " Anyway , it 's awful . Ca n't something be done for him ? " " I guess we 've done about all that can be done . " " Oh , I wish I could help him ! I 'll tell Ed about him . " " Do n't worry about him , Mrs. Field ; he ai n't worth it . " " Oh yes , he is . I feel he 's been a fine fellow , and then he 's so self-accusing . " Her own happiness was so complete , she could not bear to think of others ' misery . She told her husband about Williams , and ended by asking , " Ca n't we do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply concerned . " No ; he 's probably past help . Such men are so set in their habits , nothing but a miracle or hypnotism can save them . He 'll end up as a ' lumber Jack , ' as the townsmen call the hands in the camps . " " But he is n't that , Edward . He 's finer , some way . You feel he is . Ask Mr. Ridgeley . " Ridgeley merely said : " Yes , he seemed to me to be more than a common hand . But , all the same , it wo n't be two weeks before he 'll be in here as drunk as a wild cat , wanting to shoot me for holding back his money . " In this way Williams came to be to Mrs. Field a very important figure in the landscape of that region . She often spoke of him , and on the following Saturday night , when Field came home , she anxiously asked , " Is Williams in town ? " " No , he has n't shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good ! good ! He 's going to win his fight . " Field laughed . " Do n't bet on Williams too soon . We 'll hear from him before the week is out . " " When are we going to visit the camp ? " she asked , changing the subject . " As soon as it warms up a little . It is too cold for you . " She had a laugh at him . " You were the one who wanted to ' plunge into the snowy vistas . ' " He evaded her joke on him by assuming a careless tone . " I 'm not plunging as much as I was ; the snow is too deep . " " When you go I want to go with you -- I want to see Williams . " " Ha ! " he snorted , melodramatically . " She scorns me faithful heart . She turns --  " Mrs. Field smiled faintly . " Do n't joke about it , Ed . I ca n't get that wife out of my mind . " III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north wind cleared the sky ; and , though it was still cold , it was pleasant . The sky had only a small white cloud here and there to make its blueness the more profound . Ridgeley dashed up to the door with a hardy little pair of broncos hitched to a light pair of bobs , and Mrs. Field was tucked in like a babe in a cradle . Almost the first thing she asked was , " How is Williams ? " " Oh , he 's getting on nicely . He refused to sleep with his bunk-mate , and finally had to lick him , I understand , to shut him up . Challenged the whole camp , then , to let him alone or take a licking . They let him alone , Lawson says . G'lang there , you rats ! " Mrs. Field said no more , for the air was whizzing by her ears , and she hardly dared look out , so keen was the wind ; but as soon as they entered the deeps of the forest it was profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgot . Everywhere yellow-greens and purple shadows . The sun in a burnished blue sky flooded the forests with light , striking down through even the thickest pines to lay in fleckings of radiant white and gold upon the snow . The trail ( it was not a road ) ran like a graceful furrow over the hills , around little lakes covered deep with snow , through tamarack swamps where the tracks of wild things thickened , over ridges of tall pine clear of brush , and curving everywhere amid stumps , where dismantled old shanties marked the site of the older logging camps . Sometimes they met teams going to the store . Sometimes they crossed logging roads -- wide , smooth tracks artificially iced , down which mountainous loads of logs were slipping , creaking , and groaning . Sometimes they heard the dry click-clock of the woodsmen 's axes or the crash of falling trees deep in the wood . When they reached the first camp Ridgeley pulled up the steaming horses at the door and shouted , " Hello , the camp ! " A tall old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held one bare red arm above his eyes . He wore an apron . " Hello , Sandy ! " " Hello , Mr. Ridgeley ! " " Ready for company ? " " Am always ready for company , " he said , with a Scotch accent . " Well , we 're coming in to get warm . " " Vera weel . " As they went in , under the roofed shed between the cook 's shanty and the other and larger shanty , Mrs. Field sniffed . Sandy led them past a large pyramid composed of the scraps of beef bones , egg-shells , cans , and tea grounds left over during the winter . In the shed itself hung great slabs of beef . It was all as untidy and suggestive of slaughter as the nest of a brood of eagles . Sandy was beginning dinner on a huge stove spotted with rust and pancake batter . All about was the litter of his preparation . Beef -- beef on all sides , and tin dishes and bare benches and huge iron cooking-pans . Mrs. Field was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible place ! Are they all like that ? " " No , my camps are not like that -- or , I should say , our camps , " Ridgeley added , with a smile . " Not a gay place at all , " said Field , in exaggerated reserve . But Mrs. Field found her own camps not much better . True , the refuse was not raised in pyramidal shape before the front door , and the beef was a little more orderly , but the low log huts , the dim cold light , the dingy walls and floors , the lack of any womanly or home touch , the tin dishes , the wholesale cooking , all struck upon her with terrible force . " Do human beings live here ? " she asked Ridgeley , when he opened the door of the main shanty of No. 6 . " Forty creatures of the men kind sleep and house here , " he replied . " To which the socks and things give evidence , " said Field , promptly , pointing toward the huge stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Above it hung scores of ragged gray and red socks and Mackinac boots and jackets which had been washed by the men themselves . Around were the grimy bunks where the forty men slept like tramps in a steamer 's hold . The quilts were grimy , and the posts greasy and shining with the touch of hands . There were no chairs -- only a kind of rude stool made of boards . There were benches near the stove , nailed to the rough floor . In each bunk , hanging to a peg , was the poor little imitation-leather hand-bag which contained the whole wardrobe of each man , exclusive of the tattered socks and shirts hanging over the stove . The room was chill and cold and gray . It had only two small windows . Its doors were low . Even Mrs. Field was forced to stoop in entering . This helped to make it seem like a den . There were roller-towels in the corner and wash-basins , and a grindstone which made it seem like a barn . It was , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does n't that hay in the bunks get a -- a -- sometimes ? " asked Field . " Well , yes , I should n't wonder , though the men are pretty strict about that . They keep pretty free from bugs , I think . However , I should n't want to run no river chances on the thing myself . " Ridgeley smiled at Mrs. Field 's shudder of horror . " Is this the place ? " The men laughed . She had asked that question so many times before . " Yes , this is where Mr. Williams hangs out . Say , Field , you 'll need to make some new move to hold your end up against Williams . " Mrs. Field felt hurt and angry at his rough joke . In the dim corner a cough was heard , and as a yellow head raised itself over the bunk-board a man presented a ghastly face . His big blue eyes fixed themselves on the lovely woman with a look of childish wonder . " Hello , Gus -- did n't see you ! What 's the matter -- sick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai tank ai lack to hav doketer . " " All right , I 'll send him up . What seems the matter ? " As they talked , Mrs. Field again chilled with the cold gray comfortlessness of it all : to be sick in such a place ! The silent appearance of the man out of his grim corner was startling . She was glad when they drove out into the woods again , where the clear sunshine fell and the pines stood against the blazing winter sky motionless as iron trees . Her pleasure in the ride was growing less . To her delicate sense this life was sordid , not picturesque . She wondered how Williams endured it . They arrived at No. 8 just as the men were trailing down the road to work , after eating their dinner . Their gay-colored jackets of Mackinac wool stood out like trumpet notes in the prevailing white and blue and bronze-green . The boss and the sealer came out and met them , and after introductions they went into the shanty to dinner . The cook was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine brown mustache . He cleared a place for them at one end of the long table , and they sat down . It was a large camp , but much like the others . On the table were the same cheap iron forks , the tin plates , and the small tin basins ( for tea ) which made up the dinner-set . Basins of brown sugar stood about . " Good gracious ! Do people still eat brown sugar ? Why , I have n't seen any of that for ages ! " cried Mrs. Field . The stew was good and savory , and the bread fair . The tea was not all clover , but it tasted of the tin . Mrs. Field said : " Beef , beef -- everywhere beef . One might suppose a menagerie of desert animals ate here . Edward , we must make things more comfortable for our men . They must have cups to drink out of ; these basins are horrible . " It was humorous to the men , this housewifely suggestion . " Oh , make it napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sha' n't rest after seeing this . If you thought I was going to say , ' Oh , how picturesque ! ' you 're mistaken . I think it 's barbarous . " She was getting impatient of their patronizing laughter , as if she were a child . They changed their manner to one of acquiescence , but thought of her as a child just the same . After dinner they all went out to see the crew working . It was the biggest crew anywhere in the neighborhood . Ridgeley got out and hitched the team to a tree , and took Field up to the skidway . Mrs. Field remained in the sleigh . Near her " the swamping team , " a span of big , deep-red oxen , came and went among the green tops of the fallen pines . They crawled along their trails in the snow like some strange machinery , and the boy in a blue jacket moved almost as listlessly . Somewhere in the tangle of refuse boughs the swampers ' axes click-clocked , saws uttered their grating , rhythmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fell with soft , rushing , cracking sweeps into the deep snow , and the swampers swarmed upon them like Lilliputians attacking a giant enemy . There was something splendid ( though tragic ) in the work , but the thought of the homelessness of the men , their terrible beds , and their long hours of toil oppressed the delicate and refined woman . She began to take on culpability . She was partly in authority now , and this system must be changed . She was deep in plans for improvement , in shanties and in sleeping-places , when the men returned . Ridgeley was saying : " No , we control about thirty thousand acres of pine as good as that . It ai n't what it was twenty years ago , but it 's worth money , after all . " It was getting near to dark as they reached No. 6 again , and Ridgeley drew up and helped them out and into the cook 's shanty . Mrs. Field was introduced to the cook , a short , rather sullen , but intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great slices of beef in a huge dripping-pan . He had a taffler , or assistant , in the person of a half-grown boy , at whom he jerked rough orders like hunks of stove wood . Some hit the boy and produced noticeable effects , others did not . Meanwhile a triumphant sunset was making the west one splendor of purple and orange and crimson , which came over the cool green rim of the pines like the Valhalla March in Wagner . Mrs. Field sat there in the dim room by the window , seeing that splendor flush and fade , and thinking how dangerous it was to ask where one 's wealth comes from in the world . Outside , the voices of the men thickened ; they were dropping in by twos and fours , with teams and on foot . The assistant arranged the basins in rows , and put one of the iron forks and knives on either side of each plate , and filled the sugar-basins , and dumped in the cold beans , and split the bread into slabs , and put small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men . At last , when the big pans of toast , the big plates of beef , were placed steaming on the table , the cook called Field and Ridgeley , and said : " Set right here at the end . " He raised his arm to a ring which dangled on a wire . " Now look out ; you 'll see ' em come -- sidewise . " He jerked the ring , and disappeared into the kitchen . A sudden tumult , shouts , trampling , laughter , and the door burst open and they streamed in : Norwegians , French , **25;3191;TOOLONG fellows , all of them , save the Norwegians . They came like a flood , but they fell silent at sight of a woman , so beautiful and strange to them . All words ceased . They sank into place beside the table with the thump of falling sand-bags . They were all in their shirt-sleeves , but with faces cleanly washed , and the most of them had combed their hair ; but they seemed very wild and hairy to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grateful pleasure ; it was so restful to have them close beside her . The men ate like hungry dogs . They gorged in silence . Nothing was heard but the clank of knives on tin plates , the drop of heavy platters of food , and the occasional muttered words of some one asking for the bread or the gravy . As they ate they furtively looked with great curiosity and admiration up at the dainty woman . Their eyes were bright and large , and gleamed out of the obscure brown of their dimly lighted faces with savage intensity -- so it seemed to Mrs. Field , and she dropped her eyes before their glare . Her husband and Ridgeley tried to enter into conversation with those sitting near . Ridgeley seemed on good terms with them all , and ventured a joke or word , at which they laughed with terrific energy , and fell as suddenly silent again . As Mrs. Field looked up the second time she saw the dark , strange face of Williams a few places down , and opposite her . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes followed his , and the beauty of her husband 's hands came to her again with new force . They were perfectly shaped , supple , warm-colored , and strong . Their color and deftness stood out in vivid contrast to the heavy , brown , cracked , and calloused , paw-like hands of the workmen . Why should Williams study her husband 's hands ? If he had looked at her she would not have been surprised . The other men she could read . They expressed either frank , simple admiration or furtive desire . But this man looked at her husband , and his eyes fell often upon his own hands , which trembled with fatigue . He handled his knife clumsily , and yet she could see he , too , had a fine hand -- a slender , powerful hand , like that people call an artist hand -- a craftsman-like hand . He saw her looking at him , and he flashed one enigmatical glance into her eyes , and rose to go out . " How you getting on , Williams ? " Ridgeley asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm all right , " he said , sullenly . The meal was all over in an incredibly short time . One by one , two by two , they rose heavily and lumbered out with one last , wistful look at Mrs. Field . She will never know how seraphic she seemed sitting there amid those rough surroundings -- the dim , red light of the kerosene lamp falling across her clear pallor , out of which her dark eyes shone with liquid softness , made deeper and darker by her half-sorrowful tenderness for these homeless fellows . An hour later , as they were standing at the door , just ready to take to their sleigh , they heard the scraping of a fiddle . " Oh , some one is going to play ! " Mrs. Field cried , with visions of the rollicking good times she had heard so much about , and of which she had seen nothing so far . " Ca n't I look in ? " Ridgeley was dubious . " I 'll go and see , " he said , and entered the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Go on with your fiddling , Sam -- only I wanted to see that you were n't sitting around in dishabill . " This seemed a good joke , and they all howled and haw-hawed gleefully . " So go right ahead with your evening prayers . All but -- you understand ! " " All right , captain , " said Sam , the man with the fiddle . When Mrs. Field looked in , two men were furiously grinding axes ; several were sewing on ragged garments ; all were smoking ; some were dressing chapped or bruised fingers . The atmosphere was horrible . The socks and shirts were steaming above the huge stove ; the smoke and stench for a moment were sickening , but Ridgeley pushed them just inside the door . " It 's better out of the draught . " Sam jigged away on the violin . The men kept time with the cranks of the grindstone , and all faces turned with bashful smiles and bold grins at Mrs. Field . Most of them shrank a little from her look , like shy animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days , " he explained to Mrs. Field , " we used a fireplace , and that kept the air better . " As her sense of smell became deadened the air seemed a little more tolerable to Mrs. Field . " Oh , we must change all this , " she said . " It is horrible . " " Play us a tune , " said Sam , extending the violin to Field . He did not think Field could play . It was merely a shot in the dark on his part . Field took it and looked at it and sounded it . On every side the men turned face in eager expectancy . " He can play , that feller . " " I 'll bet he can . He handles her as if he knew her . " " You bet your life . Tune up , Cap . " Williams came from the obscurity somewhere , and looked over the shoulders of the men . " Down in front ! " somebody called , and the men took seats on the benches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled around upon them in a frank , pleased way , quite ready to show his skill . He played Annie Laurie , and a storm of applause broke out . " Hoo-ray ! Bully for you ! " " Sam , you 're out of it ! " " Sam , your name is Mud ! " " Give us another , Cap ! " " It ai n't the same fiddle ! " He played again some simple tune , and he played it with the touch which showed the skilled amateur . As he played , Mrs. Field noticed a growing restlessness on Williams ' part . He moved about uneasily . He gnawed at his finger-nails . His eyes glowed with a singular fire . His hands drummed and fingered . At last he approached , and said , roughly : " Let me take that fiddle a minute . " " Oh , cheese it , Williams ! " the men cried . " Let the other man play . " " What do you want to do with the fiddle -- think it 's a music-box ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell ! " said Williams . As Field gave the violin over to him , his hands seemed to tremble with eagerness . He raised his bow , and struck into an imposing , brilliant strain , and the men fell back in astonishment . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " gasped the owner of the violin . " Keep quiet , Sam . " Mrs. Field looked at her husband . " Why , Ed , he is playing Sarasate ! " " That 's what he is , " he returned , slangily , too much astonished to do more than gaze . Williams played on . There was a faint defect in the high notes , as if his fingers did not touch the strings properly , but his bow action showed cultivation and breadth of feeling . As he struck into one of those difficult octave-leaping movements his face became savage . On the E string a squeal broke forth ; he flung the violin into Sam 's lap with a ferocious curse , and then , extending his hands , hard , crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Field : " Look at my hands ! Lovely things to play with , are n't they ? " His voice trembled with passion . He turned and went outside . As he passed Mrs. Field his head was bowed , and he was uttering a groaning cry like one suffering physical pain . " That 's what drink does for a man , " Ridgeley said , as they watched Williams disappear down the swampers ' trail . " That man has been a violinist , " said Field . " What 's he doing up here ? " " Came to get away from himself , I guess , " Ridgeley replied . " I 'm afraid he 's failed , " said Field , as he put his arm about his wife and led her to the sleigh . The ride home was made mainly in silence . " Oh , the splendid stillness ! " the woman kept saying in her heart . " Oh , the splendid moonlight , the marvellous radiance ! " Everywhere a heavenly serenity -- not a footstep , not a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid light , white snow dappled and lined with shadows , and trees etched against a starlit sky . Unutterable splendor of light and sheen and shadow . Wide wastes of snow so white the stumps stood like columns of charcoal . A night of Nature 's making , when she is tired of noise and blare of color . And in the midst of it stood the camp , with its reek of obscenity , foul odors , and tobacco smoke , to which a tortured soul must return . IV The following Saturday afternoon , as Ridgeley and Field entered the office , Williams rose to meet them . He looked different -- finer some way , Field imagined . At any rate , he was perfectly sober . He was freshly shaven , and though his clothes were rough , he appeared the man of education he really was . His manner was cold and distant . " I 'd like to be paid off , Mr. Ridgeley , " he said . " I guess what 's left of my pay will take me out of this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , with kindly interest . Williams must have perceived his kindliness , for he answered : " I 'm going home to my wife , to my violin . I am going to try living once more . " After he had gone out , Field said , " I wonder if he 'll do it ? " " Oh , I should n't wonder . I 've seen men brace up just as mysteriously as that and stay right by their resolutions . I thought he did n't look like a common lumber Jack when he came in . " " Ed , your playing did it ! " Mrs. Field cried , when she heard of Williams ' resolution . " Oh , how happy his wife will be ! She 'll save him yet ! " " Well , I do n't know ; depends on what kind of a woman she is . " BEFORE THE LOW GREEN DOOR Matilda Bent was dying ; there was no doubt of that now , if there had been before . The gruff old physician -- one of the many overworked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bent , her husband , as he passed through the room which served as dining-room , sitting-room , and parlor . The poor fellow slouched back to his chair by the stove as if dazed , and before he could speak again the doctor was gone . Mrs. Ridings was just coming up the walk as the doctor stepped out of the door . " Oh , doctor , how is she ? " " She is a dying woman , madam . " " Oh , do n't say that , doctor ! What 's the matter ? " " Cancer . " " Then the news was true --  " " I do n't know anything of the news , Mrs. Ridings , but Mrs. Bent is dying from the effects of a cancer primarily , which she has had for years -- since her last child , which died in infancy , you remember . " " But , doctor , she never told me --  " " Neither did she tell me . But no matter now . I have done all I can for her . If you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will find some opiate powders there with directions . Keep the pain down at all hazards . Do n't let her suffer ; that is useless . She is likely to last a day or two ; but if any change comes to-night , send for me . " When the good matron entered the dowdy , suffocating little room where Matilda Bent lay gasping for breath , she was sick for a moment with sympathetic pain . There the dying woman lay , her world narrowed to four close walls , propped up on the pillows near the one little window . Her eyes seemed very large and bright , and the brow , made prominent by the sinking away of the cheeks , gave evidence that it was an uncommon woman who lay there quietly waiting the death angel . She smiled , and lifted her eyebrows in a ghastly way . " Oh , Marthy ! " she breathed . " Matildy , I did n't know you was so bad or I 'd ' a ' come before . Why did n't you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and taking the ghostly hands of the sufferer in her own warm and soft palms . She shuddered as she kissed the thin lips . " I think you 'll soon be around ag'in , " she added , in the customary mockery of an attempt at cheer . The other woman started slightly , turned her head , and gazed on her old friend long and intently . The hollowness of her neighbor 's words stung her . " I hope not , Marthy -- I 'm ready to go . I want to go . I do n't care to live . " The two women communed by looking for a long time in each other 's eyes , as if to get at the very secretest desires and hopes of the heart . Tears fell from Martha 's eyes upon the cold and nerveless hands of her friend -- poor , faithful hands , hacked and knotted and worn by thirty years of ceaseless daily toil . They lay there motionless upon the coverlet , pathetic protest for all the world to see . " Oh , Matildy , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you so ! I feel so bad that I did n't come before ! Ai n't they somethin ' ? " " Yes , Marthy -- jest set there -- till I die -- it wo n't be long , " whispered the pale lips . The sufferer , as usual , was calmer than her visitor , and her eyes were thoughtful . " I will ! I will ! But oh , must you go ? Ca n't somethin ' be done ? Do n't yo ' want the minister to be sent for ? " " No , I 'm all ready . I ai n't afraid to die . I ai n't worth savin ' now . Oh , Marthy , I never thought I 'd come to this -- did you ? I never thought I 'd die -- so early in life -- and die -- unsatisfied . " She lifted her head a little as she gasped out these words with an intensity of utterance that thrilled her hearer -- a powerful , penetrating earnestness that burned like fire . " Are you satisfied ? " pursued the steady lips . " My life 's a failure , Marthy -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marthy , what 'll become o ' them ? This is a hard world . " The amazed Martha could only chafe the hands , and note sorrowfully the frightful changes in the face of her friend . The weirdly calm , slow voice began to shake a little . " I 'm dyin ' , Marthy , without ever gittin ' to the sunny place we girls -- used to think -- we 'd git to , by-an ' - by . I 've been a-gittin ' deeper ' n ' deeper -- in the shade -- till it 's most dark . They ai n't been no rest -- n'r hope f'r me , Marthy -- none . I ain't --  " " There , there , Tillie , do n't talk so -- do n't , dear ! Try to think how bright it 'll be over there --  " " I do n't know nawthin ' about over there ; I 'm talkin ' about here . I ai n't had no chance here , Marthy . " " He will heal all your care --  " " He ca n't wipe out my sufferin 's here . " " Yes , He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear and heal every wound . " " No -- he -- ca n't . God Himself ca n't wipe out what has been . Oh , Mattie , if I was only there !  - -  in the past -- if I was only young and purty ag'in ! You know how tall I was ! How we used to run -- oh , Mattie , if I was only there ! The world was all bright then -- was n't it ? We did n't expect -- to work all our days . Life looked like a meadow , full of daisies and pinks , and the nicest ones and the sweetest birds were just a little ways on -- where the sun was -- it did n't look -- was n't we happy ? " " Yes , yes , dear . But you must n't talk so much . " The good woman thought Matilda 's mind was wandering . " Do n't you want some med'cine ? Is your fever risin ' ? " " But the daisies and pinks all turned to weeds , " she went on , waiting a little , " when we picked ' em . An ' the sunny place -- has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , if I was only there -- in the sun -- where the pinks and daisies are ! " " You must n't talk so , Mattie ! Think about your children ! You ai n't sorry y'had them ? They 've been a comfort to y ' ? You ai n't sorry you had ' em ? " " I ai n't glad , " was the unhesitating reply of the failing woman ; and then she went on , in growing excitement : " They 'll haf to grow old jest as I have -- git bent and gray , an ' die . They ai n't be'n much comfort to me : the boys are like their father , and Julyie 's weak . They ai n't no happiness -- for such as me and them . " She paused for breath , and Mrs. Ridings , not knowing what to say , did better than speak . She fell to stroking the poor face and the hands , getting more restless each moment . It was as if Matilda Fletcher had been silent so long , had borne so much without complaint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stayed . All her most secret doubts and her sweetest hopes seemed trembling on her lips or surging in her brain , racking her poor , emaciated frame for utterence . Now that death was sure , she was determined to rid her bosom of its perilous stuff . Martha was appalled . " I used to think -- that when I got married I 'd be perfectly happy ; but I never have been happy sence . It was the beginning of trouble to me . I never found things better than they looked ; they was always worse . I 've gone further an ' further from the sunshiny meadow , an ' the birds an ' flowers -- and I 'll never git back to ' em again , never ! " She ended with a sob and a low wail . Her face was horrifying with its intensity of pathetic regret . Her straining , wide-open eyes seemed to be seeing those sunny spots in the meadow . " Mattie , sometimes when I 'm asleep I think I am back there ag'in -- and you girls are there -- an ' we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , poor man , beggar man '  - -  and I hear you all laugh when I pull off the last leaf ; and then I come to myself -- and I 'm an old , dried-up woman , dyin '  - -  unsatisfied ! " " I 've felt that way a little myself , Matildy , " confessed the watcher , in a scared whisper . " I knew it , Mattie ; I knew you 'd know how I felt . Things have been better for you . You ai n't had to live in an old log house all your life , an ' work yourself to skin an ' bone for a man you do n't respect nor like . " " Matildy Bent , take that back ! Take it back , for mercy sake ! Do n't you dare die thinkin ' that -- do n't you dare ! " Bent , hearing her voice rising , came to the door , and the wife , recognizing his step , cried out : " Do n't let him in ! Do n't ! I ca n't bear him -- keep him out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who do you mean ? Not Joe ? " " Yes ! Him ! " Had the dying woman confessed to murder , good Martha could not have been more shocked . She could not understand this terrible revulsion in feeling , for she herself had been absolutely loyal to her husband through all the trials which had come upon them . But she met Bent at the threshold , and , closing the door , went out with him into the summer kitchen , where the rest of the family were sitting . A gloomy silence fell on them all after the greetings were over . The men were smoking ; all were seated in chairs tipped back against the wall . Joe Bent , a smallish man , with a weak , good-natured face , asked , in a hoarse whisper : " How is she , Mis ' Ridings ? " " She seems quite strong , Mr. Bent . I think you had all better go to bed ; if I want you , I can call you . Doctor give me directions . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sleep on the lounge in the other room . If you want me , just rap on the door . " When , after making other arrangements , Martha went back to the bedroom , she was startled to hear the sick woman muttering to herself , or perhaps because she had forgotten Martha 's absence . " But the shadows on the meadow did n't stay ; they passed on , and then the sun was all the brighter on the flowers . We used to string sweet-williams on spears of grass -- do n't you remember ? " Martha gave her a drink of the opiate in the glass , adjusted her on the pillow , and threw open the window , even to the point of removing the screen , and the gibbous moon flooded the room with light . She did not light a lamp , for its flame would heat the room . Besides , the moonlight was sufficient . It fell on the face of the sick woman till she looked like a thing of marble -- all but her dark eyes . " Does the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain ? " The woman heard with difficulty , and when the question was repeated , said slowly : " No , I like it . " After a little : " Do n't you remember , Mattie , how beautiful the moonlight seemed ? It seemed to promise happiness -- and love -- but it never come for us . It makes me dream of the past now -- just as it did of the future then ; an ' the whip-poor-wills , too --  " The night was perfectly beautiful , such a night as makes dying an infinite sorrow . The summer was at its liberalest . Innumerable insects of the nocturnal sort were singing in unison with the frogs in the pools . A whip-poor-will called , and its neighbor answered like an echo . The leaves of the trees , glossy from the late rain , moved musically to the light west wind , and the exquisite perfume of many flowers came in on the breeze . When the failing woman sank into silence , Martha leaned her elbow on the window-sill , and , gazing far into the great deeps of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life . She sighed deeply at times . She found herself at moments in the almost terrifying position of a human soul in space . Not a wife , not a mother , but just a soul facing the questions which harass philosophers . As she realized her condition of mind she apprehended something of the thinking of the woman on the bed . Matilda had gone beyond -- or far back -- of the wife and mother . The hours wore on ; the dying woman stirred uneasily now and then , whispering a word or phrase which related to her girlhood -- never to her later life . Once she said : " Mother , hold me . I 'm so tired . " Martha took the thin form in her arms , and , laying her head close beside the sunken cheek , sang , in half breath , a lullaby till the sufferer grew quiet again . The lustrous moon passed over the house , leaving the room dark , and still the patient watcher sat beside the bed , listening to the slow breathing of the dying one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighten , and with the coming light the tide of life sank in the dying body . The head , hitherto restlessly turning , ceased to move . The eyes grew quiet and began to soften like a sleeper 's . " How are you now , dear ? " asked the watcher several times , bending over the bed , and bathing back the straying hair . " I 'm tired -- tired , mother -- turn me , " she murmured drowsily , with heavy lids drooping . Martha patted the pillows once again , and turned her friend 's face to the wall . The poor , tortured , restless brain slowly stopped its grinding whirl , and the thin limbs , heavy with years of hopeless toil , straightened out in an endless sleep . Matilda Fletcher had found rest . A PREACHER 'S LOVE STORY I The train drew out of the great Van Buren Street depot at 4.30 of a dark day in late October . A tall young man , with a timid look in his eyes , was almost the last passenger to get on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an empty seat and peered out at the squalid city reeling past in the mist . The buildings grew smaller , and vacant lots appeared stretching away in flat spaces , broken here and there by ridges of ugly , squat , little tenement blocks . Over this landscape vast banners of smoke streamed , magnified by the misty rain which was driven in from the lake . At last there came a swell of land clothed on with trees . It was still light enough for him to see that they were burr oaks , and the young student 's heart thrilled at sight of them . His forehead smoothed out , and his eyes grew tender with boyish memories . He was seated thus , with head leaning against the pane , when another young man came down the aisle from the smoking-car and took a seat beside him with a pleasant word . He was a handsome young fellow of twenty three or four . His face was large and beardless , and he had a bold and keen look , in spite of the bang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed between them , and then silence fell on each . The conductor coming through the car , the smooth-faced young fellow put up a card to be punched , and the student handed up a ticket , simply saying , " Kesota . " After a decent pause the younger man said , " Going to Kesota , are you ? " " Yes . " " So am I. I live there , in fact . " " Do you ? Then perhaps you can tell me the name of your County Superintendent . I 'm looking for a school . " He smiled frankly . " I 'm just out of Jackson University , and --  " " That so ? I 'm an Ann Arbor man myself . " They took a moment for mutual warming up . " Yes , I know the Superintendent . Why not come right up to my boarding-place , and to-morrow I 'll introduce you ? Looking for a school , eh ? What kind of a school ? " " Oh , a village school , or even a country school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I 've been sick , and --  " " Yes , the good positions are all snapped up ; still , you might by accident hit on something . I know Mott ; he 'll do all he can for you . By-the-way , my name 's Allen . " The young student understood this hint and spoke . " Mine is Stacey . " The younger man mused a few minutes , as if he had forgotten his new acquaintance . Suddenly he roused up . " Say , would you take a country school several miles out ? " " I think I would , if nothing better offered . " " Well , in my old district they 're without a teacher . It 's six miles out , and it is n't a lovely neighborhood ! However , they will pay fifty dollars a month ; that 's ten dollars extra for the scrimmages . They wanted me to teach this winter -- my sister tackles it in summer -- but , great Peter ! I ca n't waste my time teaching school , when I can run up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole term 's wages in thirty minutes ! " " I do n't understand , " said Stacey . " Wheat Exchange . I 've got a lot of friends in the pit , and I can come in any time on a little deal . I 'm no Jim Keene , but I hope to get cash enough to handle five thousand . I wanted the old gent to start me up in it , but he said , ' Nix come arouse . ' Fact is , I dropped the money he gave me to go through college with . " He smiled at Stacey 's disapproving look . " Yes , indeedy ; there 's where the jar came into our tender relations . Oh , I call on the Governor -- always when I 've got a wad . I have fun with him . " He smiled brightly . " Ask him if he do n't need a little cash to pay for hog-killin ' , or something like that . " He laughed again . " No , I did n't graduate at Ann Arbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on my way back the third year , when I stopped in to see the pit -- it 's one o ' the sights of Chicago , you know -- and Billy Krans saw me looking over the rail , I went in , won , and then took a flyer on December . Come a big slump , and I failed to materialize at school . " " What did you do then ? " asked Stacey , to whom this did not seem humorous . " I wrote a contrite letter to the Governor , stating case , requesting forgiveness -- and money . No go ! Could n't raise neither . I then wrote , casting him off . ' You are no longer father of mine . ' " He smiled again radiantly . " You should have seen me the next time I went home ! Plug hat ! Imported suit ! Gold watch ! Diamond shirt-stud ! Cost me $200 to paralyze the General , but I did it . My glory absolutely turned him white as a sheet . I knew what he thought , so I said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not gaping for me . ' That about half-fetched him -- calling him Dad , I mean ; but he ca n't get reconciled to my business . ' Too many ups and downs , ' he says . Fact is , he thinks it 's gambling , and I do n't argue the case with him . I 'm on my way home now to stay over Sunday . " The train whistled , and Allen looked out into the darkness . " We 're coming to the crossing . Now , I ca n't go up to the boarding-place when you do , but I 'll give you directions , and you tell the landlady I sent you , and it 'll be all right . Allen , you remember -- Herman Allen . " Following directions , Stacey came at length to a two-story frame house situated on the edge of the bank , with its back to the river . It stood alone , with vacant lots all about . A pleasant-faced woman answered the ring . He explained briefly . " How do you do ? I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days while passing my examinations . Mr. Herman Allen sent me . " The woman 's quick eye and ear were satisfied . " All right . Walk in , sir . I 'm pretty full , but I expect I can accommodate you -- if you do n't mind Mr. Allen for a room-mate . " " Oh , not at all , " he said , while taking off his coat . " Come right in this way . Supper will be ready soon . " He went into a comfortable sitting-room , where a huge open fire of soft coal was blazing magnificently . The walls were papered in florid patterns , and several enlarged portraits were on the walls . The fire was the only adornment ; all else was cheap , and some of it was tawdry . Stacey spread his thin hands to the blaze , while the landlady sat down a moment , out of politeness , to chat , scanning him keenly . She was a handsome woman , strong , well-rounded , about forty years of age , with quick , gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you just get in ? " " Yes . I 've been on the road all day , " he said , on an impulse of communication . " Indeed , I 'm just out of college . " " Is that so ! " exclaimed Mrs. Mills , stopping her rocking in an access of interest . " What college ? " " Jackson University . I 've been sick , and only came West --  " There came a look into her face that transformed and transfigured her . " My boy was in Ann Arbor . He was killed on the train on his way home one day . " She stopped , for fear of breaking into a quaver , and smiled brightly . " That 's why I always like college boys . They all stop here with me . " She rose hastily . " Well , you 'll excuse me , wo n't you , and I 'll go an ' ' tend to supper . " There was a great deal that was feminine in Stacey , and he felt at once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined , studious , rather delicate young man , as he sat low in his chair and observed the light and heat of the fire . His large head was heavy with learning , and his dark eyes deep with religious fervor . Several young women entered , and the room was filled with the clatter of tongues . Herman came in a few moments later , his face in a girlish glow of color . Everybody rushed at him with loud outcry . He was evidently a great favorite . He threw his arms about Mrs. Mills , giving her a hearty hug . The girls pretended to be shocked when he reached out for them , but they were not afraid of him . They hung on his arms and besieged him with questions till he cried out , in jolly perplexity : " Girls , girls ! This will never do ! " Mrs. Mills brushed out his damp yellow curls with her hands . " You 're all wet . " " Girls , if you 'll let me sit down , I 'll take one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they released him . Stacey grew red with sympathetic embarrassment , and shrank away into a corner . " Go get supper ready , " commanded Herman . And it was only after they had left him that he said to Stacey : " Oh , you found your way all right . " He took a seat by the fire and surveyed his wet shoes . " I took a run up to Mott 's house -- only a half block out o ' the way . He said they 'd be tickled to have you at Cyene . By-the-way , you 're a theolog , are n't you ? " Wallace nodded , and Herman went on : " So I told Mott . He said you might work up a society out there at Cyene . " " Is there a church there ? " " Used to be , but -- say , I tell you what you do : you go out with me to-morrow , and I 'll give you a history of the township . " The ringing of the bell took them all out into the cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one end of the table , near a young woman who looked like a teacher , and he had full sweep of the table , which was surrounded by bright and happy faces . The station-hand was there , and a couple of grocery clerks , and a brakeman sat at Stacey 's right hand . They all seemed very much at home , and called one another by their Christian names , and there was very obvious courtship on the part of several young couples . Stacey escaped from the table as soon as possible , and returned to his seat beside the fire . He was young enough to enjoy the chatter of the girls , but his timidity made him glad they paid so little attention to him . The rain had changed to sleet outside and hammered at the window viciously , but the blazing fire and the romping young people set it at defiance . The landlady came to the door of the dining-room , dish and cloth in hand , to share in each outburst of laughter , and not infrequently the hired girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . A little later , having finished their work , they both came in and took active part in the light-hearted fun . Herman and one of the girls were having a great struggle over some trifle he had snatched from her hand , and the rest stood about laughing to see her desperate attempts to recover it . This was a familiar form of courtship in Kesota , and an evening filled with such romping was considered a " cracking good time . " After the girl , red and dishevelled , had given up , Herman sat down at the organ , and they all sang Moody and Sankey hymns , negro melodies , and college songs till ten o'clock . Then Mrs. Mills called , " Come , now , boys and girls ! " and they all said good-night , like obedient children . Herman and Wallace went up to their bedroom together . " Say , Stacey , have you got a policy ? " Wallace shook his head . " And do n't want any , I suppose . Well , I just asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he went on , winking at Wallace comically , " nominally I 'm an insurance agent , but practically I 'm a ' lamb '  - -  but I get a mouthful o ' fur myself occasionally . What I 'm working for is to get on that Wheat Exchange . That 's where you get life ! I 'd rather be an established broker in that howling mob than go to Congress . " He rose on his elbow in bed and looked at Wallace , who was rising from a silent prayer . " Say , why did n't you shout ? I forgot all about it -- I mean your profession . " Wallace crept into bed beside his communicative bedfellow in silence . He did n't know how to deal with such spirits . " Say , " called Herman suddenly , as Wallace was about dropping off to sleep , " you ai n't got no picnic , old man ! " " Why , what do you mean ? " " Wait till you see Cyene Church . Oh , it 's a daisy snarl ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , it 's quiet now . The calmness of death , " said Herman . " Well , you see , it came this way . The church is made up of Baptists and Methodists , and the Methodists wanted an organ , because , you understand , father was the head centre , and Mattie is the only girl among the Methodists who can play . The old man has got a head like a mule . He ca n't be switched off , once he makes up his mind . Deacon Marsden , he do n't believe in anything above tuning-forks , and he 's tighter'n the bark on a bulldog . He stood out like a sore thumb , and Dad would n't give an inch . " You see , they held meetings every other Sunday . So Dad worked up the organ business and got one , and then locked it up when the Baptists held their services . Things went from bad to worse . They did n't speak as they passed by -- that is , the old folks ; we young folks did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , upshot is , the church died out . The wind blew the horse-sheds down , and there they lie -- and the church is standing there empty as an -- old boot -- and -- Say , Stacey -- by Jinks !  - -  are you a Baptist ? " " Yes . " " Oh , Peter ! ai n't that lovely ! " He chuckled shamelessly , and went off to sleep without another word . II Herman was still sleeping when Stacey rose and dressed and went down to breakfast . Mrs. Mills defended Herman against the charge of laziness : " He 's probably been out late all the week . " Stacey found Mott in the county court-house , and a perfunctory examination soon put him in possession of a certificate . There was no question of his attainments . Herman met him at dinner-time . " Well , elder , I 'm going down to get a rig to go out home in . It 's colder'n a blue whetstone , so put on all the clothes you 've got . Gim me your check , and I 'll get your traps . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , everything 's all fixed . " He turned up about three o'clock , seated on the spring seat of a lumber wagon beside a woman , who drove the powerful team . Whether she was young or old could not be told through her wraps . She wore a cap and a thick , faded cloak . Mrs. Mills hurried to the door . " Why , Mattie Allen ! What you doin ' out such a day as this ? Come in here instanter ! " " Ca n't stop ! " called a clear , boyish voice . " Too late ! " " Well , land o ' stars , you 'll freeze ! " When Wallace reached the wagon side , Herman said , " My sister , Stacey . " The girl slipped her strong , brown hand out of her huge glove and gave him a friendly grip . " Get right in , " she said . " Herman , you 're going to stand up behind . " Herman appealed to Mrs. Mills for sympathy . " This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry up , " laughed the girl , " or I 'll make you drive . " Stacey scrambled in awkwardly beside her . She was not at all embarrassed , apparently . " Tuck yourself in tight . It 's mighty cold on the prairie . " " Why did n't you come down with the baroosh ? " grumbled Herman . " Well , the corn was contracted for , and father was n't able to come -- he had another attack of neuralgia last night , after he got the corn loaded , so I had to come . " " Sha' n't I drive for you ? " asked Wallace . " No , thank you . You 'll have all you can do to keep from freezing . " She studied his thin coat and worn gloves with keen glance . He could see only her pink cheeks , strong nose , and dark , smiling eyes . It was one of those terrible Illinois days when the temperature drops suddenly to zero , and the churned mud of the highways hardens into scoriac rock , which cripples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along like mad things . The wind was keen as a saw-bladed sword , and smote incessantly . The desolate sky was one thick , impenetrable mass of swiftly flying clouds . When they swung out upon the long pike leading due north , Wallace drew his breath with a gasp , and bent his head to the wind . " Pretty strong , is n't it ? " shouted Mattie . " Oh , the farmer 's life is the life for me , tra-la ! " sang Herman , from his shelter behind the seat . Mattie turned . " What do you think of Penelope this month ? " " She 's a-gitten there , " said Herman , pounding his shoe heels . " She 's too smart for young Corey . She ought to marry a man like Bromfield . My , would n't they talk ! " " Did y ' get the second bundle of magazines last Saturday ? " " Yes ; and Dad found something in the Popular Science that made him mad , and he burned it . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for me ! " " Are you cold ? " she asked Wallace . He turned a purple face upon her . " No -- not much . " " I guess you better slip right down under the blankets , " she advised . The wind blew gray out of the north -- a wild blast which stopped the young student 's blood in his veins . He hated to give up , but he could no longer hold the blankets over his knees , so he slipped down into the corner of the box , with his back to the wind , while Mattie drew the blankets over his head , slapped the reins down on the backs of the snorting horses , and encouraged them with shouts like a man : " Get out o ' this , Dan ! Hup there , Nellie ! " The wagon boomed and rattled . The floor of the box seemed beaten with a maul . The glimpses Wallace had of the land appalled him , it was so flat and gray and bare . Herman sang at the top of his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . " This ends it ! If I ca n't come home without freezing to death , I do n't come . I should have hired a rig , irrespective of you --  " The girl laughed . " Oh , you 're getting thin-blooded , Herman . Life in the city has taken the starch all out of you . " " Better grow limp in a great city than freeze stiff in the country , " he replied . An hour 's ride brought them into a yard before a large , gray-white frame house . Herman sprang out to meet a tall old man with head muffled up . " Hello , Dad ! Take the team . We 're just naturally froze solid -- at least , I am . This is Mr. Stacey , the new teacher . " " How de do ? Run in ; I 'll take the horses . " Herman and Wallace stumbled toward the house , stiff and bent . Herman flung his arms about a tall woman in the kitchen door . " Hello , muz ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mattie came in soon with a boyish rush , gleeful as a happy babe . She unwound the scarf from her head and neck , and hung up her cap and cloak like a man , but she gave her hair a little touch of feminine care , and came forward with both palms pressed to her burning cheeks . " Did you suffer , child ? " asked Mrs. Allen . " No ; I enjoyed it . " Herman looked at Stacey . " I believe on my life she did . " " Oh , it 's fun . I do n't get a chance to do anything so exciting very often . " Herman clicked his tongue . " Exciting ? Well , well ! " " You must remember things are slower here , " Mattie explained . She came to light much younger than Stacey thought her . She was not eighteen , but her supple and splendid figure was fully matured . Her hair hung down her back in a braid , which gave a distinct touch of childishness to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as he put his arm around her waist and looked up at her . She seemed to realize for the first time that Stacey was a young man , and her eyes fell . " Well , now , set up the chairs , child , " said Mrs. Allen . When the young teacher returned from his cold spare room off the parlor the family sat waiting for him . They all drew up noisily , and Allen said : " Ask the blessing , sir ? " Wallace said grace . As Allen passed the potatoes he continued : " My son tells me you are a minister of the gospel . " " I have studied for it . " " What denomination ? " " Tut , tut ! " warned Herman . " Do n't start any theological rabbits to-night , Dad . With jaw swelled up you wo n't be able to hold your own . " " I 'm a Baptist , " Stacey answered . The old man 's face grew grim . It had been ludicrous before with its swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon his son , whose smile angered him . " Did n't you know no more'n to bring a Baptist preacher into this house ? " " There , there , father ! " began the wife . " Be quiet . I 'm boss of this shanty , and I wo n't have you bringing --  " Herman struck in : " Do n't make a show of yourself , old man . Never mind the old gent , Stacey ; he 's mumpy to-day , anyhow . " Stacey rose . " I guess I -- I 'd better not stay -- I --  " " Oh no , no ! Sit down ! It 's all right . The old man 's a little acid at me . He does n't mean it . " Stacey got his coat and hat . His heart was swollen with indignation . He felt as if something fine were lost to him , and the land outside was so desolate ! Mrs. Allen was in tears ; but the old man , having taken his stand , was going to keep it . Herman lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a little the cussedest Christian I ever knew ! Stacey , sit down . Do n't you be a fool just because he is --  " Stacey was buttoning his coat with trembling hands when Martha went up to him . " Do n't go , " she said . " Father 's sick and cross . He 'll be sorry for this to-morrow . " Wallace looked into her frank , kindly eyes , and hesitated . Herman said : " Dad , you are a lovely follower of Christ ! You 'll apologize for this , or I 'll never set foot on your threshold again . " Stacey still hesitated . He was hurt and angry , but being naturally of a sweet and gentle nature , he grew sad , and , yielding to the pressure of the girl 's hand on his arm , he began to unbutton his overcoat . She helped him with it , and hung it back on the nail , and her mother and Herman tried to restore something of the brightness which had been lost ; but Allen sat grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snout . After supper , as his father was about retiring to his bedroom , Herman fixed his bright eyes on him , and something very hard and masterful came into his face . " Old man , you and I have n't had a settlement on this thing yet . I 'll see you later . " Allen shrank before his son 's look , but shuffled sullenly off without uttering a word . Herman turned to Wallace . " Stacey , I want to beg your pardon for getting you into this scrape . I did n't suppose the old gentleman would act like that . The older he gets , the more his New Hampshire granite shows . I hope you wo n't lay it up against me . " Wallace was too conscientious to say he did n't mind it , but he took Herman 's hand in a quick clasp . " Let 's have a song , " proposed Herman . " Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast , to charm a rock , and split a cabbage . " They went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mattie and Herman sang hymns and old-fashioned love-songs and college glees wonderfully intermingled . They ended with Lorena , a wailing , extra sentimental love-song current in war times , and when they looked around there was a lofty look on the face of the young preacher -- a look of exaltation , of consecration and resolve . III The next morning , at breakfast , Herman said , as he seized a hot biscuit , " We 'll dispense with grace this morning , and till after the war is over . " But Wallace blessed his bread in a silent prayer , and Mattie thought it very brave of him to do so . Herman was full of mockery . " The sun rises just the same , whether it 's ' sprinkling ' or ' immersion . ' It 's lucky Nature do n't take a hand in these theological contests . She does n't even referee the scrap ; she never seems to care whether you are sparring for points or fighting to a finish . What you theologic middle-weights are really fighting for I ca n't see -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes on to my corns . " Stacey listened in a daze to Herman 's tirade . He knew it was addressed to Allen , and that it deprecated war , and that it was mocking . The fresh face and smiling lips of the young girl seemed to put other affairs very far away . It was such a beautiful thing to sit at table with a lovely girl . After breakfast he put on his cap and coat , and went out into the clear , cold November air . All about him the prairie outspread , marked with farm-houses and lined with leafless hedges . Artificial groves surrounded each homestead , and these relieved , to some degree , the desolateness of the fields . Down the road he saw the spire of a small white church , and as he walked briskly toward it , Herman 's description of it came to his mind . As he drew near , the ruined sheds , the rotting porch , and the windows boarded up told a sorry story , and his face grew sad . He tried one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramp had broken the lock . The inside was even more desolate than the outside . It was littered with rotting straw and plum stones and melon seeds . Obscene words were scrawled on the walls , and even on the pulpit itself . Taken altogether , it was an appalling picture to the young servant of the Man of Galilee -- a blunt reminder of the inherent ferocity and depravity of man . As he pondered the fire burned , and there rose again the flame of his resolution . He lifted his face and prayed that he might be the one to bring these people into the living union of the Church of Christ . His blood set toward his heart with tremulous action . His eyes glowed with zeal like that of the prophets of the Middle Ages . He saw the people united once more in this desecrated hall . He heard the bells ringing , the sound of song , the voices of love and fellowship filling the anterooms where hate had scrawled hideous blasphemy against woman and against God . As he sat there Herman came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vandalism . " Cheerful prospect , is n't it ? " Wallace looked up with the blaze of his resolution still in his eyes . His pale face was sweet and solemn . " Oh , how these people need Christ ! " Herman turned away . " They need killing -- about two dozen of ' em . I 'd like to have the job of indicating which ones . I would n't miss the old man , you bet ! " he added , with cordial resentment . Wallace was helpless in the face of such reckless thought , and so sat silently watching the handsome young fellow as he walked about . " Well , now , Stacey , I guess you 'll need to move . I had another session with the old man , but he wo n't give in , so I 'm off for Chicago . Mother 's brother , George Chapman , who lives about as near the schoolhouse on the other side , will take you in . I guess we 'd better go right down now and see about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we did n't shake hands , either , " he said , as they started down the road together . He was very stern and hard . Something of the father was hidden under his laughing exterior . Stacey regretted deeply the necessity which drove him out of Allen 's house . Mrs. Allen and Mattie had appealed to him very strongly . For years he had lived far from young women , and there was a magical power in the intimate home actions of this young girl . Her bare head , with simple arrangement of hair , someway seemed the most beautiful thing he had ever seen . He thought of her that night , as he sat at the table with Chapman and his aged mother . They lived alone , and their lives were curiously silent . Once in a while a low-voiced question , and that was all . George read the Popular Science , Harper 's Monthly Magazine , and the Open Court , and brooded over them with slow intellectual movement . It was wonderful the amount of information he secreted from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had little curiosity about the young stranger . He understood that he was to teach the school ; beyond that he did not care to go . He tried Wallace once or twice on the latest discoveries of John Fiske and Edison , and then gave him up and retired to his seat beside the sitting-room stove . On the following Monday morning school began , and as Wallace took his way down the lane the wrecked church came again to his eyes . He walked past it with slow feet . His was a deeply religious nature , one that sorrowed easily over sin . Suffering of the poor did not trouble him ; hunger seemed a little thing beside losing one 's everlasting soul . Therefore , to come from his studies upon such a monument of human depravity as this rotting church was to receive a shock and to hear a call to action . Approaching the schoolhouse , his thought took a turn toward the scholars and toward Mattie . He had forgotten to ask her if she intended to be one of his pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door as he came up . It was all very American -- the box-like house of white , the slender teacher approaching , the roughly clad urchins waiting . He said , " Good morning , scholars ! " They chorused a queer croak in reply -- hesitating , inarticulate , shy . He unlocked the door and entered the cold , bare room -- familiar , unlovely , with a certain power of primitive associations . In such a room he had studied his primer and his Ray 's Arithmetic . In such a room he had made gradual recession from the smallest front seat to the back wall seat ; and from one side of such a room to the other he had furtively worshipped a graceful , girlish head . He allowed himself but a moment of such dreaming before assuming command , and with his ready helpers a fire was soon started . Other children came in , timorous as rabbits , slipping by , each with an eye fixed on him like a scared chicken . They pre-empted their seats by putting down books and slates , and there arose sly wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his own life at that age . He assumed control as nearly in the manner of the old-time teachers as he could recall , and the work of his teaching was begun . The day passed quickly , and , as he walked homeward again , there stood that rotting church , and in his mind there rose a surging emotion larger than he could himself comprehend -- a desire to rebuild it by uniting the warring factions , of whose lack of Christianity this deserted chapel was a fatal witness . IV Now this mystical thing happened . As this son of a line of preachers brooded on this unlovely strife among men , he lost the equipoise of the scholar and student of modern history . He grew narrower and more intense . The burden of his responsibility as a preacher of Christ grew daily more insupportable . Toward the end of the week he announced preaching in the schoolhouse on Sunday afternoon , and at the hour set he found the room crowded with people of all ages and sorts . His heart grew heavy as he looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzled faces of grim-looking men , who studied him with keen , unsympathetic eyes . He had hard , unfriendly material to work with . There were but few of the opposite camp present , while the Baptist leaders were all there , with more curiosity than sympathy in their faces . They exulted to think the next preacher to come among them as an evangelist should be a Baptist . After the singing , which would have dribbled away into failure but for Mattie , Wallace rose , looking very white and weak , and began his prayer . Some of the boys laughed when his voice stuck in his throat , but he went on to the end of an earnest supplication , feeling he had not touched them at all . While they sang again , he sat looking down at them with dry throat and staring eyes . How hard , how unchristian-like , they all were . What could he say to them ? He saw Mattie gazing up at him , and on the front seat sat three beautiful little girls huddled together with hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them the thought came to him , What is the goodness of a girl -- of a child ? It is not partisan -- it is not of creeds , of articles -- it is goodness of thought , of deeds . His face lighted up with the inward feeling of this idea , and he rose resolutely . " Friends , with the help of Christ I am come among you to do you good . I shall hold meetings each night here in the schoolhouse until we can unite and rebuild the church again . Let me say now , friends , that I was educated a Baptist . My father was a faithful worker in the Baptist Church , and so was his father before him . I was educated in a Baptist college , and I came here hoping to build up a Baptist Church . " He paused . " But I see my mistake . I am here to build up a Church of Christ , of good deeds and charity and peace , and so I here say I am no longer a Baptist or Methodist . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rebuild the church which stands rotting away there . " His voice rang with determination as he uttered those words . The people listened . There was no movement now . Even the babies seemed to feel the need of being silent . When he began again it was to describe that hideous wreck . He delineated the falling plaster , the litter around the pulpit , the profanation of the walls . " It is a symbol of your sinful hearts ! " he cried . Much more he said , carried out of himself by his passion . It was as if the repentant spirit of his denominational fathers were speaking through him ; and yet he was not so impassioned that he did not see , or at least feel , the eyes of the strong young girl fixed upon him ; his resolutions were spoken to her , and a swift response seemed to leap from her eyes . When it was over , some of the Methodists and one of the Baptists came up to shake hands with him , awkwardly wordless , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist brethren slipped outside to discuss the matter . Some were indignant , others much moved . Allen went by him with an audible grunt of derision , with a dark scowl on his face , but Mattie smiled at him , with tears still in her eyes . She had been touched by his vibrant voice ; she had no sins to repent of . The skeptics of the neighborhood were quite generally sympathetic . " You 've struck the right trail now , parson , " said Chapman , as they walked homeward together . " The days of the old-time denominationalism are about played out . " But the young preacher was not so sure of it , now that his inspiration was gone . He remembered his debt to his college , to his father , to the denomination , and it was not easy to set aside the grip of such memories . He sat late revolving the whole situation in his mind . When he went to bed his problem was still with him , and involved itself with his dreams ; but always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to go on -- or so it seemed to him . He was silent at breakfast . He went to school with a feeling that a return to teaching little tow-heads to count and spell was now impossible . He sat at his scarred and dingy desk while they took their places , and his eyes had a passionate intensity of prayer in them which awed his pupils . He had assumed new grandeur and terror in their eyes . When they were seated he bowed his head and uttered a short plea for grace , and then he looked at them again . On the low front seat , with dangling legs and red , round faces , sat the little ones . Some way he could not call them to his knees and teach them to spell ; he felt as if he ought to call them to him , as Christ did , to teach them love and reverence . It was impossible that they should not be touched by this hideous neighborhood strife . Behind them sat the older children , some of them with rough , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudged each other . The older girls sat with bated breath ; they perceived something strange in the air . Most of them had heard his sermon of the night before . At last he broke silence . " Children , there is something I must say to you this morning . I 'm going to have meeting here to-night , and it may be I shall not be your teacher any more -- I mean in school . I wish you 'd go home to-day and tell your people to come to church here to-night . I wish you 'd all come yourselves . I want you to be good . I want you to love God and be good . I want you to go home and tell your people the teacher ca n't teach children how to read till he has taught the older people to be kind and generous . You may put your books away , and school will be dismissed . " The wondering children obeyed -- some with glad promptness , others with sadness , for they had already come to like their teacher very much . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was as if he were a king abdicating a throne , and these his faithful subjects . Mrs. Allen came over with Mattie to see him that day . She was a good woman , gentle and prayerful , and she said , with much emotion : " Oh , Mr. Stacey , I do hope you can patch things up here . If you could only touch his heart ! He do n't mean to do wrong , but he 's so set in his ways -- if he says a thing he sticks to it . " Stacey turned to Mattie for a word of encouragement , but she only looked away . It was impossible for her to put into words her feeling in the matter , which was more of admiration for his courage than for any part of his religious zeal . He was so different from other men . It did him good to have these women come , and he repeated his vow : " By the grace of our Lord , I am going to rebuild the Cyene Church ! " and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered with emotion . He seemed to recede from her as he spoke , and to grow larger , too . Such nobility of purpose was new and splendid to her . * * * * * The revival was wondrously dramatic . The little schoolhouse was crowded to the doors night by night . The reek of stable-stained coats and boots , the smell of strong tobacco , the effluvia of many breaths , the heat , the closeness were forgotten in the fervor of the young evangelist 's utterances . His voice took on wild emotional cadences which sounded deep places in the heart . To these people , long unused to religious oratory , it was like the return of John and Isaiah . It was poetry and the drama , and processions and apocalyptic visions . This youth had the histrionic spell , too , and his slender body lifted and dilated , and his head took on majesty and power , and the fling of his white hand was a challenge and an appeal . A series of stirring events took place on the third night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbors , and was followed by two Baptist spearmen of the front rank . On Thursday the women were weeping on one another 's bosoms ; only one or two of the men held out -- old Deacon Allen and his antagonist , Stewart Marsden . Grim-visaged old figures they were , placed among repentant men and weeping women . They sat like rocks in the rush of the two factions moving toward each other for peaceful union . Granitic , narrow , keen of thrust , they seemed unmoved , while all around them , one by one , skeptics acknowledged the pathos and dignity of the preacher 's views of life and death . Meanwhile the young evangelist lived at high pressure . He grew thinner and whiter each night . He toiled in the daytime to formulate his thoughts for the evening . He could not sleep till far toward morning . The food he ate did him little good , while his heart went out constantly to his people in strenuous supplication . It was testimony of his human quality that he never for one moment lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for it there night after night . It was his inspiration in speaking , as at the first . On the nights when Mattie was not there his speech was labored ( as the elders noticed ) , but on the blessed nights when she came and sang , her voice , amid all the rest , came to him , and uttered poetry and peace like a rill of cool , sweet water . And afterward , when he walked home under the stars , his mind went with her , she was so strong and lithe and good to see . He did not realize the worshipping attitude the girl took before his divine duties . At last the great day came -- the great night . In some way , perhaps by the growing mass of rushing emotion set in action by some deep-going phrase , or perhaps by some interior slow weakening of stubborn will , Deacon Allen gave way ; and when the preacher called for penitents , the old man struggled to his feet , his seamed , weather-beaten face full of grotesque movement . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a miserable sinner . I want to confess my sins -- here -- before ye all . " He broke into sobbing terrible to hear . " My heart is made -- flesh again -- by the blessed power of Christ .... " He struggled to get his voice . One or two cried , " Praise God ! " but most of them sat silent , awed into immobility . The old man walked up the aisle . " I 've been rebellious -- and now I want to shake hands with you all -- and I ask your prayers . " He bent down and thrust his hand to Marsden , his enemy , while the tears streamed down his face . Marsden turned white with a sort of fear , but he rose awkwardly and grasped the outstretched hand , and at the touch of palms every soul rose as if by electric shock . " Amens ! " burst forth . The preacher began a fervent prayer , and came down toward the grizzled , weeping old men , and they all embraced , while some old lady with sweet , quavering voice raised a triumphal hymn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their emotional tension . Allen turned to Mattie and his wife . " My boy -- send for him -- Herman . " It seemed as if the people could not go away . The dingy little schoolhouse was like unto the shining temple of God 's grace , and the regenerated seemed to fear that to go home might permit a return to hate and strife . So they clung around the young preacher and would not let him go . At last he came out , with Allen holding to his arm . " You must come home with us to-night , " he pleaded , and the young minister with glad heart consented , for he hoped he might walk beside Mattie ; but this was not possible . There were several others in the group , and they moved off two and two up the deep hollows which formed the road in the snow . The young minister walked with head uplifted to the stars , hearing nothing of the low murmur of talk , conscious only of his great plans , his happy heart , and the strong young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which they came he lost something of his spiritual tension , and became more humanly aware of the significance of sitting again with these people . He gave the girl his coat and hat , and then watched her slip off her knitted hood and her cloak . Her eyes shone with returning laughter , and her cheeks were flushed with blood . Looking upon her , the young evangelist lost his look of exaltation , his eyes grew soft and his limbs relaxed . His silence was no longer rapt -- it was the silence of delicious , drowsy reverie . V The next morning he did not rise at all . The collapse had come . The bad air , the nervous strain , the lack of sleep , had worn down his slender store of strength , and when the great victory came he fell like a tree whose trunk has been slowly gnawed across by teeth of silent saw . His drowse deepened into torpor . In the bright winter morning , seated in a gay cutter behind a bay colt strung with slashing bells , Mattie drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the joyous jangle of the bells , the stream of sunlight , and the sparkle of snow crystals , but it only added to the poignancy of her anxiety . She had not yet reached self-consciousness in her regard for the young preacher -- she thought of him as a noble human being , liable to death , and she chirped again and again to the flying colt , whose broad hoofs flung the snow in stinging showers against her face . A call at the doctor 's house set him jogging out along the lanes , while she sent a telegram to Herman . As she whirled bay Tom into the road to go home her heart rose in relief that was almost exaltation . She loved horses . She always sang under her breath , chiming to the beat of their bells , when alone , and now she loosened the rein and hummed an old love-song , while the powerful young horse squared away in a trot which was twelve miles an hour . In such air , in such sun , who could die ? Her good animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the doctor swinging along in his old blue cutter , dozing in country-doctor style , making up for lost sleep . " Out o ' the way , doctor ! " she gleefully called . The doctor roused up and looked around with a smile . He was not beyond admiring such a girl as that . He snapped his whip-lash lightly on old Sofia 's back , who looked up surprised , and , seeming to comprehend matters , began to reach out broad , flat , thin legs in a pace which the proud colt respected . She came of illustrious line , did Sofia , scant-haired and ungracious as she now was . " Do n't run over me ! " called the doctor , ironically , and , with Sofia still leading , they swung into the yard . Mattie went in with the doctor , while Allen looked after both horses . They found Chapman attending Wallace , who lay in a dazed quiet -- conscious , but not definitely aware of material things . The doctor looked his patient over carefully . Then he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been teaching here , or , rather , preaching . " " When did this coom on ? " " Last night . Wound up a big revival last night , I believe . Kind o ' caved in , I reckon . " " That 's all . Needs rest . He 'll be wearin ' a wood jacket if he doosna leave off preachin ' . " " Regular jamboree . I could n't stop him . One of these periodical neighborhood ' awakenings , ' they call it . " " They have need of it here , na doot . " " Well , they need something -- love for God -- or man . " " M -- well ! It 's lettle I can do . The wumman can do more , if the mon 'll be eatin ' what they cuke for ' im , " said the candid old Scotchman . " Mak ' ' im eat ! Mak ' ' im eat ! " Once more Tom pounded along the shining road to Kesota to meet the six-o'clock train from Chicago . Herman , magnificently clothed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hurried toward Mattie . " Well , what is it , Sis ? Mother sick ? " " No ; it 's the teacher . He is unconscious . I 've been for the doctor . Oh , we were scared ! " He looked relieved , but a little chagrined . " Oh , well , I do n't see why I should be yanked out of my boots by a telegram because the teacher is sick ! He is n't kin -- yet . " For the first time a feeling of confusion swept over Mattie , and her face flushed . Herman 's keen eyes half closed as he looked into her face . " Mat -- what -- what ! Now look here -- how 's this ? Where 's Ben Holly 's claim ? " " He never had any . " She shifted ground quickly . " Oh , Herman , we had a wonderful time last night ! Father and Uncle Marsden shook hands --  " " What ! " shouted Herman , as he fell in a limp mass against the cutter . " Bring a physician -- I 'm stricken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They 'd better look . I 'm drowning while they wait . " She untied the horse and came back . " Climb in there and stop your fooling , and I 'll tell you all about it . " He crawled in with tearing groans of mock agony , and then leaned his head against her shoulder . " Well , go on , Sis ; I can bear it now . " She nudged him to make him sit up . " Well , you know we 've had a revival . " " So you wrote . Must have been a screamer to fetch Dad and old Marsden . A regular Pentecost of Shinar . " " It was -- I mean it was beautiful . I saw father was getting stirred up . He prayed almost all day yesterday , and at night -- Well , I ca n't tell you , but Wallace talked , oh , so beautiful and tender ! " " She calls him Wallace ? " mused Herman , like a comedian . " Hush ! And then came the hand-shaking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to , and stayed because he liked the chicken . " The girl was hurt , and she showed it . " If you make fun , I wo n't tell you another word , " she said . " Away Chicago ! enter Cyene ! Well , come , I wo n't fool any more . " " Then after Wallace -- I mean --  " " Let it stand . Come to the murder . " " Then father came and asked me to send for you , and mother cried , and so did he . And , oh , Hermie , he 's so sweet and kind ! Do n't make fun of him , will you ? It 's splendid to have him give in , and everybody feels glad that the district will be all friendly again . " Herman did not gibe now . His voice was gentle . The pathos in the scene appealed to him . " So the old man sent for me himself , did he ? " " Yes ; he could hardly wait till morning . But this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer , and father went in and found him unconscious . Then I went for the doctor . " Bay Tom whirled along in the splendid dusk , his nostrils flaring ghostly banners of steam on the cold , crisp air . The stars overhead were points of green and blue and crimson light , low-hung , changing each moment . Their influence entered the soul of the mocking young fellow . He felt very solemn , almost melancholy , for a moment . " Well , Sis , I 've got something to tell you all . I 'm going to tell it to you by degrees . I 'm going to be married . " " Oh ! " she gasped , with quick , indrawn breath . " Who ? " " Do n't be ungrammatical , whatever you do . She 's a cashier in a restaurant , and she 's a fine girl , " he added , steadily , as if combating a prejudice . He forgot for the moment that such prejudices did not exist in Cyene . Sis was instantly tender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , or you would n't care for her . Oh , I 'd like to see her ! " " I 'll take you up some day and show her to you . " " Oh , will you ? Oh , when can I go ? " She was smitten into gravity again . " Not till the teacher is well . " Herman pretended to be angry . " Dog take the teacher , the old spindle-legs ! If I 'd known he was going to raise such a ruction in our quiet and peaceful neighborhood , I never would have brought him here . " Mattie did not laugh ; she pondered . She never quite understood her brother when he went off on those queer tirades , which might be a joke or an insult . He had grown away from her in his city life . They rode on in silence the rest of the way , except now and then an additional question from Mattie concerning his sweetheart . As they neared the farm-house she lost interest in all else but the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimly in his room , and in the parlor and kitchen as well , and this unusual lighting stirred the careless young man deeply . It was associated in his mind with death and birth , and also with great joy . The house was lighted so the night his elder brother died , and it looked so to him when he whirled into the yard with the doctor when Mattie was born . " Oh , I hope he is n't worse ! " said the girl , with deep feeling . Herman put his arm about her , and she knew he knew . " So do I , Sis . " Allen came to the door as they drove in , and the careless boy realized suddenly the emotional tension his father was in . As the old man came to the sleigh-side he could not speak . His fingers trembled as he took the outstretched hand of his boy . Herman 's voice shook a little : " Well , Dad , Mattie says the war is over . " The old man tried to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last he said , brokenly : " Go right in ; your mother 's waitin ' . " It was singularly dramatic to the youth . To come from the careless , superficial life of his city companions into contact with such primeval passions as these made him feel like a spectator at some new and powerful and tragic play . His mother fell upon his neck and cried , while Mattie stood by pale and anxious . Inside the parlor could be heard the mumble of men 's voices . In such wise do death and the fear of death fall upon country homes . All day the house had swarmed with people . All day this mother had looked forward to the reconciliation of her husband with her son . All day had the pale and silent minister of God kept his corpse-like calm , while all about the white snow gleamed , and radiant shadows filled every hollow , and the cattle bawled and frisked in the barn-yard , and the fowls cackled joyously , what time the mild , soft wind breathed warmly over the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low voice , " Oh mother , how is he ? " " He ai n't no worse . The doctor says there 's no immediate danger . " The girl brought her hands together girlishly , and said : " Oh , I 'm so glad . Is he awake ? " " No ; he 's asleep . " " Is the doctor still here ? " " Yes . " " I guess I 'll step in , " said Herman . The doctor and George Chapman sat beside the hard-coal heater , talking in low voices . The old doctor was permitting himself the luxury of a story of pioneer life . He arose with automatic courtesy , and shook hands with Herman . " How 's the sick man getting on ? " " Vera well -- vera well -- consederin ' the mon is a complete worn-out -- that 's all -- naethin ' more . Thes floom-a-didale bezniss of rantin ' away on the fear o ' the Laird for sax weeks wull have worn out the frame of a bool-dawg . " Herman and Chapman smiled . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yoong mon , " said the grim old warrior . " Weel , now , ai 'll juist be takin ' anither look at him . " Herman went in with the doctor , and stood looking on while the old man peered and felt about . He came out soon , and , leaving a few directions with Herman and Chapman , took his departure . Everything seemed favorable , he said . There was no longer poignancy of anxiety in Mattie 's mind , she was too much of a child to imagine the horror of loss , but she was grave and gay by turns . Her healthy and wholesome nature continually reasserted itself over the power of her newly attained woman 's interest in the young preacher . She went to bed and slept dreamlessly , while Herman yawned and inwardly raged at the fix in which circumstances had placed him . Like many another lover , days away from his sweetheart were lost days . He wondered how she would take all this life in Cyene . It would be good fun to bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned such a trip , and grew so interested in the thought he forgot his patient . In the early dawn Wallace rallied and woke . Herman heard the rustle of the pillow , and turned to find the sick man 's eyes looking at him fixedly , calm but puzzled . Herman 's lips slowly changed into a beautiful boyish smile . " Hello , old man ! How do you find yourself ? " His hearty , humorous greeting seemed to do the sick man good . Herman approached the bed . " Know where you are ? " Wallace slowly put out a hand , and Herman took it . " You 're coming on all right . Want some breakfast ? Make it bucks ? " he said , in Chicago restaurant slang . " White wings -- sunny -- one up coff . " All this was good tonic for Wallace , and an hour later he sipped broth , while Mrs. Allen and the Deacon and Herman stood watching the process with apparently consuming interest . Mattie was still soundly sleeping . Now began delicious days of convalescence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going of the two women , each possessing powerful appeal to him : one the motherly presence which had been denied him for many years , the other something he had never permitted himself to hope for -- a sweetheart 's daily companionship . He lay there planning his church , and also his home . Into the thought of a new church came shyly but persistently the thought of a fireside of his own , with this young girl sitting in the glow of it waiting for him . His life possessed little romance . He had earned his own way through school and to college . His slender physical energies had been taxed to their utmost at every stage of his climb , but now it seemed as though some blessed rest and peace were at hand . Meanwhile , the bitter partisans met each other coming and going out of the gate of the Allen estate , and the goodness of God shone in their softened faces . Herman was skeptical of its lasting quality , but was forced to acknowledge that it was a lovely light . He it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an evidence of good faith . " You say you 're regenerated . Well , prove it -- go ahead and regenerate the church , " he said . The enthusiasm of the neighborhood took flame . It should be done . A meeting was called . Everybody subscribed money or work . It was a generous outpouring of love and faith . It was Herman also who counselled secrecy . " It would be a nice thing to surprise him , " he said . " We 'll agree to keep the scheme from him at home , if you do n't give it away . " They set to work like bees . The women came down one day and took possession with brooms and mops and soap , and while the carpenters repaired the windows they fell savagely upon the grime of the seats and floors . The walls of the church echoed with woman 's gossip and girlish laughter . Everything was scoured , from the door-hinges to the altar rails . New doors were hung and a new stove secured , and then came the painters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cold weather forbade repainting the outside . The sheds were rebuilt by men whose hearts glowed with old-time fire . It was like pioneer days , when " barn-raisings " and " bees " made life worth while in a wild , stern land . The old men were moved to tears , and the younger rough men shouted cheery , boisterous cries to hide their own deep emotion . Hand met hand in heartiness never shown before . Neighbors frequented one another 's homes , and the old times of visiting and brotherly love came back upon them . Nothing marred the perfect beauty of their revival -- save the fear of its evanescence . It seemed too good to last . Meanwhile love of another and merrier sort went on . The young men and maidens turned prayer-meeting into trysts and scrubbing-bees into festivals . They rode from house to house under glittering stars , over sparkling snows , singing : " Hallelujah ! ' t is done : I believe on the Son ; I am saved by the blood Of the Crucified One . " And their rejoicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young horses . Who shall say they did not right ? Did the Galilean forbid love and joy ? No matter . God 's stars , the mysterious night , the bells , the watchful bay of dogs , the sting of snow , the croon of loving voices , the clasp of tender arms , the touch of parting lips -- these things , these joys outweigh death and hell , and all that makes the criminal tremble . Being saved , they must of surety rejoice . And through it all Wallace crawled slowly back to life and strength . He ate of Mother Allen 's chicken-broth and of toast from Mattie 's care-taking hand , and gradually reassumed color and heart . His solemn eyes watched the young girl with an intensity which seemed to take her strength from her . She would gladly have given her blood for him , if it had occurred to her , or if it had been suggested as a good thing ; instead , she gave him potatoes baked to a nicety , and buttered toast that would melt on the tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day a smartly dressed man called to see Wallace . Mattie recognized him as the Baptist clergyman from Kesota . He came in , and , introducing himself said he had heard of the excellent work of Mr. Stacey , and that he would like to speak with him . Wallace was sitting in a rocking-chair in the parlor . Herman was in Chicago , and there was no one but Mrs. Allen and Mattie in the house . The Kesota minister introduced himself to Wallace , and then entered upon a long eulogium upon his work in Cyene . He asked after his credentials , his plans , his connections , and then he said : " You 've done a fine work in softening the hearts of these people . We had almost despaired of doing anything with them . Yes , you have done a won-der-ful work , and now we must reorganize a regular society here . I will be out again when you get stronger , and we 'll see about it . " Wallace was too weak to take any stand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away without protest or explanation of his own plans . When Herman came down on Saturday , he told him of the Baptist minister 's visit and the proposition . Herman stretched his legs out toward the fire and put his hands in his pockets . Then he rose and took a strange attitude , such as Wallace had seen in comic pictures -- it was , in fact , the attitude of a Bowery tough . " Say , look here ! If you want ' o set dis community by de ears agin , you do dat ting -- see ? You play dat confidence game and dey 'll rat ye -- sure ! You invite us to come into a non-partisan deal -- see ?  - -  and den you springs your own platform on us in de joint corkus -- and we wo n't stand it ! Dis goes troo de way it began , or we do n't play -- see ? " Out of all this Wallace deduced his own feeling -- that continued peace and good-will lay in keeping clear of all doctrinal debates and disputes -- the love of Christ , the desire to do good and to be clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized , and he lifted his face to God in the hope that no lesser thing should come in to mar the beauty of His Church . There came a day when he walked out in the sunshine , and heard the hens caw-cawing about the yard , and saw the young colts playing about the barn . And the splendor of the winter day dazzled him as if he were looking upon the broad-flung robe of the Lord Most High . Everywhere the snow lay ridged with purple and brown hedges . Smoke rose peacefully from chimneys , and the sound of boys skating on a near-by pond added the human element . The trouble of concealing the work of the community upon the church increased daily , and Mattie feared that some hint of it had come to him . She had her plan . She wanted to drive him down herself , and let him see the reburnished temple alone . But this was impossible . On the day when he seemed able to go , her father drove them all down . Marsden was there also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new carpet on the platform . As they drew near the church , Wallace said : " Why , they 've fixed up the sheds ! " Mattie nodded . She was trembling with the delicious excitement of it -- she wanted him hurried into the church at once . He had hardly time to think before he was whirled up to the new porch , and Marsden came out , followed by several women . He was bewildered by it all . Marsden helped him out with hearty voice , sounding : " Careful now ! Do n't hurry ! " Mattie took one arm , and so he entered the church . Everything repainted ! Everything warm and bright and cozy ! The significance of it came to him like a wave of light , and he took his seat in the pulpit chair and stared at them all with a look on his pale face which moved them more than words . He was like a man transfigured by an inward glow . His eyes for an instant flamed with this marvellous fire , then darkened , softened with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , and he could only say : " Friends -- brethren ! " Marsden , after much coughing , said : " We all united on this . We wanted to have you come to the church and -- Well , we could n't bear to have you see it again the way it was . " He understood it now . It was the sign of a united community . It set the seal of Christ 's victory over evil passions , and the young preacher 's head bowed in prayer , and they all knelt , while his weak voice returned thanks to the Lord for his gifts . Then they all rose and shook off the oppressive solemnity , and he had time to look around at all the changes . At last he turned to Mattie and reached out his hand -- he had the boldness of a man in the shadow of some mighty event which makes false modesty and conventions shadowy things of little importance . His sharpened interior sense read her clear soul , and he knew she was his , therefore he reached her his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which died out as she stood proudly by his side , while he said : " And Martha shall help me . " Therefore , this good thing happened -- that in the midst of his fervor and his consecration to God 's work , the love of woman found a place . **71;3218;TOOLONG AN AFTERWORD : OF WINDS , SNOWS , AND THE STARS O witchery of the winter night ( With broad moon shouldering to the west ) In the city streets the west wind sweeps Before my feet in rustling flight ; The midnight snows in untracked heaps Lie cold and desolate and white . I stand and wait with upturned eyes , Awed with the splendor of the skies And star-trained progress of the moon . The city walls dissolve like smoke Beneath the magic of the moon , And age falls from me like a cloak ; I hear sweet girlish voices ring Clear as some softly stricken string --  ( The moon is sailing to the west . ) The sleigh-bells clash in homeward flight ; With frost each horse 's breast is white --  ( The big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lettie ! " " Good night , Ben ! " ( The moon is sinking at the west . ) " Good night , my sweetheart . " Once again The parting kiss while comrades wait Impatient at the roadside gate , And the red moon sinks beyond the west . THE END
