txt Several physicians , surgeons and laboratory workers of international reputation , who are interested especially in the study and treatment of malignant disease , have been engaged for nearly a year in carrying out a new procedure in cancer cases at the General Memorial Hospital , 106th Street and Central Park West . The medical men believe that iheY have effected cures in a considerable number of cases that had failed to respond to all other known methods of treatment . Moreover , they feel that a sufficient number of patients have shown the beneficial effects of tae treatment to warrant the belief that is of permanent value , and will have a wide application in the variety and physical distribution of malignant growths that may be attacked successfully . The therapeutic agent employed is a serum of a kind never before used When the necessary laboratory experiments to determine its efficacy were completed and after it was used in the hospital , it was employed with equal success in private practice . All , or nearly all , of the cases in which it was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patients were In . a hopeless . condition from the standpoint . of the surgeon , They were merely scraps of humanity in whom the knife , the X ' rays , radium and other serums had failed to effect more than temporary ' relief or improvement . Some of the patients treated with the new serum , have exhibited no signs or symptoms malignancy for many months . Official Report Expected . It is expected that within a , short time the Medical Board of , the tion will publish an OffiCiareeport  --  bOntaining the name of the discoverer of the new serum , its ' composition , the details of the preliminary laboratory work , and the individual medical histo ? ries of the patients so far treated in the hospital . They ' forecast this report as one of the most important contributions to science emanating from the medical profession in this ? country . The Medical Board of the General Me morial Hospital . is composed of the foi1 lowing physicians and surgeons : Dr. James Ewing , Professor of Pathology , Cornell Medical College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical Surgery , Cornell : Dr. William Downes , 1 surgeon to St. Luke 's Hospital ; Dr. E. L. Keyes : Jr , , professor , Cornell ; Dr. H. H. Janeway ; Dr. S. P. Beebe , Professor of Experimental Therapeutics , Cornell , and Dr. Richard Weil , Assistant Professor of Experimental Therapeutics , Cornell . The institution practically is administered by members of the Faculty of the Cornell Medical School , with which it has been associated since last May , when Dr. James Douglas , President of Phelps , Dodge &; Co .. gave a large sum of money in addition to a very considerable amount of radium , with the end in view that the General MemoriaP Hospital would become one of the largest and most important institutions in the country for the treatment of cancer . Radium and X-Ray Superseded ? It is the opinion of those now engaged in ' administering and watching the effects of the new serum that it already has superseded the use of radium and X-rays. it has been the experience of some of the surgeons who a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radium that the obliteration of malignant manifestations by this wonderful element is only temporary . Some even have gone so far as to express the ' opinion that the recurrence of cancers so treated has exhibited a more malignant tendency than the original growth . There connected With the General Meinorial Hospital have not witnessed and fresh outbreaks of cancer following the disappearance of secondary growths treated with the serum . Carcinomatous growth , ( true cancer , ) sarcomata , and the epitheliomata which generally are classed as inoperable are either recurrent growths covering large areas or growths involving practically inaccessible regions , such as . the throat . with its numerous contiguous glands , or the Oesophagus . The General Memorial Hospital physicians believe that the serum in use there will prove of particular service in cases of this class . In addition , patients afflicted with cancer of the breast and involving the adjacent smaller glands have been treated successfully . The serum is used by injection . The cancerous growths break down , disinteera te , and disappear , . it Is asserted . One yof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be typical of . cases already discharged as cured , is that of a person suffering from an epithelioma of he right temple which , three months ago . measured three by two inches . Now , at the expiration of three months ' treatment , the greater part of the area has been replaced by healthy scar tissue , while the affected area is no more than an inch in diameter and is lessening day by day . Cancer of Tongue Gone . Another typical case was that of a patient suffering from an extensive cancer of the tongue with secondary involvement of . neighboring glands . The tumor mass disintegrated , and the patient apparently has been cured . The medical profession is awaiting the publication of a report on this subject by the authorities of the General Memorial Hospital with a great deal of interest . And , meantime , the majority of surgeons who come into contact daily with sufferers from malignant disease are continuing to advocate the early use of the knife as , the only certain method of dealing with this dreaded malady .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
