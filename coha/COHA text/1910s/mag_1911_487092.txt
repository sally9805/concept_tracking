" Nelson &; Sons of London have in preparation a complete edition of Victor Hugo 's works in fifty-one volumes , two volumes to appear every month ; the edition will begin with " Les Misera.bles " in four volumes . We have received " Webster 's New Standard American Dictionary , " encyclopedic edition , issued by Laird &; Lee of Chicago . The volume , which of course has no connection with " Webster 's International Dictionary , " produced at Springfield , Mass. , has several features which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . By excluding obsolete words they offer " a practically unabridged dictionary " in portable compass So in place of rathe we have rubberneck and for feriy , fan ( a baseball enthusiast ) . Here , as might be expected , there is inconsistency . Busk ( to prepare one 's self and buss ( to kiss ) have retained their places , while certain slang almost as old as that cited is lacking . Mythological and geographical words are conveniently put in the general vocabulary . " The Paracelsus of Robert Browning , " by Christina Pollock Denison ( Baker &; Taylor ) , is designed to facilitate the initiation of students into the twin mysteries of poetry and alchemy . The book is composed of the following parts : pp 3-34 , a sketch of the life and character of Paracelsus ; 37-57 , a summary of the philosophy of Paracelsus , 61-64 , a note on the composition and form of the poem ; 67-190 , the poem in extenso ; 193-231 , general review of the poem , consisting of excerpts united by prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsiderable The collection of Lecky 's " Historical and Political Essays , " first issued by his widow in 1908 ( Longmans ) , has appeared in a new edition The essays will all repay reading , though of a varying degree of interest and value . The book notices , on the whole , like those of Lady Blennerhassett 's " Madame de Stael " and Leroy-Beaulieu 's " Israel Among the Nations , " appear perfunctory ( some errors in the latter article ought not to have been retained ) , while the essays on ' Thoughts on History " and " Ireland in the Light of History " were , perhaps , best worth preserving . But Lecky was not preeminently an essayist His " Carlyle 's Message to His Age " ( Sunday afternoon lecture to working men ) inevitably recalls Lowell 's brilliant and acute pages on the same subject ( ua his review of " Frederick the Great " ) , greatly to the disadvantage of the English historian . " Siberia : A Record of Travel , Climbing , and Exploration " ( Scribner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1905 , has reached a second edition . As the record of a winter journey , mainly undertaken for business purposes , but resulting in a daring exploration of the Altai Mountains , and the ascent of the Belukha to the height of 14,000 feet , this volume is quite unique Mr. Turner describes minutely Siberia 's dairy industry , in which he is chiefly interested , and the development of which he holds to be of great importance alike to Siberia and to Great Britain . His modesty , fairmindedness , and keenness of observation are conspicuous throughout the book , which will retain its place in the literature of travel . It is , therefore , to be regretted that his statistics , which relate to the year 1903 , were not brought up to date in the new edition The French alone , apparently , can write on mysterious subjects without adding to them a fog of their own Una Birch , in her " Secret Societies and the French Revolution ' : ( Lane ) , certainly shows that , as Lowell says , " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a coherent story or a clear picture from her pages , in spite of her learning , genuine or doubtful . Her touch-and-go method may not be out of place in dealing with such shadowy characters as Saint-Germain and Cagliostro , but it becomes irritating when substantial historical and literary celebrities appear upon the scene . Francis Bacon is gravely classed among the Rosicrucians , and " altar and throne " are held as fully responsible for the death of Caghostro in the Inquisitor 's prison as for the guillotining of the writer Cazotte and the persecution of the Pertectibilist Weishaupt . The author moves in a world of conjectures and surmises . The criminal procedure embodied in the Code Napoleon " seems " to her " to have been ciolved out of the conclaves " of the lodge of the " Neuf Soeurs " , and " is it incredible , " she asks ( her questions are many and comprehensive ) , " that Madame de Stael , in hei many interviews with men of letters , such as Goethe , Schiller , and Schlegel , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She evidently takes the " many " interviews with Goethe and Schiller and their serious import for granted , just as she seems not to doubt that the Comte de Saint-Germain made a " judicious bestowal " to Louis XV of " pictures by Velrsquez and Murillo . " But , after all , what is true in history ? Perhaps some day , the author hopes , we shall know whether Saint-Germain was , " as men have so often called him , a charlatan , or whether he was , as some believe him to have been , a political genius of unrivalled ambition and great accomplishment " When she descends to solid ground , we ought to add , as in the essay on " Religious Liberty and the French Revolution , " she becomes clearer and more restrained The " American Political Ideas " of John Fiske are reprinted by Houghton Mifflin Co . The " Story of a New England Town " has been included , and the whole is prefaced by an introduction of seventy-five Pages by John Spencer Clark . The three chapters which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered as lectures before the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1880 . The introduction gives us some interesting letters written by Fiske to his wife in June of the preceding year , when he delivered six lectures at University College , London , on the subject of America 's place in history . It was the success of these lectures that led Huxley to engage Fiske for the Royal Institution . Aside from these letters , the introduction is mainly devoted to a discussion of the lectures as " an embodiment of style in literary art " It is shown at somewhat too great length how they exemplify all the textbook rules of Economy , Simplicity , Sequence , Climax , and Variety . Mr. Clark yields to no one in admiration of Fiske , and clearly regards him as one of America 's greatest historians , as well as a literary genius of the first water . Fiske was certainly a cs inter of excellent English , and he must have been a fascinating lecturer . Being something of a philosopher , he was partial to those " large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry down . He knew a good deal about all periods of history , and the title of the lectures here printed was exactly suited to him ? " American Political Ideas Viewed from the Standpoint of Universal History . " Hence , he was suggestive rather than profound , striking rather than original or subtile in his thinking , apt at hitting upon analogies rather than penetrating in his insight . One suspects that Fiske a as often guilty of the terrible crime of getting an idea first and then finding the facts to support it . He charged his subject without ever fully realizing its hidden difficulties , and had always the air of coming through at top speed , triumphant , with colors flying Certainly , his work was immensely worth while . His books will be read - alien those of many more erudite historians are forgotten , and , after all , it is not easy to point out the value of histories that nobody reads Fiske 's faith in the ultimate federation of Europe gives his book an additional interest at the present time Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy pages by Garet Garrett , who has drawn upon material contributed by him to the columns of the Evening Post In " Where the Money Grows " ( Harpers ) , Wall Street types , manners , and superstitions are sketched with a rapid , incisive stroke by one who is evidently familiar with his subject and has learned the art of easy narrative . Wall Street is largely a tenebrous region , and not alone to the outsider . The men who have their life and being there are ap-parently the creatures of queer theories , traditions , fears , and habits to which they subscribe without understanding , and so go on making or losing money without very well knowing how or why . As an antidote to popular conceptions ' of Wall Street routine based on the revelations of Thomas W. Lawson and Charles Klein , such a delightful bit as Mr. Garrett 's sketch of a bank president at work is extremely effective . It would be ! interesting to see the writer 's graceful wit applied to broader themes . Miss Mary White Ovington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Man " , Long-mans ) is marked by frankness and thorough knowledge It was feared that , as one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and long a worker among the colored people of New York , she might let her sympathies override her judgment . This proves not to be the case She in no wise glosses over the negro 's weaknesses , but , after stating them , dwells on the conditions which make for immorality among the women , for laziness and inefficiency or crime among the men . The picture is the drama of a worthy race struggling upward under most difficult conditions Economically so handicapped that comparatively few men can earn enough to support their families without aid from their wives , discriminated against at every turn by the labor unions , and barred from most places of resort for harmless amusement , those of slight moral stamina fall readily When one considers also that there was virtually no marriage relation any one was bound to respect among the race until after emancipation , it is not surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of virtue of the white The high percentage of improper guardianship among the negroes , and the grave number of depraved negro girls which Miss Ovington records , Show where the work must be done in the immediate future if ' the race is to be helped As for the labor question , Miss Ovington rightly points out that " North or South the negro gets an opportunity to work where he is imperatively needed " But just as soon as he can the white man pushes the black man toward jobs for which he himself does not care to compete Hence many honest places are closed to the negro , but the avenues to vice and crime never . But despite this , Miss Ovington finds that the bulk of the negroes who struggle for life in the great city have procured regular work and a fairly steady , if poor , pay To the majority of them the North , in Miss Ovington 's words " seems to have brought something of liberty and happiness . " Particularly the colored musicians and entertainers seem to get on well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of Williams and Walker , and Cole and Johnson , is here set forth . Where many despond about the future for the city-bred negro , Miss Ovington is optimistic . She records that his prospect " begins to be bright " Through the vast streams of Jewish and Latin immigrants she feels that New York may be helped beyond its provincialism that , now spells bitter prejudice . " If New York really becomes a cosmopolitan city , let us believe , " she writes , " the negro will bring to it his highest genius and will walk through it simply and quietly unnoticed , a man among men . " To many this will seem the wish which is father to the thought ; they will fear that the antipathy of race manifested lately in Coatesville and almost every section of the country will more readily affect the newcomers to New York than be changed by the views of foreigners . But democracy is on trial in New York city , as well as the country over , more than the colored man . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and industrial scale shall be permitted to thrust back those who are toiling up after them . That is the issue , and we fancy its solution will come even a little more slowly in our cities than in our rural districts But that it will be solved no one ought to doubt Such sane , wise , and sympathetic studies as Miss Ovington 's contribute not a little thereto . " Erinnerungen : von Ernst Freiherrn von Plener " tStuttgart : Deutsche Verlagsanstalt ) is the exceedingly interesting autobiography of a prominent Austrian politician , political economist , and diplomatist He was born in 1841 , the son of the distinguished Austrian statesman Ignaz von Plener , from whom he not only inherited exr cellent qualities , but also received a careful and in every respect commendable training . The first volume , just issued , contains reminiscences of his youth and early education and a record of his connection with the Austrian Embassies in Paris and London from 1865 to 1871 During this period he associated intimately with the most eminent persons in both countries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science , and national culture constitute the most attractive and instructive part of the mem-oirs Lady Elizabeth Herbert of Lea , biographer , author of many short stories , and of books of travel , is dead at her home in London She was the mother of the late Sir Michael Herbert , who was ambassador to Washington , and widow of Sidney Herbert , war minister at the time of the Crimean war Among her books we note " Rambles Round the World , " " Wayside Tales , " and Lives of Monsignor Dupanloup , Garcia Moreno , St John Baptist , de Rossi , and Mother Teresa Dubouche . Harper 's Magazine for November has the opening chapters of a Life of Mark Twain by Albert Bigelow Paine , whom Mr. Clemens designated as his official biographer . Mr. Paine , like his predecessors in the same field , labors under the disadvantage of being forced to compete against the vast amount of biographical matter supplied by Mark Twain himself in his novels , travel volume and separate sketches , numberless public addresses , and the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is little left for the formal , biographer except to systematize and elaborate . Mr Paine gives a pleasing account of the boyhood of Mark Twain . It is the story of a lad of ordinary promise , with more than ordinary capacities for mischief , and a decided gift for leadership . The origins of " Tom Sawyer " and " Huckleberry Finn " are traced . Two characteristic stories of Mark Twain are quoted . On page 492 of an edition of Suetonius , which Mr Clemens was fond of reading , there is reference to a certain Flavius Clemens , who was notorious " for his want of energy . " In the margin Mark Twain wrote . " I guess this is where our line-starts . " Speaking of the family 's migrations , Mark Twain once said : " In 1843 my father caught me in a lie . It is not this fact that gives me the date , but the house we lived in . We were there only a year . " In the same number of Harpers , Professor Lounsbury announces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction in English composition , and for the underlying theory that it is necessary to make every college man into a writer . He makes the classic argument that the sense of style Is inborn and that it is developed , as far as it can be developed , by the study and contemplation of the great masters of literature Setting undergraduates to write badly , and then having their errors corrected by incompetent instructors , strikes Professor Lounsbury as a very futile business The writer begins with the statement that he expects nobody to agree with him . We hasten to be ? among the first to realize this ' expectation . The case is sadly overstated . There is no ground for assuming that it is the aim of the college to turn every undergraduate into a " writer " in the professional sense . " There is no more reason or necessity for it , " says Professor Lounsbury , " than there is for every man to become a mathematician or a Musician or an architect or an engineer or a painter .

The Century has a one-act play by the late W S. Gilbert , of a type we do not readily associate with the author of " Pinafore " and " The Mikado " It is entitled " The Hooligan , " and deals with the last hours of a murderer condemned tobehanged . Aside from the emotional clutch inherent in the subject , we find 9ao special qualities of observation , instruction , or dramatic impetus in this little piece Mary Austin 's article in the American Magazine , on why the New Theatre failed , is the most thoughtful discussion we have seen on this vexed subject Mrs Austin contends that the management of the New Theatre made a fatal mistake when it tried to be practical " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To realize the aims of its founders and the best aspirations to which it gave birth , it should have searched out and fostered the kind of art that the commercial manager was either too timid or too uneducated to encourage .

" But instead of being a guide , the New Theatre became an imitator . It produced plays whose popularity had been proved in private theatres or new plays which promised to be popular because they were like the plays being produced by the private managers . The sub-title chosen by Louise Collier Willcox for her paper on Nietzsche , in the North American Review , " A Doctor for Sick Souls , " is not a happy description of one who by the author 's own account was a physician who failed to cure himself , and whose methods were those of Christian Science To those of us who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laudatory as the writer may imagine .

The author is Professor Paolo Amaducei of Rovigo , and his theory is , in few words , that Dante 's journey , " from its beginning in the dark wood to its end in the Empyrean , " is an image of the journey of the children of Israel from Egypt to the Promised Land as allegorically interpreted in a work of St. Peter Damian , " De quadragesima et quadraginta duabus Ilebrmorum mansionibus " The " Drama Commedia " to be properly understood must be divided into forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march and resting place having the same allegorical meaning that St. Peter Damian assigns to those of the Israelites.
