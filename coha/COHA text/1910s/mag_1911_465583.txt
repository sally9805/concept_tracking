IF a man is to study a subject , he should go where there is plenty of it . As soon as I reached the thriving little city of Tucson , in southern Arizona , I was convinced that I had made no mistake in accepting the invitation of Dr. D. T. IlaeDougal to use the Carnegie Desert Laboratory , of which he is the director , as a center from which to carry on a study of the influences of climate . I had not been at the handsome Old Pueblo Club two hours before I inadvertently complained that a temperature of ninety-five degrees at the beginning of March was excessive . My complaints met no sympathy . I was merely given to understand that theclimate of southern Arizona may be warm , but nevertheless it is ideal . If I really wanted to enjoy it , I must wait three months until the thermometer rose to a hundred and ten or fifteen degrees . Long before the three months were finished I was firmly convinced that , together with the sunshine , fresh air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the few commodities which are both abundant and inexpensive in Arizona . My friends all said that my plans did not seem quite right . An automobile may he an excellent thing , but they doubted whether it was exactly appropriate for use in studying deserts , discovering ruins , and visiting Indians . When we had eight punctures in a day and were finally forced to make part of one trip in a wagon we agreed with them , but that was a mere incident . Starting from the Desert Botanical Laboratory , we found that an automobile was exactly the conveyance in which to make trips in all directions in southern Arizona and in the neighboring Mexican State of Sonora . The distances in this desert country are so great and the population so scanty that even a " bug-bunter , " as all field scientists are called , needs a much more rapid means of conveyance than in more densely inhabited regions . We were obliged to negotiate all kinds of roads , and we learned how great are the possibilities of a good machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightest possible body . We had wheels of large size , being thirty-four inches in diameter . They were fitted with four-and-a-half-inch tires , so that the total diameter was forty-three inches . This gave good clearance over stumps and on deeply rutted roads , but not quite enough for the boulder on which we broke a gear-case . We attempted only one hill that proved too steep . The trouble there was that the slope was so great that the gasoline would not rim up-hill into the earbureter , The worst of our enemies was the sand of dry river bottoms , but the large size of the tires enabled us to cross even the broadest of the " rivers with t h e sandy side up , " which everywhere take the place of ordinary streams of wa ter . Automobiling in the desert is delightful . No other form of traveling gives such a complete sense of freedom . Having put on our oldest , shabbiest clothes and gotten out of town , we cared absolutely nothing for appearances . That in itself did a vast deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grime were an inevitable part of each day 's programme . The greatest element of freedom , however , lay in the fact that we carried all the necessities of life with us . One of our number , Mr. Sykes , knew everything about automobiles and other machines , so that we did not care what broke . Only once did I fear that the automobile had outwitted him . That was when we stuck , temporarily , on the far side of a river of sand in Mexico . lie was a temperate man , and not profane , but that time he became angry and swore a terrible oath ? " The curses of seven motherless pigs upon it ! " The machine trembled at the imprecation and at once climbed up the sandy bank to the firm ground on top . A hotel was quite as unnecessary as a repair-shop . Our beds were slung behind on a carrier , a six-gallon tank of water and numerous canteens quarreled for room with the feet of the man on the back seat , a big " grub-box " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts for repairs on the left , and the cooking kit and sundry other necessities occupied one of the rear seats . Besides all this we had an extra tank of gasoline under the legs of the men actually beheaded in this way , and who on another occasion was saved from a similar fate only by the catching of the barbed wire on the rods of the windshield , I was glad that it was not our habit to take chances by riding fast at night . It seems strange to an Easterner that there should be no redress under such circumstances , but in Arizona a man has a right to fence his land , and that ends t h a matter . The fences always irritated me . Not that I mind a fresh tear in my coat every time I went through a fence to look at the potsherds of an ancient village , but I always wanted to cut the wire and take my horse through when I was on horseback . That will not do , however , even though one carries wire and pretends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sacred institution , and to cut it is a grave offense . Why should it not be sacred ? In many cases it is actually worth more than the land which it surrounds . Land is cheap , only one or two dollars an acre in many places , while fences cost work and cash . The most delightful feature of automobiling in the desert is the night . Every evening , as the sun neared the horizon , we began to look for a bit of smooth sand as sleeping-ground , a dead ironwood or mesquite tree for fuel , and a pleasant view off toward the ever-present mountains . After dinner we lay on the ground around the fire and talked . The conversation almost always began in the same way . " What a fine camp this is ! I believe it 's the best we 've had yet . Is n't the night superb ? Who would have believed that after so hot a day we should enjoy sitting near a fire at night ? Just look at the moon . It seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old man , if you wake up early to-morrow morning and see the cornet , just call me , will you ' ? Nights like this make up for any number of hot days . I wish it were night all the time . " Then we grew philosophic and discussed the relation of plants or animals to peculiar types of environment , the similarity of the behavior of man and brutes , the origin of law , or some other trilling theme . At last it was time to go to bed . It was always a nuisance to be obliged to rouse up and prepare our blankets , even though it required only a pull and a pat . Of course there was invariably a thorn which stuck in one 's back as soon as he lay down . But , after all , what did a thorn or anything else matter ? The sky was so beautiful and the air so fresh that we wanted to enjoy them for hours , but somehow they disappeared as soon as we lay down . The first that we knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was saying , " Was n't this a bully night for sleeping ? " The glorious nights of the desert more than make up for its hot , sunny days . As we left Tucson on one of our trips , lines of massive cottonwood-trees raised domes of deep green beside little irrigation ditches , while on either side fair fields of alfalfa refreshed the eye . On the right , beyond a wooden bridge over the dry bed of the Santa Cruz River , a picturesque old ruin of adobe recalled the romantic days when the Spaniards in-vaded the land . For the love of God they established this mission and many others , where holy padres gave up their lives for their flocks , while ungodly soldiers grew rich with illicit gains . Beyond the church a weedless vegetable-garden and an adobe house surrounded by shacks of rough boards and galvanized iron joined hands with a junk-heap in the shade of a cottonwood in indicating that thrifty Chinese were at work . Across the road , behind a wire fence , a little garden of gay flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark straight hair , proclaimed that Mexico had begun . To be sure , the international boundary was seventy miles distant , and the largest city of Arizona lay only a mile behind us . Yet to all intents and purposes we were in Mexico . Few places in the United States are more foreign than southern Arizona , outside of the towns and mining-camps . All that day , and many another , we rode without meeting a single person who spoke English as his native tongue , and very few who spoke English at all . " No sabe , " is what they all replied , for they were Mexicans , or else Indians who knew as much Spanish as English . The white man , in spite of his pride , has not subdued the country . lie may govern it , and own it , and exploit it , but when it comes to living in it , he can not hold his own except in the towns . It is not the sandy desert of our childish fancy . with drifting yellow dunes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Arab horseman , spear in hand , stoops for a drink . Nor is it the barren , gravelly desert of Persia , most desolate of all the lindscapes of the world ; nor yet the drab sagebrush desert of LTtah and Nevada . On the contrary , it is the most beautiful of deserts , the strange arboreal desert of southern Arizona , The traveler familiar with deserts in other parts of the world finds here a great surprise . He is accustomed to the jagged outlines and delicate shading which prevail in desert mountains . He expects that the hills will appear brown and barren close at hand , while in the distance range after range shades off into purple , dark blue , pale blue , and then a fairy tint looking as if a piece of the sky had been torn from the blue of the zenith and placed against the lighter blue of the horizon . He is accustomed to seeing every mountain range half smothered in interminable slopes of gravel which head far up on the flanks of the hills and sometimes cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain , and leaves only a little peak standing far out from the main ranges like an island in the midst of a plain well-nigh as smooth as the sea . In Arizona , just as in Persia , one has only to look at the topography to know that for hundreds of thousands or millions of years the country has been dry . If it had not been dry the topography , would be like that of the Eastern States . The boulders , gravel , sand , and fine soil washed down by rain and flood from the mountains would have been slowly carried onward to the sea , and the space between the mountain ranges would be filled with small valleys where brooks would run among rounded hilts well covered with soil . Because of the aridity , however , all but a few of the very largest streams have for ages dried up or sunk into the ground and disappeared soon after leaving the mountains . Hence the material which they have brought . down has been deposited not far from its place of origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have formed steep slopes covered with boulders . The finer parts have been washed out farther to form vast coalescent fans of gravel . These " bajadas , " as the Spaniards call them , sweep grandly out with ever-lessening slope for ten or twenty miles , to end in terraces overlooking alluvial bottom-lands , or in broad playas of naked soil where the finest materials are deposited when the waters of floods spread themselves in sheets and disappear . Almost none of the material from the bills is carried to the sea and lost . Therefore the plains and the great slopes of gravel are steadily rising upon the mountains , threatening to entomb the source from which they were themselves derived . The surprising feature of the desert of southern Arizona is the great amount of vegetation , not merely in the relatively moist valleys , but on the dry gravelly slopes of the bajadas . There one looks for nothing but poor grasses and little weeds . Instead of this he finds hundreds and thousands of square miles of gently sloping gravel covered with an abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an annual rainfall of only ten or twelve inches appear barren and brown , but here the general landscape is green throughout the year . For mile after mile we rode through great plains covered with the despised grease-wood , or creosote bush . The nearer bushes usually appeared scattered , a n d the ground between any two was dry and bare , yet as soon as we looked away , beyond a distance of one or two hundred feet , the whole country seemed to be verdant . The creosote is a poor , useless shrub , from three to six feet high as a rule , with pudgy , sticky little leaves a n d an indeterminate half-spicy odor . Yet it can be most beautiful when the low morning sun is reflected from the gummy green leaves , or bathes the abundant yellow flowers in glory and shines through the fuzzy seed-vessels , converting them into spots of gray surrounded by radiant white halos . Beyond the creosote flats we hastened past small mesquite-trees covered with a wealth of dainty leaves , like those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purest green imaginable . They show to best advantage in the early spring , when the yellow blossoms form hundreds of gracefully pendent catkins three or four inches long . Other trees grew here and there ? the gray-green ironwood with its stem , unbending thorns , and the palo verde , greenest of trees . Its scanty leaves are merely circular leaflets scarcely a quarter of an inch in diameter . The plant seems to need no leaves , for all the trunk and branches are covered with soft-green bark . Now and again we found the less common of the two species of palo verde in blossom . It was enchanting when the filmy veils of soft yellow thrown over the green domes of the trees stood silhouetted against a background of reddish-black volcanic mountains with sharply serrated peaks and cruel precipices . As we rode through this strange green land we continually repeated Orlando 's question : But we could not people it with tongues as Rosalind 's lover peopled the Forest of A rden . Man has tried to occupy the country and has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next , and fifty from one cultivated area to another . We marveled that a land which appears so prolific should so resist the efforts of man . The reason is not far to seek , however . Southern Arizona and northwestern Mexico He in a region not only of deserts , but of monsoons . They resemble the provinces of Rajputana and Sind in northwestern India , where northeasterly winds prevail in winter and southwesterly in summer . In winter , when the commonest winds are from the north and west , the conditions of the temperate zone are prevalent , and a small amount of rain is precipitated by great cyclonic storms like those which furnish moisture to the greater part of the United States . As the winter is warm , with only a little frost , many plants begin to grow in February . If there were no other rains , all the vegetation would he of small types like those which prevail in most of the deserts of the world , where winter rains are the only kind . After a season of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and June , however , a change takes place . The climatic belts of the earth are so bent to the northward by the heating of the great continent of North America , that the region with which we are dealing falls within the domain of southerly winds , which come up from equatorial regions freighted with moisture . Through July and August and sometimes in September they give rise to heavy thunder - showers . These furnish more rain than the storms of winter , although it falls so rapidly that most of it soon runs off . During the dry spring the small plants of the winter type of vegetation die down , only to be replaced in summer by another crop of quickly growing grasses and flowers , which dry up in October or September . With trees and bushes the case is different . They can not thrive unless the growing season is at least four or five months long . Hence ordinary deserts which have rain in winter and an absolutely dry season of five or six months in summer are treeless . In southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees and the summer rains complete it , while various adaptations , such as widely spreading roots , diminutive leaves , and organs for the storage of water or for the prevention of evaporation , enable the plants to live through the hot , dry period from the beginning of April to the end of June . Thus the country has not only a winter and summer crop of small plants which last but a few months , but also a fairly dense growth of bushes and small trees . The total amount of vegetation is far greater than in places which have the same amount of rainfall for the whole year but receive it all in winter . Unfortunately neither the winter nor the summer rains are abundant enough to make agriculture possible except where irrigation is practised . Hence the country is a desert in spite of its verdure . The cacti are the most unique feature of the verdant arboreal desert . The man with a camera goes daft over them . Whenever I took a picture , I found myself skirmishing about to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cactus is called . If I could not find a suhuaro with its stately branches like a huge candelabrum , it was usually possible to find at least a spiny , many-branched cholla , the most unmitigatedly vicious of all cacti , or a flat-leaved harmless opuntia of the prickly-pear species . At the time of our journey the cacti were in blossom , to our great delight . It would be hard to find any flowers more beautiful than those which form a coronet of white around the tops of the giant cactus , and produce a many-seeded - fig- like fruit , one of the staples of the diet of the Indians . The slender bells , some three inches long , are not pure white , but of a slightly creamy tint . Heavy masses of yellow stamens form a pleasing contrast to the pale petals , especially when a shiny black bee is burrowing for honey . The petals have a peculiarly soft quality , not sticky , but as if the surface bad actual depth . The low-growing prickly-pear is by no means so aristocratic as the suhuaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon and sometimes to orange , have a very friendly quality . In the flowering season no cacti are so interesting as two closely similar species which have no common name , but are known to scientists as Opuntia versicolor and Opuntia spinosior . They are scraggly , branching forms from three to six feet high , with stems of many shades from purple to green . Ordinarily they are unattractive , but when the flowers come out , one is tempted to spend hours in wandering from one to another to see what the color will be . Each plant has its own peculiar color , the same when newly opened or when fading . On some plants the flowers are almost green , on others pale yellow , orange , or brown . And as if this were not enough , one soon finds plants whose blossoms are bright pink or purple , or varying 3hades of red . A single plant never has flowers of more than one color , but one may look at scores of different plants and scarcely find two bearing the same shade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems as if it were horn with the wrinkles of age in its plump body . All its life it has a somewhat superior air , as if its hoard of water were some precious family heirloom handed down through countless generations . Perhaps it would seem less like a remnant of earlier days if its acquaintance could be made more readily ; but who can really know a plant so armed with spines ? Cattle would gladly eat it , but when they attempt to do so they are almost sure to get thorns in their tongues . Often we saw prickly-pears whose leaves they had gingerly nibbled in attempts to obtain something green and juicy to relieve the monotony of a diet of dry grass which a winter drought had forced upon the cattle from September till the following summer . The cholla and other branching forms are too thorny to be eaten at all by animals . Their loose-jointed branches often break off as the cattle brush past them , and hang from the neck or flanks , rankling for days . But the archaic appearance is deceitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . On the contrary , it is one of the newest of the great families of plants . No real cacti have ever been found in the fossil state . The family seems to have originated so recently that it has not yet had time to spread beyond the limits of America . From Mexico , which was probably its original home , it has spread northward and eastward , so that one energetic little species of prickly-pear is found far away on the sunny side of steep hills in rainy Connecticut ; while other species have penetrated far into South America . Most families of plants are much more widely disseminated than this , and have representatives in both the Old World and the New . The cacti appear to have originated so recently that since they began to spread there has been no land connection of such a kind that they could migrate from one hemisphere to the other . To be sure , the Mediterranean countries are full of the prickly-pear . Every one who has been in Greece in the autumn has seen . venders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow or reddish tint and three or four inches long , and the other seemingly filled with rotten fruit of the same kind . When a buyer comes along , the purpose of the second basket becomes apparent . The vender with a dexterous sweep of his knife strips the skin from a prickly-pear and throws it into the basket on his left , while the buyer takes the juicy fruit and wends his way homeward undisturbed by the fear of pricking his fingers on the clusters of minute little thorns which stud its surface . The prickly-pear , however , is not a native of the Mediterranean countries . It was introduced into Spain from Mexico in the days of the Spanish conquerors , and has now spread far and wide . The cactus represents almost the acme of Nature 's clever method of adapting living forms to difficult types of environ ment . Beginning with species of plants which inhabited the water , she made a tremendous step forward when a few plants learned to live upon the land . Since that day the progress of evolution has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent and easily accessible supply of water . Our commonest plants take water from the soil even when there is so little that the human hand can not feel the moisture . As the damper parts of the earth 's surface became fully occupied , vegetation spread out into drier regions . In the last age of geological time Nature has outdone herself . She has produced a plant which can grow to the estate of a lordly succulent tree on mountain slopes so hot and sunny that for months it is painful at noon to touch the heated rocks which project among patches of the thinnest , scantiest soil . The cacti are far from archaic ; they are the youngest and most highly developed among the families of plants ? the most successful of living forms in the struggle with aridity , the masterpiece of Nature in the greenest of all earth 's deserts .
