txt Sacrifice for the Red Cross . I do not wish to miss the opportunity of bringing to the attention of the public in general , while the Red Cross drive Is still fresh in their minds , the splendid co-operation the Red Cross had in the lower part of the city . During the week of May 20 to 27 each evening I canvassed two little moving picture houses on Third Avenue in the vicinity of Fourteenth Street . The results Were more than gratifying and far greater than I expected . Tho patrons of these two little theatres are people of the working class , and being a breadwinner myself , I appreciate what it means to give at this time , when mere existence is one of the problems of the day . Tho spirit in which they received the Red Cross girls each evening encouraged us to go ahead with the work , but I must admit that it hurt occasionally to think what they sacrificed in giving up their pennies for this great cause . Rut they did not stop at pennies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . Quarters , dimes , and nickels , and they made It felt that : they wanted to do their bit . They did , and nobly too . VERA R. NVOLFiT . New York , May 28 , 1918.
