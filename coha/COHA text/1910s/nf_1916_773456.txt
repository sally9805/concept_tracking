txt // collection to possess a single skull which is not bisected longitudinally  --  until the angles and measurements here mentioned , together with a number of others of which I can not speak in this place , are determined , and tabulated with reference to the basicranial axis as unity , for large numbers of skulls of the different races of Mankind , I do not think we shall have any very safe basis for that ethnological craniology which aspires to give the anatomical characters of the crania of the different Races of Mankind . At present , I believe that the general outlines of what may be safely said upon that subject may be summed up in a very few words . Draw a line on a globe , from the Gold Coast in Western Africa to the steppes of Tartary . At the southern and western end of that line there live the most dolichocephalic , prognathous , curly-haired , dark-skinned of men  --  the true Negroes . At the northern and eastern end of the same line there live the most brachycephalic , orthognathous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartars and Calmucks . The two ends of this imaginary line are indeed , so to speak , ethnological antipodes . A line drawn at right angles , or nearly so , to this polar line through Europe and Southern Asia to IIindostan , would give us a sort of equator , around which round-headed , oval-headed , and oblongheaded , prognathous and orthognathous , fair and dark races  --  but none possessing the excessively // marked characters of Calmuck or Negro  --  group themselves . It is worthy of notice that the regions of the antipodal races are antipodal in climate , the greatest contrast the world affords , perhaps , being that between the damp , hot , steaming , alluvial coast plains of the West Coast of Africa and the arid , elevated steppes and plateaux of Central Asia , bitterly cold in winter , and as far from the sea as any part of the world can be . From Central Asia eastward to the Pacific Islands and subcontinents on the one hand , and to America on the other , brachycephaly and orthognathism gradually diminish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , on the American Continent ( throughout the whole length of which a rounded type of skull prevails largely , but not exclusively ) * than in the Pacific region , where , at length , on the Australian Continent and in the adjacent islands , the oblong skull , the projecting jaws , and the dark skin reappear ; with so much departure , in other respects , from the Negro type , that ethnologists assign to these people the special title of " Negritoes . " The Australian skull is remarkable for its narrowness and for the thickness of its walls , especially in the region of the supraciliary ridge , p // which is frequently , though not by any means invariably , solid throughout , the frontal sinuses remaining undeveloped . The nasal depression , again , is extremely sudden , so that the brows overhang and give the countenance a particularly lowering , threatening expression . The occipital region of the skull , also , not unfrequently becomes less prominent ; so that it not only fails to project beyond a line drawn perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , begins to shelve away from it , forwards , almost immediately . In consequence of this circumstance , the parts of the occipital bone which lie above and below the tuberosity make a much more acute angle with one another than is usual , whereby the hinder part of the base of the skull appears obliquely truncated . Many Australian skulls have a considerable height , quite equal to that of the average of any other race , but there are others in which the cranial roof becomes remarkably depressed , the skull , at the same time , elongating so much that , probably , its capacity is not diminished . The majority of skulls possessing these characters , which I have seen , are from the neighbourhood of Port Adelaide in South Australia , and have been used by the natives as water vessels ; to which end the face has been knocked away , and a string passed through the vacuity and the occipital foramen , so that the skull was suspended by the greater part of its basis . // Fig. 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Port , with the jaw attached , and of the Neanderthal skull , both reduced to one-third of the size of nature . A small footnote additional amount of flattening and lengthening , with a corresponding increase of the supraciliary ridge , would convert the Australian brain case into a form identical with that of the aberrant fossil . And now , to return to the fossil skulls , and to the rank which they occupy among , or beyond , // these existing varieties of cranial conformation . In the first place , I must remark , that , as Professor Schmerling well observed ( supra , p. 161 ) in commenting upon the Engis skull , the formation of a safe judgment upon the question is greatly hindered by the absence of the jaws from both the crania , so that there is no means of deciding , with certainty , whether they were more or less prognathous than the lower existing races of mankind . And yet , as we have seen , it is more in this respect than any other , that human skulls vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain case of an average dolichocephalic European differing far less from that of a Negro , for example , than his jaws do . In the absence of the jaws , then , any judgment on the relations of the fossil skulls to recent Races must be accepted with a certain reservation . But taking the evidence as it stands , and turning first to the Engis skull , I confess I can find no character in the remains of that cranium which , if it were a recent skull , would give any trustworthy clue as to the Race to which it might appertain . Its contours and measurements agree very well with those of some Australian skulls which I have examined  --  and especially has it a tendency towards that occipital flattening , to the great extent of which , in some Australian skulls , I have alluded . But all Australian skulls do not present this flattening , and the supraciliary ridge // of the Engis skull is quite unlike that of the typical Australians . On the other hand , its measurements agree equally well with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mark of degradation about any part of its structure . It is , in fact , a fair average human skull , which might have belonged to a philosopher , or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage . The case of the Neanderthal skull is very different . Under whatever aspect we view this cranium , whether we regard its vertical depression , the enormous thickness of its supraciliary ridges , its sloping occiput , or its long and straight squamosal suture , we meet with ape-like characters , stamping it as the most pithecoid of human crania yet discovered . But Professor Schaaffhausen states ( supra , p. 178 ) , that the cranium , in its present condition , holds 1033,24 cubic centimetres of water ; or about 63 cubic inches , and as the entire skull could hardly have held less than an additional 12 cubic inches , its capacity may be estimated at about 75 cubic inches , which is the average capacity given by Morton for Polynesian and Hottentot skulls . So large a mass of brain as this , would alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not extend deep into the organization ; and this conclusion is borne out by the dimensions of the other bones of the skeleton given // by Professor Schaaffhausen , which show that the absolute height and relative proportions of the limbs , were quite those of an European of middle stature . The bones are indeed stouter , but this and the great development of the muscular ridges noted by Dr. Schaaffhausen , are characters to be expected in savages . The Patagonians , exposed without shelter or protection to a climate possibly not very dissimilar from that of Europe at 1 he time during which the Neanderthal man lived , are remarkable for the stoutness of their limb bones . In no sense , then , can the Neanderthal bones be regarded as the remains of a human being intermediate between Men and Apes . At most , they demonstrate the existence of a Man whose skull may be said to revert somewhat towards the pithecoid type  --  just as a Carrier , or a Pouter , or a Tumbler , may sometimes put on the plumage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though truly the most pithecoid of known human skulls , the Neanderthal cranium is by no means so isolated as it appears to be at first , but forms , in reality , the extreme term of a series leading gradually from it to the highest and best developed of human crania . On the one hand , it is closely approached by the flattened Australian skulls , of which I have spoken , from which other Australian forms lead us gradually up to skulls having very much the type of the Engis cranium . And , on the other hand , it is even more closely // affined to the skulls of certain ancient people who inhabited Denmark during the " stone period , " and were probably either contemporaneous with , or later than , the makers of the " refuse heaps , " or " Kjokkenznoddings " of that country . The correspondence between the longitudinal contour of the Neanderthal skull and that of some of those skulls from the tumuli at Borreby , very accurate drawings of which have been made by Mr. Busk , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supraciliary ridges are nearly as prominent , and the skull is as low . Furthermore , the Borreby skull resembles the Neanderthal form more closely than any of the Australian skulls do , by the much more rapid retrocession of the forehead . On the other hand , the Borreby skulls are all somewhat broader , in proportion to their length , than the Neanderthal skull , while some attain that proportion of breadth to length ( 80 : 100 ) which constitutes brachycephaly. * // In conclusion , I may say , that the fossil remains of Man hitherto discovered do not seem to me to take us appreciably nearer to that lower pithecoid form , by the modification of which he has , probably , become what he is . And considering what is now known of the most ancient Races of men ; seeing that they fashioned flint axes and flint knives and bone-skewers , of much the same pattern as those fabricated by the lowest savages at the present day , and that we have every reason to believe the habits and modes of living of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mammoth and the tichorhine Rhinoceros till now , I do not know that this result is other than might be expected . Where , then , must we look for primeval Man ? Was the oldest Homo sapiens pliocene or niocene , or yet more ancient ? In still older strata do the fossilized bones of an ape more anthropoid , or a Man more pithecoid , than any yet known await the researches of some unborn paleontologist ? Time will show . But , in the meanwhile , if any form of the doctrine of progressive development is correct , we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that has yet been made of the antiquity of Man . 178 IV . ON THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. 1865 . ETHNOLOGY is the science which determines the distinctive characters of the persistent modifications of mankind ; which ascertains the distribution of those modifications in present and past times , and seeks to discover the causes , or conditions of existence , both of the modifications and of their distribution . I say " persistent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with chance and transitory peculiarities of human structure . And I speak of " persistent modifications " or " stocks " rather than of " varieties , " or " races , " or " species , " because each of these last well-known terms implies , on the part of its employer , a preconceived opinion touching one of those problems , the solution of which is the ultimate object of the science ; and in regard to which , therefore , ethnologists are especially bound to 210 // keep their minds open and their judgments freely balanced . Ethnology , as thus defined , is a branch of ANTHROPOLOGY , the great science which unravels the complexities of human structure ; traces out the relations of man to other animals ; studies all that is especially human in the mode in which man 's complex functions are performed ; and searches after the conditions which have determined his presence in the world . And anthropology is a section of ZOOLOGY , which again is the animal half of Biology  --  the science of life and living things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects of the ethnologist . The paths or methods , by following which he may hope to reach his goal , are diverse . He may work at man from the point of view of the pure zoologist , and investigate the anatomical and physiological peculiarities of Negroes , Australians , or Mongolians , just as he would inquire into those of pointers , terriers , and turnspits ,  --  " persistent modifications " of man 's almost universal companion . Or he may seek aid from researches into the most human manifestation of humanity  --  Language ; and assuming that what is true of speech is true of the speaker  --  a hypothesis as questionable in science as it is in ordinary life  --  he may apply to mankind themselves the conclusions drawn from a searching analysis of their words and grammatical forms . Or , the ethnologist may turn to the study of 212 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. the practical life of men ; and relying upon the inherent conservatism and small inventiveness of untutored mankind , he may hope to discover in manners and customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clue to the origin of the resemblances and differences of nations . Or , he may resort to that kind of evidence which is yielded by History proper , and consists of the beliefs of men concerning past events , embodied in traditional , or in written testimony . Or , when that thread breaks , Archaeology , which is the interpretation of the unrecorded remains of man 's works , belonging to the epoch since the world has reached its present condition , may still guide him . And , when even the dim light of archaeology fades , there yet remains Palaeontology , which , in these latter years has brought to daylight once more the exuvia of ancient populations , whose world was not our world , who have been buried in river beds immemorially dry , or carried by the rush of waters into caves , inaccessible to inundation since the dawn of tradition . Along each , or all , of these paths the ethnologist may press towards his goal ; but they are not equally straight , or sure , or easy to tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to us . Archeological and historical investigations are of great value for all those peoples whose ancient state has differed widely from their present condition , and who have the good or evil fortune to // possess a history . But on taking a broad survey of the world , it is astonishing how few nations present either condition . Respecting five-sixths of the persistent modifications of mankind , history and archeology are absolutely silent . For half the rest , they might as well be silent for anything that is to be made of their testimony . And , finally , when the question arises as to what was the condition of mankind more than a paltry two or three thousand years ago , history and archaeology are , for the most part , mere dumb dogs . What light does either of these branches of knowledge throw on the past of the man of the New World , if we except the Central Americans and the Peruvians ; on that of the Africans , save those of the Valley of the Nile and a fringe of the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and central Asiatic peoples , the former of whom probably , and the last certainly , were , at the dawn of history , substantially what they are now ? While thankfully accepting what history has to give him , therefore , the ethnologist must not look for too much from her . Is more to be expected from inquiries into the customs and handicrafts of man ? It is to be feared not . In reasoning from identity of custom to identity of stock the difficulty always obtrudes itself , that the minds of men being everywhere similar , differing in quality and quantity but not in kind of faculty , like circumstances must tend to produce 214 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. like contrivances ; at any rate , so long as the need to be met and conquered is of a very simple kind . That two nations use calabashes or shells for drinking-vessels , or that they employ spears , or clubs , or swords and axes of stone and metal as weapons and implements , can not be regarded as evidence that these two nations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place between them ; seeing that the convenience of using calabashes or shells for such purposes , and the advantage of poking an enemy with a sharp stick , or hitting him with a heavy one , must be early forced by nature upon the mind of even the stupidest savage . And when he had found out the use of a stick , he would need no prompting to discover the value of a chipped or whetted stone , or of an angular piece of native metal , for the same object . On the other hand , it may be doubted , whether the chances are not greatly against independent peoples arriving at the manufacture of a boomerang , or of a bow ; which last , if one comes to think of it , is a rather complicated apparatus ; and the tracing of the distribution of inventions as complex as these , and of such strange customs as betel-chewing and tobacco-smoking , may afford valuable ethnological hints . Since the time of Leibnitz , and guided by such men as Humboldt , Abel Rernusat , and Klaproth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirms that " the history of nations , // termed Ethnology , must be mainly founded on the relations of their languages . " An eminent living philologer , August Schleicher , in a recent essay , puts forward the claims of his science still more forcibly : " If , however , language is the human rear ' igoY , jv , the suggestion arises whether it should not form the basis of any scientific systematic arrangement of mankind ; whether the foundation of the natural classification of the genus Homo has not been discovered in it . " How little constant are cranial peculiarities and other so-called race characters ! Language , on the other hand , is always a perfectly constant diagnostic . A German may occasionally compete in hair and prognathism with a negro , but a negro language will never be his mother tongue . Of how little importance for mankind the socalled race characters are , is shown by the fact that speakers of languages belonging to one and the same linguistic family may exhibit the peculiarities of various races . Thus the settled Osmanli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplify the Mongol type . On the other hand , the Magyar and the Basque do not depart in any essential physical peculiarity from the Indo-Germans , whilst the Magyar , Basque , and Indo-Germanic tongues are widely different . Apart from their inconstancy , again , the so-called race characters can hardly yield a scientifically natural system . Languages , on the other hand , readily fall into a natural arrangement , like that of which other vital products are susceptible , especially when viewed from their morphological side . . . . The externally visible structure of the cerebral and facial skeletons , and of the body generally , is less important than that no less material but infinitely more delicate corporeal structure , the function of which 216 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. is speech . I conceive , therefore , that the natural classification of languages , is also the natural classification of mankind . With language , moreover , all the higher manifestations of man 's vital activity are closely interwoven , so that these receive due recognition in and by that of speech . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an adjuvant to ethnology , I must venture to doubt , with Rudolphi , Desmoulins , Crawfurd , and others , its title to the leading position claimed for it by the writers whom I have just quoted . On the contrary , it seems to me obvious that , though , in the absence of any evidence to the contrary , unity of languages may afford a certain presumption in favour of the unity of stock of the peoples speaking those languages , it can not be held to prove that unity of stock , unless philologers are prepared to demonstrate , that no nation can lose its language and acquire that of a distinct nation , without a change of blood corresponding with the change of language . Desinoulins long ago put this argument exceedingly well : " Let us imagine the recurrence of one of those slow , or sudden , political revolutions , or say of those secular changes which among different people and at different epochs have annihilated historical monuments and even extinguished tradition . In that case , the evidence , now so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a French colony , who , by the very effect of the subordination involved in slavery lost their own diverse languages and adopted that of their masters , would vanish . And metaphysical philosophers , observing the identity of Ilaytian French with that spoken on the shores of the Seine and the Loire , would argue that the men of St. Domingo with woolly heads , black and oily skins , small calves , and slightly bent knees , are of the same race , descended from the same parental stock , as the Frenchmen with silky brown , chestnut , or fair hair , and white skins . For they would say , their languages are more similar than French is to German or Spanish . " * It must not be imagined that the case put by Desmoulins is a merely hypothetical one . Events precisely similar to the transport of a body of Africans to the West India Islands , indeed , can not have happened among uncivilised races , but similar results have followed the importation of bodies of conquerors among an enslaved people over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which two or more nations speaking widely different tongues have not become intermixed ; and there is hardly a language of Europe of which we have any right to think that its structure affords a just indication of the amount of that intermixture . As Dr. Latham has well said : " It is certain that the language of England is of Anglo-Saxon origin , and that the remains of the original Kettle are unimportant . It is by no means so certain that the blood of Englishmen is equally Germanic . A vast 218 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. amount of Keltieism , not found in our tongue , very probably exists in our pedigrees . The ethnology of France is still more complicated . Many writers make the Parisian a Roman on the strength of his language ; whilst others make him a Felt on the strength of certain moral characteristics , combined with the previous Kclticism of the original Gauls . Spanish and Portuguese , as languages , are derivations from the Latin ; Spain and Portugal , as countries , are Iberic , Latin , Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Latin all the world over ; yet surely there must be much Keltic blood in Lombardy , and much Etruscan intermixture in Tuscany . " In the ninth century every man between the Elbe and the Niemen spoke some Slavonic dialect ; they now nearly all speak German . Surely the blood is less exclusively Gothic than the speech . " * In other words , what philologer , if he had nothing but the vocabulary and grammar of the French and English languages to guide him , would dream of the real causes of the unlikeness of a Norman to a Provencal , of an Orcadian to a Cornishman ? how readily might he be led to suppose that the different climatal conditions to which these speakers of one tongue have so long been exposed , have caused their physical differences ; and how little would he suspect that these are due ( as we happen to know they are ) to wide differences of blood . Few take duly into account the evidence which exists as to the ease with which unlettered savages gain or lose a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cruise among the Islands // of the Western Pacific , " especially remarks upon the " avidity with which the inhabitants of the polyglot islands of Melanesia , from New Caledonia to the Solomon Islands , adopt the improvements of a more perfect language than their own , which different causes and accidental communication still continue to bring to them ; " and he adds that " among the Melanesian islands scarcely one was found by us which did not possess , in some cases still imperfectly , the decimal system of numeration in addition to their own , in which they reckon only to five . " Yet how much philological reasoning in favour of the affinity or diversity of two distinct peoples has been based on the mere comparison of numerals ! But the most instructive example of the fallacy which may attach to merely philological reasonings , is that afforded by the Feejeans , who are , physically , so intimately connected with the adjacent Negritos of New Caledonia , &c.,; that no one can doubt to what stock they belong , and who yet , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The case is as remarkable as if the Canary Islands should have been found to be inhabited by negroes speaking Arabic , or some other clearly Semitic dialect , as their mother tongue . As it happens , the physical peculiarities of the Feejeans are so striking , and the conditions under which they live are so similar 220 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. to those of the Polynesians , that no one has ventured to suggest that they are merely modified Polynesians  --  a suggestion which could otherwise certainly have been made . But if languages may be thus transferred from one stock to another , without any corresponding intermixture of blood , what ethnological value has philology ?  --  what security does unity of language afford us that the speakers of that language may not have sprung from two , or three , or a dozen , distinct sources ? Thus we come , at last , to the purely zoological method , from which it is not unnatural to expect more than from any other , seeing that , after all , the problems of ethnology are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely distributed animal he studies . The father of modern zoology seems to have had no doubt upon this point . At the twenty-eighth page of the standard twelfth edition of the " Systema Nature , " in fact , we find : footnote Linnueus ' definition of what he considers to be mere varieties of the species Man are , it will be observed , as completely free from any allusion to linguistic peculiarities as those brief and pregnant sentences in which he sketches the characters of the varieties of the species Dog . " Pilis nigris , naribus patulis " may be set against " auriculis erectis , cauda subtus lanata ; " while the remarks on the morals and manners of the human subject seem as if they were thrown in merely by way of makeweight . Butfon , Blumenbach ( the founder of ethnology as a special science ) , Rudolphi , Bory de St. Vincent , Desmoulins , Cuvier , Retzius , indeed I may say all the naturalists proper , have dealt with man from a no less completely zoological point of view ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been least naturalists , and most linguists , have most neglected the zoological method , the neglect culminating in those who have been altogether devoid of acquaintance with anatomy . Prichard 's proposition , that language is more // persistent than physical characters , is one which has never been proved , and indeed admits of no proof , seeing that the records of language do not extend so far as those of physical characters . But , until the superior tenacity of linguistic over physical peculiarities is shown , and until the abundant evidence which exists , that the language of a people may change without corresponding physical change in that people , is shown to be valueless , it is plain that the zoological court of appeal is the highest for the ethnologist , and that no evidence can be set against that derived from physical characters . What , then , will a new survey of mankind from the Linnean point of view teach us ? The great antipodal block of land we call Australia has , speaking roughly , the form of a vast quadrangle , 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical , to the middle of the temperate , zone . Setting aside the foreign colonists introduced within the last century , it is inhabited by people no less remarkable for the uniformity , than for the singularity , of their physical characters and social state . For the most part of fair stature , erect and well built , except for an unusual slenderness of the lower limbs , the AusTRALIANS have dark , usually chocolate-coloured skins ; fine dark wavy hair ; dark eyes , overhung by beetle brows ; coarse , projecting jaws ; broad and 224 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. dilated , but not especially flattened , noses , and lips which , though prominent , are eminently flexible . The skulls of these people are always long and narrow , with a smaller development of the frontal sinuses than usually corresponds with such largely developed brow ridges . An Australian skull of a round form , or one the transverse diameter of which exceeds eight-tenths of its length , has never been seen . These people , in a word , are eminently " dolichocephalic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation , their crania present considerable variations , some being comparatively high and arched , while others are more remarkably depressed than almost any other human skulls . The female pelvis differs comparatively little from the European ; but in the pelves of male Australians which I have examined , the antero-posterior and transverse diameters approach equality more nearly than is the case in Europeans . No Australian tribe has ever been known to cultivate the ground , * to use metals , pottery , or any kind of textile fabric . They rarely construct huts . Their means of navigation are limited to rafts or canoes , made of sheets of bark . Clothing , except skin cloaks for protection from cold , is a // superfluity with which they dispense ; and though they have some singular weapons , almost peculiar to themselves , they are wholly unacquainted with bows and arrows . It is but a step , as it were , across Bass 's Straits to Tasmania . Neither climate nor the characteristic forms of vegetable or animal life change largely on the south side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him on the north side . The skin of the Tasmanian was dark , though he lived between parallels of latitude corresponding with those of middle Europe in our own hemisphere ; his jaws projected , his head was long and narrow ; his civilization was about on a footing with that of the Australian , if not lower , for I can not discover that the Tasmanian understood the use of the throwing-stick . But he differed from the Australian in his woolly , negro-like hair ; whence the name of Niwni'ro , which has been applied to him and his congeners . Such Negritos  --  differing more or less from the Tasmanian but agreeing with him in ( lark skin and woolly hair  --  occupy New Caledonia , the New Hebrides , the Louisiade Archipelago ; and stretching to the Papuan Islands , and for a doubtful extent beyond them to the north and west , form a sort of belt , or zone , of Negrito population , interposed between the Australians on the west and the inhabitants of the great majority of the Pacific islands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cranial characters of the Negritos vary considerably more than those of their skin and hair , the most notable circumstance being the strong Australian aspect which distinguishes many Negrito skulls , while others tend rather towards forms common in the Polynesian islands . In civilization , New Caledonia exhibits an advance upon Tasmania , and , farther north , there is a still greater improvement . But the bows and arrows , the perched houses , the outrigger canoes , the habits of betel-chewing and of kawa-drinking , which abound more or less among the northern Negritos , are probably to be regarded not as the products of an indigenous civilization , but merely as indications of the extent to which foreign influences have modified the primitive social state of these people . From Tasmania or New Caledonia , to New Zealand or Tongataboo , is again but a brief voyage : but it brings about a still more notable change in the aspect of the indigenous population than that effected by the passage of Bass 's Straits . Instead of being chocolate-coloured people , the Maories and Tongans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or wavy , black hair . And if from New Zealand , we travel some 5,000 miles east to Easter Island ; and from Easter Island , for as great a distance north-west , to the Sandwich Islands ; and thence 7,000 miles , westward and southward , to Sumatra ; and even across the // Indian Ocean , into the interior of Madagascar , we shall everywhere meet with people whose hair is straight or wavy , and whose skins exhibit various shades of brown . These are the Polynesians , Micronesians , Indonesians , whom Latham has grouped together under the common title of AMPHI EsrANS . The cranial characters of these people , as of the Negritos , are less constant than those of their skin and hair . The Maori has a long skull ; the Sandwich Islander a broad skull . Some , like these , have strong brow ridges ; others like the Dayaks and many Polynesians , have hardly any nasal indentation . It is only in the westernmost parts of their area that the Amphinesian nations know anything about bows and arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals or with pottery . Everywhere they cultivate the ground , construct houses , and skilfully build and manage outrigger , or double , canoes ; while , almost everywhere , they use some kind of fabric for clothing . Between Easter Island , or the Sandwich Islands , and any part of the American coast is a much wider interval than that between Tasmania and New Zealand , but the ethnological interval between the American and the Polynesian is less than that between either of the previously named stocks . The typical AMERICAN has straight black hair and dark eyes , his skin exhibiting various shades of reddish or yellowish brown , sometimes inclining 228 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. to olive . The face is broad and scantily bearded ; the skull wide and high . Such people extend from Patagonia to Mexico , and much farther north along the west coast . In the main a race of hunters , they had nevertheless , at the time of the discovery of the Americas , attained a remarkable degree of civilization in some localities . They had domesticated ruminants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of irrigation . They manufactured textile fabrics , were masters of the potter 's art , and knew how to erect massive buildings of stone . They understood the working of the precious , though not of the useful , metals ; * and had even attained to a rude kind of hieroglyphic , or picture , writing . The Americans not only employ the bow and arrow , but , like some Amplinesians , the blow-pipe , as offensive weapons : hut I am not aware that the outrigger canoe has ever been observed among them . I have reason to suspect that some of the Fuegian tribes differ cranially from the typical Americans ; fi and the Northern and Eastern American tribes have longer skulls than their Southern compatriots . But the Esquimaux , who roam on the desolate and ice-hound coast of Arctic America , certainly present us with a new stock . The Esquinunux ( among whom the Greenlanders // are included ) , in fact , though they share the straight black hair of the proper Americans , are generally a duller complexioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have still more prominent cheek-bones . P , ut the circumstance which most completely separates them from the typical Americans , is the form of their skulls , which instead of being broad , high , and truncated behind , are eminently long , usually low , and prolonged backwards . These Hyperborean people clothe themselves in skins , know nothing of pottery , and hardly anything of metals . Dependent for existence upon the produce of the chase , the seal and the whale are to them what the cocoa-nut tree and the plantain are to the savages of more genial climates . Not only are those animals meat and raiment , but they are canoes , sledges , weapons , tools , windows , and fire ; while they support the dog , who is the indispensable ally and beast of burden of the Esquimaux . It is admitted that the Tchuktchi , on the eastern side of Behring 's Straits , are , in all essential respects , Esquimaux ; and I do not know that there is any satisfactory evidence to show that the Tunguses and Samoiedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are indications of Esquimaux characters among the Japanese , and it is possible that their influence may be traced yet further . However this may be , Eastern Asia , from Mant-p 230 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. chouria to Siam , Thibet , and Northern Hindostan , is continuously inhabited by men , usually of short stature , with skins varying in colour from yellow to olive ; with broad cheek-bones and faces that , owing to the insignificance of the nose , are exceedingly fiat ; and with small , obliquely-set * black eyes and straight black hair , which sometimes attains a very great length upon the scalp , but is always scanty upon the face and body . The skull , never much elongated , is , generally , remarkably broad and rounded , with hardly any nasal depression , and but slight , if any , projection of the jaws . Many of these people , from whom the old name of MONGOLIANS may be retained , are nomades ; others , as the Chinese , have attained a remarkable and apparently indigenous civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north-western extremity of Europe the Lapps repeat the characters of the Eastern Asiatics . Between these extreme points , the Mongolian stock is not continuous , but is represented by a chain of more or less isolated tribes , who pass under the name of Calmucks and Tartars , and form Mongolian islands , as it were , in the midst of an ocean of other people . The waves of this ocean are the nations for whom , in order to avoid the endless confusion produced by our present half-physical , half. - philo-  // logical classification , I shall use a new name  - -  XANTHocHRor  --  indicating that they are " yellow " haired and " pale " in complexion . The Chinese historians of the IIan dynasty , writing in the third century before our era , describe , with much minuteness , certain numerous and powerful barbarians with " yellow hair , green eyes , and prominent noses , " who , the black-haired , skew-eyed , and flat-nosed annalists remark in passing , are " just like the apes from whom they are descended . " These people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yenisei , and thence under various names stretched southward to Thibet and Kashgar . Fair-haired and blue-eyed northern enemies were no less known to the ancient Hindoos , to the Persians , and to the Egyptians , on the south and west of the great central Asiatic area ; while the testimony of all European antiquity is to the effect that , before and since the period in question , there lay beyond the Danube , the Rhine , and the Seine , a vast and dangerous yellow or red-haired , fairskinned , blue-eyed population . Whether the disturbers of the marches of the Roman Empire were called Gauls or Germans , Goths , Alans , or Scythians , one thing seems certain , that until the invasion of the Huns , they were largely tall , fair , blue-eyed men . If any one should think fit to assume that , in the year 100 B. C. , there was one continuous Xanthochroic population from the Rhino to the Yeni232 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. sei , and from the Ural mountains to the Hindoo Koosh , I know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , while the existing state of things is rather in its favour than otherwise . For the Scandinavians , the Germans , the Slavonian and the Finnish tribes , to a great extent ; some of the inhabitants of Greece , many Turks , some Kirghis , and some Mantchous , the Ossetes in the Caucasus , the Siahposh , the Rohillas , are at the present day fair , yellow or red haired , and blue-eyed ; and the interpolation of tribes of Mongolian hair and complexion , as far west as the Caspian Steppes and the Crimea , might justly be accounted for by those subsequent westward irruptions of the Mongolian stock , of which history furnishes abundant testimony . The furthermost limit of the Xanthochroi north-westward is Iceland and the British Isles ; south-westward , they are traceable at intervals through Syria and the Berber country , ending in the Canary Islands . The cranial characters of the Xanthochroi are not , at present , strictly definable . The Scandinavians are certainly long-headed ; but many Germans , the Swiss so far as they are Germanized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are short-headed . What were the cranial characters of the ancient " Usuns " and " Ting-lings " of the valley of the Yenisei is unknown . West and south of the area occupied by the chief mass of the Xanthochroi , and north of the // Sahara , is a broad belt of land , shaped like a . Between the forks of the Y lies the Mediterranean ; the stem of it is Arabia . The stem is bathed by the Indian Ocean , the western ends of the forks by the Atlantic . The majority of the people inhabiting the area thus roughly defined have , like the Xanthochroi , prominent noses , pale skins and wavy hair , with abundant beards ; but , unlike them , the hair is black or dark and the eyes usually so . They may thence be called the MELA ? OCIIImI . Such people are found in the British Islands , in Western and Southern Gaul , in Spain , in Italy south of the Po , in parts of Greece , in Syria and Arabia , stretching as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chief inhabitants of Africa north of the Sahara , and , like the Xanthochroi , they end in the Canary Islands . They are known as Belts , Iberians , Etruscans , Romans , Pelasgia s , Berbers , Semites . The majority of them are longheaded , and of smaller stature than the Xanthochroi. * It is needless to remark upon the civilization of these two great stocks . With them has originated everything that is highest in science , in art , in law , in politics , and in mechanical inventions . In their hands , at the present moment , lies the order of the social world , and to them its progress is committed . 234 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY . South of the Atlas , and of the Great Desert , Middle Africa exhibits a new type of humanity in the NEGRO , with his dark skin , woolly hair , projecting jaws , and thick lips . As a rule , the skull of the Negro is remarkably long ; it rarely approaches the broad type , and never exhibits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dwelling in villages ; a maker of pottery , and a worker in the useful as well as the ornamental metals ; employing the bow and arrow as well as the spear , the typical negro stands high in point of civilization above the Australian . Resembling the Negroes in cranial characters , the BUSHMEN of South Africa differ from them in their yellowish brown skins , their tufted hair , their remarkably small stature , and their tendency to fatty and other integumentary outgrowths ; nor is the wonderful click with which their speech is interspersed to be overlooked in enumerating the physical characteristics of this strange people . The so-called " Dravidian " populations of Southern Hindostan lead us back , physically as well as geographically , towards the Australians ; * // while the diminutive MINCOPIES of the Andaman Islands lie midway between the Negro and Negrito races , and , as Mr. Busk has pointed out , occasionally present the rare combination of brachycephaly , or short-headedness , with woolly hair . In the preceding progress along the outskirts of the habitable world , eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been recognized . I have purposely omitted such people as the Abyssinians and the Hindoos of the valleys of the Ganges and Indus , who there is every reason to believe result from the intermixture of distinct stocks . Perhaps I ought for like reasons , to have ignored the Mincopies . But I do not pretend that my enumeration is complete or , in any sense , perfect . It is enough for my purpose if it be admitted ( and I think it can not be denied ) that those which I have mentioned exist , are well marked , and occupy the greater part of the habitable globe . In attempting to classify these persistent modifications after the manner of naturalists , the first circumstance that attracts one 's attention is the broad contrast between the people with straight and wavy hair , and those with crisp , woolly , or tufted hair . Bory de St. Vincent , noting this fundamental distinction , divided mankind accord- 236 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. ingly into the two primary groups of Leiotrichi and Ulotrichi ,  --  terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the accompanying table , because they have been used . It is better for science to accept a faulty name which has the merit of existence , than to burthen it with a faultless newly invented one . footnote Under each of these divisions are two columns , one for the Brachycephali , or short heads , and one for the Dolichocephali , * or long heads . Again , each column is subdivided transversely into four compartments , one for the " leucous , " people with // fair complexions and yellow or red hair ; one for the " leucomelanous , " with dark hair and pale skins ; one for the " xanthomelanous , " with black hair and yellow , brown , or olive skins ; and one for the " melanous , " with black hair and dark brown or blackish skins . It is curious to observe that almost all the woolly-haired people are also long-headed ; while among the straight-haired nations broad heads preponderate , and only two stocks , the Esquimaux and the Australians , are exclusively long-headed . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea , which has subsequently been fully developed by Agassiz , that the distribution of the persistent modifications of man is governed by the same laws as that of other animals , and that both fall into the same great distributional provinces . Thus , Australia , America , south of Mexico ; the Arctic regions ; Europe , Syria , Arabia , and North Africa , taken together , are each regions eminently characterised by the nature of their animal and vegetable populations , and each , as we have seen , has its peculiar and characteristic form of man . But it may be doubted whether the parallel thus drawn will hold good strictly , and in all cases . The Tasmanian Fauna and Flora are essentially Australian , and the like is true , to a less extent , of many , if not of all , the Papuan islands ; but the Negritos who inhabit these islands are strikingly different from the Australians . Again , 238 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. the differences between the Mongolians and the Xanthochroi are out of all proportion greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Asia . But whatever the difficulties in the way of the detailed application of this comparison of the distribution of men with that of animals , it is well worthy of being borne in mind , and carried as far as it will go . Apart from all speculation , a very curious fact regarding the distribution of the persistent modifications of mankind becomes apparent on inspecting an Ethnological chart , projected in such a manner that the Pacific Ocean occupies its centre . Such a chart exhibits an Australian area occupied by dark smooth-haired people , separated by an incomplete inner zone of dark woolly-haired Negritos and Negroes , from an outer zone of comparatively pale and smooth-haired men , occupying the Americas , and nearly all Asia * and North Africa . t Such is a brief sketch of the characters and distribution of the persistent modifications , or stocks , of mankind at the present day . If we seek for direct evidence of how long this state of things has lasted , we shall find little enough , and that little far from satisfactory . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us for less than 400 years ; and of these seven not one // possessed a fragment of written history at the time it came into contact with European civilization . The other four  --  the Negroes , Mongolians , Xanthochroi , and Melanochroi  --  have always existed in some of the localities in which they are now found , nor do the negroes ever seem to have voluntarily travelled beyond the limits of their present area . But ancient history is in a great measure the record of the mutual encroachments of the other three stocks . On the whole , however , it is wonderful how little change has been effected by these mutual invasions and intermixtures . As at the present time , so at the dawn of history , the Melanochroi fringed the Atlantic and the Mediterranean ; the Xanthochroi occupied most of Central and Eastern Europe , and much of Western and Central Asia ; while Mongolians held the extreme east of the Old World . So far as history teaches us , the populations of Europe , Asia and Africa were , twenty * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their broad features and general distribution . The evidence yielded by Archeology is not very definite , but so far as it goes , it is to much the same effect . The mound builders of Central America seem to have had the characteristic short and broad head of the modern inhabitants of that continent . The tumuli and tombs of Ancient 240 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY . Scandinavia , of pre-Roman Britain , of Gaul , of Switzerland , reveal two types of skull  --  a broad and a long  --  of which , in Scandinavia , the broad seems to have belonged to the older stock , while the reverse was probably the case in Britain , and certainly in Switzerland . It has been assumed that the broad-skulled people of ancient Scandinavia were Lapps ; but there is no proof of the fact , and they may have been , like the broadskulled Swiss and Germans , Xanthochroi . One of the greatest of ethnological difficulties is to know where the modern Swedes , Norsemen , and Saxons got their long heads , as all their neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are broadheaded . Again , who were the small-handed * longheaded people of the " bronze epoch , " and what has become of the infusion of their blood among the Xanthochroi ? At present Paleontology yields no safe data to the ethnologist . We know absolutely nothing of the ethnological characters of the men of Abbeville and Hoxne ; but must be content with the demonstration , in itself of immense value , that Man existed in Western Europe when its physical condition was widely different from what it is now , and when animals existed , which , though they // belong to what is , properly speaking , the present order of things , have long been extinct . Beyond the limits of a fraction of . Europe , Palwontology tells us nothing of man or of his works . To sum up our knowledge of the ethnological past of man ; so far as the light is bright , it shows him substantially as he is now ; and , when it grows dim , it permits us to see no sign that he was other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men of different stocks differ as much physiologically as they do morphologically ; but it is very hard to prove , in any particular case , how much of a supposed national characteristic is due to inherent physiological peculiarities , and how much to the influence of circumstances . There is much evidence to show , however , that some stocks enjoy a partial or complete immunity from diseases which destroy , or decimate , others . Thus there seems good ground for the belief that Negroes are remarkably exempt from yellow fever ; and that , among Europeans , the melanochroic people are less obnoxious to its ravages than the xanthochroic . But many writers , not content with physiological differences of this kind , undertake to prove the existence of others of far greater moment ; and , indeed , to show that certain stocks of mankind exhibit , more or less distinctly , the physiological characters of true species . ITnions between these stocks , and still more between the half-breeds arising from their mixture , 242 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. are affirmed to be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between males and females of either stock under the same circumstances . Some go so far as to assert that no mixed breeds of mankind can maintain themselves without the assistance of one or other of the parent stocks , and that , consequently , they must inevitably be obliterated in the long run . Here , again , it is exceedingly difficult to obtain trustworthy evidence and to free the effects of the pure physiological experiment from adventitious influences . The only trial which , by a strange chance , was kept clear of all such influences  --  the only instance in which two distinct stocks of mankind were crossed , and their progeny intermarried without any admixture from without  --  is the famous case of the Pitcairn Islanders , who were the progeny of Bligh 's English sailors by Tahitian women . The results of this experiment , as everybody knows , are dead against those who maintain the doctrine of human hybridity , seeing that the Pitcairn Islanders , even though they necessarily contracted consanguineous marriages , throve and multiplied exceedingly . But those who are disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its support by M. Broca , its latest and ablest advocate , and compare this evidence with that which the botanists , as represented by a Gaertner or by a Darwin , think it indispensable to obtain // before they will admit the infertility of crosses between two allied kinds of plants . They will then , I think , be satisfied that the doctrine in question rests upon a very unsafe foundation ; that the facts adduced in its support are capable of many other interpretations ; and , indeed , that from the very nature of the case , demonstrative evidence one way or the other is almost unattainable . A priori , I should be disposed to expect a certain amount of infertility between some of the extreme modifications of mankind ; and still more between the offsprings of their intermixture . A posteriori , I can not discover any satisfactory proof that such infertility exists . From the facts of ethnology I now turn to the theories and speculations of ethnologists , which have been devised to explain these facts , and to furnish satisfactory answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persistent modifications of mankind , and have caused their distribution to be what it is ? These speculations may be grouped under three heads : firstly , the Monogenist hypotheses ; secondly , those of the Polygenists ; and thirdly , that which would result from a simple application of Darwinian principles to mankind . According to the Monogenists , all mankind have sprung from a single pair , whose multitudinous progeny spread themselves over the world , such as it now is , and became modified into the 244 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. forms we meet with in the various regions of the earth , by the effect of the climatal and other conditions to which they were subjected . The advocates of this hypothesis are divisible into several schools . There are those who represent the most numerous , respectable , and would-be orthodox of the public , and are what may be called " Adamites , " pure and simple . They believe that Adam was made out of earth somewhere in Asia , about six thousand years ago ; that have was modelled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two having been reduced to the eight persons who were landed on the summit of Mount Ararat after an universal deluge , all the nations of the earth have proceeded from these last , have migrated to their present localities , and have become converted into Negroes , Australians , Mongolians , &c.,; within that time . Five-sixths of the public are taught this Ad:uitic Monogenism , as if ' it were an established truth , and believe it . 1 do not ; and I am not acquainted with any man of science , or duly instructed person , who does . A second school of monogenists , not worthy of much attention , attempts to hold a place midway between the Adamites and a third division , who take up a purely scientific position , and require to be dealt with accordingly . This third division , in fact , numbers in its ranks Linnaus , Buffon , Blumenbach , Cuvier , Prichard , and many distinguished living ethnologists. // These " Rational Monogenists , " or , at any rate , the more modern among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth has existed for untold ages ; secondly , that , at a remote period , beyond the ken of Archbishop Usher , man was created , somewhere between the Caucasus and the Hindoo Koosh ; thirdly , that he might have migrated thence to all parts of the inhabited world , seeing that none of them are unattainable from some other inhabited part , by men provided with only such means of transport as savages are known to possess and must have invented ; fourthly , that the operation of the existing diversities of climate and other conditions upon people so migrating , is sufficient to account for all the diversities of mankind . Of the truth of the first of these propositions no competent judge now entertains any doubt . The second is more open to discussion ; for , in these latter days , many question the special creation of man : and even if his special creation be granted , there is not a shadow of a reason why he should have been created in Asia rather than anywhere else . Of all the odd myths that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , " invented quite innocently by Blumenbach , is the oddest . A Georgian woman 's skull was the handsomest in his collection . Hence it became his model exemplar of human skulls , from which all others might be regarded as deviations ; and 246 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. out of this , by some strange intellectual hocuspocus , grew up the notion that the Caucasian man is the prototypic " Adamic " man , and his country the primitive centre of our kind . Perhaps the most curious thing of all is , that the said Georgian skull , after all , is not a skull of average form , but distinctly belongs to the brachycephalic group . With the third proposition I am quite disposed to agree , though it must be recollected that it is one thing to allow that a given migration is possible , and another to admit there is good reason to believe it has really taken place . But I can find no sufficient ground for accepting the fourth proposition ; and I doubt if it would ever have obtained its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very readily tanned and embrowned by the sun . Yet I am not aware that there is a particle of proof that the cutaneous change thus effected can become hereditary , any more than that the enlarged livers , which plague our countrymen in India , can be transmitted ; while there is very strong evidence to the contrary . Not only , in fact , are there such cases as those of the English families in Barbadoes , who have remained for six generations unaltered in complexion , but which are open to the objection that they may have received infusions of fresh European blood ; but there is the broad fact , that not a single indigenous Negro exists either in the great // alluvial plains of tropical South America , or in the exposed islands of the Polynesian Archipelago , or among the populations of equatorial Borneo or Sumatra . No satisfactory explanation of these obvious difficulties has been offered by the advocates of the direct influence of conditions . And as for the more important modifications observed in the structure of the brain , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show in what way they can be effected directly by climate . It is here , in fact , that the strength of the Polygenists , or those who maintain that men primitively arose , not from one , but from many stocks , lies . Show us , they say to the Monogenists , a single case in which the characters of a human stock have been essentially modified without its being demonstrable , or , at least , highly probable , that there has been intermixture of blood with some foreign stock . Bring forward any instance in which a part of the world , formerly inhabited by one stock , is now the dwelling-place of another , and we will prove the change to be the result of migration , or of intermixture , and not of modification of character by climatic influences . Finally , prove to us that the evidence in favour of the specific distinctness of many animals , admitted to be distinct species by all zoologists , is a whit better than that upon which we maintain the specific distinctness of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ETHNOLOGY. adversary were the same thing as proving your own case , the Polygenists would be in a fair way towards victory ; but , unfortunately , as I have already observed , they have as yet completely failed to adduce satisfactory positive proof of the specific diversity of mankind . Like the Monogenists , the Polygenists are of several sects ; some imagine that their assumed species of mankind were created where we find them  --  the African in Africa , and the Australian in Australia , along with the other animals of their distributional province ; others conceive that each species of man has resulted from the modification of some antecedent species of ape  --  the American from the broad-nosed Simians of the New World , the African from the Troglodytic stock , the Mongolian from the Orangs . The first hypothesis is hardly likely to win much favour . The whole tendency of modern science is to thrust the origination of things further and further into the background ; and the chief philosophical objection to Adam being , not his oneness , but the hypothesis of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it may look , an increase , instead of a diminution , of the difficulties of the case . And , as to the second alternative , it may safely be affirmed that , even if the differences between men are specific , they are so small , that the assumption of more than one primitive stock for all is altogether superMETHODS // fluous . Surely no one can now be found to assert that any two stocks of mankind differ as much as a chimpanzee and an orang do ; still less that they are as unlike as either of these is to any New World Simian ! Lastly , the granting of the Polygenist premises does not , in the slightest degree , necessitate the Polygenist conclusion . Admit that Negroes and Australians , Negritos and Mongols are distinct species , or distinct genera , if you will , and you may yet , with perfect consistency , be the strictest of Monogenists , and even believe in Adam and Eve as the primeval parents of all mankind . It is to Mr. Darwin we owe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guise of an eclectic philosopher , presents his doctrine as the key to ethnology , and as reconciling and combining all that is good in the Monogenistic and Polygenistic schools . It is true that Mr. Darwin has not , in so many words , applied his views to ethnology ; but even he who " runs and reads " the " Origin of Species " can hardly fail to do so ; and , furthermore , Mr. Wallace and M. Pouchet have recently treated of ethnological questions from this point of view . Let me , in conclusion , add my own contribution to the same store . I assume Man to have arisen in the manner which I have discussed elsewhere , and probably , though by no means necessarily , in one locality . Whether he arose singly , or a number of examples 250 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. appeared contemporaneously , is also an open question for the believer in the production of species by the gradual modification of pre-existing ones . At what epoch of the world 's history this took place , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the older tertiary , or earlier ; but what is most important to remember is , that the discoveries of late years have proved that man inhabited Western Europe , at any rate , before the occurrence of those great physical changes which have given Europe its present aspect . And as the same evidence shows that man was the contemporary of animals which are now extinct , it ' is not too much to assume that his existence dates back at least as far as that of our present Fauna and Flora , or before the epoch of the drift . But if this be true , it is somewhat startling to reflect upon the prodigious changes which have taken place in the physical geography of this planet since man has been an occupant of it . During that period the greater part of the British islands , of Central Europe , of Northern Asia , have been submerged beneath the sea and raised up again . So has the great desert of Sahara , which occupies the major part of Northern Africa. * The Caspian and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably communicated // with both the Arctic and the Mediterranean oceans. * The greater part of North America has been under water , and has emerged . It is highly probable that a large part of the Malayan Archipelago has sunk , and that its primitive continuity with Asia has been destroyed . Over the great Polynesian area subsidence has taken place to the extent of many thousands of feet  --  subsidence of so vast a character , in fact , that if a continent like Asia had once occupied the area of the Pacific , the peaks of its mountains would now show not more numerous than the islands of the Polynesian Archipelago f What lands may have been thickly populated for untold ages , and subsequently have disappeared and left no sign above the waters , it is of course impossible for us to say ; but unless we are to make the wholly unjustifiable assumption that no dry land rose elsewhere when our present dry land sank , there must be half-a-dozen Atlantises beneath the waves of the various oceans of the world . But if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense alterations , were wholly or in part inhabited before the changes I have indicated began  --  and it is more probable that they 252 METHODS AND RESULTS OF ETHNOLOGY. were than that they were not  --  what a wonderfully efficient " Emigration Board " must have been at work all over the world long before canoes , or even rafts , were invented ; and before men were impelled to wander by any desire nobler or stronger than hunger . And as these rude and primitive families were thrust , in the course of long series of generations , from land to land , impelled by encroachments of sea or of marsh , or by severity of summer heat or winter cold , to change their positions , what opportunities must have been offered for the play of natural selection , in preserving one family variation and destroying another ! Suppose , for example , that some families of a horde which had reached a land charged with the seeds of yellow fever , varied in the direction of woolliness of hair and darkness of skin . Then , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative or absolute exemptions from that scourge , the inevitable tendency would be to the preservation and multiplication of the darker and woollier families , and the elimination of the whiter and smoother haired . In fact , by the operation of causes precisely similar to those which , in the famous instance cited by Mr. Darwin , have given rise to a race of black pigs in the forests of Louisiana , a negro stock would eventually people the region. * Again , how often , by such physical // changes , must a stock have been isolated from all others for innumerable generations , and have found ample time for the hereditary hardening of its special peculiarities into the enduring characters of a persistent modification . Nor , if it be true that the physiological differences of species may be produced by variation and natural selection , as Mr. Darwin supposes , would it be at all astonishing , if , in some of these separated stocks , the process of differentiation should have gone so far as to give rise to the phenomena of hybridity . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the origin of mankind afforded by anatomical considerations , satisfactory proof of the existence of any degree of sterility in the unions of members of two of the " persistent modifications " of mankind , might well be appealed to by Mr. Darwin as crucial evidence of the truth of his views regarding the origin of species in general . V. ON SOME FIXED POINTS IN BRITISH ETHNOLOGY. 1871 . IN view of the many discussions to which the complicated problems offered by the ethnology of the British Islands have given rise , it may be useful to attempt to pick out , from amidst the confused masses of assertion and of inference , those propositions which appear to rest upon a secure foundation , and to state the evidence by which they are supported . Such is the purpose of the present paper . Some of these well-based propositions relate to the physical characters of the people of Britain and their neighbours ; while others concern the languages which they spoke . I shall deal , in the first place , with the physical questions . // dark people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like the Belgic Gauls . The chief direct evidence of the truth of this proposition is the well-known passage of Tacitus : This passage , it will be observed , contains statements as to facts , and certain conclusions deduced from these facts . The matters of fact asserted are : firstly , that the inhabitants of Britain exhibit much diversity in their physical characters ; secondly , that the Caledonians are red-haired and large-limbed , like the Germans ; thirdly , that the Silures have curly hair and dark complexions , like the people of Spain ; fourthly , that the British people nearest Gaul resemble the " Galli . " Tacitus , therefore , states positively what the Caledonians and Silures were like ; but the interpretation of what he says about the other Britons // must depend upon what we learn from other sources as to the characters of these " Galli . " Here the testimony of " divus Julius " comes in with great force and appropriateness . Caesar writes : " Britanniee pars interior ab iis incolitur , quos natos in insula ipsi memoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierant ; qui omnes fere iis nominibus civitatum appellantur quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt , et Bello inlato ibi permanserunt atque agros colere ceeperunt. " * From these passages it is obvious that , in the opinion of Caesar and Tacitus , the southern Britons resembled the northern Gauls , and especially the Beige ; and the evidence of Strabo is decisive as to the characters in which the two people resembled one another : " The men of Britain are taller than the Netts , with hair less yellow ; they are slighter in their persons . " t The evidence adduced appears to leave no reasonable ground for doubting that , at the time of the Roman conquest , Britain contained people of two types , the one dark and the other fair complexioned , and that there was a certain difference between the latter in the north and in the south of Britain : the northern folk being , in the judgment of Tacitus , or , more properly , according to the information he had received from Agricola and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter . As to the distribution of these stocks , all that is clear is , that the dark people were predominant in certain parts of the west of the southern half of Britain , while the fair stock appears to have furnished the chief elements of the population elsewhere . No ancient writer troubled himself with measuring skulls , and therefore there is no direct evidence as to the cranial characters of the fair and the dark stocks . The indirect evidence is not very satisfactory . The tumuli of Britain of pre-Roman date have yielded two extremely different forms of skull , the one broad and the other long ; and the same variety has been observed in the skulls of the ancient Gauls. * The suggestion is obvious that the one form of skull may have been associated with the fair , and the other with the dark , complexion . But any conclusion of this kind is at once checked by the reflection that the extremes of long and short-headedness are to be met with among the fair inhabitants of Germany and of Scandinavia at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-headed , while the Scandinavians are as predominantly longheaded . What the natives of Ireland were like at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain , and for centuries afterwards , we have no certain knowl- 181 // edge ; but the earliest trustworthy records prove the existence , side by side with one another , of a fair and a dark stock , in Ireland as in Britain . The long form of skull is predominant among the ancient , as among modern , Irish . II . The people termed Gauls , and those called Germans , by the Romans , did not differ in any important physical character . The terms in which the ancient writers describe both Gauls and Germans are identical . They are always tall people , with massive limbs , fair skins , fierce blue eyes , and hair the colour of which ranges from red to yellow . / , cuss , the great authority on these matters , affirms broadly that no distinction in bodily feature is to be found between the Gauls , the Germans , and the Wends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians ; and he proves his case by citations from a cloud of witnesses . An attempt has been made to show that the colour of the hair of the Gauls must have differed very much from that which obtained among the Germans , on the strength of the story told by Suetonius ( Caligula , 4 ) , that Caligula tried to pass off Gauls for Germans by picking out the tallest , and making then " rutilare et summittere comam . " The Baron de Belloguet remarks upon this pas-sage : " It was in the very north of Gaul , and near the sea , that Caligula got up this military comedy . And the fact // proves that the BeIg e were already sensibly different from their ancestors , whom Strabo had found almost identical with their brothers on the other side of the Rhine . " But the fact recorded by Suetonius , if fact it be , proves nothing ; for the Germans themselves were in the habit of reddening their hair . Ammianus Marcellinus * tells how , in the year 367 A. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alemanni near the town now called Charpeigne , in the valley of the Moselle ; and how the Roman soldiers , as , concealed by the thick wood , they stole upon their unsuspecting enemies , saw that some were bathing and others " comas rutilantes ex more . " More than two centuries earlier Pliny gives indirect evidence to the same effect when he says of soap : " Galliarum hoc inventum rutilandis eapiilis ... apud Gerinanos majore in usu viris quam fonuinis " t Here we have a writer who flourished not very long after the date of the Caligula story , telling us that the Gauls invented soap for the purpose of doing that which , according to Suetonius , Caligula forced them to do . And , further , the combined and independent testimony of Pliny and Amin ianus assures us that the Germans were as much in the habit of reddening their hair as the Gauls . As to Be Belloguet 's supposition that , even in Cal- // igula 's time , the Gauls had become darker than their ancestors were , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Celsioris statures et candidi poene Gatti sunt omnes , et rutili , luminumque torvitate terribiles , " is his description ; and it would fit the Gauls who sacked Rome . III . In none of the invasions of Britain which have taken place since the Roman dominion , has any other type of man been introduced than one or other of the two which existed during that dominion . The North Germans , who effected what is commonly called the Saxon conquest of Britain , were , most assuredly , a fair , yellow , or red-haired , blueeyed , long-skulled people . So were the Danes and the Norsemen who followed them ; though it is very possible that the active slave trade which went on , and the intercourse with Ireland , may have introduced a certain admixture of the dark stock into both Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest brought in new ethnological elements , the precise value of which can not be estimated with exactness ; but as to their quality , there can be no question , inasmuch as even the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the fair and the dark types of men , already present in Britain . But whether the Norman settlers , on the whole , strengthened the fair or the dark element , is a problem , the etcv BRITISH // ments of the solution of which are not attainable . I am unable to discover any grounds for believing that a Lapp element has over entered into the population of these islands . So far as the physical evidence goes , it is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that the only constituent stocks of that population , now , or at any other period about which we have evidence , are the dark whites , whom I have proposed to call " Melanochroi , " and the fair whites , or " Xanthochroi . " IV . The Xanthochroi and the Melanochroi of Britain are , speaking broadly , distributed , at present , as they were in the time of Tacitus ; and their representatives on the continent of Europe have the same general distribution as at the earliest period of which we have any record . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the movements consequent on civilization and on political changes , there is a predominance of dark men in the west , and of fair men in the east and north , of Britain . At the present day , as from the earliest times , the predominant constituents of the riverain population of the North Sea and the eastern half of the British Channel , are fair men . The fair stock continues in force through Central Europe , until it is lost in Central Asia . Offshoots of this stock extend into Spain , Italy , and Northern India , and by way of Syria and North Africa , to the Canary // Islands . They were known in very early times to the Chinese , and in still earlier to the ancient Egyptians , as frontier tribes . The Thracians were notorious for their fair hair and blue eyes many centuries before our era . On the other hand , the dark stock predominates in Southern and Western France , in Spain , along the Ligurian shore , and in Western and Southern Italy ; in Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Persia , Afghanistan , and Hindostan , shading gradually , through all stages of darkening , into the type of the modern Egyptian , or of the wild Hill-man of the Dekkan . Nor is there any record of the existence of a different population in all these countries . The extreme north of Europe , and the northern part of Western Asia , are at present occupied by a Mongoloid stock , and , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , may be assumed to have been so peopled from a very remote epoch . But , as I have said , I can find no evidence that this stock ever took part in peopling Britain . Of the three great stocks of mankind which extend from the western coast of the great Eurasiatic continent to its southern and eastern shores , the Mongoloids occupy a vast triangle , the base of which is the whole of Pastern Asia , while its apex lies in Lapland . The Melanochroi , on the other hand , may be represented as a broad band stretching from Ireland to Hindostan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two , thins out , so to speak , at either end , and mingles , at its margins , with both its neighbours . Such is a brief and summary statement of what I believe to be the chief facts relating to the physical ethnology of the people of Britain . The conclusions which I draw from these and other facts are  --  ( 1 ) That the Melanochroi and the Xanthochroi are two separate races in the biological sense of the word race ; ( 2 ) That they have had the same general distribution as at present from the earliest times of which any record exists on the continent of Europe ; ( 3 ) That the population of the British Islands is derived from them , and from them only . The people of Europe , however , owe their national names , not to their physical characteristics , but to their languages , or to their political relations ; which , it is plain , need not have the slightest relation to these characteristics . Thus , it is quite certain that , in Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Belga , the Celtw , and the Aquitani ; and that the last were very widely different , both in language and in physical characteristics , from the two former . The Be1gm and the Celtva , on the other hand , differed comparatively little either in physique or in language . On the former point there is the distinct testimony of Strabo ; as to the latter , St. Jerome states that the " Galatians had // almost the same language as the Treviri . " Now , the Galatians were emigrant Volcw Tectosages , and therefore Celtw ; while the Treviri were Belgw. * At the present day , the physical characters of the people of Belgic Gaul remain distinct from those of the people of Aquitaine , notwithstanding the immense changes which have taken place since Cwsar 's time ; but Belgw , Celtu , and Aquitani ( all but a mere fraction of the last two , represented by the Basques and the Bretons ) are fused into one nationality , " le people Francais . " But they have adopted the language of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their original names and languages having almost disappeared . Suppose that the French language remained as the sole evidence of the existence of the population of Gaul , would the keenest philologer arrive at any other conclusion than that this population was essentially and fundamentally a " Latin " race , which had had some communication with Celts and Teutons ? Would he so much as suspect the former existence of the Aquitani ? Community of language testifies to close contact between the people who speak the language , but to nothing else ; philology has absolutely nothing to do with ethnology , except so far as it suggests the existence or the absence of such contact . The contrary assumption , that language is a test of race , has introduced the utmost confusion into // ethnological speculation , and has nowhere worked greater scientific and practical mischief than in the ethnology of the British Islands . What is known , for certain , about the languages spoken in these islands and their affinities may , I believe , be summed up as follows : I. At the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under two principal dialectical divisions , the Cymric and the Gaelic , was spoken throughout the British Islands . Cymric was spoken in Britain , Gaelic * in Ireland . If a language allied to Basque had in earlier times been spoken in the British Islands , there is no evidence that any Euskarian-speaking people remained at the time of the Roman conquest . The dark and the fair population of Britain alike spoke Celtic tongues , and therefore the name " Celt " is as applicable to the one as to the other . What was spoken in Ireland can only be surmised by reasoning from the knowledge of later times ; but there seems to be no doubt that it was Gaelic . II . The Belgce and the Celtie , with the offshoots of the latter in Asia Minor , spoke dialects of the Cymric division of Celtic . The evidence of this proposition lies in the // statement of St. Jerome before cited ; in the similarity of the names of places in Belgic Gaul and in Britain ; and in the direct comparison of sundry ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing Cymric dialects , for which I must refer to the learned work of Brandes . Formerly , as at the present day , the Cymric dialects of Celtic were spoken by both the fair and the dark stocks . III . There is no record of Gaelic being spoken anywhere save in Ireland , Scotland , and the Isle of Man . This appears to be the final result of the long discussions which have taken place on this muchdebated question . As is the case with the Cymric dialects , Gaelic is now spoken by both dark and fair stocks . When the Teutonic languages first became known , they were spoken only * by Xanthochroi , that is to say , by the Germans , the Scandinavians , and Goths , And they were imported by Xanthochroi into Gaul and into Britain . In Gaul , the imported Teutonic dialect has been completely overpowered by the more or less modified Latin , which it found already in possession ; and what Teutonic blood there may be in modern Frenchmen is not adequately represented in their // language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialects have overpowered the pre-existing forms of speech , and the people are vastly less " Teutonic " than their language . Whatever may have been the extent to which the Celtic-speaking population of the eastern half of Britain was trodden out and supplanted by the Teutonic-speaking Saxons and Danes , it is quite certain that no considerable displacement of the Celtic-speaking people occurred in Cornwall , Wales , or the Highlands of Scotland ; and that nothing approaching to the extinction of that people took place in Devonshire , Somerset , or the western moiety of Britain generally . Nevertheless , the fundamentally Teutonic English language is now spoken throughout Britain , except by an insignificant fraction of the population in Wales and the Western Highlands . But it is obvious that this fact affords not the slightest justification for the common practice of speaking of the present inhabitants of Britain as an " AngloSaxon " race . It is , in fact , just as absurd as the habit of talking of the French people as a " Latin " race , because they speak a language which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdity becomes the more patent when those who have no hesitation in calling a Devonshire man , or a Cornish man , an " Anglo-Saxon , " would think it ridiculous to call a Tipperary man by the same title , though he and his forefathers may have spoken English for as long a time as the Cornish man . // Ireland , at the earliest period of which we have any knowledge , contained , like Britain , a dark and a fair stock , which , there is every reason to believe , were identical with the dark and the fair stocks of Britain . When the Irish first became known they spoke a Gaelic dialect , and though , for many centuries , Scandinavians made continual incursions upon , and settlements among them , the Teutonic languages made no more way among the Irish than they did among the French . How much Scandinavian blood was introduced there is no evidence to show . But after the conquest of Ireland by Henry 1I. , the English people , consisting in part of the descendants of Cymric speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made good their footing in the eastern half of the island , as the Saxons and Danes made good theirs in England ; and did their best to complete the parallel by attempting the extirpation of the Gaelic-speaking Irish . And they succeeded to a considerable extent ; a large part of Eastern Ireland is now peopled by men who are substantially English by descent , and the English language has spread over the land far beyond the limits of English blood . Ethnologically , the Irish people were originally , like the people of Britain , a mixture of Melanoehroi and Xanthochroi . They resembled the Britons in speaking a Celtic tongue ; but it was a Gaelic and not a Cymric form of the Celtic language . Ireland was untouched by the Roman conquest , nor // do the Saxons seers to have had any influence upon her destinies , but the Danes and Norsemen poured in a contingent of Teutonism , which has been largely supplemented by English and Scotch efforts . What , then , is the value of the ethnological difference between the Englislman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern half of Ireland ? For what reason does the one deserve the name of a " Celt , " and not the other ? And further , if we turn to the inhabitants of the western half of Ireland , why should the term " Celts " be applied to them more than to the inhabitants of Cornwall ? And if the name is applicable to the one as justly as to the other , why should not intelligence , perseverance , thrift , industry , sobriety , respect for law , be admitted to be Celtic virtues ? And why should we not seek for the cause of their absence in something else than the idle pretext of " Celtic blood " ? I have been unable to meet with any answers to these questions . V. The Celtic and the Teutonic dialects are members of the same great Aran fancily of languages ; but there is evidence to show that a nonAryan language was at one time spoken over a large extent of the area occupied by Melanochroi in Europe . The non-Aryan language here referred to is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which seems in earlier times to have been the Ian2 ( 0 BRITISH ETHNOLOGY. v guage of the Aquitanians and Spaniards , and may possibly have extended much further to the East . Whether it has any connection with the Ligurian and Oscan dialects are questions upon which , of course , I do not presume to offer any opinion . But it is important to remark that it is a language the area of which has gradually diminished without any corresponding extirpation of the people who primitively spoke it ; so that the people of Spain and of Aquitaine at the present day must be largely " Euskarian " by descent in just the same sense as the Cornish men are " Celtic " by descent . Such seem to me to be the main facts respecting the ethnology of the British islands and of Western Europe , which may be said to be fairly established . The hypothesis by which I think ( with Dc Belloguet and Thurnam ) the facts may best be explained is this . In very remote times Western Europe and the British islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone , and these Melanochroi spoke dialects allied to the Euskarian . The Xanthochroi , spreading over the great Eurasiatic plains westward , and speaking Aryan dialects , gradually invaded the territories of the Melanochroi . The Xanthochroi , who thus came into contact with the Western Melanochroi , spoke a Celtic language ; and that Celtic language , whether Cymric or Gaelic , spread over the Melanochroi far beyond the limits of intermixture of blood , supplanting Euskarian , just as English and French // have supplanted Celtic . Even as early as Csar 's time , I suppose that the Euskarian was everywhere , except in Spain and in Aquitaine , replaced by Celtic , and thus the Celtic speakers were no longer of one ethnological stock , but of two . Both in Western Europe and in England a third wave of language  --  in the one case Latin , in the other Teutonic  --  has spread over the same area . In Western Europe , it has left a fragment of the primary Euskarian in one corner of the country , and a fragment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only outlying pools of the secondary linguistic wave remain in Wales , the Highlands , Ireland , and the Isle of Man . If this hypothesis is a sound one , it follows that the name of Celtic is not properly applicable to the Melanochroic or dark stock of Europe . They are merely , so to speak , secondary Celts . The primary and aboriginal Celtic-speaking people are Xanthochroi  --  the typical Gauls of the ancient writers , and the close allies by blood , customs , and language , of the Germans . VI . THE ARYAN QUESTION AND PREHISTORIC MAN . 1890 . THE rapid increase of natural knowledge , which is the chief characteristic of our age , is effected in various ways . The main army of science moves to the conquest of new worlds slowly and surely , nor ever cedes an inch of the territory gained . But i I the advance is covered and facilitated by the ceaseless activity of clouds of light troops provided with a weapon  --  always eflicicnt , if not always an arm of precision  --  the scientific imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science to make raids into the realm of ignorance wherever they see , or think they see , a chance ; and cheerfully to accept defeat , or it may be annihilation , as the reward of error . Unfortunately , the public , which watches the progress of the campaign , too often mistakes a dashing incursion of the Uhlans for a forward movement of the main body ; fondly imagining that the strategic movement to the rear , which occasionally follows , indicates a battle lost 272 // by science . And it must be confessed that the error is too often justified by the effects of the irrepressible tendency which men of science share with all other sorts of men known to me , to be impatient of that most wholesome state of mind  --  suspended judgment ; to assume the objective truth of speculations which , from the nature of the evidence in their favour , can have no claim to be more than working hypotheses . The history of the " Aryan question " affords a striking illustration of these general remarks . About a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chief European languages with Sanskrit and its derivative dialects now spoken in India . Brilliant and laborious philologists , in long succession , enlarged and strengthened this position , until the truth that Sanskrit , Zend , Armenian , Greek , Latin , Lithuanian , Slavonian , German , Celtic , and so on , stand to one another in the relation of descendants from a common stock , became firmly established , and thenceforward formed part of the permanent acquisitions of science . Moreover , the term " Aryan " is very generally , if not universally , accepted as a name for the group of languages thus allied . Hence , when one speaks of " Aryan languages , " no hypothetical assumptions are involved . It is a matter of fact that such languages exist , that they present certain substantial and formal relations , and that convention sanctions the name applied to them . 182 // But the close connection of these widely differentiated languages remains altogether inexplicable , unless it is admitted that they are modifications of an original relatively undifferentiated tongue ; just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italian , Spanish , and the rest  --  would be incomprehensible if there were no Latin . The original or " primitive Aryan " tongue , thus postulated , unfortunately no longer exists . It is a hypothetical entity , which corresponds with the " primitive stock " of generic and higher groups among plants and animals ; and the acknowledgment of its former existence , and of the process of evolution which has brought about the present state of things philological , is forced upon us by deductive reasoning of similar cogency to that employed about things biological . Thus , the former existence of a body of relatively uniform dialects , which may be called primitive Aryan , may be added to the stock of definitely acquired truths . But it is obvious that , in the absence of writing or of phonographs , the existence of a language implies that of speakers . If there were primitive Aryan dialects , there must have been primitive Aryan people who used them ; and these people must have resided somewhere or other on the earth 's surface . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation within the limits of bare necessity , arrives , not only at the conceptions of Aryan // languages and of a primitive Aryan language ; but of a primitive Aryan people and of a primitive Aryan home , or country occupied by them . But where was this home of the Aryans ? When the labours of modern philologists began , Sanskrit was the most archaic of all the Aryan languages known to them . It appeared to present the qualifications required in the parental or primitive Aryan . Brilliant Uhlans made a charge at this opening . The scientific imagination seated the primitive Aryans in the valley of the Ganges ; and showed , as in a vision , the successive columns , guided by enterprising Brahmins , which set out thence to people the regions of the western world with Greeks and Celts and Germans . But the progress of philology itself sufficed to show that this Balaclava charge , however magnificent , was not profitable warfare . The internal evidence of the Vedas proved that their composers had not reached the Ganges . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the assumption that these languages were modifications of an original Indo-Iranian tongue , spoken by a people of whom the Aryans of India and those of Persia were offshoots , and who could therefore be hardly lodged elsewhere than on the frontiers of both Persia and India  --  that is to say , somewhere in the region which is at present known under the names of Turkestan , Afghanistan , and Kafiristan . Thus far , it can hardly be doubted // that we are well within the ground of which science has taken enduring possession . But the Uhlans were not content to remain within the lines of this surely-won position . For some reason , which is not quite clear to me , they thought fit to restrict the home of the primitive Aryans to a particular part of the region in question ; to lodge them amidst the bleak heights of the long range of the Hindoo Koosh and on the inhospitable plateau of Pamir . From their hives in these secluded valleys and wind-swept wastes , successive swarms of Celts and Greco-Latins , Teutons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanderings , in distant Europe . The Hindoo-Koosh-Pamir theory , once enunciated , gradually hardened into a sort of dogma ; and there have not been wanting theorists , who laid down the routes of the successive bands of emigrants with as much confidence as if they had access to the records of the office of a primitive Aryan Quartermaster-General . It is really singular to observe the deference which has been shown , and is yet sometimes shown , to a speculation which can , at best , claim to be regarded as nothing better than a somewhat risky working hypothesis . Forty years ago , the credit of the HindooKoosh-Pamir theory had risen almost to that of an axiom . The first person to instil doubt of its value into my mind was the late Robert Gordon Latham , a man of great learning and singular originality , whose attacks upon the Hindoo-Kooshite doctrine // could scarcely have failed as completely as they did , if his great powers had been bestowed upon making his books not only worthy of being read , but readable . The impression left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations about the " Sarmatian hypothesis , " which my friend wished to substitute for the Hindoo-Iioosh-Pamir speculation , was that the one and the other rested pretty much upon a like foundation of guess-work . That there was no sufficient reason for planting the primitive Aryans in the Hindoo Iioosh , or in Pamir , seemed plain enough ; but that there was little better ground , on the evidence then adduced , for settling them in the region at present occupied by Western Russia , or Podolia , appeared to me to be not less plain . The most I thought Latham proved was , that the Aryan people of Indo-Iranian speech were just as likely to have come from Europe , as the Aryan people of Greek , or Teutonic , or Celtic speech from Asia . Of late years , Latham 's views , so long neglected , or mentioned merely as an example of insular eccentricity , have been taken up and advocated with much ability in Germany as well as in this country  --  principally by philologists . Indeed , the glory of Hindoo-KiooshPamir seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Aryan philology owes so much , will not say more now , than that he holds by the conviction that the seat of the primitive Aryans was " somewhere in Asia . " Dr. Schrader // sums up in favour of European Russia ; while Herr Penka would have us transplant the home of the primitive Aryans from Pamir in the far east to the Scandinavian peninsula in the far west . I must refer those who desire to acquaint themselves with the philological arguments on which these conclusions are based to the recently published works of Dr. Schrader and Canon Taylor ; * and to Penka 's " Die Herkunft der Arier , " which , in spite of the strong spice of the Uhlan which runs through it , I have found extremely well worth study . I do not pretend to be able to look at the Aryan question under any but the biological aspect ; to which I now turn . Any biologist who studies the history of the Aryan question , and , taking the philological facts on trust , regards it exclusively from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early , the purely biological conception of " race " illegitimately mixed itself up with the ideas derived from pure philology . It is quite proper to speak of Aryan " people , " because , as we have seen , the existence of the language implies that of a people who speak it ; it might be equally permissible to call Latin people all those who speak Romance dialects . But , just as the application of the term * Schrader , Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples . Translated by F. P. Jevons , M.A. , 1890 . Taylor , The Origin of the Aryans , 1800. // Latin " race " to the divers people who speak Romance languages , at the present day , is none the less absurd because it is common ; so , it is quite possible , that it may be equally wrong to call the people who spoke the primitive Aryan dialects and inhabited the primitive home , the Aryan race . " Aryan " is properly a term of classification used in philology . " Race " is the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which are called " species " in the technical language of Zoology and Botany ; and the term connotes the possession of characters distinct from those of the other members of the species , which have a strong tendency to appear in the progeny of all members of the races . Such race-characters may be either bodily or mental , though in practice , the latter , as less easy of observation and definition , can rarely be taken into account . Language is rooted half in the bodily and half in the mental nature of man . The vocal sounds which form the raw materials of language could not be produced without a peculiar conformation of the organs of speech ; the enunciation of duly accented syllables would be impossible without the nicest co-ordination of the action of the muscles which move these organs ; and such eo-ordination depends on the mechanism of certain portions of the nervous system . It is therefore conceivable that the structure of this highly complex speaking apparatus should determine a man 's linguistic potentiality ; that is to say , should en280 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one class and not of another . It is further conceivable that a particular linguistic potentiality should be inherited and become as good a race mark as any other . As a matter of fact , it is not proven that the linguistic potentialities of all men are the same . It is affirmed , for example , that , in the United States , the enunciation and the timbre of the voice of an American-born negro , however thoroughly he may have learned English , can be readily distinguished from that of a white man . But , even admitting that differences may obtain among the various races of men , to this extent , I do not think that there is any good ground for the supposition that an infant of any race would be unable to learn , and to use with ease , the language of any other race of men among whom it might be brought up . History abundantly proves the transmission of languages from some races to others ; and there is no evidence , that I know of , to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its native tongue . From these considerations it follows that community of language is no proof of unity of race , is not even presumptive evidence of racial identity .
