txt " Mr. Sullivan , the Democratic candidate for senator , has had his whole career shaped by his part in the Ogden gas ordinance which practically the solid press of the city at the time denounced . " The passage of this ordinance was not an incident in the career of Mr. Sullivan . It was the foundation for his political and commercial career , and shortly after its passage he appeared as an officer of the corporation . " . " The foundation for Mr. Sherman 's whole political career was laid when in the legislature he was one of the most prominent supporters of the so-called Allen law . The Allen law was passed in the interest of Yerkes and Lorimer to confer upon city councils the right to grant fifty year franchises . " " In all the essentials of their actions Mr. Sherman and Mr. Sullivan stand together . The essence of a bi-partisan machine is that on certain questions hostile to the interests of the public the members of the two machines vote against the interests of the public , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one machine come to the help of the members of the other machine . ' , . ' " I may make my appeal in Illinois not merely to the Progressives , but to all honest Republicans and honest Democrats to repudiate both the Sullivan and Sherman machines . This they can only do by , electing to the United States senate as able and upright and genuine a popular representative as Illinois has ever sent to that body  --  namely , Raymond Robins .
