Has not the rush of the young through succeeding generations in this country toward the mechanical , the dexterous , already begun to tell in a constantly increasing narrowness , a shrinkage of intellectual and spiritual stature ? Has not that preoccupation with the immediate which once served a great idealistic purpose , become in time its own end , the only end at last ? Comfort , safety , in the minds of our pioneer ancestors , ministered to the service of God ; now , when we are too comfortable to be even happy , too pampered to be blest , we go on trying to be more and more comfortable . Is our boasted mechanical progress entirely a triumphant exhibition of the growth of humankind , or is it partly a case of arrested mental development ? In many ways , perhaps , it is pleasing and convenient not to have time to think ; but is it wise ? The typical American has come to seem to many people of other nationalities a handy man , ' quick with muscle , nimble in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality . A swift intelligence , with all the latest modern adjustments , is there ; but I have heard it hinted that there is more vibration of machinery than of ideas in our minds ; that a distant echo of piston and of whistle , insistent and shrill in our voices , symbolizes a certain mechanical quality in our innermost selves . Our critics are constant in generous praise of our great quality , generosity , norshall any gainsay it ; it is our one priceless spiritual possession . But it may be that they are right when they fail to agree with us in our childish self-congratulation that we are the best of all possible types of people in the best of all possible worlds . When they speak of our lack of inner resources and of deep reserve of thought and of feeling ; of a certain thinness of quality in the American temperament ; of lack of personality , of permanence of quality , of enduring conviction ? can we wholly deny the charges ? Much of the fiction written by us and about us confirms them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we see ourselves . Our interest in the world of things rather than in the world of ideas is already resulting in too many naive and shallow types of character , uncurious save in regard to the material secrets of the world . We are suffering not only from waning faith in invisible realities , but from the externality of our training ; from the preponderance , in our schools and colleges , of scientific and mathematical discipline ; from the steadily decreasing devotion to the humanities . Is it the multiplication of ' observation ' studies that makes the young continually less interested in the profounder phases of existence , more and more unaware of the problems of the inner life ? To court too rigidly training concerned chiefly with the world of matter is to court a lasting childishness of mind ; greatly useful in its place , this discipline should keep its place , and not encroach , as it does in our country , upon provinces not its own . Lessened maturity of mind and of spirit must of necessity result from lessened contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to study men in their mental , spiritual , national development . Why require in college of all students work in science , unless history , literature , and philosophy are also required ? Is knowledge of chemical actions and reactions supremely necessary , while spiritual reactions , study of complex human relationships , of profound philosophic thought , piercing the veil of matter at least toward , if not to , reality , are left to chance , to students ' whims in the lottery of elective work ? I would make a plea against the one-sidedness of our present endeavor , leaning over to the external world ; I would make a plea fora deeper culture ; for more widespread study of the humanities ; for more determined use , in our colleges and our schools , of the idealist 's opportunity in a world drunk with a sense of physical fact . A plea for the study of history ; for the pure intellectual discipline of philosophy ; and , because of our special need , for literature as a necessary discipline in all school work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily decreasing ; alas for the dimming of the torch that has guided our way ! Since ancient literature , with its superb power of shaping young civilization , has been largely driven out , ? with what incalculable loss ! ? let us study and teach our own , still permitted and , in places , even encouraged ; let us have our English literature taught in the wisest and profoundest way ascertainable , wherever anything is taught . It is greatly needed for knowledge of human nature , insight into its complexities , for practical purposes as well as for intellectual enlightenment ; there is , after all , nothing sounpractical as the purely practical man . It is needed to make good the lack in modern training with its emphasis on externals , and the loss that comes from lessened intimacy on the part of people in general with the best in literature ; it is needed that the young may win acquaintance with human insight at its best ; needed to strengthen the hold on the ideal , on that beauty , visible and invisible , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II For many years , as I have felt increasingly a sense of this need , I have , from time to time , heard the statement made that literature is a subject that can not be taught ; that , while it may hold its own as a source of individual pleasure , it has no real place in an educational system ; and that , when it attempts to hold such a place , it serves only to divert the minds of the young from legitimate subjects of study . These protests have been made by very different people for widely differing reasons . A mathematician informs me that the study of literature can give no proper mental discipline , as it is not an intej.lectual exercise , and fails in inculcating exactness in use of facts . A humanist , specialist in history , once thoughtfully remarked that it was impossible to see where genuine work could come in in connection with this subject , as it was just a case of recording impressions , telling whether you liked a thing or not ; the implication being that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing one 's Christmas shopping . This conceiving of literature as one of the mere decorations of life is shared by other critics : scientists have told me that it offers no opportunity for obtaining real knowledge , as it is not based upon observation , through the senses , of the world of fact . A wholly different kind of objection comes now and then from poet or essayist , who maintains that insight into literature is a case of the divine fire ; either you have it or you have n't it in you ; it can not be communicated . For many years I have heard it said that literature can not be taught , and for many years I have known that the young of the college world , in some of the places where this study is still permitted , troop into English literature classes , overrunning the elective courses , clamoring for work in literature , for more and more . If literature can not be taught , the young have not found it out . The frequent gibe that this is because literature work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproved ; first , by the fact that the best students , the most indefatigable workers , flock to it ; and second , by the fact that , in classes where the standard is held high , students work with a passionate enthusiasm , an intensity , an ungrudging devotion , which certainly is not surpassed in any other subject , and is perhaps rarely equaled . Mathematician , scientist , historian may shake their heads , regarding this as evidence of mental aberration on the part of the young ; but the young do not heed the shaking . Some inner intellectual and spiritual necessity impels them ; they feel , if they can not formulate , that which is necessary for their growth ; they are full of a hunger and thirst which nothing else , it would seem , will satisfy . There is practical evidence enough to show that literature can be taught with resulting gain . So vigorous and so prolonged a demand on the part of the young must represent a vital necessity ; and their testimony is better than any other as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that their study of literature helped them more than any other part of their edu cational preparation , in the wear and tear of life , stayed by them best and longest . Sham attainment does not endure in this way . He is indeed a bold person who would assert a priori what are the limits of that which can be taught ; supply should bear some relation . to demand in the immaterial as in the material world , and the demand , where good work gains a foothold , is great . The reason why this should exist is self-evident , as is the reason why we should meet it with utmost effort . If literature be that writing to which depth and sincerity of thought and feeling and beauty of form have given permanence , securing for us an inner revelation of human experience at different moments of race-experience , it seems natural that the young should delve with passionate eagerness into the profoundest records of the life of the race ; that they should welcome any guidance which makes them more sure of its great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its problems . The shock of surprise wherewith they face the new worlds opened to them by study of literature , the joy of intellectual discovery , bear witness to the potency of the work . Traditionless , some of them , having suf. , suffered from lack of books at home , and from the crowding out in the schools of that humanistic training which has been so large a factor in whatever civilization we possess , they find in the study of literature something fresh , full of challenge , making them aware of wider horizons than they had dreamed of before . I am convinced , from long study of the problem , long observation , that literature , as an academic discipline , supplies elements which can be found in nothing else ; that it not only can he taught , but , under the conditions obtaining in our modern world , must be taught , in the interests of our higher civilization ; taught with profound purpose , for its incomparable service in the matter of method , and in the matter of substance . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , and fails in the matter of mental discipline , we answer that precisely this kind of study is needed to supplement the training given by mathematics . We recognize mathematics as a necessity ; for certain uses its training is invaluable ; yet its narrow track is inadequate for the larger uses of life . Exact and indispensable in helping make the world of matter serve our need , it is useless in that greater world of the inner life not dominated by laws of matter . Working along the lines of logic to determined ends , it takes no count of the shifting stuff of life with its uncertainties ; and its training rather unfits than fits the mind for the relative judgments , the delicate adjustments that it must make to the human dilemma . There are no axioms or for-make that can help in a great spiritual crisis , nor can mathematical methods of thought then guide mind and soul . The abstract certainties of mathematics bet ray us in lives which have a way of not following strict laws of algebraic or geometrical demonstration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh , compare , sift ; to make wise judgments even where some factors are uncertain ; to estimate probabilities . To face any difficult human situation , expecting life to run in the smooth grooves which one 's training in mathematical thought would lead one to believe , is to invite madness . In life , if not in mathematics , two plus two may make anything from twenty-five to chaos ; one plus one may make infinity in a reckoning truer than mathematics knows . Many-sided , and demanding varied equipment is our dilemma ; rigidly mathematical training is wholly inadequate to prepare the young human being for the issues of life . Mathematics may teach us how to build bridges , but not to build lives ; to compute the stars , but not to compute the action of the human soul in a world of shifting circumstance . Versus the unfailingly accurate results of true mathematical thinking are complicating elements that require our entire intellectual and spiritual self-possession : in the former , an error invalidates the whole ; in life , an error may mean finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with uncertainty , our intellectual training should prepare us by constant work involving judgment . In work in literature , as in work in history , a mass of material confronts us ? it may be confused and confusing records . It is necessary to sift and choose , and , by means of finer logic , work out an interpretative idea , representing one 's best decision in regard to the puzzling matter . Not here is the easier task of putting down in figures the indisputable result of uncontested fact ; here is the necessity of discriminating , of finding relative values , as constantly in the recurring dilemmas of life . This selection matures the judgment and strengthens the intellectual fibre , as by an act of creation . Such training is indispensable for method , because it deals with the complexity of life in its welter of warring motives and conflicting claims ; because it requires constructive thinking , based upon all the data attainable ; and the student is compelled to summon all his faculties and think , to give full account of the intellectual power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaped in the light of an informing conception , comes , in a sense , nearer than can anything else to the quick of human need in the kind of thought necessary for its interpretation . It is Coleridge who speaks of poetry as having ' a logic of its own , as severe as that of science , and more difficult , because more subtle , more complex and dependent on more fugitive causes . ' It is this logic , the logic of art , rather than the barren logic of the formula , that will help in facing perplexities ; the logic that , dealing with the complex , searches out the ways of law , of harmony in the tangle of things , that selective power in which the will is ever involved . Perpetual choice is demanded by the artist in creating , a sense of fitness in view of the whole design ; for student and critic , what better intellectual discipline can he devised than that involved in tracing the delicate mental adjustments , whereby each word and phrase is made to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not escape the fine interrelations of existence , and this subtler logic of art is supremely needed in human life to create perfectness and integrity from the multiform , varying elements . To the charge that the study of literature is not an intellectual discipline we can answer further that the great masterpieces of literature bring us face to face , no less than do the greatest philosophical theories , with the profoundest questions of human destiny . The problems presented alike by philosophy and by tragedy , concerning human fate , human responsibility , challenge the intellect as far as it can go , and further . They reckon ill who leave these out of any system of training of the young . If the charge be that study of literature is not a purely intellectual discipline , herein lies its peculiar glory , and the peculiar opportunity that comes through it . It is the attempt to make the word educational synonymous with intellectual , and the word intellect synonymous with reason , that has been the crowning academic curse of our country and ofour time . Conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-mastery of intellectual disciplines , which , busy primarily with the problems of the external world , do not even challenge the deepest in mere intellect . The peculiar service of great literature lies in the fact that it is greatly intellectual , and that it is something more , bringing home to the individual the profoundest problems of human destiny with that mastery of resources known only to great art . Those who , busy with the positive sciences , charge that study of literature brings you into a world of imaginings , and does not stand for truth of observed fact ; those who , like my friend the historian , regard the teaching of literature as mere idle utterance of preferences , a substanceless and bodiless something that has little to do with recorded fact , should really inform themselves of the many-sided study of fact necessary for the interpretation of a piece of literature in any period . Presented with the problem of interpreting master and masterpiece against the background of the age which produced them , you must delve deep into the time if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accurate knowledge of the historical setting is necessary ; of great political events ; of great events in the world of thought , the expression of philosophy at the moment . A great poem or prose masterpiece becomes a focus , a centre , where many lines converge ; patient investigation , following the many lines , is the insistent duty of the student . The self-expression of a human soul is to be read and understood in the light of all obtainable information regarding the author 's life , the influences that formed mind and character ; and regarding the history of the literature of the country , that his place in it may be found . What knowledge of classic literature is necessary , in order to follow the development of great types ! How much must be done with masterpieces of other countries of all times , that one may reach an understanding of literary forms and one man 's use of them ! How much with questions of linguistic growth and change ? that knowledge of words and of inflections , of the changing significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ! Modern linguistic work gives an opportunity for close discipline as exigent in its demand for accuracy of fact as the mathematical training of the present day , or that of Greek and Latin in earlier days ; moreover , it depends less than did the latter on mere memory , and more upon observation of the laws of development , more on the ways of reasoning from phenomenon to phenomenon , combining the exactness in detail of older-fashioned study of the classics ? that drill that has played a major part in fashioning mind and character of many generations ? with evolutionary method , knowledge of the laws of growth , that power to trace continuity in fact which is the crowning achievement of the scholarship of our time . Fact ? and herein lies the worth of this as of other humanistic studies , that through it all , beyond it all comes the deeper challenge , the need to employ fact for further ends , for intellectual or spiritual interpretation . The task of delving into fact to find its deepest significance challenges the deepest that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this day of impassioned clinging to external things , of love of fact for fact 's sake ; of observation and experiment studies where , often , not enough data can be gathered for any real intellectual conclusion , there is need of such study of fact , not as a resting-place for the mind , but as an aid to larger understanding . Training in history in order to understand the web of circumstance that forms a background for a great work of literature ; training in language in order to get the full import of word and phrase ; training in philosophy in order to accustom the mind to the gravest problems of thought ; then , the attempt to interpret the master 's embodiment in art of his reading of the riddle of existence who can deny the profundity of the challenge of this discipline ? Who can deny its validity as intellectual training in its study of mere fact , or its supreme importance as the only lasting record of the greater facts of the inner life ? Who can say , remembering that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? from the Anglo-Saxon tcecean , to show , ? that the maturer mind may not help the younger to understand the deep records of human experience , suggesting wise ways of bringing philosophy , bringing history to bear upon it , illuminating by literary comparisons and contrasts , bringing , it may be , a wealth of information and a gift of interpretative power that will intensify ten-fold its meaning for the struggling student ? For the true teacher of literature the task is to serve as stimulus , to quicken , to make the student aware of great things to be done , to point out the veins where he may dig ; to help a bit with the hard things , constantly spurring him on , but to let him do his own digging so far as niay be . III If the objectors betray ignorance of the importance of the subject-matter involved , they betray ignorance also of the methods and the ideals manifest in this work at its best . The world in general , even the world of scholars working along other lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of it ; the difficulty of its discipline as carried on even in properly conducted classrooms in American colleges ; the possible profundity of its presentation , and the indispensable nature of such work , from the point of view of method , from the point of view of substance , if the young are to reach their full stature . The exact knowledge demanded as an aid to understanding ; the energy of intellectual endeavor that must go into the interpretation of the underlying idea of any great work of literature , make it a searching test , not only of a man 's knowledge , and of his power of ever gaining fresh knowledge , but of his power in pure thought , his imaginative insight , of all that he is capable of doing with utmost effort of mind and of soul . That which is the ideal of the instructor must necessarily be impressed upon the student ; what he has done and done wisely he must male 3 his pupils do . Slighter , simpler though the student 's task must be , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his subject , of the manifold effort required to meet its demands . Many an American youth , who considers the pursuit of letters unmanly , effeminate , would prove , grown soft and pampered in his machine-eased life , utterly incapable of straining to the great endeavor of the work done with the strenuousness of intellectual purpose that should go into it . What can be done to make him aware of the profound challenge of the work , and his great need of it ? It is precisely in one aspect of the scientist 's formulation of the case against literature in our educational system that the deepest validity of its claim lies ; that the great need is suggested of a large and larger part for literature in our lives ; a large and larger part in our academic work . It does not , we are told , deal with observed fact ; it has elements upon which you can not put thumb and finger ; its significance can not be detected by eye or ear , and it therefore has no solid foundation in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming reason for encouraging the young in the pursuit of this study , which recognizes the inner values of life , as well as the outer ; which resists that shrinkage to the world of the five senses ' demanded by modern intellectual process ; which is aware of a larger world , with wider horizons , than contemporary knowledge will admit ; a deeper life than mere intellectualism can fathom . If there be any witness to the fact that we are greater than the sight of our eyes and the hearing of our ears , and speculation based upon the material they offer us ; that there is something within us which can not he satisfied with training limited to this observation , literature is surely the lasting record of that larger self . That deeper something demands recognition : it meets expression in literature ; why should not literature be made to serve in a practical way the greater ends of life ? Has not Puck been much abroad in our world of late , some cosmic Puck , turning our universe upside down , reversing values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many of the gravest educators , that that discipline is hardest , severest , and best for mind-forming , which is busy only with things in space ; and that that which presents the profoundest achievement of the race , the inner life , recorded in spiritual and intellectual conceptions subtly blended in forms of beauty , is supposed to be an easy something whose study is undertaken only by the smatterer and the dileztante . The records of the life of the soul count for so little among us ; the records of all physical and material matters count for so much ! Surely anything that will keep the young from conceiving that the boundaries of sense are final boundaries , that the world of matter is the world of reality , should ever be kept before them ; should be devoutly and reverently studied . Education should deepen , not lessen . the sense of the encompassing mystery of life ; the teachers who can explain too much explain nothing . We know little of the ' why ' of our predicament ; let those studies that deepen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due place . We protest against the misleading certainties of mathematics and the illusory boundary line of organic science as circumscribing the intellectual life , not pleading to have these studies neglected , but pleading against the supremacy they have gained , and the spiritual loss resulting from this supremacy . Whatever may be the ultimate truth , we are greater than our modern training would have us know ; yet we must not lose the deeper curiosity , or forego the higher questioning . Save crucial experience , there is nothing that keeps before us this sense of vastness as does great literature , with its recognition of the unfathomable depths of the inner life . Supreme moments in the production of literature are always full of a sense of unexplained mystery ; infinity with wide wings broods over it . In Greek drama , in Shakespeare and in the literature of the Renaissance , in our own early nine-teem h-century poetry , there is a profound sense of wonder at the illimitable greatness of life , known and not known , dimly divined . To deepen the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waken in the young a need of spiritual quest ? what ran help more than close contact with records of spiritual achievement , the insight of great souls ? Life , to be great , must , be forever quick with a sense of infinite opportunity . IV In the name of our birthright to wider and profounder life , we protest against the narrowness , externality , lack of vision , lack of freedom of much of our educational life of to-day . The very nature of the objection ; ; brought against the study of literature is a reason why it should be taught ? constantly , assiduously taught . Each objection shows the narrowing or hardening of the mind to a single track , that tendency of education that has been all but fatal to so many of the educators and the educated . Whatever education does , it should leave open all avenues out into intellectual light and space , and should discover new ones . And this study ? appealing to the intellect , both reason and imagination ; appealing to that which is deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the means to keep the human mind aquiver and astir , sensitive to new meanings , quick to grasp , strong to retain , large and larger significances of this our problem of existence- . It is perhaps the only study which , presenting human experience in its wholeness , calls upon the human being in his entirety , the many-sided creature of many instincts and many impulses who nevertheless draws himself together and says ' I. ' To the solving of his problems in literature , as in the large complexity of life , he must bring his every power ; as it gives scope , freedom , to feeling , imaginative instinct , intellectual aspiration , so it demands their service in the matter of interpretation . We live in our emotions , as well as in intellect ; in imagination , in soul , as well as in mind ; feeling , the motive power , and perhaps the greater part of life , may be the impelling force to new spiritual and intellectual attainment . Study of literature keeps us aware of the larger resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , when it becomes overwhelmingly evident that the paramount factors in civilization are those which develop human feeling and guide it aright ; now , when force cruelly triumphs , it behooves us to make use of all resources that will keep feeling quick and sensitive . Losing its guidance in human affairs we lose our way ; has recent history justified the sneer wherewith efficiency ' has banished sentiment ? Inasmuch as in all life there is nothing so misleading as mere intellect , unchecked by feeling , by sense of necessary adjustments , by old instincts , growing fine and sensitively aware of larger need ? the deeper powers should be allowed their rightful share in education and in shaping existence . There are innumerable ways in which study of literature can minister to the greater self , of passionate aspiration , divine imaginings , and hopes that will not tarry at the sense-boundaries of things . The young must be made to feel its answer to the greater needs of life , its ministry to the inner self , to the finer hopes , the profounder faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may answer these diviner instincts when they first waken ; that they may know from what great source to draw in their spiritual hunger . Human emotion is forever pressing on to larger life , to greater destiny ; and the guide in all this further quest is that divinest faculty of the human mind , imagination , which , in its penetrative power , is in the forefront of all efforts to solve the mystery of existence . Confessedly or not , it works in science , in philosophy , in thegreat conjectures that may or may not later find reasoned proof ; it is in all arts the guiding factor , piercing to inner meanings , and shaping in accordance with the divination . This gift , supremely necessary in apprehending the beauty of the uni. verse , in searching out the finer law , and supremely necessary in fashioning forms of loveliness , finds , perhaps , its profoundest expression in great literature . Here we find the fullest records of the deepest insight of most gifted human souls , and the fullest record of that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working out the great meaning . Because the study of literature fosters , as perhaps no other study can , this faculty , discovers , develops , guides it , it is a supremely important part of education . The young should be taught the mastery , among the human faculties , of this power which marshals the great insights ; taught , through Wordsworth , Coleridge , Ruskin , that it is the profoundest attribute of the human mind ? not fancy , sporting with unrealities , but divining imagination , piercing to the very heart of things ; taught not to confuse imaginative , as is often done in common parlance , with imaginary , in slighting , contemptuous reference to it as a more or less misleading mental faculty , as if it were a power leading away from reality , instead of to the soul of it . Why should this faculty , working behind all great discoveries in the outer world , be discredited to-day only in searching out the meanings of the inner life , the profoundest working of all ? We have need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of being , after our forty years and more than forty years of wandering in that arid wilderness ? the contemplation of facts of the external world . You can not teach the divining power : that is admitted ; but you can teach the young that this divining power of great genius is superior to reason ; that , in all departments of intellectual endeavor , reason is its helpmate , its tool , which may serve , but may not master , this creative gift . You can bring the voting into contact with greatly imaginative work ; in this age of alleged enlightenment , many have never heard of it ! Often you can make them see deeper meanings which would otherwise have escaped them . You can help them recognize the fact that genius may and does perceive great meanings M life that lesser folk could not find without them ; that it is good , at times , to forget our entire preoccupation with the minor , and seek the company of the great thinkers , the diviners of the best , whose vision sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely as our knowledge of cosmic law contradicts the apparent rising and setting of the sun . Let as teach the young to trust the great insights , the great dreamers who have dreamed the great dream . It is by this power of divining inner significances through the penetrative imagination , of being able to clothe these in terms of concrete beauty , that the poet becomes the great interpreter , as Sidney , Shelley , Arnold claim ? stimulating feeling to great ends , expressing his insight into the divine in a way that mere human beings can understand more potently than they can understand the purely intellectual appeal . Eyes have we , and ears ; sense ' may help soul , ' and beauty comes home to the whole human being in a on that no abstract plea can command , as profound thought and passion , guided by imaginative vision , become visible and tangible in creative work . The poet is the great teacher , making the senses serve him , letting eye and ear become avenues through which great interpretations may reach the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may reach in many ways the mere mortal , caged in sense . You may analyze virtue to the last subtle shade : you will bring something to the intellectual perception of your reader , but you will not quicken his pulse , or waken his ardor , or rouse in him that creative will which is the very secret of life itself , as you will if you show him supremely well one human being in heroic moments of victory or defeat . Let him see and hear and share , and he will know as he could never know from mere telling . Herein lies the danger of the present predominance of the analytical over the synthetic in contemporary education . What further loss , what slipping backward will ensue , if this creative faculty of the imagination is further obscured by our contemporary habit of pulling apart ! In that creative art , human life , mere analytic processes of intellect will not suffice ; life is constant synthesis , whether we will or no , and constant combining , acting , creating are necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deeper values , all crumbles ; great epochs are always a time of seeing large relations , of synthesis , of faith , and action in the light of that faith . We must have constructive idealism ; we must conceive life as a whole and work at it as a whole ; and for this must have ever before us that which guides in creating fineness of thought and feeling , and incites thereto . Surely the best literature , soul-experience in terms of beauty , stirring emotion , guiding feeling to lovely issues ? no care can be too great to keep and cultivate and greatly share its high import . Our great literature is , at least , a partial answer to that cry for beauty and for harmony , which sounds , however feebly , in every human soul ? that assurance of law toward which all human lives grope , however blindly . More than any other art , it reveals the ways of beauty in connection with those questions that are the profoundest and the most searching , the impulses that arise from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as profoundly , or in such awful beauty , as does great tragedy , the clash between will and circumstance , the central fact of human existence , that we are partly bound , partly free , and that herein lies the point of our being here ? No mere exposition can ever present this as can this supreme art , or so bring it home to the quivering heart and soul of youth . Tracing cause and effect , following the inevitable consequences of act and choice , you watch the working of the laws of life as presented in a great artist 's conception . In Macbeth , in King Lear one can trace , as one can trace in a Gothic cathedral , the power and the delicacy , the unity of design in boundless variety . Demonstration could never achieve for us this awful nearness to human fate gained through thus partaking , step by step , of another 's experience . Again , close contact with varied expressions of emotion that have found permanent place in literature because of depth of feeling and beauty of form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? can hardly help effecting a civilizing power , a training power , a delicately suggestive potency in the matter of finer self-possession . Perfect integrity of form is in itself a matter of control ; and ethical as well as aesthetic gain comes from sharing human impetuosity , patiently seeking out the ways of loveliness , searching and finding law , so that it seems not spasmodic , tangential , but gladly obedient to great laws ordering and controlling the universe . Great lyric poetry , in its passionate restraint , is a measure of growth both in depth of feeling and in its mastery , marking the upward progress from unrestrainedsavage wail toward the mighty rhythm of all things obedient to eternal law . Association with this controlled beauty achieves something of the result of association with people of exquisite personality ? that creative contact with higher things that can in no way come from mere intellectual percep. tion . This discipline of letters , now more and more discredited as a part of education ; the impress , the touch , the shaping power of that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it would seem that no tongue would need to plead for this , our self-evident necessity ? the profound need of all that has been wrought in beauty and in fineness to be brought to bear , in as many ways as possible , as cogently as possible , upon the young at the most susceptible age , the age when gracious ideals will most readily impress themselves . We need constantly before us , not only for our delight but for our inspiration , touchstones of thought and of feeling . The training-power in the matter of taste found in literature of achieved beauty is a necessary discipline . We need beauty , in the great sense of the word ; divining loveliness of thought , shaping loveliness of form . The discipline of beauty ? there is none more severe , none more high , for the ways of beauty lead from visible to invisible beauty ? from Spenser 's Earthly Beauty , joyously hymned , to Heavenly Beauty , hymned with finer joy , where the clashing of harsh notes ceases in harmony . We need beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate perception of values ; beauty that makes available the depths of human nature , turns to fine uses feeling , emotion , powers wherein may lurk danger . No fineness of judgment , no phases of control once won must he allowed to escape us ; we must keep the ground gained , and build upon the foundation of our forbears . Herein lies an answer to those who decry the folly of searching the literature of older days ; who say that an age is sufficient unto itself ; that consideration of the past insults the present . To those who look upon the old as something outworn and put away , we can but say that , in the world of spirit , the relation to us of the past is not that of discarded garments , but of feeding roots . Those who cry without ceasing for the modern should remember that the very discovery of the evolutionary method of study involves us in greater , not less , responsibility in regard to the past than has ever rested upon the shoulders of men before , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how past and present are linked in an unbroken chain . Surely they are wisest who break faith neither with past nor with future ; no generation really wants to be the weak place in the chain . This is not a plea that we linger helplessly in the old , but a plea to make it serve our need more fully than we are doing , yield up its potency , its beauty , that nothing be lost . We do not undervalue the creative work of the present ; the worth of any expressed spiritual insight or inner experience can not be gainsaid . That which comes directly , in word or written phrase , from those who walk the earth with us is a stimulus and a source of refreshment ; but we must not think that , for the young , all too prone to turn only to the new , chance contact with this or that bit of contemporary literature will suffice . They must not miss the training of that earlier literature whose entirety and beauty of conception and form have given it enduring worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beauty of form , in that literature which survives the ages ; and because of thiswise balance , it has incomparable value in training young minds . Here we do not find a yearning to startle and be startled ; we find instead that great note of common understanding which distinguishes all supreme art . The simplicity , the fundamental humanness of all things great we need to keep ever before us ; among the quips and cranks , the literary and critical antics of our time , we need to turn to the great literature of old , to keep fresh the sense of achieved beauty , reminding ourselves of , and teaching the young , the great things that have been said , and the great way in which they have been said . Study of the older literature will quicken the imaginative instinct , will quicken and train feeling , and suggest high standards of beauty . Because , in earlier literature , life is conceived as essentially spiritual , not physical alone ; because there the imagination works with a wholeness of conception which is lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , if the future is to fulfill the promise of the past . The great poets have not become part of the race-experience as they should . Ignored , forgotten , save by the chosen few , they do not , to our immeasurable loss , enter into the daily life of common folk . We are so proud of our wheels that go fast ; of our unparalleled housekeeping arrangements ; so unabashed , amid the splendors of asphalt , electricity , and aluminum , by our intellectual and spiritual poverty ; would it not be well for us to pause , if pause is possible for us , to consider our inner lack ? Can we not spare some minutes from our adoration of our national materialistic god , to teach the young that it is good to be in the company of those who interpret life in terms of spirit , not in terms of material prosperity ; in terms of spirit , not of flesh ; in terms of beauty , whose potent appeal may quicken the will to rise and create in the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual and aesthetic gain that we need the discipline of letters , but also for spiritual training . We have need of vision that pierces further than our own , and the young should be given the chance to know , at the outset of life , that which may prove the path to higher existence . The work of the great poets represents glimpses of heights unseen by others , of wider horizons than their contemporaries knew , or we know . Literature records the high points that have been reached in the development of the human soul ; spiritual attainment ; moments of finer knowledge , subtler assurance , in the inner life of the race ; insight into the depth of our dilemma , and into the forces that make for solution of our problem . These high-water marks of experience must not be forgotten or neglected as they are , for the most part now , by the majority of people . We must cherish the record of every deeper wakening of love , of pity ; we must let the young know the promise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the soul seems to have but an endangered chance . Our older literature must be taught , lest we lose our sense of spiritual values ; ' lest we forget ' the best that our forefathers have worked out in the hard struggle of the inner life . The great poets are the guardians of our race-ideals ; how can we cherish them too reverently ? Enduring litera , ture gives us a record of achieved standards , spiritual and ethical , upon which we may not go back ; we have need of the greatest and best that our finest souls have achieved , nor may the furthest reach of the human soul be ignored ? save to our undoing . Other arts can give us beauty ; what other can preserve for us the hard-won achievement of the soul of man ? All that there has been of higher vision , of poet , prophet , seer , has come down to us , if it has come at all , in the form of literature . Mere literature ! What else has afforded one tenth , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind out of the bog ? It has kept alive , through dark ages , the divine spark , and has rekindled life again to vital flame . From immemorial time it has been the live coal upon the human hearth , whose going out would mean extinction for the finest and divinest instincts of the soul . Can we afford to neglect that which has , in the household fashion of old time , been carried from hearth to hearth , enkindling new flame ? Our dark rickl'e grows more light as we more and more associate with those who have light upon their foreheads . We should make known and honor , in the service of the young , the moments of profoundest insight of the greatest souls ; nor dare we let slip intellectual and spiritual experience once gained . If literature be indeed the divine fire , can any one suggest a greater service that can be done the young than helping them find the divine fire ?                    @
