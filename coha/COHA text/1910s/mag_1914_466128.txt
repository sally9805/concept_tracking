THERE is one phase of the much- discussed question of the nature and origin of life which , so far as I know , has not been considered either by those who hold a brief for the physico-chemical view or by those who stand for some form of vitalism . I refer to the small part that life plays in the total scheme of things . The great cosmic machine would go on just as well without it . Its relation to the whole appears to be little different from that of a man to the train in which he journeys . Life rides on the mechanical and chemical forces , but it does not seem to be a part of them , nor identical with them , because they were before it , and will continue after it is gone . The everlasting , all-inclusive thing in this universe seems to he inert matter with the energy it holds ; while the slight , flitting , casual thing seems to be living matter . The inorganic is from all eternity to all eternity ; it is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organic is , in comparison , only of the here and the now ; it was not here yesterday , and it may not be here to-morrow ; it comes and goes . Life is like a bird of passage which alights and tarries for a time and is gone , and the places where it perched and nested and led forth its brood know it no more . Apparently it flits from world to world as the great cosmic spring comes to each , and departs as the cosmic winter returns to each . It is a visitor , a migrant , a frail , timid thing , which waits upon the seasons and flees from the cosmic tempests and vicissitudes . How casual , uncertain , and inconsequential the vital order seems in our own solar system ? a mere incident or byproduct in its cosmic evolution ! Astronomy sounds the depths of space , andsees only mechanical and chemical forces at work there . It is almost certain that only a small fraction of the planetary surfaces is the abode of life . On the earth alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the vital order in full career . It may yet linger upon Mars , but it is evidently waning . On the inferior planets it probably had its day long ago , while it must be millions of years before it comes to the superior planets , if it ever comes to them . What a vast , inconceivable outlay of time and energy for such small returns ! Evi- dently the vital order is : nly an episode , a transient or a secondary phase of matter in the process of cosmic evolution . Sidereal space is strewn with dead worlds , as a New England field is with drift boulders . That life has touched and tarried here upon them can hardly i be doubted , but if it is anything more than a passing incident , an infant crying in the night , a flush of color upon the cheek , a flower blooming by ithe way-side , appearances are against it . We read our astronomy and geology in the light of our enormous egotism , and appropriate all to ourselves ; but science sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foam and bubbles that whirl and dance for a moment upon the river 's current . The bubbles have their reason for being ; all the mysteries of molecular attraction and repulsion may be involved in their production ; without the solar energy , and the revolution of the earth upon its axis , they would not appear ; and yet they are only bubbles upon the river 's current , as we are bubbles upon the stream of energy that flows through the universe . Apparently the cosmic game is played for us no more than for the parasites that infest our bodies , or for the frost ferns that form upon our window-panes in winter . The making of suns and systems goes on in the depths of space , and doubtless will go on to all eternity , without any more reference to the viral order than to the chemical compounds . The amount of living matter in the universe so far as we can penetrate it , compared with the non-living , is , in amount , like a flurry of snow that whitens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of rock and soil beneath it ; and with reference to geologic time it is about as fleeting . In the vast welter of suns and systems in the heavens above us , we see only dead matter , and most of it is in a condition of glowing metallic vapor . There are doubtless living organisms upon some of the invisible planetary bodies , but it is probably as fugitive and temporary as upon our own world . Much of the surface of the earth is clothed in a light vestment of life , which , hack in geologic time , seems to have more completely enveloped it than at present , as both the arctic and the antarctic regions bear evidence in their coal-beds and other fossils of luxuriant vegetable growths . Strip the earth of its thin pellicle of soil , thinner with reference to the mass than is the peel to the apple , and you have stripped it of its life . Or , rob it of its watery vapor and carbon dioxide in the air , both stages in the evolution , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space only as a mass of insensate rock . So limited and evanescent is the world of living matter , so vast and enduring is the world of the non-living . Looked at in this way , in the light of physical science , life , I repeat , seems like a mere passing phase of the cosmic evolution , a flitting and temporary stage of matter which it passes through in the procession of changes on the surface of a cooling planet . Between the fiery mist of the nebula and the frigid and consolidated globe there is a brief span , ranging over about one hundred and twenty degrees of temperature , where life appears and organic evolution takes place . Compared with the whole scale of temperature , from absolute zero to the white heat of the hottest stars , it is about a hand's-breadth compared to a mile . Life processes cease , but chemical and mechanical processes go on for ever . Life is as fugitive and uncertain as the bowin the clouds , and , like the bow in the clouds , is confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also it is a perpetual creation , a constant becoming , and its source is not in the matter through which it is manifested , though inseparable from it . The material substance of life , like the rain-drops , is in perpetual flux and change ; it hangs always on the verge of dissolution and vanishes when the material conditions fail , to be renewed again when they return . We know ? do we not ? ? that life is as literally dependent upon the sun as is the rainbow , and equally dependent upon the material elements ; but whether the physical conditions sum up the whole truth about it , as they do with the bow , is the insoluble question . Science says Yes , but our philosophy and our religion say No . The poets and the prophets say No , and our hopes and aspirations say No . Where , then , shall we look for the key to this mysterious thing we call life ? Modern biochemistry will not listen to the old notion of a vital force ? that is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves us floundering in the quagmire . If I question the forces about me , what answer do I get ? Molecular attraction and repulsion seem to say , " It is not in us ; we are as active in the clod as in the flower . " The four principal elements ? oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen , and carbon ? say , " It is not in us , because we are from all eternity , and life is not ; we form only its physical basis . " Warmth and moisture say , " It is not in us ; we are only its faithful nurses and handmaidens . " The sun says : " It is not in me ; I shine on dead worlds as well . I but quicken life after it is planted . " The stars say , " It is not in us ; we have seen life come and go among myriads of worlds for untold ages . " No questioning of the heavens above nor of the earth below can reveal to us the secret we are in quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life : " You tarry with me at your peril . You will always be on the firing-line of my blind , contending forces ; they will respect you not ; you must take your chances amid my flying missiles . My forces go their eternal round without variableness or shadow of turning , and woe to you if you cross their courses . You may bring all your gods with you ? gods of love , mercy , gentleness , altruism ; but I know them not . Your prayers will fall upon ears of stone , your appealing gesture upon eyes of stone , your cries for mercy upon hearts of stone . I shall he neither your enemy nor your friend . I shall be utterly indifferent to you . My floods will drown you , my winds wreck you , my fires burn you , my quicksands suck you down , and nor know what they are doing . My earth is a theater of storms and cyclones , of avalanches and earthquakes , of lightnings and cloudbursts ; wrecks and ruins strew my course . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fluids and gases and solids ; my stars in their courses will fight on your side , if you put and keep yourself in right relations to them . My atoms and electrons will build your house , my lightning do your errands , my winds sail your ships , on the same terms . You can not live without my air and my water and my warmth ; but each of them is a source of power that will crush or engulf or devour you before it will turn one hair's-breadth from its course . Your trees will he uprooted by my tornadoes , your fair fields will 6e laid waste by floods or fires ; my mountains will fall on your delicate forms and utterly crush and bury them ; my glaciers will overspread vast areas and banish or destroy whole tribes and races of your handiwork ; the shrinking and wrinkling crust of my earth will fold in its insensate bosom vast forests of your tropical growths , and convert them into black rock , and I will make rock of the myriad forms of minute life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages my relentless , unseeing , unfeeling forces will drive on like the plowshare that buries every flower and grass-blade and tiny creature in its path . My winds are life-giving breezes to-day , and the besom of destruction to-morrow ; my rains will moisten and nourish you one day , and wash you into the gulf the next ; my earthquakes will bury your cities as if they were ant-hills . So you must take your chances , but the chances are on your side . I am not all tempest or flood or fire or earthquake . Your career will be a warfare , but you will win more battles than you will lose . Rut remember , you are nothing to me , while I am everything to you . I have nothing to lose or gain , while you have everything to gain . Without my soils and moisture and warmth , without my carbon and oxygen and nitrogen and hydrogen , you can do or be nothing ; without my sunshine you perish ; but you have these things on condition of effort and struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hazard of the warring geologic ages . Fate and necessity rule in my realm . When you fail , or are crushed or swallowed by my remorseless forces , do not put the blame upon my gods , nor upon your own ; there is no blame , there is only the price to be paid ? the hazards of invading the closed circle of my unseeing forces . In California I saw an epitome of the merciless way inorganic nature deals with life . An old , dried , and hardened asphalt lake near Los Angeles tells a horrible tale of animal suffering and failure . It had been a pit of horrors for long ages ; it was Nature concentrated ? her wild welter of struggling and devouring forms through the geologic ages made visible and tangible in a small patch of mingled pitch and animal bones . There was nearly as much bone as pitch . The fate of the unlucky flies that alight upon tangle-foot fly-paper in our houses had been the fate of the victims that had perished here . How many wild creatures had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt themselves helpless and sinking in this allengulfing pitch ! How many human be-irws in storms and disasters at sea and in flood and fire upon land have turned the same appealing look to the unpitying heavens ! There is no power in the world of physical forces , or apart from our own kind , that heeds us or turns aside for us , or bestows one pitying glance upon us . The winds are never tempered to the shorn lamb , or the heats to the unshorn . Life has run , and still runs , the gantlet of a long line of hostile forces , and escapes by dint of fleetness of foot or agility in dodging , or else by toughness of fiber . Yet here we are ; here is love and charity and mercy and intelligence ; the fair face of childhood , the beautiful face of youth , the clear , strong face of manhood and womanhood , and the calm , benign face of old age , seen , it is true , as against a background of their opposites , but seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . Here is life in the midst of death , but death forever playing into the hands of life ; here is the organic in the midst of the inorganic , at strife with it , hourly crushed by it , yet sustained and kept going by its aid . That we have told the whole truth about a living body when we have enumerated all its chemical and mechanical activities , it is impossible for me to see . If this is the case , in what respect does life differ from a steam-engine or any other piece of machinery ? all of which are explained by the sum-total of their chemical , mechanical , or electrical activities ? What is added to these forces that makes the result vital instead of mechanical ? Vitality is only a word , but it marks a class of phenomena in nature that stands apart from all merely mechanical manifestations in the universe . The cosmos is a vast machine , but in this machine ? this tremendous complex of physical forces ? there appears , at least on this earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or this peculiar manifestation of energy that we call vital . Apparently it is a transient phase of activity in matter , which , unlike other chemical and physical activities , has its beginning and its ending , and out of which has arisen all the myriad forms of terrestrial life , and , finally , the body and brain of man . The merely material forces , blind and haphazard from the first , did not arise in matter ; they are inseparable from it ? they are as eternal as matter itself . but the activities called vital arose in time and place , and must eventually disappear as they arose , and the career of the inorganic elements go on as if life had never visited the sphere . Was it , or is it , a visitation ? something ab extra that implies supermundane , or supernatural , powers ? Added to this wonder is the fact that the vital order has gone on unfolding through the geologic ages , mounting from form to form , or from order toorder , becoming more and more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the emphasis of size of brain , and finally from instinct and reflex activities to free volition , and the reason and consciousness of man ; while the purely physical and chemical forces remain where they began . There has been endless change among them , endless shifting of the balance of power , but always the tendency to a dead equilib-rium , while the genius of the organic forces has been in the power to disturb the equilibrium and to ride into port on the crest of the wave it has created , or to hang forever between the stable and the unstable . So there we are , confronted by two apparently contrary truths . It is to me unthinkable , as the late Professor Brooks said , " that the living world is anything but natural , " that the vital order is not as truly rooted in the constitution of things as are the mechanical and chemical orders ; and yet , here we are face to face with its limited , fugitive , or transitional character . It comes and goes like the dews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional , unexpected , extraordinary occurrence of miracle , if you will ; but if the light which physical science turns on the universe is not a delusion , if the habit of mind which it begets is not a false one , then life belongs to the same category of things as do day and night , rain and sun , rest and motion Who shall reconcile these contradictions ? Huxley spoke for physical science when he said that he did not know what it was that constituted life ? what it was that made the " wonderful difference between the dead particles and the living particles of matter appearing in other respects identical . " He thought there might be some bond between physicochemical phenomena , on the one hand , and vital phenomena , on the other , that philosophers will some day find out . Living matter is characterized by " spontaneity of action , " which is entirely absent from inert matter . Huxley can not or does not think of a vital force distinct from all other forces , as the cause of life phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to our day . He finds protoplasm to be the physical basis of life ; it is one in both the vegetable and animal worlds ; the animal takes it from the vegetable , and the vegetable , by the aid of sunlight , takes or manufactures it from the inorganic elements . But protoplasm is living matter . Before there was any protoplasm , what brought about the stupendous change of the dead into the living ? Protoplasm makes more protoplasm , as fire makes more fire , but what kindled the first spark of this living flame ? Here we corner the mystery , but it is still a mystery that defies us . Cause and effect meet and are lost in each other . Science can not admit a miracle , or a break in the continuity of life , yet here it reaches a point where no step can be taken . Huxley 's illustrations do not help his argument . Protoplasm , he says , " is the day of the potter ; which , bake it and paint it as he will , remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the commonest brick or sun-dried clod . " Clay is certainly the physical basis of the potter 's art , but would there be any pottery in the world if it contained only clay ? Do we not have to think of the potter ? In the same way , do we not have to think of something that fashions these myriad forms of life out of protoplasm ? ? and back of that , of something that begat protoplasm out of non - protoplasmic matter , and started the flame of life going ? Life accounts for protoplasm , but what accounts for life ? We have to think of the living clay as separated by Nature from the inert " sun-dried clod . " There is something in the one that is i not in the other . There is really no authentic analogy between the potter 's art and Nature 's art of life . There is more wit than science in Huxley 's question , " What better philosophical status has vitality than aqueosity ? " There is at least this difference : When vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce it by your chemistry ; but you can recombine the two gases in which you have decomposed water any number of times , and get your aqueousity back again ; it never fails ; it is a power of chemistry . But vitality will not come at your beck ; it is not a chemical product ; it is not inthe same category as the wetness or liquidity of Vol , . CXXIX. ? No. 771. - 45water . It is a name for a phenomenon ? the most remarkable phenomenon in nature . It is one that the art of man is powerless to reproduce , while water may be made to go through its cycle of change ? solid , fluid , vapor , gas ? and always come back to water . Life is the introduction of a new element or force or tendency into the cosmos . Henceforth the elements go new ways , form new compounds , build up new forms , and change the face of nature . Rivers flow where they never would have flowed without it , mountains fall in a space of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise , rough ways are made smooth , a new world appears ? the world of the mind and soul of man . If the gods of the inorganic elements are neither for nor against us , but utterly indifferent to us , how came we here ? Nature 's method is always from the inside , while ours is from the outside ; hers is circular , while ours is direct . We think , as Bergson says , of things created , and of a thing that creates , but things in nature are not created , they are evolved ; they grow , and the thing that grows is not separable from the force that causes it to grow . The water turns the wheel , and can be shut off or let on . This is the way of the mechanical world . But the wheels in organic nature go around from something inside them , a kind of perpetual motion , or self-supplying power . They are not turned , they turn ; they are not repaired , they repair . The nature of living things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical things , though mechanics and chemistry play the visible , tangible part in them . In view of all these things , how man got here is a problem . Why the slender thread of his line of descent was not broken in the warrings and upheavals of the terrible geologic ages , what power or agent took a hand in furthering his development , is beyond the reach of our biologic science . Man 's is the only intelligence , as we understand the word , in the universe , and his intelligence demands something akin to intelligence in the nature from which he sprang .
