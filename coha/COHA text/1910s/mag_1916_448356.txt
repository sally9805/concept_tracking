No reverberatory effect of t he great war has caused American public opinion more solicitude than the failure of the ' melting-pot . ' The discovery of diverse , nat ionalistic , feelings among our great alien population has come to most people as an intense shock . It has brought out the unpleasant inconsistencies of our traditional beliefs . We have had to watch hard-hearted old Brahmins virtuously indignant at the spectacle of the immigrant refusing to be melted , while they jeer at patriots like Mary Ant in who write about ' our forefathers . ' We have had to listen to publicists who express themselves as stunned by the evidence of vigorous nationalistic and cultural movements in this country among Germans , Scandinavians , IhJhernians , and Poles , while in the same breath they insist that the alien shall be forcibly assimilated to that Anglo-Saxon tradition which they unquestioningly label ' American . ' As the unpleasant truth has come upon us that assimilation in this country was proceeding on lines very different from those we had marked out for it , we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth became culpable . We blamed the war , we blamed the Germans . And then we discovered with a moral shock that these movements had been making great headway before the war even began . We found that the tendency , reprehensible and paradoxical as it might be , has been for the national clusters of immigrants , as they became more and more firmly estab86fished and more and more prosperous , to cultivate more and more assiduously the literatures and cultural traditions of their homelands . Assimilation , in other words , instead of washing out the memories of Europe , made them more and more intensely real . Just as these clusters became more and more objectively ' American , did they become more and more German or Scandinavian or Bohemian or Polish . To face the fact that our aliens are already strong enough to take a share in the direction of their own destiny , and that the strong cultural movements represented by the foreign press , schools , and colonies are a challenge to our facile attempts , is not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear the failure of democracy . It is rather to urge us to an investigation of what Americanism may rightly mean . It is to ask ourselves whether our ideal has been broad or narrow ? whether perhaps the time has not come to assert a higher ideal than the ' melting-pot . ' Surely we can not be certain of our spiritual democracy when , claiming to melt the nations within its to a comprehension of our free and democratic institutions , we fly into panic at the first sign of their own will and tendency . We act as if we wanted Americanization to take place only on our own terms , and not by the consent of the governed . All our elaborate machinery of settlement and school and union , of social and political naturalization , however , will move with friction just in so far as it neglects to take into account this strong and virile insistence that America shall be what the immigrant . will have a hand in making it , and not what a ruling class , descendant of those British stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be made . This is the condition which confronts us , and which demands a clear and general readjustment of our attitude and our ideal . Mary Antin is right when she looks upon our foreign-born as the people who missed the Mayflower and came over on the first boat they could find . But she forgets that when they ( lid come it was not upon other Mayflowers , but upon a Maiblume , ' a ' Fleur de Mai , ' a ' Fior di Maggio , ' a Majblonist . " Ehese people were not mere arrivals from the same family , to be welcomed as understood and long-loved , but strangers to the neighborhood , with whom a long process of settling down had to take place . For they brought with them their national and racial characters , and each new national quota had to wear slowly away the contempt with which its mere alienness got itself greeted . Each had to make its way slowly from the lowest strata of unskilled labor up to a level where it satisfied the accredited norms of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign-born , and if distinctions are to be made between us they should rightly be on some other ground than indigenousness . The early colonists came over with motives no less colonial than the later . They did not come to he assimilated in an American melting-pot . They ( lid not come to adopt the culture of the American Indian . They had not the smallest intention of ' giving themselveswithout reservation ' to the new country . They came to get freedom to live as they wanted to . They came to escape from the stilling air and chaos of the old world ; they came to make t heir fortune in a new land . They invented no new social framework . Bather they brought over bodily the old ways to which they had been accustomed . Tightly concentrated on a hostile frontier , they were conservative beyond belief . Their pioneer daring was reserved for the object ive conquest of material resources . In their folkways , in their social and political institutions , they were , like every colonial people , slavishly imitative of the mother-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' our whole legal and political system remained more English than the English , petrified and unchanging , while in England law developed to meet the needs of the changing times . It is just this English-American conservatism that has been our chief obstacle to social advance . We have needed the new peoples  --  the order of the German and Scandinavian , the turbulence of the Slav and Hun ? to save us from our own stagnation . I do not mean that the illiterate Slav is now the equal of the New Englander of pure descent . Ile is raw material to be educated , not into a New Englander , but into a socialized American along such lines as those thirty nationalities are being educated in t he unlacing schools of Gary . I do not believe that , this process is to be one of decades of evolution . The spectacle of Japan 's sudden jump from medievalism to post-modernism shout ( ' have destroyed that superstition . We are not dealing wit It individuals who are to ' evolve . ' We are dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about to have , will start level with all of us . Let us cease to think of ideals like democracy as magical qualities inherent in certain peoples . Let us speak , not of inferior races , but of inferior civilizations . We are all to educate and to be educated . These peoples in America are in a common enterprise . It is not what we are now that concerns us , but what this plastic next generation may become in the light of a new cosmopolitan ideal . We are not dealing with static factors , but with fluid and dynamic generations . To contrast the older and the newer immigrants and see the one class as democratically motivated by love of liberty , and the other by mere money-getting , is not to illuminate the future . To think of earlier nationalities as culturally assimilated to America , while we picture the later as a sodden and resistive mass , makes only for bitterness and misunderstanding . There may be a difference between these earlier and these later stocks , but it lies neither in motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeland . The truth is that no more tenacious cultural allegiance to the mother country has been shown by any alien nation than by the ruling class of Anglo-Saxon descendants in these American States . English snobberies , English religion , English literary styles , English literary reverences and canons , English ethics , English superiorities , have been the cultural food that we have drunk in from our mothers ' breasts . The distinctively American spirit ? pioneer , as distinguished from the reminiscently English ? that appears in Whitman and Emerson and James , has had to exist on sufferance alongside of this other cult , unconsciously belittled by our cultural makers of opinion . No country has perhaps had so great indigenous genius which had so little influence on the country 's traditions and expressions . The unpopular and dreaded German-American of the pres ent day is a beginning amateur in comparison with those foolish Anglophiles of Boston and New York and Philadelphia whose reversion to cultural type sees uncritically in England 's cause the cause of Civilization , and , under the guise of ethical independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ' than the German categories themselves . It speaks well for German-American innocence of heart or else for its lack of imagination that it has not turned the hyphen stigma into a " At quoquel ' If there were to be any hyphens scattered about , clearly they should be affixed to those English descendants who had had centuries of time to be made American where the German had had only half a century . Most significantly has the war brought out of them this alien virus . showing them still loving English things , owing allegiance to the English : Kultur , moved by English shibboleths and prejudice . It is only because it has been the ruling class in this country that bestowed the epithets that we have not heard copiously and scornfully of ' hyphenated English-Americans . ' But even our quarrels with England have had the bad temper , the extravagance , of family quarrels . The Englishman of to-day nags us and dislikes us in that personal , peculiarly intimate way in which he dislikes the Australian , or as we may dislike our younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonials . ' America ? official , controlling , literary , political America ? is still , as a writer recently expressed it , ' culturally speaking , a self-governing dominion of the British Empire . ' The non-English American can scarcely be blamed if he sometimes thinks of the Anglo-Saxon predominance in America as little more than a predominance of priority . The Anglo- Saxon was merely the first immigrant , the first to found a colony . He has never really ceased to be the descendant of immigrants , nor has he ever succeeded in transforming that colony into a real nation , with a tenacious , richly woven fabric of native culture . Colonials from the other nations have come and settled down beside him . They found no definite native culture which should startle them out of their colonialism , and consequently they looked back to their mother-country , as the earlier Anglo-Saxon immigrant was looking back to his . What has been offered the newcomer has been the chance to learn English , to become a citizen , to salute the flag . And those elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , the settlements , all the organizations for amelioration in the cities , have every reason to be proud of the care and labor which they have devoted to absorbing the immigrant . His opportunities the immigrant has taken to gladly , with almost a pathetic eagerness to make his way in the new land without friction or disturbance . The common language has made not only for the necessary communication , but for all the amenities of life . If freedom means the right to do pretty much as one pleases , so long as one does not interfere with others , the immigrant has found freedom , and the ruling element has been singularly liberal in its treatment of the invading hordes . But if freedom means a democratic cooperation in determining the ideals and purposes and industrial and social institutions of a country , then the immigrant has not been free , and the Anglo-Saxon element is guilty of just what every dominant race is guilty of in every European country : the imposition of its own culture upon the minority peoples . The fact that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-conscious does not alter its quality . And the war has brought out just the degree to which that purpose of ' Americanizing , ' that is , AngloSaxonizing , ' the immigrant , has failed . For the Anglo-Saxon now in his bitterness to turn upon the other peoples , talk about their ' arrogance , ' scold t hem for not being melted in a pot which never existed , is to betray the unconscious purpose which lay at the hot torn of his heart . It betrays too the possession of a racial jealousy similar to that of which he is now accusing the so-called ' hyphenates . ' Let . the Anglo-Saxon be proud enough of the heroic toil and heroic sacrifices which moulded the nation . But let him ask himself , if he had had to depend on the English descendants , where he would have been living to-day . To those of us who see in the exploitation of unskilled labor the strident red leit-motif of our civilization , the settling of the country presents a great social drama as the waves of immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been if these races had not come ? Let those who feel the inferiority of the non-AngloSaxon immigrant contemplate that region of the States which has remained the most distinctively ' American , ' the South . Let him ask himself whether he would really like to see the foreign hordes Americanized into such an Americanization . Let him ask himself how superior this native civilization is to the great ' alien ' states of Wisconsin and Minnesota , where Scandinavians , Poles , and Germans have self-consciously labored to preserve their traditional culture , while being outwardly and satisfactorily American . Let him ask himself how much more wisdom , intelligence , industry and social leadership has come out of these alien states than out of all the truly American ones . The South , in fact , while this vast . Northern development has gone on , still remains an English colony , stagnant and complacent , having progressed culturally scarcely beyond the early Victorian era . It is culturally sterile because it has had no advantage of cross-fertilization like the Northern states . What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong foreign cultures have struck root in a new and fertile soil . America has meant liberation , and German and Scandinavian political ideas and social energies have expanded to a new potency . The process has not been at all the fancied assimilation ' of the Scandinavian or Teuton . Rather has it been a process of their assimilation of us ? I speak as an Anglo-Saxon . The foreign cultures have not been melted down or run together , made into some homogeneous Americanism , but have remained distinct but cooperating to the greater glory and benefit , not only of themselves but of all the native ' Americanism ' around them . What we emphatically do not want is that these distinctive qualities should be washed out into a tasteless , colorless fluid of uniformity . Already we have far too much of this insipidity , masses of people who are cultural half-breeds , neither assimilated Anglo-Saxons nor nationals of another culture . Each national colony in this country seems to retain in its foreign press , its vernacular literature , its schools , its intellectual and patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony extends out by imperceptible gradations to a fringe where national characteristics are all but lost . Our cities are filled with these half-breeds who retain their foreign names but have lost the foreign savor . This does not mean that they have actually been changed into New Englanders or Middle Westerners . It does not mean that they have been really Americanized . It means that . let ting slip from them whatever native culture they had , they have substituted for it only the most rudimentary American  --  the American culture of the cheap newspaper , the " movies , ' I he popular song , the ubiquitous automobile . The unthinking who survey this class call them assimilated , Americanized . The great . American public school has done its work . With these people our institutions are safe . We may thrill with dread at the aggressive hyphenate , but this tame flabbiness is accepted as Americanization . The same moulders of opinion whose ideal is tom &; the different races into Anglo-Saxon gold hail this poor product as the satisfying result of their alchemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not the self-conscious cultural nuclei that sap at our American life , but these fringes . It is not the Jew who sticks proudly to the faith of his fathers and boasts of that . venerable culture of his who is dangerous to America , but the Jew who has lost the Jewish fire and become a mere elementary , grasping animal . It is not the Bohemian who supports the Bohemian schools in Chicago whose influence is sinister , but the Bohemian who has made money and has got into ward politics . Just so surely as we tend to disintegrate these nuclei of nationalistic culture do we tend to create hordes of men and women without a spiritual country , cultural outlaws , without . taste , without . standards but those of the mob . We sentence them to live on the most rudimentary planes of American life . The influences at the centre of the nuclei are centripetal . They make for the intelligence and the social values which mean an enhancement of life . And just because the foreign-born retains t his expressiveness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? NATIONAL AMERICA American community . The influences at the fringe , however , are centrifugal , anarchical . They make for detached fragments of peoples . Those who came to find liberty achieve only license . They become the flotsam and jetsam of American life , the downward undertow of our civilization with h its leering cheapness and falseness of taste and spiritual outlook , the absence of mind and sincere feeling which we see in our slovenly towns , our vapid moving pictures , our popular novels , and in the vacuous faces of the crowds on the city street . This is the cultural wreckage of our time , and it is from the fringes of t he Anglo-Saxon as well as the other stocks that it falls . America has as yet no impelling integrating force . It makes too easily for this detritus of cultures . In our loose , free country , no constraining national purpose , no tenacious folk-tradition and folk-style hold the people to a line . The war has shown us that not in any magical formula will this purpose be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . But do we not begin to see a new and more adventurous ideal ? Do we not see how the national colonies in America , deriving power from the deep cultural heart of Europe and yet living here in mutual toleration , freed from the age-long tangles of races , creeds , and dynasties , may work out a federated ideal ? America is transplanted Europe , but a Europe that has not been disintegrated and scattered in the transplanting as in some Dispersion . Its colonies live here inextricably mingled , yet not homogeneous . They merge but they do not fuse . America is a unique sociological fabric , and it bespeaks poverty of imagination not to be thrilled at the incalculable potentialities of so novel a union of men . To seek no other goal than the weary old nationalism , ? bel ligerent , exclusive , inbreeding , the poison of which we are witnessing now in Europe ,  - -   - -   is to make patriotism a hollow sham , and to declare that , in spite of our boast ings , America must ever be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to find t his lioint of view plausible , we shall have to give up t he search for our native ' American ' culture . With the exception of the South and that New England which , like the Red Indian , seems to be passing into solemn oblivion , there is no distinctively American culture . It is apparently our lot rather to be a federation of cultures . This we have been for half a century , and the war has made it ever more evident that this is what we are destined to remain . This will not mean , however , that there are not expressions of indigenous genius that could not have sprung from any other soil . Music , poetry , philosophy , have been singularly fertile and new . Strangely enough , American genius has flared forth just in those directions which are least understanded of the people . If the American note is bigness , action , the objective as contrasted with the reflective life , where is the epic expression of this spirit ? Our drama and our fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are somehow exactly the fields of the spirit which remain poor and mediocre . American materialism is in some way inhibited from getting into impressive artistic form its own energy with which it bursts . Nor is it any better in architecture , thc least romantic and subjective of all the arts . We are inarticulate of the very values which we profess to idealize . But in the finer forms ? music , verse , t he essay , philosophy the American genius puts forth work equal to any of its contemporaries . Just in so far as our American genius has expressed the pioneer spirit , the adventurous , forward-looking drive of a colonial empire , is it representative of that whole America of the many races and peoples , and not of any partial or traditional enthusiasm . And only as that pioneer note is sounded can we really speak of the American culture . As long as we thought of Americanism in terms of the ' mel ti ng-pot , ' our American cultural tradition lay in the past . It was something to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our changing ideal of Americanism , we must perpetrate the paradox that our American cultural tradition lies in the future . It will be what we all together make out of this incomparable opportunity of attacking the future with a new key . Whatever American nationalism turns out to be , it . is certain to become something utterly different from the nationalisms of twentieth-century Europe . This wave of reactionary enthusiasm to play the orthodox nationalistic game which is passing over the country is scarcely vital enough to last . We can not swagger and thrill to the same national self-feeling . We must give new edges to our pride . We must be content to avoid the unnumbered woes that national patriotism has brought in Europe , and that fiercely heightened pride and self-consciousness . Alluring as this is , we must allow our imaginations to transcend this scarcely veiled belligerency . We can be serenely too proud to fight if our pride embraces the creative forces of civilization which armed contest nullifies . We can be too proud to fight if our code of honor transcends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates . Our honor must be positive and creative , and not the mere jealous and negative protec tiveness against metaphysical violations of our technical rights . When the doctrine is put forth that in one American flows the mystic blood of all our country 's sacred honor , freedom , and prosperity , so that an injury to him is to be the signal for turning our whole nation into that clan-feud of horror and reprisal which would be war , then we find ourselves back among the musty schoolmen of the Middle Ages , and not in any pragmatic and realistic America of the twentieth century . We should hold our gaze to what . America has done , not what media'val codes of dueling she has failed to observe . We have transplanted European modernity to our soil , without . the spirit that inflames it and turns all its energy into mutual destruction . Out of these foreign peoples there has somehow been squeezed the poison . An America , ' hyphenated ' to bitterness , is somehow non-explosive . For , even if we all hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war has set every one vibrating to some emotional string twanged on the other side of the Atlantic , the effect has been one of almost dramatic harmlessness . What we have really been witnessing , however unappreciatively , in this country has been a thrilling and bloodless battle of Kulturs . In that arena of friction which has been the most dramatic ? between the hyphenated German-American and the hyphenated English-American ? there have emerged rivalries of philosophies which show up deep traditional attitudes , points of view which accurately reflect the gigantic issues of the war . America has mirrored the spiritual issues . The vicarious struggle has been played out peacefully here in the mind . We have seen the stout resistiveness of the old moral interpretation of history on which Victorian England thrived and made itself great in its own es- teem . The clean and immensely satisfying vision of the war as a contest between right and wrong ; the enthusiastic support of the Allies as the incarnation of virtue-on-a-rampage ; the fierce envisaging of their selfish national purposes as the ideals of justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensest force against t he German realistic interpretations in terms of the struggle for power and the virility of the integrated State . America has been the intellectual battleground of the nations . III The failure of the melting-pot , far from closing the great American democratic experiment , means that it has only just begun . Whatever American nationalism turns out to be , we see already that it will have a color richer and more exciting than our ideal has hitherto encompassed . In a world which has dreamed of internationalism , we find that we have all unawares been building up the first international nation . The voices which have cried for a tight and jealous nationalism of the European pattern are failing . From that ideal , however valiantly and disinterestedly it has been set for us , time and tendency have moved us further and further away . What we have achieved has been rather a cosmopolitan federation of national colonies , of foreign cultures , from whom the sting of devastating competition has been removed . America is already the world-federation in miniature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved that miracle of hope , the peaceful living side by side , with character substantially preserved , of the most heterogeneous peoples under the sun . Nowhere else has such contiguity been anything but the breeder of misery . Here , notwithstanding our tragic failures of adjustment , the outlines are already too clear not to give us a new vision and a new orientation of the American mind in the world . It is for the American of the younger generation to accept this cosmopolitanism , and carry it along with h self-conscious and fruitful purpose . In his colleges , he is already getting , with t he study of modern history and polities , the modern literatures , economic geography , the privilege of a cosmopolitan outlook such as the people of no other nation of to-day in Europe can possibly secure . If he is still a colonial , he is no longer the colonial of one partial culture , but of many . He is a colonial of the world . Colonialism has grown into cosmopolitanism , and his motherland is no one nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . That . vague sympathy which the France of ten years ago was feeling for t he world ? a sympathy which was drowned in the terrible reality of war ? may be the modern American 's , and that in a positive and aggressive sense . If the American is parochial , it is in sheer wantonness or cowardice . His provincialism is the measure of his fear of bogies or the defect of his imagination . Indeed , it is not uncommon for the eager Anglo-Saxon who goes to a vivid American university to-day to find his true friends not among his own race but among the acclimatized German or Austrian , the acclimatized . Jew , the acclimatized Scandinavian or Italian . In them he finds the cosmopolitan note . In these youths , foreign-horn or the children of foreign-horn parents , be is likely to find many of his old inbred morbid problems washed away . These friends are oblivious to the repressions of that tight little society in which he so provincially grew up . He has a pleasurable sense of liberation from the stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created anything vital for his America of to-day . He breathes a larger air . In his new enthusiasms for continental literature , for unplumbed Russian depths , for French clarity of thought , for Teuton philosophies of power , he feels himself citizen of a larger world . He may be absurdly superficial , his outward-reaching wonder may ignore all the stiller and homelier virtues of his Anglo-Saxon home , but he has at least found the clue to that international mind which will be essential to all men and women of good-will if they are ever to save this Western world of ours from suicide . His new friends have gone through a similar evolution . America has burned most , of the baser metal also from them . Meeting now with this common American background , all of them may yet . retain that distinctiveness of their native cultures and their national spiritual slants . They are more valuable and interesting to each other for being different , yet that difference could not be creative were it not For this new cosmopolitan outlook which America has given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a spirit is possible even to the smallest degree , has within itself already the seeds of this international intellectual world of the future . It suggests that the contribution of America will be an intellectual internationalism which goes far beyond the mere exchange of scientific ideas and discoveries and the cold recording of facts . It will be an intellectual sympathy which is not satisfied until it has got at the heart of the different cultural expressions , and felt as they feel . It may have immense preferences , but it will make understanding and not indignation its end . Such a sympathy will unite and not divide . Against the thinly disguised panic which calls itself ' patriotism ' and the thinly disguised militarism which calls itself preparedness ' the cosmopolitan ideal is set . This does not mean that . those who hold it are for a policy of drift . They , too , long passionately for an integrated and disciplined America . But they do not want one which is integrated only for domestic economic exploitation of the workers or for predatory economic imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that is integrated by coercion or militarism , or for the truculent assertion of a mediaeval code of honor and of doubtful rights . They believe that the most effective integration will be one which coordinates the diverse elements and turns them consciously toward working out together the place of America in the world-situation . They demand for integration a genuine integrity , a wholeness and soundness of enthusiasm and purpose which can only come When no national colony within our America feels that , it is being discriminated against or that its cultural case is being prejudged . This strength of cooperation , this feeling that all who are here may have a hand in the destiny of America , will make for a finer spirit of integration than any narrow ' Americanism ' or forced chauvinism . In this effort we may have to accept some form of that dual citizenship which meets with so much articulate horror among us . Dual citizenship we may have to recognize as the rudimentary form of that international citizenship to which , if our words mean anything , we aspire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the United States must cut the new citizen off from all sympathy with his old allegiance . Anything but a bodily transfer of devotion from one sovereignty to another has beeta viewed as a sort of moral treason against the Republic . We have insisted that the immigrant . whom we welcomed escaping from the very exclusive nationalism of his European home shall forthwith adopt a nationalism just as exclusive , just as narrow , and even less legitimate because it is founded on no warm traditions of his own . Yet a nation like France is said to permit a formal and legal dual citizenship even at the present time . Though a citizen of hers may pretend to cast off his allegiance in favor of some other sovereignty , he is still subject to her laws when he returns . Once . t citizen , always a citizen , no matter how many new citizenships he may em-mace . And such a dual citizenship seems to us sound and right . For it recognizes that , although the Frenchman may accept the formal institutional framework of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet his Frenchness he will never lose . What makes up the fabric of his soul will always be of this Frenchness , so that unless he becomes utterly degenerate he will always to some degree dwell still in his native environment . Indeed , does not the cultivated American who goes to Europe practice a dual citizenship , which , if not formal , is no less real ? The American who lives abroad may be the least expatriate of men . If he falls in love with French ways and French thinking and French democracy and seeks to saturate himself with the new spirit , he is guilty of at least a dual spiritual citizenship . He may be still American , yet he feels himself through sympathy also a Frenchman . And he finds that this expansion involves no shameful conflict within him , no surrender of his native attitude . He has rather for the first time caught a glimpse of the cosmopolitan spirit . And after wandering about through many races and civiliza- Lions he may return to America to find them all here living vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made . He sees the new peoples here with a new vision . They are no longer masses of aliens , waiting to be assimilated ; waiting to be meh ed clown into the indistinguishable dough of Anglo-Saxon ism . They are rather threads of living and potent cultures , blindly striving to weave themselves into a novel international nation , the first the world has seen . In an Austria-Hungary or a Prussia the stronger of these cultures would be moving almost instinctively to subjugate the weaker . But in America those wills-to-power are turned in a different direction into learning how to live together . Along with dual citizenship we shall have to accept , I think , that free and mobile passage of the immigrant between America and his native land again which now arouses so much prejudice among us . We shall have to accept the immigrants return for the same reason that we consider justified our own flitting about . the earth . To stigmatize the alien who works in America for a few years and returns to his own land , only perhaps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalistic terms . It is to ignore the cosmopolitan significance of this migration . It is to ignore the fact that the returning immigrant is often a missionary to an inferior civilization . This migratory habit has been especially common with the unskilled laborers who have been pouring into the United States in the last dozen years from every country in southeastern Europe . Many of them return to spend their earnings in their own country or to serve their country in war . But they return with an entirely new critical outlook , and a sense of the superiority of American organization to the primitive living around them . This continued passage to and fro has already raised the material standard of living in many regions of these backward countries . For these regions are thus endowed with exactly what they need , the capital for the exploitation of their natural resources , and the spirit of enterprise . America is thus educating these laggard peoples from the very bottom of society up , awaking vast masses to a new-born hope for the future . in the migratory Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful American asset , but a symbol of that cosmopolitan interchange which is coming , in spite of all war and national exclusiveness . Only America , by reason of the unique liberty of opportunity and traditional isolation for which she seems to stand , can lead in this cosmopolitan enterprise . Only the American ? and in this category I include the migratory alien who has lived with us and caught the pioneer spirit and a sense of new social vistas ? has the chance to become that citizen of the world . America is coming to be , not a nationality but a trans-nationality , a weaving back and forth , with the other lands , of many threads of all sizes and colors . Any movement which attempts to thwart this weaving , or to dye the fabric any one color , or disentangle the threads of the strands , is false to this cosmopolitan vision . I do not mean that we shall necessarily glut ourselves with the raw product of humanity . It would be folly to absorb the nations faster than we could weave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is purely a question of expediency . What concerns us is the fact that the strands are here . We must have a policy and an ideal for an actual situation . Our question is , What shall we do with our q America ? How are we likely to get the more creative America ? by confining our imaginations to the ideal of the mel ting-pot , or broadening them to some such cosmopolitan conception as I have been vaguely sketching ? The war has shown America to be unable , though isolated geographically and politically from a European world-situation , to remain aloof and irresponsible . She is a wandering star in a sky dominated by two colossal constellations of states . Can she not . work out some position of her own , some life of being in , yet not quite of , this seething k.nd embroiled European world ? This is her only hope and promise . A trans ? nationality of all the nations , it is spiritually impossible for her to pass into the orbit of any One . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to emulate Europe and play fast and loose with the forces that drag into war . No Americanization will fulfill this vision which does not recognize the uniqueness of this trans-nationalism of ours , The Anglo-Saxon attempt to fuse will only create enmity and distrust . The crusade against ' hyphenates ' will only inflame the partial patriotism of trans-nationals , and cause them to assert their European traditions in strident and unwholesome ways . But the attempt to weave a wholly novel international nation out of our chaotic America will liberate and harmonize the creative power of all these peoples and give them the new spiritual citizenship , as so many individuals have ? already been given , of a world . Is it a wild hope that the undertow of opposition to metaphysics in international relations , opposition to militarism , is less a cowardly provincialism than a groping for this higher cosmopolitan ideal ?
