TALK of war with Japan has recently been heard in our Senate . Just as we were relaxing from the great effort against Germany , this old bugaboo has been raised again . The ostrich policy of ignoring danger never prevented any war . " Drift " is what we have most to fear . If we want peace , we must prepare to prevent war . We must think about it . An important element in our relations with Japan is relative size . Not only in mileage is our country larger than the Japanese Islands ; in almost every sense it is more spacious . Masses of statistics could be marshaled to emphasize this contrast . The most impressive have to do with the food-supply . This subject is treated ably in King 's Farmers of Forty Centuries . He was an agricultural expert , and just as Ruskin saw nothing in Venice but works of art , so King 's sole interest in the Orient was the marvelous farmeraft , the infinite capacity for taking pains , by which these ancient peoples have wrung a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic chart , with one square representing the amount of land per capita of our farmers , and another on the same basis for Japan , it would look like the socialist diagrams of the unequal distribution of wealth in capitalistic society . Our share is almost ten times theirs . They have an appalling number of mouths to feed for every acre of arable land . This terrific overcrowding influences the whole structure of their society . A sparse frontier community can get along with informal lynch law , while a dense population requires detailed legislation and rigid traditional customs . There is no need of a food administrator where CXXXIX - N0. 834 - 108there is plenty to eat , but in a beleaguered city it is necessary to ration all the mean of life . Formal , careful manners , control ? discipline ? are needed in a crowd . So not only in our acreage , but also in our habits of thought , we are more favored than Japan . We have grown wastefully rich in peace . The New Era in Japan began with the imminent threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reorganizers " was to imitate the militarism of Christendom , which menaced them . Their achievements have been marvelous ? but very expensive . They are still burdened by the heavy debts of the Russian War and their army budget in times of peace has been excessive . In the war crisis we sent to France one man for every fifty of our population . The Japanese have kept a larger percentage of their manhood in arms continually . They have not only had to make every acre yield more food than we do ; they have had to stretch every gold coin much thinner . The effect of these contrasts , between our large-scale farming with tractors and the intensive hand labor of their ricefields , between our easy wastefulness and their intense thrift , is felt in every branch of life . It might be summed up by comparing our sky-scrapers with their eloissone vases . The grand design versus the intimate detail . There is much antagonism , instinctive , unreasoning , in this contrast the background of our relations . We may wax enthusiastic over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us it seems a bit moribund . They may be thrilled and somewhat awed by the great sweep of our conceptions ? but we seem to them grandiose and gross . Much more important than any " incidents " at Tientsin or Magdalena Bay is this fact of background . We do not like the same things . However , there is no reason for a clash over this difference in scale . If there is to be a fight , there must be an " issue . " The sword-wavers are trying to make one out of Japan 's tendency to expand at the expense of China . It is a serious matter for us , for under some circumstances it will surely lead to war . But first let us try to state the " issue " clearly . However threatening Japanese ambitions may be to us , they have to face a worse menace at home . They have a baby-peril , more dangerous than Oriental immigration ever was to us . Each new child born to them increases the desperate pressure of over-population . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Famine . Emigration . Industrial Expansion . There are no other choices for Japan . The first will never be accepted as a governmental policy . We forbid emigration to the districts where the pressure on the food-supply is less . If ever force majeure controlled the destiny of a nation , it drives Japan to expanding industrialism . If her factories can produce what the overfed nations of Christendom will buy , she can feed her people ? not otherwise . But goods , exchangeable for food , can not he manufactured out of thin air or pious wishes . The demand for imitation antiques or modern lacquerware is scant . The graceful products of her soul will not keep Japan alive . Her string of rocky islands is not rich in the raw materials of modern industry . The resources of metal and fuel are limited . The crops of wool and cotton and silk arc not large enough to keep her looms busy . And every day there are bigger crowds at the factory doors begging for work . Germany , under circumstances similar ? but less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hack her way through to a place in the sun . The economic situation of Japan is as black midnight compared to our sunny noontide . To check the development of Japanese trade and industry is to push her to suicide ? gradual death from famine or such a spectacular climax as has overwhelmed Germany . This is a new problem for Japan . It is a misleading custom to translate " Mikado " as " Emperor . " There was nothing imperial about the Old Japan . They never had a Caesar or a Bonaparte . They were always fighting feudal wars among themselves , but they left their neighbors alone . They never subjugated alien peoples ? which is the very essence of .1 , mperiolism . Foreign dominion is as new an idea to the Mikados as steam-engines . It is only since Perry lifted the Lid from this Oriental Pandora 's Box , that the traditional policy has been reversed . Faced by the threat of foreign aggression , the Japanese suddenly developed internal unity , eliminated civil war , modernized their armament . They fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drove industrial stakes into widely separated parts of China . There is no indication of a fall in this rising curve of expansion . In fact , all the conditions have the opposite implication . Japan 's great change in the middle of the last century had very little democratic intent . The masses took no part in the movement . It was a quarrel among the clans . The warrior chieftains who led the Reconstruction were not interested in our religion nor in our theories of government . What impressed them and stirred their emulation was our war-ships . With marvelous ability and energy they set about copying our armaments ? to defend themselves from us with our own fire . llut they seem to have been blind to the chance that success hi this project of self-defense would gravely affect their social status and change the entire basis of Japanese life . When they discovered the inevitable byproducts of their enterprise ? industrial development and all its political results ? most of these innovators became reactionary . Progress has been too rapid to suit the old generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encouraged for the production of weapons , grew apace and could not be stopped . It is this industrial development , which pushes Japan to expansion . The drive back of her foreign policy comes from this force rather than from the throne . The Japanese have tried to meet their need for raw material ? just as in so many other cases ? by close imitation of the Christian Powers . They have developed a colonial policy ; they have annexed territory , against the will of the inhabitants , where they hoped to find the things they needed . Their first venture was Formosa . There they were after tropical products . But the military expenses incurred in " educating " the head-hunters has wiped out any profit from the enterprise . With this experience to guide them , they did better in the administration of Korea . They have tried in many ways to benefit the " natives . " One thing , which all tourists notice is the elaborate program of reforestation . The barren and denuded hills of Korea are growing up to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more hopeful about Korea than Formosa . It was very expensive , but rich in promise . However , the present Independence movement is rolling up staggering expenses . They feel about Korea very much as we did , about the Philippines , when Aguinaldo was noisily insisting that we were not wanted there . In those days the Spanish priests filled the European press with indignant letters about our brutality to the Filipinos , just as our missionaries are now writing home unpleasant truths about Korea . The Japanese colonial administrators ? in their small way have had to face their share of " Sepoy Rebellions " and " Insurrecto Movements . " They havemet such unpleasant crises just as Americans and Europeans have done . They are just as likely as we to lose their tempers , just as quick to suppress the " seditions , ? who want to be free , just as bitter in their " race prejudice " against the people they have subjugated . The tragic ? and humiliating ? thing is that so little colonial history is pleasant reading . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent morality in such matters . The recent news from Korea is sickening . But we have similar news from Egypt and the Afghan border . The French and Spanish are campaigning against native rebels in Morocco , the Italians in Tunisia . Our Marines are on " active service " in San Domingo and Nicaragua . The Japanese are not claiming any " racial superiority . " The gravest criticism we can bring against their colonial policy is that they have too closely followed the practice of Christendom . But these colonies , at the best , would furnish but a drop in the bucket of Japan 's need . Her hunger for raw material can only be satisfied on the mainland of Asia . In China , Japan does not profess to seek colonies . She wants " spheres of influence . " Perhaps this results from her own experiences , her not too successful experiments in colonization . Perhaps it is pure imitation . France is the only one of the European Powers which has carved a colony out of the body of China . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure economic concessions . The dangers involved in " dismemberment " are apparent to the Japanese , and they are probably as sincere as the other Powers in their renunciation of colonial ambitions in China . But economic penetration is a different matter , and they insist that it is their manifest destiny to share largely in the industrial development of China . We , of the West , have not even attempted to write anything into the Law of Nations which makes such demands illegal . The other nations , to whom China appeals for protection , can not with equity hem in Japan with rules they themselves do not respect . A few questions will clarify some of the possibilities before us . Will Japan seek her place in the sun by diplomatic negotiations , or will she appeal to arms ? Will she insist on political sovereignty over the sources of needed raw material or can she be satisfied with soundly guaranteed economic concessions ? as France was at last in regard to the Saar Valley ? If she gets assured access to the coveted fuel and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will she ameliorate the hideous conditions of her workers at home or will the only people to profit be her mushroom millionaires ? To these questions you can find contradictory answers in the parliamentary discussions of Japan . They have not made up their minds on such matters . But there is no dispute about one thing . Their factories must be fed or their people will starve . Now that the war is over we do not need to muddle our thinking longer by the pretense of sacred union . Of course it was only a figure of speech ? a wartime necessity ? to talk about nations as units . It is no longer a patriotic duty to concentrate all our hatred on the Kaiser , and we have promptly rediscovered most of our old , local animosities . It is not even sound to speak of any class in the nation as united in political aspirations . We have people , just as undemocratic in their pride of birth as the Samurai , but they do not vote alike . Our industrial magnates are divided into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Roosevelt 's campaign funds . Our working-class does not unite in one party . Japan is just as much torn by internal politics as we . Modern industry has developed a Third Estate in Japan , much as it did in France a dozen decades ago . Feudalism is being ground up in the factories . The magic of machinery has produced rich men , with a wealth more dazzlingthan that of the nobles , with more powerful retinues of bourgeoisminded lawyers , engineers , and journalists . It is a growing class ? immensely stimulated by war conditions ? active , enterprising , reckless . The Samurai may disapprove and despise , but they can not compete . The ancient clans are giving ground to the political parties . For the first time in their history , a Commoner , a man of this new Third Estate , Hara -- - chosen by the Diet , not an appointee of the Throne ? is Premier . It is a momentous change for them , a great advance in constitutional government . But it means little to the bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , their conditions of life changed very little since the Great Buddha was erected at Kamakura . They hear the rumble of distant trains and see the glow of arc-lights , but they take little interest in premiers and politics . A small , but rapidly growing , section of the coolies has been caught under the Juggernaut of the Industrial Revolution ? as hideous and merciless as it ever was in Leeds or Manchester . The living conditions in the shacks about the factories are appalling , the wages pitiful , women and children are being ruthlessly sacrificed to the modern Moloch . Highly explosive material here . Mr. Hasa has promised to introduce a law to permit labor-unions . The war has quickened economic processes everywhere ; it has turned Japan into a vortex of complicated strains . The old feudal control is weakening . The munition business has made many new millionaires . And the cost of rice has gone up . There is immense strain in the conflict between the immemorial customs of the coolies and the desperate new efforts to which they are spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice riots in Japan . That all these internal strains and new adjustments will cause some change in foreign policy is probable , but it would take a very bold prophet to forecast its effect on Japan 's relations to us . Mr. Rara 's plebeian Cabinet may be less subservient to the General Staff , less hungry for military glory , but it may well be more industrially minded , more influenced by commercial greed . It may prove only a change from the frying-pan of militarism to the fire of capitalistic imperialism . This old world of ours has suffered as much from one as from the other . But of one thing we may be sure . This new mercantile element , which has control , will be more intent than ever on securing access to raw material for the factories . They are face to face with Japan 's labor problem ? the feeding of the masses . Another thing is sure . The attitude of America is more important to Japan than ever before . No other country has watched our military development more intently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese jingoes have not been original . Their program was " made in Germany , " based on the theory of the Grosse Generalstab that a nation of shopkeepers would not fight . They did not propose to conquer the United States , but to grab a coast town , now and then , and hold it for ransom . Easy wealth had sapped our vitality , robbed us of " honor , " and we would pay tribute rather than fight . We have not won any love from the Japanese by our war record , but we have gained a new respect . We have silenced those of our enemies who used to preach that war with us would be easy and profitable . Now that Russia and Germany are impotent and the other nations exhausted , America is the only country to stand in the way of Japanese ambitious . They are giving us a great deal of thought . The new element , under the leadership of Tiara , want " to do business . " They need many American products and want to sell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia and we have always resisted their expansion in China . They are a hard-headed people . Our co-operation would be very valuable , our enmity dangerous . If theycould come to terms with us , their future would be more hopeful . There has been much talk of late of a new " American orientation " in foreign policy . Britain was the first Christian nation to recognize the political equality of Japan . Since she introduced the Japanese to the circle of the Great Powers by the Alliance of 190e , her Embassy has been the center of diplomatic gravity at Fold ? . The only serious rival of the British ambassador was the representative of the Kaiser . Strongly reinforced by the friendship of Japanese officers , who in the military academies of Prussia had learned a great reverence for " Eisen and Blut , " supported by the business enterprise of his countrymen , who were subsidized to underbid their English competitors , the German ambassador grew more and more important . From 1914 to 1917 the struggle tween the British and German influence , in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , but the many friends of Germany ? some in high governmental position continued active . Their principal attack was on the hitherto sacrosant " Anglo-Japanese Treaty " was it worth renewing ? What could England do for Japan , compared to the services Japan was expected to render ? Newspapers which had previously raged at American race prejudice began to turn their attention to similar " incidents " in the British Empire . Speeches by Mr. Hughes of Australia on the " Yellow Peril " ? quite as insulting as the senatorial output ? were featured . Hindu revolutionists were allowed to air their grievances in public . In the long , indecisive first years of the war it was inevitable that the British prestige should suffer . The facts seemed to fit the theory of Berlin that a loosely organized mercantile democracy could not fight . This theory was very congenial to the junkers of Japan . After the collapse of Russia , most educated Japanese decided ? sorrowfully or gladly ? that Germany had won , and that their alliance with Britain bad been bad policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also were mercantile and democratic . But the news from America was always in direct contradiction to the German theory . The telegrams about our military preparations through 1917 were discounted as bluff , But the news of Chilteali-Thierry and St.-Mihiel could not be ignored . Our friends in Japan began to talk louder and louder of an " American orientation . " As the tide began to turn against Germany we fortunately had in Tokio an ambassador worthy of the post . Mr. Morris 's position was immensely strengthened by the bulletins from the front , but even before things began to look so hopeful he had achieved a brilliant result in the matter of ship-building . The efforts of the British ambassador to get the Japanese to build ships for the Entente had failed . They did not have enough steel to keep their own fleet in repair . They were reluctant to use their scanty raw material for the benefit of others . But our embargo was already making itself felt . Unless we relaxed it on their behalf , their commerce would he strangled . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to them : " How much steel do you need to round out your own building program ? First of all , we 'll meet your requirements and then we 'll see what you can do for us . " It was a very successful policy . Instead of forcing the Japanese to turn over their insufficient mercantile marine , as they had feared , he gave them the chance to attend to their own business and offered them a profitable enterprise besides . For the first time the Japanese shipyards began to work at full capacity . Also , it was a very sharp object-lesson in commercial geography . The British might have liked to deal with them equally generously , but they did not have the spare steel and could not deliver such help if they had had it . The diplomatic center of gravity in Tokio began to swing to our Embassy . It was humanly inevitable that the British diplomats iu the Far East should suffer keenly from this loss of prestige , resent the rise of our influence , and strive to regain their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away and the diplomatic jousts of Tokio very near and much out of proportion . " What 's the use of this tremendous effort to defeat Germany , " some FarEastern Britishers said , " if the only resuit is to put the Yankees on top ? " A close analogy is offered by the British reaction to our ship-building program . They were as near unanimous as a nation could be in wanting us to build ships with all the speed we could muster . But English shipping interests were less enthusiastic . " What 's the use , " they said , " in driving the Germans from the seas , if n11 it means is a new and more dangerous rival across the Atlantic ? " What the attitude of the Cabinet in London was toward the developments in the Far East we shall not know till the day of " Memoires " arrives . They were probably too busy at home to give much attention to the diplomatic intrigues of Tokio . But when the Japanese government refused the suggestion of isolated action in Siberia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resentment of the British officials in the Far East toward our growing influence was obvious . In order to regain their lost prestige , in order to revivify the alliance , which was becoming moribund , there was an obvious , if shabby , policy for such British diplomats . They must show the Japanese that Britain would help them realize their ambitions , while America would surely oppose . They must arrange " incidents " where they could pose as loyal friends of Japan , supporting her in the face of American hostility . At times they encouraged annexationist appetites in Siberia , at times in China . They were not scrupulous about what they suggested , so long as it set the stage for their little comedy of St. George rescuing the Japanese maiden from the Yankee dragon . There was an equally obvious play for the Japanese Imperialists ? military and commercial . If Britain and America were at odds , neither could coerce Japan ; but if we united on a Far Eastern program , they would have to submit . The more sand they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the Japanese junkers proceeded to stake out claims . They filled Eastern Siberia with troops , doubled their garrisons in Manchuria , and bribed and bullied Peking into accepting the infamous " Twenty-one Demands . " They did not hope to bring home all this loot . But it is the classic technique of European diplomacy to ask for more than you expect , to get . Sometimes the Japanese outstrip their teachers ? in such guile . But it is hard to be indignant about it ? they are so unoriginal , they play their cards so precisely " according to Hoyle . " In this case the amount of the spoils they could keep obviously depended on the degree of unity with which Washington and London viewed the venture . The more distrust and enmity they could engender between the two Englishspeaking nations the more they could hope to cash in . This , of course , was a policy of extremists . The majority of Englishmen would have repudiated these disloyal intrigues of their representatives . In fact , some of them , out in the Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of outspoken opposition in Japan to the exaggerated pretensions of their annexationists . But there were many of these extremists on both sides . From British sources there was a constant stream of gossip about Japanese duplicity , and Japanese " friends " were continually arriving with tittle-tattle about the sinister anti-American game of the British . In Tokio , our State Department is faced by a bizarre triangle . It is a threeparty affair . British diplomacy is jealous of American-Japanese co-operation , andthe Tories of Tokio have everything to gain by making trouble between Washington and London . The development of the Anglo-French Entente gives comforting assurance that war is not the only way to liquidate such " issues " as now stand in the way of an , accord with Japan . When Colonel Kitchener peremptorily ordered Colonel Marchand to haul down the French flag at Fashoda , those two countries were very much nearer war than we have ever been with Japan . There was a tremendous upflare of hostility . But common sense overtook the two governments long befote it quieted the passions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mipistcrs in Paris decided that war would be foolish and set themselves to a give-and-take reduction of the causes of friction . There were numerous dangerous issues at stake ; the most important was the rivalry in North Africa . Britain . wanted , a " free hand " in Egypt ; France had a " manifest destiny " in Morocco . Each party had to pay for what it wanted . France sacrificed the " legitimate interests " of her ciLizeus in Egypt and Britain withdrew support from her nationals in Morocco . The diplomats shook hands and a new era of cordiality between the two governments began . But popular clamor did not die down for years . In London a " Morocco Society " was formed by merchants who suffered from the new policy , by chronic French-haters , by politicians who wished to embarrass the government . A corresponding Cornite sprang up in Paris to protest against the betrayal of French interests in Egypt . They both kept up a bitter propaganda against the Entente until the outbreak of war in 1914 . " Incidents " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circle where conflicting interests clash . " Accords " are achieved by statesmanship at the center of the circle . The French and British residents of North Africa hated one another cordially , partly from memories of Agincourt , partly from trade rivalry . If their advice had been listened to ? the famous " advice of the man on the spot , " " who knows the real facts " ? the Entente would never have been signed . So , in our relations with Japan , there is every prospect of long-continued and unpleasant " incidents " out on the periphery . In the Far East our traders and diplomats meet in rivalry . The bases of an understanding will not be discovered by competing Japanese and American merchants in Siberia and China . The student of diplomacy will be more interested in the developments at the center of the circle . The " Lansing-fshii Agreement " shows that an effort is being made to reach an accord . It is quite possible that this beginning may in spite of the jingoes in both countries ? develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . But this is dependent on our attitude toward Japan 's policy of expansion . The destinies of nations are not decided on precise dates . Definite decisions , clearcut crises , are the rarest things in history . But ten years hence we will probably he able to look back on the decade following the Great War and tell how a policy ? gradually and with many hesitations ? took shape . The oscillations of discord will he damped to a point manageable and insignificant , or the vibrations will increase in violence till the structure of peace is wrecked . No one in America wants war . Most of us want a real friendship with Japan , but some of us would like the spoils of war , without fighting for them . This is the dangerous element on our side of the problem . If a desire for unfair commercial advantages determines our policy , we can not hope for decent relations . Japan may be too weak to fight us . Like the government of Bogota , her fear of our strength may overshadow her hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than war . If we want friendship we must not use pious phrases to cloak a commercial real-politik , which would strangle Japan . We must help her tofind some solution for her problems , which are very real and very pressing . We have come out officially for the Open Door in the Far East . We will insist ? and rightly ? that no door of commercial opportunity opened to others shall be closed to us . We must ? if we would be fair ? insist that no door open to us in China shall be closed on Japan . If we decide to enforce this rule both ways in China , it means a very real commercial advantage to Japan . We are far from this market , unfamiliar with its language and customs . We have many other markets to interest us . The Japanese will center their efforts in Asia . The Open Door means their commercial predominance in China . If we try to close the door on the Japanese there , because it profits them more than us , if our policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in the argument . If we veto projects of theirs in China , which are similar to those we launch there and elsewhere , we shall be the veriest hypocrites However , American opposition to some of Japan 's ambitions does not have rise in commercial motives . Very few of us have mercantile interests in Siberia , but we are opposed to Japanese annexations there . There is very general protest among us , based on more respectable motives than greed , against some of the " Twenty-one Demands . " It is too much like stealing pennies from a child . The best excuse which the authors of these demands have yet offered is that they did not expect to get all they asked for . It is a weak excuse . The moderation they now profess seems too closely associated with the storm of protest their proposed brigandage has raised . It is not jealousy of financial profit which stirs us in this matter , but simple sympathy for the victims that Japan has bullied . It is just as important for us to be fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to make our stand . We had better remobilize and go to war at once , rather than acquiesce in such despoiling of China . But Japan does not intend to insist on all of these demands ? now that public attention has been called to them . And some on the list are not at all shocking , according to the accepted standard of international morality . What rule shall we use in judging Japanese expansion ? Our unrealized ideals of perfection ? Or accustomed practice ? A gentleman tries to observe a higher standard himself than he demands of others . The " accustomed practice " ought not to satisfy us in our own enterprises , but we can hardly expect a higher morality from others . A thoroughgoing reformer , wishing to arrange a perfect world , could not be content with a mere change in human nature . He would have to undertake geographical and geological reforms . There will be no perfect justice so Jong as some people are congested in barren districts and others are " chosen " to monopolize the lands flowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel ? to take an unnecessarily ancient , but still potent , precedent ? respect the " political sovereignty and territorial integrity " of Philistia ? They might have stayed in the desert . Nature has been " unjust " to the Japanese . And the monotony of their increasing hunger is not , relieved by any miraculous showers of manna . We might somewhat right this natural wrong by sharing our plenty with them . We might encourage them to find an outlet from their misery in the undeveloped regions under our control . Until we do , we can not in the name of Justice ? ask them to develop perfection and consent to starve in pious peace . We have refused to recognize their " racial equality " and so can not expect moral superiority . We could greatly relieve the pressure on China if we were unselfishly willing to allow Japan to expand in our direction , to our detriment . But this is hardly " practical politics . " Unless we want to " smash " Japan , we must facilitate her commercial access to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between political and economic penetration . If the " Twenty-one Demands " were submitted to the Hague Tribunal , there would be unanimity in dividing most of them into one or the other category . A few of the demands lie too close to the dividing-line for unanimous decision . But it was for just such cases that arbitration was invented . Without any attempt to apply to Japan a rule we refuse to recognize when applied to us , we can insist on the fulfilment of her various pledges to respect the political sovereignty and territorial integrity of China . A. sound policy for us is to veto all of the demands which infringe on the political rights of China and so violate formal agreements with us . But such action is negative , and to be equitable requires positive support of the economic projects which are necessary to Japan 's industrial life , which are similar to those enjoyed by us and other nations in China and elsewhere . That such a policy has its dangers goes without saying . The Chinese have reason to " view with alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions wrung from weaker nations have generally been the prelude to political absorption . The French p ? netration paefique of Morocco , the British action in South Africa are classic examples . But in neither of these cases was there any outside control , any " organized major force " to see justice done . As the League of Nations develops this impartial overpowering force , it will find plenty of work ? not only as between China and Japan , but in a hundred other corners of the globe . If the League fails , China will not be the only weak nation left to the mercy of the strong . China refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles because she did not get all she wanted . The teeth and claws of her recently acquired " hereditary enemy " were not pulled . Japan was not punished for being stronger and better organized . But , in spite of her protest , China 's gains from the Peace Conference are considerable . Her distressing dialogue with Japan is over . While the Japanese have not promised to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by adhering to the Covenant of the League , pledged themselves to accept the standard which the Christian nations have evolved for their own guidance . And a very real step in advance was made at . Paris . The custom , which allowed the strong to define their own " rights " in relation to the weak , was outlawed . If the League gains strength , it will be impossible to " localize " such disputes , as Austria wished to do in her affair with Serbia . The more people concerned in any agreement , the better chance it has to live . We have a right to insist that Japan respect her pledges . But we have n't a leg to stand on , in any attempt to prevent the purely commercial expansion of the Japanese in China . Their Foreign Office knows a great deal more about our mercantile ventures in Central America than most of us do . We can not pretend to protect the Chinese from commercial exploitation by the Japanese , when we are unwilling or unable to protect our nearer neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not he conscious of making up our minds in this matter , but within a decade or so all the world will know that we , as a nation , have decided to befriend Japan or bully her . It is hard to conceive a middle course . To-day the browbeating would be rather easy . In every way we are so much the stronger . We could probably veto every one of Japan 's projects of expansion , by the mere threat of war . It would be wiser for her to submit andcontinue to starve ? until she could find allies . It would be difficult to enlist a corporal 's guard in America for a frank campaign to strangle Japan . With practical unanimity we want peace . Peace in Europe . Peace on our southern border . Peace on the Pacific . But it will take hard work , consistent effort ? eternal vigilance ? to realize the dream . The friendship of Japan is a necessary element . We , like all the world , are somewhat saddened by the Treaty of Versailles . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable assurance that everybody was as fine as we should like to have them ? as fine as we should like to be ourselves in our better moments . We have come down to earth , to a realization that an eloquent formulization of our new ideals of International Organization is not enough . Before we can get them generally accepted , we must patiently and persistently demonstrate them . We must bring our practice up to our professions . We must test every proposal we make by its application to ourselves . We can not win the friendship of Japan with words . We must deal justly with her . We must co-operate with her in working out plans for her national wellbeing which do not depend on the old method of brutal domination , which we want to see discarded ? on the kind of diplomacy , which she learned from the practice of Christendom . If we want Japan to be more considerate to her weaker neighbor than other nations have been ? or are ? we must give her active and cordial assistance . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean to deserve its attractive name .
