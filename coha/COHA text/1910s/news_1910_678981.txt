William F. Baker . Police Commissioner . Mayor Read the Play . There is still some doubt as to whether It was the Mayor ' or Commission-r L ; ker who started the crusade against the play . According to an individual close to the Mayor , his Honor 's attention was called to the play shortly after it opened ? two weeks 1-go . Thu Mayor , it is said , received many letters of complaint about the piece , and several persons , including representatives of two newspapers . called upon him and asked him to take action . The.Mayor , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectionable parts taken down . He also secured the manuscript of the play and went over it carefully . Then he wrote a letter to Commissioner Baker , advising him not to renew the license of the theatre . Commissioner Baker said yesterday that the letters of complaint and the protesting individuals came to him . He said he detailed four men to the theatre last Thursday night to take notes , and when he looked over the evidence Friday morning he sent a letter to Abraham L. Erlanger of Klaw &; Erlanger , managers of the theatre , stating that unless the play was withdrawn he would refuse to renew the theatre 's license . He gave Mr. Erlanger , he said , until Saturday night to have his demands complied with . and stated that under no condition would be allow a performance to be given after that date on pain of refusing to renew the license . Mr. Erlanger , the Commissioner said , replied that he would withdraw the play at once . He said he thought the matter would end there , but AI H. Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter so complacently . As soon as he found that the run of the play was to be interrupted he hurried to Commissioner Baker 's office with his lawyer , Henry J. Goldsmith , and put up a vigorous protest . He got little comfort from the Commissioner , however . In fact , the Commissioner frankly told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself for producing plays of such an objectionable nature . Woods Obtains Injunction . Monday afternoon Mr. Woods and his lawyer went to the City Hall and had a ccnference with Mayor Gaynor . The Mayor apparently gave him no more comfort than did the Police Commissioner . heaving the City Hall the producer and his lawyer went before Justice Whitney and ebtained an order directing Police Commissioner Baker , Inspector Walsh , and ' apt . Finelite of the Twenty-sixth Precinct to show legal cause why they should not be restrained from taking any step to stop the production of the play . " The Girl with the Whooping Cough , " and from trespassing upon the property of New York Theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court yesterday aft-ernoonWhen Lawyers Goldsmith and Mirabeau I .. Towns appeared before ' Justice McCall they produced an affidavit from Mr. Woods , in which he set forth that on May Commissioner Baker told him that he would not allow any further production of " The Girl with the Whooping Cough " in this city . He also asserted that Commissioner Baker told him that he would not listen to any argument , and that he would not go to see the play or send any one there . The Commissioner added , according to Woods , that he had received reports about the play , and that it was " rotten . " Woods also set forth that Commissioner Baker said : " . I will not allow that play to be produced in New York Further , I will also not allow it as long as Veleska Suratt takes the leading part I stopped her at Hammerstein 's and other places , and I will stop her here . I do not care what loss you sustain by reason of my actions ; that is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that play . " Justice McCall made the injunction restraining the police from interfering with tee play permanent so long as litigation concerning it continued . He pointed out , however , that he had no authority to compel the Police Commissioner to grant " the theatre license to the New York Theatre . Baker Refuses to Renew License . " A very fortunate state of affairs made it possible for me to reach this man Woods and force him to stop the very improper play , " said Police Commissioner Baker yesterday . " The license for all the theatres in the city expire at the end of each April . The law gives the Police Commissioner a great deal of power in regard to granting these licenses , and I used this as a club to get after Woods . I received many complaints about the ploy ftorn very reputable -- people , and I // MAYOR CUTS OFF AN INDECENT PLAY // determined to put a stop to it . Mr. Woods put up a very vigorous objection , of course , but I told him a few plain truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his , I asked him to name one , but he refused . " I heard that Mr. Woods intended to produce another as bad or worse , but he will probably think better of it now . I am sorry that the play has received this notoriety , but it apparently is what Mr. Woods is looking for . I thought ' he would quietly withdraw the thing Saturday night and let it go at that , but it appears he wanted to get all the advertising he could and secured this injunction . " Play Not Immoral , Says Woods . " There is something behind all this . " said Mr. Woods yesterday , " and I would like to know what it is . Commissioner Baker wrote me last week that the play would have to be withdrawn , and I went to see him on Friday , taking along the original manuscript as written by Stanislaus Stange . I asked the Commissioner to point out what was immoral in the play , and he replied that certain lines were risque and suggestive . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if he found anything objectionable he could arrest the players , the theatre managers , or myself . He said that that hasn't- necessary ; that he had - decided ? - - that the play was objectionable , and that was all there was to it . " In my opinion , there is absolutely nothing immoral in the play . Why c'oes n't the Commissioner proceed against other plays , or why did n't he stop ' The Girl With the Whooping Cough ' when It first opened ? Why does it take him two weeks to find out that it is immoral ? " I do not know whether I will produce the play at another New Yorw theatre or not . If I attempt to do so I suppose Commissioner Baker will hold up that theatre 's license . By not giving me two week 's notice I will lose about $6,000 , for I will have to pay my company their salaries for two weeks in advance . As I said before , there is some influence behind all this , and I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erlanger would not make any comment upon the matter yesterday . He hopes , it was satd , to get the license of the theatre renewed because of his prompt action ! n ordering Mr. Woods to discontinue the play wnen objection came from Commissioner Baker . Mayor Gaynor was asked if he intended to continue getting evidence against objectionable plays , either by reading the manuscripts or by sending stenographers to take down the lines as spoken by the players , and he replied that he would do so if conditions warranted it . ?
