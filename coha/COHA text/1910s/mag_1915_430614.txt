WHAT is an etching ? The word etching is often used with familiarity ; but how many who use it know how an etching is produced ? It will not do to reply , " I do n't know anything about etching ; but I know what I like . " A little elementary knowledge of processes is necessary for the proper appreciation of any art . The medium ? that is , the tools with which and the materials from which a work of art is made imposes its limits on the artist and its nature on the result . But within these limits , to be respected by the artist , lie also its possibilities , to be realized by him . The sculptor 's clay model will be differently attacked by him , according to the material ( bronze , marble , granite , terracotta ) in which it is to be reproduced . The painting in oil , in water color , in pastel , each has its characteristic appearance , based on the manner of production . So also has etching its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts : from copper engraving , wood engraving , or lithography . Each medium has its proper field of expression , within which lies its charm and its appeal .  | How then is an etching produced ? A copper plate is polished , covered with a thin coating of " etching ground " ( which may consist of white wax , gum mastic , and asphaltum ) , and the latter smoked over . On this " grounded " surface the artist draws with a steel point ( the " etching needle " ) , which lays bare the copper wherever it passes . The design thus stands out copper-colored from the smoked ground . The plate is then subjected to the action of acid , which eats into the copper wherever the needle bared it , and where it is therefore no longer protected by the etching ground . The remaining ground is then removed and the plate inked , the ink lodging in the lines of the design . The plate , with a sheet of paper laid on its inked surface , is placed on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its revolving rollers , the enormous pressure transferring the ink to the paper . That is the process , in bare outlines ,  - -  a process which for centuries has had its peculiar charm for the artist because it has enabled him to practise a so-called " painter " art , or autographic art , giving reproductions of designs that bear the full impress of his individuality , presented directly , in lines drawn by himself , without the intervention of a professional engraver . The light touch of the needle gives freedom in effect , which is added to by the irregular action - of the acid . " Is an etching a copy or an original ? " Since the work is dormant in the copper and comes to life only in the printed impression on paper , each such print is really an original , placing us in direct relation with the artist . The qualities and possibilities of etching have called forth production as wide and varied in j range as the difference in outlook between a Hollander of the sixteenth century and an American of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but also numerous minor ones well worth your notice ; also we have etchers with us today . Passing over earlier work , such as the landscapes of Altdorfer , or I iirer 's few plates , or the free and experimentative work of Hercules , hers , we come to Rembrandt , who looms with giant proportions . His -. nge was wide and his power of expression varied . We generally regard aching as an art of suggestion rather than of completeness of effect ; of indication , not elaboration . The line is a convention , a symbol ( there are no lines in nature ) , and Rembrandt used it so in his little sketch of " Six 's Bridge , " done when waiting at Burgomaster Six 's table for the girl who had run out to buy the missing mustard . Yet the same hand executed the well finished portrait of that same burgomaster , with delicate , soft shadows , in which the line is used simply as a means for producing tints . Rembrandt is best approached first through his noteworthy portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " leaning on a sill " and " drawing at a window , " the latter a particularly delightful presentation of personality , which meets our human sympathy . So does likewise his portrait of his mother , seated , beautiful in disclosure of character and technically interesting in the indication of texture of flesh and the various articles of dress . Then there are the portraits of Clement Jonghe ( pronounced by Whistler " without a flaw " ) , Bonus , Hareng , and others . It has been well said that Rembrandt 's portraits have dignity without pretension , where many modern ones have pretension without dignity . In a number of landscapes , done with a light , delicate touch , he pictured the Dutch lowlands , ? a few huts or trees in the foreground , from which the eye passes to the distance beyond , bathed in the slight haze of soft sea air . " They express the genius of the Dutch country , " says Binyon , " as no other of his countrymen has expressed it . " A noteworthy example is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , " The Three Trees " has dramatic intensity , a rich play of light and shade , that leads us naturally to religious figure pieces such as the famous " Christ Healing the Sick " ( the " Hundred-Guilder Piece " ) , which " em- bodies the whole range of human sympathy . " To one beginning the study of etchings there will be much in Rembrandt 's work which at first may seem uncouth . He may find architecture , or water , or nudes draw a with more apparent skill and ease by various moderns ; but Rembrandt 's is the supremacy of a big artistic personality , with its pervading and ennobling influences . The seventeenth century saw a number of etchers in the Lowlands . There were Ruysdael ( rois ' - dahl ) , Waterloo , Everdingen , Breenberg , reproducing landscape . Potter , Dujardin , and Berghem did cattle and sheep pieces . Ostade ( Os ' - tah- de ) described peasant life with good characterization and with fine craftsmanship . His pupil , Bega , ( bay ' - gah ) presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in mental accomplishment was depicted with admirable ease and refinement , and a graceful incisiveness , in portraits etched by Van Dyck , intended to be elaborated by engravers , " the most perfect models of portrait etching in existence , " says A. M. Hind . In England that industrious Bohemian , Wenzel Hollar , did many landscapes of quiet charm , and city scenes , with a technical skill which won praise from Haden . Some plates of muffs showed his ability in rendering textures . And in Italy the Tiepolos ( tee-ay ' - po- lo ) reflected in etching the principles and manner of their painting , while Canaletto ( cah-nah-let ' - to ) gave early expression to the modern enjoyment of  | architecture as a pictorial subject . Later , in the eighteenth century , the Italian Piranesi , in large , effective plates , disclosed the beauties of Roman architecture . And in Spain , yet later , Goya was doing his extraordinary " Caprices , " audacious satires , remarkably telling in their combination of vigorous line with the fiat tints of the aquatint process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - lo ) had depicted the " Miseries of War " with remarkable skill in arranging large groups of small figures . And Claude Lorrain etched landscapes , including Le Bouvier ( " The Cowherd " ) , a masterly , delicate rendering of the atmospheric effect of a warm evening . Of this last Hamerton said , " For technical quality of a certain delicate kind this is the finest landscape etching in the world . Its transparency and gradation have never been surpassed . The most wonderful passages are in the great masses of foliage . . The composition is very beautiful . " " Painter-etching " rather fell into disuse in the eighteenth century ; but about the middle of the nineteenth France witnessed a remarkable revival of the art . There stand out the views of Paris on which is based the fame of Charles Meryon . When Haussmann was making boulevards by sweeping away old landmarks this mad genius was perpetuating much of the old city in plates breathing the spirit of old streets and buildings and those who had lived there . The visitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meryon , in 1854 , saw his remarkable view of Notre Dame : little has really changed . He drew , too , one of the stone demons on the same building , a monster brooding over his " pasture , " Paris . Fame came to him after death . In bitter poverty and discouragement he destroyed some of his finest plates , and died in a madhouse . In complete contrast to the somber quality of Meryon stands the joyousness of Buhot . His lively fancy pictured the Paris of his time , ? the streets with holiday crowds , or a line of cabs on a rainy day . Different surroundings were presented , with " deep and sincere love of simple coun- try life , " by Charles Jacque . He showed the peasant at work , the shepherd tending his charges , the country boy courting his lass , the good wise doing the week 's wash , adding , says Wedmore , " to the truth that was Ostade 's the native grace that is French . " The peasant formed the subject also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different way . Simple and big in style , there is a classic spirit in these " diggers , " " gleaners , " " shepherdesses , " or that unforgetable picture of a man pushing a wheelbarrow through a doorway ,  - -  something that removes you from the mere ordinary acts depicted to a larger view of life . Of that period also was Lalanne , easy , graceful , a master technician ; and Appian , different again in style , but a delight to the student ; the famous painters of the Fontainebleau-Barbizon group etched ( Rousseau , Corot , and Daubigny ) ; the delicately executed little etchings by Veyrassat , in which horses usually figured , may be contrasted with the larger and more vigorously delineated bird pieces by Bracquemond , particularly his delightful ducks , which remind the beholder of W. J. Locke 's " Septimus , " who went to the waterside to see the ducks waggle their tails . Bracquemond executed also a number of " reproductive etchings , " ? etchings in which another artist 's painting or other work of art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The production of such etchings was extensively carried on by Rajon , Flameng , Waltner , Le Rat , Koepping , Unger , Chauvel . One etcher made a specialty of still-life subjects , ? Jacquemart , who gave richness and life to glass , jade , pottery , and similar objects , with " a personal , almost a creative , vision . " A remarkable artistic personality was Alphonse Legros ( le-gro ' ) , a " belated old master , " whose seriousness of purpose underlaid variety in treatment and effect . He presented , with deep insight and somber power , factors of life and death , as in " Death of the Vagabond , " or " Death and the Wood-Cutter . " Different mood and style appear in his delicate , silvery brookside effects of early spring morning . And in his portraits of Cardinal Manning and others seriousness and dignity are joined to exquisite refinement . Legros settled in England ,  | where Strang and Holroyd are his most noted followers . It was Great Britain too ? where J. M. W. Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liber Studiorum " ? that produced one of the greatest etchers , Sir Francis Seymour Haden . Marked by strength and delicacy , robustness and pliancy , his work forms a shining example of the adaptation of a given medium to a given individuality , a quality which forms the very basis of all good art . The calm , classic beauty of his " Shere Mill Pond " caused Hamerton to pronounce it the finest landscape etching except Claude Lorrain 's " Le Bouvier . " " Egham " and " Egham Lock " show delightfully sure , simple treatment of still water . " Sawley Abbey " or " By Inverness " are executed in firm , sharp lines ; while in " Towing Path " and " Sunset in Ireland " a happy freedom of manner is expressed by the juicy richness of dry-point . ( In " dry-point " work the lines , instead of being etched by acid , are scratched into the copper with the " needle , " which throws up a ridge of copper . The latter , in printing , produces " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haden 's change of manner in various plates implies judicious choice of method to suit a particular subject or different moods . Nearly all his plates  | are views of intimate aspects of England . His art glorified the homeland scenes which inspired its finest fruits . This love of the native soil , and the emotions which it arouses , is an important element in art . Haden'sbrotherin-law , James Whistler , American by birth , English by residence , did his first etchings in France , ? plates of the quiet richness of " The Kitchen , " closey shaded ; masterly , picturesque portraits of Drouet ( droo-ay ' ) and others ; graceful child types such as " Bibi Lalouette . " Here may be mentioned also his " Engraver , " a beautiful example of " dry-point . " In England he still retained a certain finished precision , as in the " Black Lion Wharf . " But in his later , Venice , subjects the needle goes flicking over the plate in a graceful , airy spirit of condensed suggestion . " Riva No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others illustrate the importance of knowing not only what to put in but what to leave out . And they bear witness also to the effectiveness of the unfilled space ? say , the sky ? left white and serving its purpose . The line is supreme . pushed here to its farthest limits as a convention . Moreover , in " Nocturne ? Salute " a mere framework of lines serves to hold together a tone produced by a film of ink left on the surface of the plate , ? an interesting example of the importance of the printer .  | Joseph Pennell , ( pen ' - el ) , also an English resident of American birth , with an eye for the picturesque and remarkable sureness in drawing , has found subjects in various quarters of the globe , and occasionally returns to us to present skyscrapers of New York or industrial establishments of Pittsburg , or other prominent features of our larger cities . Today the active interest in etching is everywhere evident . In the United States , C. H.White , C. Washburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner , H. A. Webster , D. S. MacLaughlan , E. D. Roth , L. G. Hornby , George C. Aid , and others are finding subjects , some abroad , some in their home land , in their practice of the art . And we have to note here also the plates produced during and after the ' 8o 's of the last century , by J. D. Smillie , C. A. Platt , S. Parrish , Duveneck , Bacher , Mrs. M. N. Moran , Manley , Vanderhoof , and C. F. W. Mielatz ( who has well explored the artistic possibilities of New York City ) . France has Lepere ( with a breadth of outlook and avigor that gives him the aspect of an old master ) , Bejot ( who sings the praise of Paris ) , Beurdeley , Leheutre , Helleu ( with his " snapshots at the grace of women " ) , Pissarro , Raffaelli , and our countrywoman , Mary Cassatt , whose " dry-points " show a remarkable understanding of child nature and motherhood , expressed with noteworthy economy of tine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Y. Cameron , Muirhead Bone ,  | Sir Frank Short , Fitton , and McBey ; in Germany , Liebermann , Klinger , Kollwitz , Geiger ; in Austria-Hungary , T. F. Simon , L. Kasimir , L. Michalik ; in the Netherlands , Storm van 's Gravesande , Witsen , Bauer , Veth ; in Sweden , Anders Zorn , an artist of nonchalant certainty , who has executed some remarkable nude studies , ? and so on . The names listed here represent only a few of the etchers active today . Of course so widespread a movement will not be free from weak effort ; but work will live only when the artist has had something worth while to say , when there is a personal force behind the exercise of technic . Etching has a charm all its own . It is an art of indication rather than of elaboration . Whistler showed how much could be said with few lines , ? an art indeed supple and expressive . Ours is the privilege to see and appreciate etchings . Opportunities there are , ? print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chicago , Buffalo , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Brooklyn , Worcester ( Mass. ) , and elsewhere , print dealers ' exhibitions in various cities , and traveling exhibits . And one may study reproductions of notable examples of etching in the books listed under " Supplementary Reading , " as well as in others . All writing on etching is as a signpost . The main thing is to see much , and to see thoughtfully . The charm of the print is there , for us to cultivate and to enjoy .  |
