txt Secretary denies the report , made as by authority from Washington , that the Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank had advised that the next loan by the United States should be at the rate of 4% per cent . The amount was put at eight billions , and the date of issue March 15 next . It is no secret that there must be another loan , but the amount and the rate of interest are open subjects which it is profitable to discuss before decision . The needs of the war and the Treasury must be served , but there are other interests to be considered . The increase of the rate by onehalf of 1 per cent . would apply also to previous loans which are - convertible . Such an increase of interest is no small matter , even in these days of large figures . The experience in England has been the same as here , that loans could be placed at lower , rates of interest than strict money market calculations would indicate . Secretary himself has favored such moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% per cent , report . The discount . on the 4 per cent . issue is not an argument , for the discount would disappear if the money market altered . The attempt to peg Federal bonds at par is a barren ideal , and as impossible of realization as it is to peg the money market at any rate . It is the merit of the money market that it is the expression of factors beyond control , and which can be discounted only at a risk too great to be taken by those whose duty it is to deal with present facts . No one could say now what would be the right rate next March , but it is easy to say on what principle the rate should be fixed . It should be the rate at which the country would take the loan , and according to which the country had already appraised all outstanding securities in their relation to each other and to Government credit If the Treasury should fix the rate so high as to disturb theserelations , , it would inflict losses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be avoided at any cost except failure to find funds for the war . The 4% per cent . rate is so far above the savings bank rate that depositors would be tempted to withdraw their money for investment . The banks might be compelled to raise their mortgage rate , or to call mortgage loans . Uncounted billions of securities would be %depressed by those seeking funds to take up such a bargain as the Treasury denies the intention of offering . We have experienced this once , and should be warned . No Government but ours undertakes to base its finance on a rate of interest calculated solely on par value . All other Governments calculate their rate of interest on the rate of ? yield on a security below par . The reason Is clear : If the rate alone is subject to Variation , the change in rate . must be by fractions of the rate itself . An increase from 4 per cent . could only be by one-Quarter or one-half on many . billions . But if the rate were reekoned by discount on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 1 per cent. , and the variations could be ' slight . It might be better finance to float att other load at the realised discount on the outstanding 4s than to raise the rate . It would disturb other values less , and would be a better reflection of the money market . That is the manner in which the war savings stamps are issued . ' They are issued below par , discounted like a note , and nobody has suggested that there is any reproach in that . Their approach to par is one of the recapmendatIons for saving them . That principle would work on a larger scale . It would work better for those accustomed to hundreds , thousands , and millions than those accustomed to dimes and dollars . There must be legislation before there can be a change of rate or method , but the discussion need not be merely whether the next loan should be 4 per cent . or 4%.
