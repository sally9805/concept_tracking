K. Harris . $2 . The assertion of an eminent Frenchman that " musicians do not love masterworks " is borne out particularly by the average song recital programme . Robert Franz , in a letter to Mr. Apthorp , referred to " the boundless vanity of professional singers , " adding that " these gentry never care for the thing itself , but only for their own personal success . " The historian Ambros commented on the custom of concert singers of searching the volumes of songs for those ending with loud high notes , which , like the old Roman vos plan rate , are an appeal for applause . Adding to these traits the natural indolence of most vocalists , which made Liszt remark sarcastically that it would be too much to ask them to enlarge their repertory by learning new songs , we can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liszt himself was one of those who suffered most from such neglect . In his case there was a further impediment in the difficulty and expressiveness of his piano parts , which made it necessary , in order to obtain the best results , to have a player of the same rank as the singer . And thus it has come about that of his sixty or more lseder only half a dozen have been adopted by professional singers . In this centenary year it may perhaps be hoped that some , at any rate , of the singers will take the trouble to bring forward a few of his neglected master-songs . They will find a good selection of them in the volume just issued by the Ditson Co The editor , Mr. Armbruster , may be commended for the choice he has made , also for the footnotes to many of the songs , which will aid both singer and pianist in matters of expression . The introductory pages are concerned mostly with a sketch of Liszt 's career . Of eleven columns , only two are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable or discriminating . We read that Liszt 's " Hungarian descent and French education prevented him from - quite becoming a German . " As a matter of fact , it is in his songs that the cosmopolitan Liszt is peculiarly German . Goethe , Heine , and Schiller are the poets most favored by him , and in his settings of their songs , he is like the best Teuton composers in depth of feeling , spontaneity , tenderness , and dreamy pathos . Mr. Armbruster is particularly impressed in these songs with their composer 's " Titan-like command of musical expression . " Liszt , he adds , " has produced gems , the charm of which is absolutely irresistible to an unprejudiced hearer " The bibliography is far from complete . In particular , it is surprising that under the head of Essays and Sketches , the only two volumes in the English language that have special chapters on Liszt 's songs are not mentioned One is " Songs and Song Writers " ; the ' other , Hueffer 's " Wagner and the Music of the Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain it at recitals knew little of Russian songs , excepting those of Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky . A few months ago , Breitkopf &; Hh , rtel issued a collection of nineteen , seven of which are by Moussorgsky , the others by Richmaninov . To this the Schirmers have now added a clearly printed and beautifully bound collection of fifty , by a dozen Russians . The list includes , besides the two just mentioned , Glinka , Dargomijsky , Rubinstein , Borodine , Cui , Balakirev , Rimsky-Korsakov , Arensky , Glazunov , Tchaikovsky . In making his selections , Mr. Schindler was guided , as he admits , not so much by the beauty of the songs or by his personal preferences , as by the desire to place before the English-speaking public those songs that are " the most direct expression of the Russian national character . " Years ago we expressed the opinion that Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky differed from other Russian composers , in having real creative genius , especially from the melodic point of view . A perusal of this volume of songs does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the six by Rubinstein and the six by Tchaikovsky , although they are not the best written by those composers . How Mr. Schindler can call Moussorgsky " Russia 's greatest musician " is incomprehensible His opera " Boris Godounov " we have not yet heard ( it is to be produced this season at the Metropolitan ) , but in his songs he certainly does not reveal the divine faculty of creating new melodic ideas . Rosa Newmarch , whose articles on the Russian composers in the new edition of Grove are the best by far ever written on them , says that , " had the realistic schools of painting and fiction never come into being , we might still reconstruct from Moussorgsky 's songs the whole psychology of Russian life . " That may be true ; Mr. Schindler in his preface gives some very interesting details corroborating that assertion , and from this point of view , in particular , the songs of all these Russians are worthy of attention . But , after all , psychology , poetic realism , sympathy with peasants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purely musical point of view Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky remain , even if they are not " nationalists , " Russia 's greatest composers . Melodically the songs of the other ten Russians in this ' collection are of interest when they copy or recall the folk music of their country . Not a few Russian songs , notably Rubinstein 's , are colored by quaintly fascinating Oriental melodic intervals . This , as a matter of course , is true also of the " Jewish Folk Songs " issued by Platen Brounoff . Mr. Brounoff is musically a descendant of Rubinstein , whom he also strikingly resembles in appearance . He has composed works that are superior to most of the novelties produced in our concert halls and which some day will be produced there . His collection of Jewish songs appeals not only to those of his race but to all lovers of good music . They are the best of about 250 he has written down after hearing them sung by Hebrews who have preserved the traditions . Possibly some were borrowed by them  --  it is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinction between Semitic traits in music and Oriental coloring in general ; but the main thing is that these Jewish songs have melodic charm and that Mr. Brounoff has set them to piano parts that are not only musicianly , but preserve and emphasize their spirit . A new biography of Richard Strauss will soon be published in Berlin by Schuster &; Loeffler . It will have sixty portraits of the composer , and analyses of his compositions , including eighty that have never been published . The lately discovered Beethoven symphony will shortly be publiShed by Breitkopf &; Hertel . That it is a juvenile work by the great symplionist , Prof Fritz Stein of Jena gives good reasons to believe in a fortys , , - page brochure , entitled " Eine Jugendsymphonic Beethoven ? " New operas , in the days of Grau and Con-med. , were usually produced near the end of the season , as it was taken for granted that they would not be given more than two or three times The lesson taught by Oscai Hammerstein , and recent experiences at the Metropolitan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Konigskinder " and Puccini 's " Girl of the Golden West , " led in the number of performances , have changed all that . This year not only are these two operas in the first week 's repertory , but an actual novelty . " Lobetanz , " is to be produced on Saturday afternoon . The $10,000 Prize-opera " Mona , " by Professor Parker , has been postponed until January , owing to the temporary absence of the prima donna who is to create the principal role In the meantime we'are to hear one or more of several other novelties promised , probably Moussorgsky 's " Boris Godounov " and Wolf-Ferrari 's " Le Donne Curiose . " Whether Franchetti 's l'Cristoforo Colombo , " Goldmark 's " Cricket on the Hearth , " ' and Nevin 's " Twilight " also will be staged remains to be seen . Among the'revivals promised it is pleasant to see Mozart 's " Don Giovanni , " Boito 's " Mefistofele , " and Rossini 's " William Tell . " The list of singers is as strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenors , and baritones are concerned . Why great contraltos and basses are so scarce no one can explain . Among this Year 's newcomers the most noted are Luisa Tetrazzini ( not heretofore a regular member of the company ) , the famous Munich contralto , Margarete Matzenauer , who won a great success as Amneris in " Aida " on Monday , and two other Germans , both of them Wagner specialists , the tenor Heinrich Hensel and the baritone Herman Weil . Lillian Nordica 's appearances with the Philharmonic Orchestra will be on November 27 , 28 , 29 . Her Western tour , which began on September 28 , has been a series of triumphs From February 5 to 17 she will sing at the Boston Opera House with the Symphony Orchestra in German roles , It was due to her that the noted conductor .

No opera holds its own better than Gounod 's " Faust " Recently it had its 1,400th performance in Paris Yet , when it was first produced , in 1859 , it was not a success The Critics condemned it alnoist unreservedly , and nobody seemed to believe in the opera 's future . The composer actually experienced difficulty in finding a publisher . One , however , more discriminating than the rest , by name Choudens , bought the opera for 8,000 francs , and in so doing laid the foundations of a great business When Frederick Gye heard " Faust " in Paris he confidently asserted that it contained only two really good numbers , the " Soldiers ' Chorus " being one of them Nor did Tom Chappell form a much higher opinion of the music , but , as a speculation , undertook to pay ? 160 for the English performing rights .

Edmund Schuecker , the harpist , known both in this country and Europe , died a week ago in Kreuznach , Germany He was the harpist for the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1910 , and in 1888 he received the title of " court harpist " from the Grand Duke Ernest of Saxony .

The considerable difference between these four St Zenobius panels and the mystical Nativity ( dated 1500 ) in the National Gallery is due to the fact that the Nativity is painted on , canvas and is a nocturne Such minor but desirable accessions as a Mars and Venus by Sodoma and a cassone front by Matteo da Siena attest an intelligent activity with which the press endeavors in vain to cope J.

There are many half-tone illustrations , and R. T Haines Halsey , the well-known authority on Colonial antiquities , has contributed valuable notes on the early New York silversmiths . Apart from their immediate purpose , these notes have interesting and varied historical and personal bearings Thus the catalogue is a model of its kind , being not merely a guide , but also a permanent contribution to the study of the subject We may add that the plate of the Middle States has not the uniformly English quality of New England silver , Dutch and even Swedish makers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawings , and paintings at the galleries of the Berlin Photographic Company is of quite exceptional interest and significance In every class of design this young English artist shows an unflinching energy of draughtsmanship .

In this brief notice it is impossible to praise aright Mr Rothenstein 's recent pencil sketches of Indian types The expression is of amazing terseness Only a great draughtsman can imply so much as to mass and character with means so sparse Often a generation or two passes without producing work of such tonic excellence .

Howard Pyle died in Florence a week ago of heart failure . He was born in Wilmington , Del , in 1853 , and after leaving preparatory school turned to the study of art , three years being spent in Philadelphia Partially discouraged , he went into business , but was soon reclaimed for the career of his choice by the success attending his early drawings in the magazines . He has described in an amusing fashion how his first assignment in illustration , a picture called Wreck in the Offing , brought him steady employment and set him shortly afterward in the way of making friends of such men , then working in New York , as the late Edwin Abbey , Reinhart , A B Frost , Chase , Dielman , and Duveneck , the latter members of the group having lately returned from Europe He declined an opportunity which came to him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held pronounced views as to the disadvantages of foreign training and associations In this respect his ideas approached those of the late Frederic Remington . Howard Pyle did his most important work in periodical illustration He had no patience with the attitude of distaste which illustrators of the higher rank too often assume toward their work designed for reproduction He liked to draw for the accompaniment of text , and did much to dignify the practice He felt that modern reproductive processes had freed the illustrator from former hindrances by allowing him the widest latitude in his manner of work No doubt the results he has given us bear him out in this point so far as work in line or in black and white is concerned But as yet reproduction in colors has left some qualities to be desired . It is worth while to recall this , because he must have recognized it himself His plates , rich and often gorgeous in color as they were , pictorial it intent and spirited in movement , show ed the hand that was acquainted with the shortcomings as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own text , have taken a place of their own . And the Buccaneers of the Spanish Main rise to thought at the mention of his name It is a pity that we have not more of his mural work , such as the recent decorations in the Essex County Court House and elsewhere . In the work of younger painters he took an unusually gracious ' interest , and at Wilmington-gathered about him a little band of associates and pupils without ever maintaining an outright school . He threw his Influence against dependence on earlier schools of art in the wider sense of the term . He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters , and became a " full member of the National Academy in 1907 His principal publications are : " The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood , " " Pepper and Salt , " " Within the Capes , " " The Wonder Clock , " " The Rose of Paradise , " " Otto of the Silver Hand , " " A Modern Aladdin , " " Men of Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twilight Land , " " The Garden Behind the Moon , " " Semper Idem , " " Rejected of Men , " " The Story of King Arthur and His Knights , " " The Story of the Champions of the Round Table , " " The Story of Launcelot and His Companions , " and " Stolen Treasure .
