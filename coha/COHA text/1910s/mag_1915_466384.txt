O do the impossible , again and again to do the impossible ; always to do it with unexpeetedness and simplicity ; always to go from a small beginning to a noble end ; always , in fact , to accomplish results ? great results , important results , impressive results ? it is because of his doing all this I call Russell Conwell the Great Accomplisher . And in accomplishing , he also inspires . That , indeed , is the finest feature of his work . For he not only is successful himself , but is the cause of success in countless others . And in his varied life , in the surprises of his career , in the marvelousness of his achievements , there has been the constant touch of the dramatic , the fine , free relish of romance . Russell Conwell is the founder and head of a university that has already numbered tens of thousands of students . He is the active head of a great church that he raised from nothingness . He is the head of two great hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Sunday . He lectures scores of times every year , traveling for these lectures thousands of miles annually . As minister and lecturer he has personally addressed more than thirteen millions of people . One single lecture he has delivered more than five thousand times . He makes great sums of money , but not for himself . It goes into his work or into private helpfulness . That he is a minister indicates but one side of a many-sided nature , for he did not enter the ministry until he was almost forty years old . Before that he had successfully been school-teacher , book-agent , author , newspaper correspondent , lawyer , and in the Civil War he had risen to a colonelcy . Born in a region of rocky hills and beauty , his nature shows the rare combination of rockbound determinationwith lovable beauty of spirit . He was born in February of 1843 , in a low-roofed cottage in the eastern Berkshires of Massachusetts . " I was born in this room ? it was bedroom and kitchen ? it was poverty , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old fireplace , and his voice sank , with a sort of grimness , into silence , as memories of the long-past years came back . His father was a friend of John Brown , and as a boy Conwell came to love that stern enthusiast , who could turn from thoughts of slavery to the training of the old horse of the Conwells to trot demure . ly home , unattended , after carrying Russell and his brother to the little school a mile or more away , and to return demurely , unattended , when taken out into the road and faced in the right direction , to meet the two boys when school was over . Russell Conwell works sixteen hours every day . He has worked sixteen hours a day since that long-past time of the Civil War . And that this is so is owing to a deed of romantic devotion which so influenced him that he himself considers it the real beginning of his life . In his home , in Philadelphia , at the head of his bed , hangs a sword ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the event that mean so much to him ; and he told me the story as we stood together before the sword , told it with quiet repression but with depth of feeling , seeing it all and living it all just as vividly as if it had occurred but yesterday . " A boy up there in the Berkshires , a neighbor 's son , John Ring ? I call him a boy , for we all called him a boy , and we looked upon him as a boy , for he was undersized and underdeveloped , so much so that he could not enlist ? for some reason was devoted to me , and he not only wanted to enlist , but he also wanted to be in the artillery company of which I was captain ; but I could only take him along as my servant . I did n't want a servant , but it was the only way to take poor little Johnnie Ring . " Johnnie was deeply religious and would read the Bible every evening before turning in . In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh at Ring , and after a while he took to reading the Bible outside the tent on account of my laughing at him . " This sword was an object of absolute devotion to him . It had been given to me by the hill boys , to go to war with as their captain . To Ring it represented not only myself , but all the glory and pomp of war . " One day the Confederate soldiers suddenly stormed our position near New Berne and swept through the camp , driving our entire force before them ; and all , including my company , hurried across the river , setting fire to a long wooden bridge in the retreat . It blazed up furiously , making a barrier that the Confederates could not pass . " But unknown to everybody , and unnoticed , John Ring had dashed back to my tent , seized the sword that had long been so precious to him , dodged here and there , and actually managed to gain the blazing bridge . Next we saw him crawling out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that frightful place . His clothes were ablaze , and he toppled over and fell into shallow water , and in a few moments he was dragged out , unconscious . " He lingered for a day or so , still unconscious , and then came to himself and smiled a little as be found that the sword for which he had given his life had been left beside him . He took it in his arms . He hugged it to his breast . He gave a few words of final message for me . And that was all . " When I stoodbeside the body of John Ring and realized that he had died for love of me , I made a vow that has formed my life . I vowed that from that moment I would live not only my own life , but that I would also live the life of John Ring . And from that moment I have worked sixteen hours every day ? eight hours for John Ring 's work and eight hours for my own . " The story of how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the ordinary man thinks his life fully adjusted , he " I looked over that building , " he went on , whimsically , " and I saw that repair really seemed to be out of the question . Nothing but a new church would do . So I took the ax that I had brought with me and began chopping the place down . In a little while a man , not one of the church members , came along , and he watched me for a little and said , ' What are you going to do there ? ' " And I instantly replied , ' Tear down this old building and build a new church . ' " He looked at me . ' But the people wo n't do that , ' he said . " ' Yes , they will , ' I said , cheerfully , keeping at my work . Whereupon he watched me a few minutes longer and said : " ' Well , you can put me down for one hundred dollars for the new building . Come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a little while another man came along and stopped and looked , and he rather gibed at the idea of a new church , and when I told him of the livery-stable man contributing one hundred dollars , he said , But you have n't got the money yet ! ' " No , ' I said , ' but I 'm going to get it to-night ! ' " ' You 'll never get it , ' he said . Re 's not that kind of a man . He 's not even a church man . ' " But I just went quietly on with the work , without answering , and after a while he left , but called back as he went off , ' Well , if he does give you that one hundred dollars , come to me and I 'll give you another hundred . ' " Those two men both paid the money , and of course the church people themselves , who at first had not quite understood that I could be in earnest , then joined in and helped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was building it was peculiarly important to get and keep the congregation together , and as they had ceased to have a minister of their own I used to run out from Boston and preach for them , in a room we hired . " And it was there , in Lexington , in 1879 , that I determined to become a minister . I had a good law practice , but I determined to give it up . All of my life I had felt more or less of a call to the ministry , and here at length was a definite time to begin . Week by week I preached there , and after a while the church was completed , and in that very church , there in Lexington , I was or- dained a minister . " He set the Lexington church on its feet , gave it new life , made it welldoing and self-supporting ; and then , a struggling little church in Philadelphia heard of what he was doing , and an old deacon went up to see and hear him , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous and the needs of the Philadelphia body keenly appealed to Conwell 's imagination , a change was made , and at a salary of eight hundred dollars a year he went , in 188z , to the little struggling Philadelphia congregation ; and of that he is still the pastor , only it ceased to be a struggling congregation a great many years ago . I , or that congregation built , and now owns free of debt , a great new building , the Temple Church , that seats more than any other Protestant church in America ? and Dr. Conwell fills it . When he took charge of the little Philadelphia church the services quickly became so popular that his preaching services and Sunday-school services were alike so crowded that many had to be turned from the doors . One afternoon a little girl who had eagerly wished to go , went away from the Sunday-school crying bitterly because they had told her that there was no more room . But a tall , dark-haired man met her and noticed her tears , and , stopping , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the Sunday-school . " I lifted her to my shoulder , " says Dr. Conwell , in telling of this ? " I lifted her to my shoulder " ? and one realizes what a picture it must have made for the little girl to go through the crowd of people , drying her tears and riding proudly on the shoulders of the kindly , tall , dark man . " I said to her that I would take her in , and I did so ; and I said to her that we should some day have a room big enough for all who should come . And when Sunday-school was over she went home and told her parents ? I only learned this afterward ? that she was going to save money to help build the larger church and Sundayschool that Dr. Conwell wanted . Her parents pleasantly humored her in the idea and let her run errands and do little jobs to earn pennies , and she began dropping the pennies into her bank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few weeks before she was taken suddenly ill and died ; and at the funeral her father told me , quietly , of how his little girl had been saving money for a building-fund . And he handed me what she had saved ? just fifty-seven cents in pennies . " At a meeting of the trustees I told of this gift of fifty-seven cents , the first gift toward the proposed building-fund . For until then the matter had barely been spoken of , as a new church building had been simply a matter for the future . " The trustees seemed much impressed , and in a few days one of them came to me and said that he thought it would be an excellent idea to buy a lot on Broad Street ? the very lot on which the new buildings now stand . I talked the matter over with the owner of the property , and told him of the beginning of the fund . He was not one of our i church , nor , in fact , was he a churchgoer at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and sell us that piece of land for ten thousand dollars , taking a first payment of just fifty-seven cents and letting the entire balance stand on a five-per-cent. mortgage . So I went over it all on that basis with the trustees and some of the other members , and all the people were soon talking of having a new church . " In a short time the entire ten thousand dollars was raised and the land for the church that I wanted was bought and free of debt . And all this had come so quickly and directly from that little girl 's fifty-seven cents . " It sounds like a fairy tale ; but then , this man has all his life been making fairy tales into realities . Each important phase of his life seems , when considered by itself , the most important of all , and so it seems with the foundation and management of the university . For the university came outof nothing ? nothing but the need of a young man of his congregation , and the fact that he told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to him and said that he could earn but little money , and that he supported his mother as well as himself , but that the desire of his life was to have a college education . Conwell replied that with proper determination he could study sufficiently at night . But the young man could not see how to do it . " Come to me one evening a week and I will begin teaching you myself , " said Conwell . The young man went , and , having asked permission , took with him a few friends . And that first evening was an evening of Latin . " That was the beginning of it , and there is very little more to tell . The third evening the pupils were forty . Others joined in helping me . A room was hired , then a house , then a second house . From a few students and teachers we became a college . Our buildings went up on Broad Street , beside the Temple Church , and we became Temple University . From the first our aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it through the usual channels . And so that is really all there was to it . " But this is far from " ail there was to it " ; for from that young man who went to his library , downhearted , one evening in 1884 , the Temple University has had , up to commencement time of 1915 , the huge attendance of 88,821 students . For the convenience of those who work for their living either by night or day , lectures and recitations nay be attended either in the forenoon , the afternoon , or the evening . And the classics , the languages , literature , may be studied there ; or law or medicine , theology or engineering , or such practical branches . as dressmaking , boOkkeeping , or manual training . Another of his accomplishments was the founding of a hospital . It was in 1891 . It began with two rented rooms , one nurse , one patient . Now it is the great Samaritan Hospital . A little over eight years ago he acquired another hospital , the Garretson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made part of Temple University , and , including dispensary work , they have already treated , under Conwell 's control , over 400,000 cases . How he can find time for his many activities is a marvel . The head of a great church , of a university , of two hospitals ? helped , indeed , by efficient executive assistants , but none the less the man to whom all turn ? he gets through his work only by superb strength and the memory of John Ring and the sword . His ministerial work alone would overtask the ordinary man . He preaches twice every Sunday . He shakes hands with hundreds after each service . He addresses a large class of men . He attends the Sunday-school . He leads the weekly prayer-meeting . He is on call for any need . He may be seen at almost any time by any of his people who need help or advice . As a preacher he has wonderful power . He instantly gains the attention of every one and holds it to the close . Yet he is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is to preach so simply that his listeners will not think it preaching , but just that they are listening to a friend . He is so earnest , so happy , that every one in the church feels earnest and happy , and there is a general sense of ease , of unrestrainedness . His fund of personal anecdote , of personal reminiscence , is unfailing ; he speaks of something he heard yesterday or ten years ago ; he tells of what some one said to him in New York or London or Bombay . He has been everywhere and met everybody ; he remembers all he heard or saw , and at any moment the needed illustration comes to him . One Sunday evening he referred to the first time he met Garfield , and of how McKinley took him to Garfield 's home ; and he told how the conversation turned to music , and that these two men , each of whom was to become President , agreed in a deep love for the old tune of " The Ol &Time; Religion " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awakened every morning by the quavering singing of the old hymn , down at the pasture bars , by the old man who had cared for him and to whom he owed so much . What followed was an astonishing example of Russell Conwell 's power to move and sway . For a new expression came into his face , and he said , as if the idea had only that moment occurred to him as it most probably had ? " I think it is in our hymnal . " And in a moment he announced the number , and the music struck up and every person in that great church , every man , woman , and child , joined in the swinging rhythm of verse after verse as if they would never tire : It was good enough for mother , and it 's good enough for me ! It was good in the fiery furnace and it 's good enough for me I think it almost certain that he has never spoken to any one of what , to me , is the finest thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly goes to the small towns that arc never visited by other men of great reputation . He knows that it is the little places , the out-of-the-way places , the submerged places , that most need a pleasure and a stimulant , and he goes out , man of well over seventy that he is , to tiny towns in distant states , heedless of the discomforts of traveling , of the poor little hotels that seldom have visitors , of the oftentimes hopeless cooking and uncleanliness , of the hardships and the discomforts . He does not think of claiming the relaxation earned by a lifetime of labor . How he does it all , how he can possibly keep it up , shows him a marvel of efficiency . I have before me a list of his engagements during his summer vacation of the year 1915 , and for eight weeks it shows a lecture for every weekday night and preaching on every Sunday . Never did any man so spend a " vacation . " And the money that he receives is not for himself ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conwell . His charities , his helpfulness , his interest in progress and education ? it is into such lines that the money goes . Russell Conwell is an orator horn , and the inborn power has been developed by the hardest of thought and of practice . When he speaks , men listen . It is quality , temperament , control . It is oratory . But it is never " elocution . " " Acres of Diamonds " is the lecture that he has delivered more than five thousand times . It is vibrant with his energy . It flashes with his hopefulness . It is full of his enthusiasm . It is packed full of his intensity . It stands for the possibility of success for every one . The demand for the lecture never diminishes . The success grows never less . And every dollar that the lecture earns is used for one special purpose that is very near to his heart . And the cause for this dates back to his days at Yale . He went to Yale with only a little money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not mind hardship ; he had been used to hardships and hard work at home , but he found that his poverty brought him personal humiliations so keen that it pains him , even now , to think of them . And so , " I determined , " he says , " that whatever I could do to make the way easier at college for young men working their way I would do . " Many years ago he began to devote every dollar that he made from " Acres of Diamonds " to this definite purpose . He has what may be termed a waitinglist , and many of the names come to him from other college presidents throughout the country . " Every night , when the lecture is over and the check is in my hand , I sit down in my room in the hotel " - what a lonely picture ! ? " I sit down in my room and subtract from the total sum received my actual expenses for that place , and make out a check for the difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I always send with the cheek a letter expressing my hope that it will be of some service to him , and telling him that he is to feel under no obligations except to his Lord . I feel strongly , and I try to make every young man feel , that there must be no sense of obligation to me personally . " And after a pause he added , " I do not attempt to send any young man enough for all his expenses . But I want to save him from bitterness , and each check will help . And , too , " he conVoid , CXXXII ,  - -  No . T87. - 18 eluded na ? vely in the vernacular , " I do not want them to lay down on me . " I heard this lecture on its 5 , 24th delivery . I noticed that he was to deliver it at a little out-of-the-way place difficult to get to , and I wondered just how much of an audience would gather and how they would be impressed . So I went over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road was dark , and I pictured a small audience , but when I got there I found that the church building in which he was to deliver the lecture had a seating capacity of eight hundred and thirty and that precisely eight hundred and thirty people were already there and that a fringe of others were standing behind around the edges . Many had come from miles away . Yet the lecture had scarcely been advertised . Always , wherever he speaks and whatever the character of his audience , he talks with ease and sympathy . There are geniality , composure , humor , simple and homely jests , yet never does the audience forget that he is every moment in tremendous earnest . They bubble with responsive laughter or are silent in riveted attention . Every little while a stir of earnestness or surprise , amusement or resolve can he seen to sweep over the audience . When he is grave or sober or fervid , the people feel that he is himself a fervidly earnest man , and when he is telling something humorous there is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fun of it , not in the least as if he were laughing at his own humor , but , such being the skill of the man , just as if he and his hearers were laughing together at something of which they were all humorously cognizant . It is impossible to write of such a man without superlatives . He is so efficient . He sets out to do the impossible and always does it . And , over threescore years and ten , he still works sixteen hours a day . In work he forgets his sadness , his loneliness , his age . And he said to me , quietly , one day , " I will die in harness . "
