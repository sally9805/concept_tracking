txt During the last few days the security markets have been buoyant , while the commodity markets have continued a moderate , orderly decline . The movements are logical , not contradictory . Stocks rise on the prospect of profits . Commodities fall on the prospect of lower costs . Both movements are prophetic . The saying that the wheel does not grind with the water which has passed over it applies particularly to calamity news . There is nothing alarming or depressing in the bad news of the past years of terror and destruction . That lies behind . The future must be better , not only by comparison with the war conditions , but . by comparison with the best before the war . We are not on the crest of prosperity . Rather we are rising from the depth of calamity . It is true that the world never witnessed such destruction of capital . But it is also true that it . never witnessed such increased capacity of production . The latter is more important . The destruction was temporary and has stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to make it , under the stimulus of world wants and American capacity to supply them . The world lacks food and clothes and materials to Supply every want , to a total of uncounted billions . Here only is plenty in goods and capacity of quick production . Every consideration of neighborly duty and self-interest constrains us to remove the obstacles in the way of bringing foreign buyers and our sellers together . It is not practicable to assemble all the facts in support of this statement of conditions . Only the broadest outline can be filled in here . The great bank clearings attest the activity of- trade . The suggestion that the volume is in prices rather than in goods is negatived by the tonnage passing.over the railways . Never was there such a volume of business , and never sounder conditions among traders , as the fewness of insolvencies proves . The largest foreign trade of 1918 was in its last month , and the first month of 1919 registered above any other month in all time . The trade of Janpary put the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire fiscal year 1914 . Undeniably food is dear , but wages are high and give . no sign of immediate fail . They need never fall if labor will earn them . High wages and cheap living are a contradiction only seemingly . They are reconciled by quantity production , capable of immeasurable increase if labor and capital meet with open hands rather than with clenched fists . That must pass here as an assertion ; but the argument in " ts support will be found in the article in the THE TIMES Sunday Magazine today by a large employer of labor , whose practice has proved it . No. true picture is without shadows , but the shadows only prove that them is sunshine . Living is too high for many , even with high wages . But the high prices have caused such accumulation of goods that it is almost a scandal . We have taken from the soil in the last year more money than we have raised in Liberty bonds , and we are almost dreading the bounty of next year 's harvest . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or move it from the farms ? Never was there in sight such a total of living or slaughtered food animals , although never did any people reap such profit from the sale of them . There is so much cotton that the planters are planning to restrict production . Once we were to be ruined by Chinese cheap labor . Now some seem to think that we are cursed by abundance . That is not true because foreign needs are greater than domestic supplies . The problem of bringing them together is far from insoluble . A Produce Exchange meeting of the trade last week resolved that the embargo on exports of oils and fats should bp removed , seeing that the present supply is 970,000,000 pounds , against 580,000,000 a - year ago . In the House of Representatives there were protests last week against the embargo on cotton exports , and against requirements of licenses for trade with neutrals . At this port there is an accumulation of $100,000,000 of goods awaiting shipping . There is in the American market a French buyer for American coal , on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that the French buyer says that he . will take American coal only until Germany undersells . The cable reports that France is negotiating for $40,000,000 worth of machine tools , an equal value of , farmers ' machines , and $100,000,000 of raw materials . Another French inquiry is for 800 locomotives and 32,000 cars , additional to 27,000 to be taken over from our army outfit . Last week a syndicate of American bankers arranged a credit of $50,000,000 for Belgian bankers , all to be spent here , and $10,000,000 forthwith . It is only Americans who are *waiting for our prices to collapse . Foreign demands are exigent and instant . It is reassuring to remark how ample is our supply of credit . Last week a statement by the Federal Reserve Bank showed that the supply of free gold would support a doubling of the credits of member banks . Our credit capacity is growing despite demands upon it . At the end of the year the Federal Reserve free gold was $528,000,000 . On February 1 it was $618,000,000 , an increase which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $197,000,000 . We have seen the time when our trade suffered heartblock because it could not get currency for hand-to-hand business . Our Federal - Reserve system now . has capacity of issue of $1,546,000,000 of notes , or $1,767,000,000 of deposits , which are as useful as currency , even in times of panic . Yet there are those among us afraid to do business , even while those less able are taking away their trade . Last week Canada gave credits of $25,000,000 each to France and Rumania , and is negotiating with Belgium . At the same time Congress was considering stopping credits to England until she discontinued her embargo , and rejected Secretary GLASS 'S proposal for financing exports by loans to our allies and privately through the War Finance Corporation . These are the purposes for which banking funds should be used , and not for the absorption of Treasury issues . The blockade of prosperity does not conic from our . men of business . The difficulties in our situation are technical only , and created if not imaginary .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
