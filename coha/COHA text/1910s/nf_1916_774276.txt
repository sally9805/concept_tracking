txt  | with the concrete by having projecting surfaces or " knobs " to form an anchorage with concrete . But even today , the French engineers use plain bars in most of their work . If they consider additional anchorage is necessary , they hook the ends of the bars . To assist in making a good bond between the concrete and the steel , in this country , a higher yield point in the steel is used , as we believe if this bond is broken we would no longer have the type of structure on which our design is based . In development of the bar with mechanical bond , the names of Ransome , Johnson , and Thacher should be mentioned . They were the leaders in this country in developing deformed bars , on which they secured patents . In recent practice , engineers are not only using deformed bars but , in addition , are hooking the ends of bars on non-continuous ends , which demonstrates that we believe the bond between the bar and the concrete must not be broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also did much to extend the use of reinforced concrete in this country . Plain Concrete . The ingredients used in making concrete are cement , sand , stone , and water . The strength of the concrete depends largely on the proportions of these materials and , of course , on the materials themselves . To make good concrete , good materials must be used , well mixed together with a minimum of water to secure a plastic concrete . To mould the concrete in the shapes desired , forms must be constructed of sufficient strength to support the concrete when placed . Plain concrete is extensively used for clams , retaining walls , piers , abutments , foundations , and many other types of construction where loads are to be supported . Reinforced Concrete . Concrete has a fairly high compressive value but is weak in tensile strength and , therefore , steel bars are imbedded in the concrete in the proper places to resist the tensile stresses . In designing a beam , usually the top of the beam is in compression and is resisted by the compressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam will have a tensile stress to resist ; and since the concrete has a low tensile value , the steel bars are placed near the bottom of the beam to resist the stress . The steel bars must be entirely imbedded in the concrete to form a bond with the concrete . The concrete on the bottom will protect the  | steel from rusting and also protect it from heat in case of fires . The shear stresses in reinforced concrete are resisted by a combination of concrete and the steel . Reinforced concrete is used for buildings , arches , retaining walls , and in the last few years it has been extensively used for highway construction . Concrete is a good material for fireproofing steel structures and also protecting steel against rust . It is comparatively cheap material and the ingredients for making concrete are available nearly everywhere . By placing steel bars in the concrete in the correct percentage , the steel will greatly assist in reducing cracks in the concrete due to temperature stresses . CEMENTING MATERIALS The principal cementing materials are common lime , hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement . There are a few other varieties , but their use is so limited that they need not be considered here . Common Lime . This is produced by burning limestone , whose chief ingredient is carbonate of lime . Except in the form of marble , a limestone usually contains other substances ? perhaps up to 10 per cent of silica , alumina , magnesia , etc . The process of burning drives off the carbonic acid and leaves the protoxide of calcium . This is the lime of commerce ; and to preserve it from deterioration , it must be kept dry and even protected from a free circulation of air . When exposed freely to the air for a long period , it will become air-slaked ; that is , it will absorb both moisture and carbonic acid from the air , and will lose its ability to harden . The first step in using common lime is to combine it with water , which it absorbs readily so that its volume is increased to 2 to 3z times what it was before . Its weight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , which consisted originally of large lumps with some powder , is reduced to an unctuous mass of smooth paste . The lime is then called slaked lime , the process of slaking being accompanied by the development of great heat . The purer the lime , the greater the development of heat and the greater the expansion in volume . It is soluble in water which is not already " hard , " or which does not already contain considerable lime in solution . A good lime will make a smooth paste with only a very small per1.3  | tentage ( less than 10 per cent ) of foreign matter or clinker . By such simple means a lime may be readily tested . The hardening of common lime mortar is due to the formation of a carbonate of lime ( substantially the original condition of the stone ) by the absorption from the atmosphere of carbonic oxide . This will penetrate for a considerable depth in course of time ; but instances are common in which masonry has been torn down after having been erected many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been found still soft and onset , since it was hermetically cut off from the carbonic oxide of the atmosphere . For the same reason , common lime mortar will not harden under water and , therefore , it is utterly useless to employ it for work under water or for large masses of masonry . When the qualities of slaking and expansion are not realized or are obtained only very imperfectly , the lime is called lean or pool ( rather than fat ) and its value is less and less , until it is perhaps worthless for use in making mortar , or for any other use except as a fertilizer . Hydraulic Lime . This is derived from limestones containing about 10 to 20 per cent of clay or silica , which is intimately mixed with the carbonate of lime in the structure of the stone . During the process of burning , some of the lime combines with the clay ( or the silica ) so as to form the aluminate or silicate of lime . The excess of lime becomes quicklime as before . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere sprinkling , the lime having been intimately mixed with the clay or silica , the expansion of the lime completely disintegrates the whole mass . This slaking is done by the manufacturer . The lime having a much greater avidity for the water than the aluminate or the silicate , the small amount of water used in the slaking is absorbed entirely by the lime , and the aluminate or the silicate is not affected . The setting of hydraulic lime appears to be due to the crystallizing of the aluminate and silicate ; and since this will be accomplished even when the masonry is under water , it receives from this property its name of hydraulic lime . It is used but little in this country , and is all imported . Hydrated Lime . This is a manufactured product , sold in sacks or barrels , like cement , and is slaked by the manufacturer in  | a manner which avoids the objections , named above , due to improper slaking . Its being ready for immediate use is an advantage when the delay required for slaking lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of hydrated lime to Yortland cement accomplished two results ? when added to mortar , it makes the mortar less harsh and more easy to work under a trowel ; and when added to either mortar or to concrete , the product is more impervious to water . Claims have been made that the addition of not more than 15 per cent of hydrated lime to the cement will not reduce the strength of concrete made with it . Even if the claim is not strictly true , it is evident that the reduction of strength is so little that it is very easily allowed for in the unit strength requirements when impermeability is of great importance . Some tests made by S. E. Thompson showed that using 8 per cent of hydrated lime with 1:2:4 concrete , or 12 per cent with 1:12:5 concrete , or 1G per cent with concrete , makes a concrete which is practically impermeable . On the other hand , the " Joint Committee " has said , " integral compounds shall not be used for waterproofing unless specifically authorized by the Engineer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete in contradistinction to a coating placed on the concrete afterward . Evidently the Joint Committee does not wish to recommend any integral compound , of which hydrated lime is one of many on the market . Natural Cement . Natural cement is obtained by burning an argillaceous or a magnesian limestone which happens to have the proper chemical composition . The resulting clinker is then finely ground and is at once ready for use . Such cement was formerly and is still commonly called Rosendale cement , owing to its having been produced first in Rosendale , Ulster County , New York . A very large part of the natural cement now produced in this country comes from Ulster County , New York , or from near Louisville , hentucky . Cement rock from which natural cement can be made is now found widely scattered over the country . Portland Cement . Portland cement consists of the product of burning and grinding an artificial mixture of carbonate of lime and clay or slag , the mixture being very carefully proportioned so that the ingredients shall have very nearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . 15  | " If a deposit of stone containing exactly the right amount of clay , and of exactly uniform composition , could he found , Portland cement could be made from it , simply by burning and grinding . For good results , however , the composition of the raw material must be exact , and the proportion of carbonate of lime in it must not vary even by one per cent . No natural deposit of rock of exactly this correct and unvarying composition is known or likely ever to be found ; therefore Portland cement is always made from an artificial mixture , usually , if free front organic matter , containing about 75 per cent carbonate of lime and 25 per cent clay . " ? S. B. NEW BERRY , in Taylor and Thompson 's " Concrete , Plain and Reinforced . " In a general way , it may be said that the characteristics of Portland cement on which its value as a material to be used in construction work chiefly depends may be briefly indicated as follows : When the cement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harden in a few hours , and should develop a considerable proportion of its ultimate strength in a few days . It should also possess the quality of permanency , so that no material change in form or volume will take place on account of its inherent qualities or as the result of exterior agencies . There is always found to be more or less of shrinkage in the volume of cement and concrete during the process of setting and hardening ; but with any cement of really good quality , this shrinkage is not so great as to prove objectionable . Another very important characteristic is that the cement shall not lose its strength with age . Although some longtime tests of cement have apparently indicated a slight decrease in the strength of cement after the first year or so , this decrease is nevertheless so slight that it need not affect the design of concrete , even assuming the accuracy of the general statement . To insure absolute dependence on the strength and durability of any cement which it is proposed to use in important structural work , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thorough tests . CEMENT TESTING All cement should be tested . On large operations a testing laboratory can be fitted up and all cement tested at the site of the operation . On smaller jobs the tests are generally made by professional laboratories . The cost of these tests is small . The professional laboratories keep men at all the big cement plants so that they can secure samples when the shipments are being made . Often 1c  | by the time that the cement is received at the job afid unloaded the report of the seven-day test will be also received at the work . In 1904 a Joint Committee on Concrete and Reinforced Concrete was organized to standardize the science . As finally developed , the Committee consisted of five representatives of each of the following Societies : American Society of Civil Engineers , American Society for Testing Materials , American Railway Engineering Association , American Concrete Institute , and the Portland Cement Association . After twenty years of arduous work , the report of the Joint Committee , issued to the constituent organizations , has been almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest authorities . Although there has been a development , in some details , in the science of making concrete since 1924 , the fundamentals of that report are still authoritative and have been followed in this course of instruction . For brevity , quotations from this report will be referred to as the work of the ' Joint Committee . " In the following pages will be described the methods ( based on the Final Report of the Joint Committee ) of sampling cement shipments , and the simple tests of cement which may be made at the site of the work with very simple testing equipment . For brevity , the language of e original Report , describing the tests , will be very much condense especially of those tests which can only be reliably made iii a well-equipped laboratory . The engineer of a comparatively small structure must depend on simple tests , as hereafter described , or utilize a professional testing laboratory . Sampling . Samples are either indiridual , the whole sample being taken from one spot , or coinposmte , the sample being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the shipment . A test sample should weigh at least S pounds . It may be collected at the mill by taking from the conveyor which delivers the cement to the bin at least S pounds for each 100 barrels passing on the conveyor . Sometimes augers or sampling irons are inserted in the bin vertically to a maximum depth of 10 feet , or horizontally through holes made in the bin side-walls for this very purpose , the location of the holes being selected so as to obtain a representative sample of the whole bin . The samples should be passed through a sieve having 20 meshes per linear inch in order thoroughly to mix the sample , break up lumps , and remove foreign 17  | materials . The samples should be stored and shipped in air-tight containers until the time for actual testing . Chemical Analysis . Ordinarily an engineer is not concerned with the chemical composition of cement , provided the cement is physically satisfactory . If the work is of such magnitude that a chemical analysis is considered desirable or necessary , this should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real significance of the chemical analysis . Therefore the chemical requirements of cement will not be further discussed . Specific Gravity . Significance . The specific gravity of cement is lowered by adulteration and hydration , but the adulteration must be considerable to be detected by tests of specific gravity . Inasmuch as the differences in specific gravity are usually very small , great care must be exercised in making the determination . Apparatus . The determination of specific gravity should be made with a standardized Le Chatelier apparatus . This consists of a flask ( D ) , Iaig. 1 , of about 120 cu . can . capacity , the neck of which is about 20 cm. long ; in the middle of this neck is a bulb ( C ) , above and below which are two marks ( F ) and ( E ) ; the volume between these two marks is 20 cu . cm . The neck has a diameter of about 9 mm. , and is graduated into tenths of cubic centimeters above the mark ( F ) . Benzine ( 62 ? Baume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making the determination . Method . The flask is filled with either of these liquids to the lower mark ( E ) , and 64 grams of cement , cooled to the temperature of the liquid , is slowly introduced through the funnel ( B ) , the stem of which should be long enough to extend into the flask to the top of the bulb ( C ) , taking care that the cement does not adhere to the sides of the flask and that the funnel does not touch the liquid . After all the cement is introduced , the level of the liquid will rise to some division of the graduated neck ; this reading , plus 20 cu . cm. is the volume displaced by 64 grains of the cement . The specific gravity is then obtained from the formula figure The flask , during the operation , is kept immersed in water in a jar in order to avoid variations in the temperature of the liquid 18  | in the flask , which should not exceed 2 ? C. The results of repeated tests should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made on the cement as received ; if it should fall below 3.10 , a second determination should be made after igniting the sample at a low red heat in the following manner : One-half gram of cement is heated in a weighed platinum crucible , with cover , for 5 minutes with a Bunsen burner ( starting with a low flame and gradually increasing to its full height ) and then heating for 15 minutes with a blast lamp ; the difference between the weight after cooling and the original weight is the loss on ignition . The temperature should not exceed 900 ? C. , and the ignition should preferably be made in a muffle ? The apparatus may be cleaned in the following manner : The flask is inverted and shaken vertically , until the liquid flows freely and then held in a vertical position until empty ; any traces of cement remaining can be reMoved by pouring into the ask a small quail- tity of clean benzine or ker ne , and repeating i the operation . The specific gravity should not be less than 3.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signifieanee . It is generally accepted that the coarser particles in cement are practically inert and that only the extremely fine powder possesses cementing qualities . The more finely cement is pulverized , other conditions being the same , the more sand it will carry and so produce a mortar of a given strength . . l pparatux . The fineness of a sample of cement is determined by weighing the residue retained on a standard No. 200 sieve , which is one having nominally an 0.0029-inch opening and 200 wires per lineal inch . The number of wires in ally inch shall not be outside the limits of 192 to 208 . No opening between adjacent parallel wires shall exceed 0.0050 inch in width . The average diameter of the wires shall not exceed the limits 0.0019 to 0.0021 inch . Method . The test should be made with 50 grams of cement , 19  | dried at a temperature of 100 ? C. ( 212 ? F. ) . The cement is placed on the No. 200 sieve , which , with pan and cover attached , is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and backward about 200 times per minute , at the . same time striking the side gently , on the up stroke , against the palm of the other hand . The operation is continued until not more than 0.05 grant will pass through in one minute . The residue on a standard No. 20O sieve should not exceed 22 per cent by weight . Normal Consistency . Sigui , f conee . The use of a proper percentage of water in making pastes* and mortars for the various tests is exceedingly important and vitally affects the results obtained . The amount of water , expressed in percentage by weight of the dry cement required to produce a paste of plasticity desired , termed " normal consistency , " should be determined with the Vicat apparatus in the following manner : Apparatus . This consists of a frame ( A ) , Fig. 2 , bearing a movable rod ( B ) , weighing 300 grams , one end ( C ) being 1 cm. in diameter for a distance of Ei cm. , the other having a removable needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cm. long . The rod is reversible . and can be held in any desired position by a screw ( T ) , and has midway between the ends a mark ( F ) which moves under a scale ( graduated to millimeters ) attached to the frame ( A ) . The paste is held by a conical , hard-rubber ring ( G ) , 7 cm. in diameter at the base , 4 cm. high , resting on a glass plate ( II ) about 10 cm. square . Method . In making the determination , the same quantity of cement as will be used subsequently for each batch in making the test pieces , but not less than 500 grams , with a measured quantity of water , is kneaded into a paste , as described in paragraph 45 , and quickly formed into a ball with the hands , completing the operation by tossing it six times from one hand to the other , maintained about 1 ) inches apart ; the ball resting in the palm of one hand is pressed into the larger end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling the ring with paste ; the excess at the larger end is then removed by a single movement of the palm of the hand ; the ring is then placed on its larger end on a glass plate and the excess paste at the smaller end is sliced off at the top of the ring by a single oblique stroke of a footnote *The term " paste " is used in this report to designate a mixture of cement and water , and the word " mortar " to designate a mixture of cement , sand , and water .  | trowel held at a slight angle with the top of the ring . During these operations care must be taken not to compress the paste . The paste confined in the ring , resting on the plate , is placed under the rod , the larger end of which is brought in contact with the surface of the paste ; the scale is then read and the rod quickly released . figure The paste is of normal consistency when the cylinder settles to a point 10 mm. below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus must be free from all vibrations during the test . Trial pastes are made with varying percentages of water until the normal consistency is obtained . Having determined the percentage of water required to produce a paste of normal consistency , the percentage required for a mortar containing by weight one part of cement to three parts of standard  | figure Ottawa sand is obtained from Table I , the amount being a percentage of the combined weight of the cement and sand . Time of Setting . Significance . The object of this test is to determine the time which elapses from the moment water is added until the paste ceases to be plastic ( called the " initial set " ) , and also the time until it acquires a certain degree of hardness ( called the " final set " or " hard set " ) . The former is the more important , since . with the comutenceiuent of setting , the process of crystallization begins . As a disturbance of this process may produce a loss of strength , it is desirable to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work before the cement begins to set . Apparatus . The initial and final set should be determined with the Vicat apparatus previously described . Method . A paste of normal consistency is moulded in the hardrubber ring , as previously described , and placed under the rod ( Th the smaller end of which is then carefully brought in contact with the surface of the paste , and the rod quickly released . The initial set is said to have occurred when the needle ceases to pass a point 5 min. above the glass plate ; and the final set , when the needle does not sink visibly into the paste . The test pieces should be kept in moist air during the test : this may be accomplished by placing them on a rack over water contained in a pan and covered by a damp cloth ; the cloth to be kept from contact with them by means of a wire screen ; or they may he stored in a moist box or closet .  | Care should be taken to keep the needle clean , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penetration , while cement on the point may increase the penetration . The time of setting is affected not only by the percentage and temperature of the water used and the amount of kneading the paste receives , but figure by the temperature and humidity of the air , and its determination is , therefore , only approximate . An alternative method of determining time of setting is that of using " Gillrnore 's Needles , " which are metal balls of definite weight having needles of several diameters mounted in a light wooden frame so that the needles will bear vertically on a pat of cement paste . The time of setting shall be determined as follows : A pat of neat cement paste about 3 inches in diameter and inch in thickness with a flat top , as shown in Fig. 3 , mixed to a normal consistency ,  | shall be kept in moist air at a temperature maintained as nearly as practicable at 21 ? centigrade ( 70 ? Fahr . ) . The cement shall be considered to have acquired its initial set when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle , - ' 2 inch in diameter , loaded to weigh + pound . The final set has been acquired when the pat will bear without appreciable indentation , the Gilhnore needle , T2  --  r inch in diameter , loaded to weigh 1 pound . Ln making the test , the needles shall be held in a vertical position and applied lightly to the surface of the pat . Cement should not develop initial set in less than 45 minutes when the Vicat needle is used , or GO minutes when the Gillmore needle is used . Final set should be attained within 10 hours . Standard Sand . The sand to be used for cement testing should be natural sand from Ottawa , Ill. , screened to pass a No. 20 sieve , and retained on a No. 30 sieve . The sieves should be at least S inches in diameter ; the wire cloth should be of brass wire and should conform to the following requirements : figure Sand which has passed the No. 20 sieve is standard when not more than 5 grains passes the No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500-gram sample. * Form of Test Pieces . For tensile tests the form of test piece shown in Fig. 4 should be used . For compressive tests , 2-inch cubes should be used . Moulds . The moulds should be of brass , bronze , or other noncorrodible material , and should have sufficient metal in the sides to prevent spreading during moulding . Moulds may be either single or gang moulds . The latter are preferred by many . If used , the type shown in Fig. 5 is recommended . The moulds should be wiped with an oily cloth before using . footnote *This sand may be obtained from the Ottawa Silica Company at a cost of three cents per pound , f. o. b. cars , Ottawa , l.  | Mixing Cement Pastes and Mortars . The quantity of dry material to be mixed at one time shall not exceed 1000 grammes nor be less than 500 grammes . The proportions of cement or cement figure and sand shall be stated by weight in grammes of the dry materials ; the quantity of water shall be expressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gramme ) . The dry materials shall be weighed , placed upon a non-absorbent surface , thoroughly mixed dry if sand is used , and a crater formed in the center , into which the proper  | percentage of clean water shall be poured ; the material on the outer edge shall be turned into the crater by the aid of a trowel . After an interval of one-half minute for the absorption of the water , the operation shall be completed by continuous , vigorous mixing , squeezing , and kneading with the hands for at least one minute ? or even several minutes . The error in mixing should be on the side of overmixing . During the operation of mixing , the hands should be protected by rubber gloves . The temperature of the room and the mixing water shall be maintained as nearly as practicable at 21 ? centigrade ( 70 ? Fahr . ) . Moulding . Immediately after mixing , the paste or mortar is placed in the moulds with the hands , pressed in firmly with the fingers , and smoothed off with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mould , and , in smoothing off , the trowel should be drawn over the mould in such a manner as to exert a moderate pressure on the material . The mould should then be turned over and the operation of heaping and smoothing off repeated . Storage of the Test Pieces . During the first 24 hours after moulding , the test pieces should be kept in moist air to prevent drying . A moist closet consists of a soapstone or slate box , or a wood box lined with metal , the interior surface being covered with felt or broad wicking kept wet , the bottom of the box being kept covered with water . The interior of the box is provided with glass shelves on which to place the test pieces , the shelves being so arranged that they may be withdrawn readily . After 24 hours in moist air , the pieces to be tested after longer periods should be immersed in water in storage tanks or pans made of non-corrodible material . The air and water in the moist closet and the water in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 ? centigrade ( 70 ? F. ) . Tensile Strength . The tests may be made with any standard machine . The clip is shown in Fig. 6 . It must be made accurately , the pins and rollers turned , and the rollers bored slightly larger than the pins , so as to turn easily . There should be a slight clearance at each end of the roller , and the pins should be kept properly lubricated and free from grit . The clips should be used without cushioning at the point of contact .  | Test pieces should be broken as soon as they are removed from the water . Care should be observed in centering the test pieces in the testing machine , as cross strains , produced by imperfect centering , tend to lower the breaking strength . The load should not be applied too suddenly , as it may produce vibration , the shock from which often causes the test piece to break before the ultimate figure strength is reached . The bearing surfaces of the clips and test pieces must be kept free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bearing . The load should be applied at the rate of ( iO() pounds per minute . The average of the results of the test pieces from each sample should be taken as the test of the sample . Test pieces which do not break within 4 inch of the center , or are otherwise manifestly faulty , should be excluded in determining average results .  | The average tensile strength , in pounds per square inch , of not less than three standard mortar briquettes ( made as previously described , see Fig. 4 ) composed of one part of cement and three parts of standard sand , by weight , shall be equal to or higher than the following : Age 7 days : 1 day in moist air , ( i days in water ; 200 lbs . Age 28 days : 1 day in moist air , 27 days in water ; 300 lbs . figure Constancy of Volume or Soundness . Significance . The object is to detect those qualities which tend to destroy the strength and durability of a cement . Under normal conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other cases may not develop for a considerable time , Fig. 7 . Since the detection of these destructive qualities before using the cement in construction is essential , 29  | tests are made not only under normal conditions but under artificial conditions created to hasten the development of these defects . Tests may , therefore , be divided into two classes : ( 1 ) normal tests , made in either air or water maintained , as nearly as practicable , at 21 ? C. ( 70 ? F. ) ; and ( 2 ) accelerated tests , made in air , steam , or water , at temperature of 45 ? C. ( 113 ? F. ) and upward . The Committee recommends that these tests be made in the following manner : Methods . Pats , about 3 inches in diameter , z inch thick at the center , and tapering to a thin edge , should be made on clean glass plates ( about 4 inches square ) from cement paste of normal consistency , and stored in a moist closet for 24 hours . Normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pat is immersed in water for 28 days and observed at intervals . A similar pat , after 24 hours in the moist closet , is exposed to the air for 28 days or more and observed at intervals . Accelerated Text . After 24 hours in the moist closet , a pat is placed in an atmosphere of steam , upon a wire screen 1 inch above boiling water , for 5 hours . The apparatus should be so constructed that the steam will escape freely and atmospheric pressure be maintained . Since the type of apparatus used has a great influence on the results , the arrangement shown ill Fig. 8 is recommended . Pats which remain firm and hard and show no signs of cracking , distortion , or disintegration are said to be of constant volume " or " sound . " Should the pat leave the plate , distortion may be detected best with a straightedge applied to the surface which was in contact with the plate . Standard Cement Specifications* GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 1 . These remarks have been prepared with a view of pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions to be observed in the interpretation of the results of the tests . footnote *These specifications are in the main as adopted August 16 , 1909 , by the American Society for Testing Materials . Important additions have been incorporated which were approved by the American Society of Civil Engineers , . lanuary 17 , 1912 . They were not incorporated into the final report of the Committee , as made in August . 1924 , but since there is so much valuable information and advice in them , they are retained in this edition . 30  | 2 . The Committee would suggest that the acceptance or rejection under these specifications be based on tests made by an experienced person having the proper means for making the tests . SPECIFIC GRAVITY : , . Specific gravity is useful in detecting adulteration . The results of tests of specific gravity are not necessarily conclusive as an indication of the quality of a cement , but when iuu combination with the results of other tests may afford valuable indications . FINENESS 1 . The sieves should be kept thoroughly dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised to maintain the test pieces under as uniform conditions as possible . A sudden change or wide range of temperature in the room in which the tests are made , a very dry or humid atmosphere , and other irregularities vitally affect the rate of setting . CONSTANCY OF VOLUME fi . The tests for constancy of volume are divided into two classes , the first normal , the second accelerated . The latter should be regarded as a precautionary test only , and not infallible . So many conditions enter into the slaking and interpreting of it that it should be used with extreme care . 7 . In making the pats , the greatest care should be exercised to avoid initial strains due to moulding or to too rapid drying-out during the first 24 hours . The pats should be preserved under the most uniform conditions possible , and rapid changes of temperature should be avoided . S. The failure to meet the requirements of the accelerated tests need not be sufficient cause for rejection . The cement , however , may be held for 2S days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using a new sample . Failure to meet the requirements at this time should be considered sufficient cause for rejection , although in the present state of our knowledge it can not be said that such failure necessarily indicates unsoundness , nor can the cement be considered entirely satisfactory simply because it passes the tests . GENERAL CONDITIONS 1 . All cement shall be inspected . 2 . Cement may be inspected either at the place of manufacture or on the work . 31  | 3 . In order to allow ample time for inspecting and testing , the cement should be stored in a suitable weather-tight building having the floor properly blocked or raised front the ground . 4 . The cement shall be stored in such a manner as to permit easy access for proper inspection and identification of each shipment . 5 . Every facility shall be provided by the contractor , and a period of at least 12 ( lays allowed for the inspection and necessary tests . 6 . Cement shall be delivered in suitable packages , with the brand and name of manufacturer plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain 94 pounds of cement net . I ? ach barrel of Portland cement shall contain 4 bags , and each barrel of natural cement shall contain 3 bags of the above net weight . S. Cement failing to meet the 7-day requirements may be held awaiting the results of the 28-day tests before rejection . 9 . All tests shall be made in accordance with the methods proposed by the Special Committee on Uniform Tests of Cement of the American Society of Civil Engineers , presented to the Society on January 17 , 1912 , with all subsequent amendments thereto . 10 . The acceptance or rejection shall be based on the following requirements : PORTLAND CEMENT 11 . Definition . This term is applied to the finely pulverized product resulting from the calcination to incipient fusion of an intimate mixture of properly proportioned argillaceous and calcareous materials , and to which no addition greater than 3 per cent has been made subsequent to calcination . SPECIFIC GRAVITY 12 . The specific gravity of cement shall be not less than 3.10 . Should the test of cement as received fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sample ignited at a low red heat . The loss in weight of the ignited cement shall not exceed 4 per cent . FINENESS 13 . It shall leave by weight a residue of not more than 8 per cent on the No. 100 , and not more than 25 per cent on the No. 200 sieve . 32  | TIME OF SETTING 14 . It shall not develop initial set in less than 30 minutes ; and must develop hard set in not less than 1 hour , nor more than 10 hours . TENSILE STRENGTH 15 . The minimum requirements for tensile strength for briquettes 1 square inch in cross section shall be as follows , and the cement shall show no retrogression in strength within the periods specified : figure CONSTANCY OF VOLUME 16 . Pats of neat cement about 3 inches in diameter , a inch thick at the center , and tapering to a. thin edge , shall be kept in moist air for a period of 24 hours . ( a ) A pat is then kept in air at normal temperature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) Another pat is kept in water maintained as near 70 ? F as practicable , and observed at intervals for at least 28 days . ( c ) A third pat is exposed in any convenient way in an atmosphere of steam , above boiling water , in a loosely closed vessel for 5 hours . 17 . These pats , to pass the requirements satisfactorily , shall remain firm and hard , and show no signs of distortion , checking , cracking , or disintegrating . SULPHURIC ACID AND MAGNESIA 18 . The cement shall not contain more than 1.75 per cent of anhydrous sulphuric acid ( SO3 ) , nor more than 4 per cent of magnesia ( MgO ) Test Machines . There are many varieties of testing machines on the market . One very common type of machine is illustrated in Fig. 9 . A reservoir contains a supply of shot , which falls through 33  | the pipe closed by means of a valve at the bottom . The briquette is carefully placed between the clips , as shown in the figure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . A hook lever is moved so that a. screw w ornl is engaged with its gear . Then figure the valve of the shot reservoir is opened so as to allow the shot . to run into the clip , a small valve regulating the flow of shot into the cup . Better results will be obtained by allowing the shot to run slowly into the cup . The crank is then turned with just sufficient speed so that the scale beam is held in position until the briquette  | is broken . Upon the breaking of the briquette , the scale beam falls , and automatically closes the valve . The weight of the shot in the cup then indicates , according to some definite ratio , the stress required to break the briquette . SAND Sand is a constituent part of mortar and concrete . The strength of the masonry is dependent to a considerable extent on the qualities of the sand and it is therefore important that the desirable and the defective qualities should be understood , and that these qualities be always investigated as thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been many failures of structures due to the use of poor sand . Object . Sand is required in mortar or concrete for economy and to prevent the excessive cracking that would take place in neat lime or cement without the use of sand . Mortar made without sand would be expensive and the neat lime or cement would crack so badly that the increased strength , due to the neat paste , would be of little value , if any , on account of it contracting and cracking very badly . Essential Qualities . The word " sand " as used above is intended as a generic term to apply to any finely divided material which will not injuriously affect the cement or lime , and which is not subject to disintegration or decay . Sand is almost the only material which is sufficiently cheap and which will fulfill these requirements , although stone screenings ( the finest material coming from a stone crusher ) and powdered slag have occasionally been used as substitutes . Specifications usually demand that the sand shall be " sharp , clean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often that they are accepted as standard , notwithstanding the frequent demonstration that modifications of these terms are not only desirable but also economical . These words also ignore other qualities which should be considered , especially when deciding between two or more different sources of sand supply . Geological Character . Quartz sand is the most durable and unchangeable . Sands which consist largely of grains of feldspar , mica , hornblende , etc. , which will decompose upon prolonged exposure to the atmosphere , are less desirable than quartz , although , after 35  | being made up into the mortar , they are virtually protected against further decomposition . Coarseness . A mixture of coarse and fine grains , with the coarse grains predominating , is found very satisfactory , as it makes a denser and stronger concrete with a less amount of cement than when coarse-grained sand is used with the same proportion of cement . The small grains of sand fill the voids caused by the coarse grains so that there is not so great a volume of voids to be filled by the cement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few grains in the hand or by crushing it near the ear and noting if a grating sound is produced ; but an examination through a small lens is better . Sharpness . Experiments have shown that round grains of sand have less voids than angular ones , and that water-worn sands have from 3 to 5 per cent less voids than corresponding sharp grains . In many parts of the country where it is impossible , except at a great expense , to obtain the sharp sand , the round grain is used with very good results . Laboratory tests made under conditions as nearly as possible identical , show that the rounded-grain sand gives as good results as the sharp sand . In consequence of such tests , the requirement that sand shall be sharp is now considered useless by many engineers , especially when it leads to additional cost . Cleanness . In all specifications for concrete work , is found the clause : The sand shall be clean . " Very few natural deposits of sand , even when dug from a river bed , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the strength of mortar . The degree of organic impurity is approximately indicated by a " color test . " " A 12-ounce graduated glass prescription bottle shall be filled to the .4-ounce mark with the sand to be tested . A 3 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide ( NaOIl ) in water shall be added until the volume of sand and liquid after shaking gives a total value of 7 liquid ounces . The bottle shall be stoppered and shaken thoroughly and then allowed to stand for 24 hours . A standard color solution shall be prepared by adding 2.5 cu . cm. of a 2 per cent solution of tannic acid in 10 per cent alcohol to 22.5 cu . cm. of a 3 per cent sodium hydroxide solution . This shall be placed in a 12-ounce prescription bottle , stoppered , and allowed to stand for 24 hours , then 25 cu . cm. of water added . The color of the clear liquid above  | the sand shall be compared with the standard color solution prepared as above . " If the tested sand shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sand is at least doubtful and that it should be physically tested by a mortar-strength test , comparing it with a similar test made with standard Ottawa sand . Any soluble matter in the sand is usually deleterious . Its percentage may be determined by the decantation , test . A sample of sand is dried at a temperature of 100 ? C. ( =230 ? F. ) until the weight remains constant . It is then thoroughly washed until the effluent water is clear , being careful to pour the water through a 200-mesh sieve and returning to the sample any material retained on the sieve . Then the percentage of silt , clay , loam , etc. , figure I f this percentage exceeds 3 per cent , the sand is doubtful and should be tested physically by comparison , as above , with standard Ottawa sand . Grading . While the general requirement for sand is that it shall have the greatest density , the best results are usually found when sieve testing will show figures about as follows : figure Sand containing loam or earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine specially designed for the purpose , or by agitating the sand with water in boxes provided with holes to permit the dirty water to flow away . Very fine sand may be used alone , but it makes a weaker concrete than either coarse sand or coarse and fine sand mixed . A mortar consisting of very fine sand and cement will not be so dense as one of coarse sand and the same cement , although , when measured or weighed dry , both contain the same proportion of voids and solid matter . In a unit measure of fine sand , there are more grains than in a , unit measure of coarse sand and , therefore , more points of contact . More water is required in gaging a mixture of fine sand and cement than in a mixture of coarse sand and the same cement . The water forms a film and separates the grains , thus producing a larger volume having less density . 37  | The screenings of broken stone are sometimes used instead of sand . Tests frequently show a stronger concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is perhaps due to the variable sizes of the screenings , which would have a less percentage of voids . Percentage of Voids . As before stated , a mortar is strongest when composed of fine and coarse grains mixed in such proportion that the percentage of voids shall be the least . The simplest method of comparing two sands is to weigh a certain gross volume of each , the sand having been thoroughly shaken down . Assuming that the stone itself of each kind of sand has the same density , then the heavier volume of sand will have the least percentage of voids . The actual percentage of voids in packed sand may be approximately determined by measuring the volume of water which can be added to a given volume of packed sand . If the water is poured into the sand , it is quite certain that air will remain in the voids in the sand , which will not be dislodged by the water , and the apparent volume of voids will be less than the actual . The precise determination involves the measurement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed , and the percentage of moisture in the sand , all of which is done with elaborate precautions . The measured volume of a given quantity or weight of sand is very variable , depending on moisture conditions . Adding about ti per cent , by weight , of water to sand causes it to " bulk " 20 per cent or possibly 30 per cent . Soaking it still more will decrease the bulking , and when the sand is " inundated " and the voids are all filled with water , the volume will be substantially the same as dry sand . Very wet sand will carry from 10 per cent to 13 per cent of water , and even " moist " sand will carry about 3 per cent , which makes its volume quite uncertain when it is measured " by volme " while making mortar or concrete . A quick and approximate calculation of moisture may be made by weighing a specimen quantity of damp sand and then drying the sand by heating it until the weight is constant ? no more moisture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture in that weight of sand . But this includes the moisture of " absorption " within the sand grains , which for average sand may be considered to be 1 per cent by weight . If the total loss of weight on drying was 8 per cent , then the " surface water " on the surface of the sand grains is 7 per cent of the weight of the sand .  | BROKEN STONE Classification of Stones . This term ordinarily signifies the product of a stone crusher or the result of hand-breaking by hammering large blocks of stone ; but the term may also include gravel , described below . The best , hardest , and most durable broken stone comes from the trap rock , which are dark , heavy , close-grained rocks of igneous origin . The term granite is usually made to include not only true granite , but also gneiss , mica schist , syenite , etc . These are just as good for concrete work , and are usually less expensive . Limestone is suitable for some kinds of concrete work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite or trap rock , and it is more affected by a conflagration . Conglomerate , often called pudding stone , makes a very good concrete stone . The value of sandstone for concrete is very variable according to its texture . Some grades are very coinpact , hard , and tough , and make a good concrete ; other grades arc friable , and , like shale and slate , are practically unfit for use . Gravel consists of pebbles of various sizes , produced from stones which have been broken up and then worn smooth with rounded corners . The very fact that they have been exposed for indefinite periods to atmospheric disintegration and mecianical wear is a proof of the durability and mechanical strength of the stone . Size of Stone and Its Uniformity . There is hardly any limi tion to the size of stone which may be used in large blocks of mass e concrete , since it is now frequently the custom to insert these large blocks and fill the spaces between them with a concrete of smaller stone . But the term broken stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be readily mixed up in a mass , as is done when mixing concrete ; and this virtually limits the size to stones which will pass through a 21-inch ring . The lower limit in size is very indefinite , since the product of a stone crusher includes all sizes doll n to stone dust screenings , such as are substituted partially or entirely for sand , as previously noted . Practically the only use of broken stone in masonry construction is in the making of concrete ; and , since one of the most essential features of good concrete construction is that the concrete shall have the greatest possible density , it is important to reduce the percentage of voids in the stone as much as possible . This percentage can be determined with sufficient 39  | accuracy for ordinary unimportant work , by the very simple method previously described for obtaining that percentage with sand ? namely , by measuring how much water will be required to fill up the cavities in a given volume of dry stone . As before , such a simple determination is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be retained in the stone which will reduce the percentage somewhat , and also because of the uncertainty involved as to whether the stone is previously dry or is saturated with water . Some engineers drop the stone slowly into the vessel containing the water , rather than pour the water into the vessel containing the stone , with the idea that the error due to the formation of air bubbles will be decreased by this method . The percentage of error , however , due to such causes , is far less than it is in a similar test of sand , and the error for ordinary work is too small to have any practical effect on the result . Illustrative Example . A pail having a mean inside diameter of 10 inches and a height of 14 inches is filled with broken stone well shaken down ; a similar pail filled with water to a depth of 8 inches is poured into the pail of stone until the water fills up all the cavities and is level with the top of the stone ; there is still 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a depth of 54 inches has been used to fill up the voids . The area of a 10-inch circle is 78.54 square inches and therefore the volume of the broken stone was 78.54X14 =1,099.56 cubic inches . The volume of the water used to fill the pail was 78.54X5.75 , or 451.6 cubic inches . This is 41 per cent of the volume of the stone , and is in this case the percentage of voids . The accuracy of the above computation depends largely on the accuracy of the measurement of the mean inside diameter of the pail . If the pail were truly cylindrical , there would be no inaccuracy . If the pail is flaring , the inaccuracy might be considerable ; and if a precise value is desired , more accurate methods should be chosen to measure the volume of the stone and of the water . Screening of Stone . The product of a stone crusher is a mixture of all sizes , varying from " sand " to pieces which are perhaps undesirably large . The output should be screened through revolving screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected the various sizes , in quantity and proportion , which have been found by test to give the densest mixture of aggregate . Some-40  | times the finest of this crushed material is a " sand " which is equal to the best natural bank sand , but it all depends on the quality of the rock . At one time it was popular to use " the run of the crusher , " all sizes , without any screening , on the basis that it would make the most dense mixture of aggregate . While it is theoretically possible that a rock might be crushed to produce exactly the right proportions of fine and coarse aggregate , it is seldom that such a rock would be found or that the quality of the rock would be satisfactorily constant . Therefore it should be specified that all crusher products should be screened and that the " sand " from a crusher can only be used provided it complies with the regular sand specifications . Cinders . Cinders for concrete should be free from coal or soot . Usually a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cinders and then mixing in a larger proportion of sand , than by using unscreened material , although , if the fine stuff is uniformly distributed through the mass , it may be used without screening , and a less proportion of sand used . As shown later , the strength of cinder concrete is far less than that of stone concrete ; and on this account it can not be used where high compressive values are necessary . But on account of its very low cost compared with broken stone , especially under some conditions , it is used quite commonly for roofs , etc. , on whichte loads are comparatively small . One possible objection to the use of cinders lies in the fact that they frequently contain sulphur and other chemicals which may produce corrosion of the reinforcing steel . In any structure where the strength of the concrete is a matter of importance , cinders should not be used without a thorough inspection , and even then the unit of compressive values allowed should be at a very low figure . CONCRETE Concrete is composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gravel , which , after being mixed with water , soon sets and obtains a hardness and strength equal to that of a good building stone . These properties , together with its adaptability to monolithic construction , combined with its cheapness , render concrete very useful as a building material . 4.1  | Principles Used in Proportioning Concrete . Theoretically , the proportioning of the sand and cementing material should be done by weight . It is always ( lone in this way in laboratory testing . The volume of a given weight of cement is quite variable according as it is packed or loosely thrown in a pile . The same statement is true of sand . A barrel of Portland cement will increase in volume from 10 to 30 per cent by being merely dumped loosely in a pile and then shoveled into a measuring box . In measuring the materials for concrete the cement should be measured in the original packages as it comes from the manufacturer , but the sand and stone should be measured loose as it is thrown in the measuring boxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand . Loose dry sand occupies a considerably larger volume than wet sand , and this is still more the case when the sand is very fine . Ideal Conditions . The general principle to be adopted is that the amount of water should be just sufficient to supply that needed for crystallization of the cement paste ; that the amount of paste should he just sufficient to fill the voids between the particles of sand ; that the mortar thus produced should be just sufficient to fill the voids between the broken stones . If this ideal could be realized , the total volume of the mixed concrete would be no greater than that of the broken stone . But no matter how thoroughly and carefully the ingredients are mixed and rammed , the particles of cement will get between the grains of sand and thus cause the volume of the mortar to be greater than that of the sand ; the grains of sand will get between the smaller stones and separate them ; and the smaller stones will get between the larger stones and separate them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the volume of the mortar was only 70 per cent of the volume of the voids in the broken stone , the volume of the rammed concrete was n per cent more than that of the broken stone . When the theoretical amount of mortar was added , the volume was 7.5 per cent in excess , which shows that it is practically impossible to ram such concrete and wholly prevent voids . When mortar amounting to 140 per cent of the voids was used , all voids were apparently filled , but the volume of the concrete was 114 per cent of that of the broken stone . Conditions in Practice . Therefore , on account of the impracticability of securing perfect mixing , the amount of water used is 42  | always somewhat in excess ; the cement paste is generally made somewhat in excess of that required to fill the particles in the sand ( except in those cases where , for economy , the mortar is purposely made very lean ) ; and the amount of mortar is usually considerably in excess of that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we allow some excess in the above particulars , there is so much variation in the percentage of voids in the sand and broken stone , that the best work not only requires an experimental determination of the voids in the sand and stone which are being used ; but , on account of the liability to variation in those percentages , even in materials from the same source of supply , the best work requires a constant testing and revision of the proportions as the work proceeds . For less careful work , the proportions ordinarily adopted in practice are considered sufficiently accurate . Proportions . On the general principle that the voids in ordinary broken stone are somewhat less than half of the volume , it is a very common practice to use one-half as much sand as the volume of the broken stone . The proportion of cement is then varied according to the strength required in the structure , and according to the desire to economize . On this principle we have the familiar ratios 1:2:4 , 1:2 ; : 5 , 1:3:6 , and 1:4:8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the numbers give the relative proportions of the cement , sand , and stone respectively , the ratio o ' , the sand to the broken stone is a constant , and the ratio of the eer ' mnt is alone variable , for it would be just as correct to express the ratios as follows : 1:2:4 ; 0.8:2:4 ; 0.67:2:4 ; 0.5:2:4 . Cinder Concrete . Cinder concrete has been used to some extent on account of its light weight . The strength of cinder concrete is from one-third to one-half the strength of stone concrete . It will weigh about 110 pounds per cubic foot . Rubble Concrete . Rubble concrete is a concrete in which large stones are placed , and will be discussed in Part II . Compressive Strength . The compressive strength of concrete is the measure of its value , but since its compressive strength is so variable , depending on a very large number of factors , it becomes necessary to study the effect of variations in proportioning and in the character of the constituent materials , which will produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . 43  | A study of the results of many thousand tests , made at the Structural Materials Research Laboratory , through the cooperation of the Lewis Institute and the Portland Cement Association , has established a relation between the compressive strength of concrete and the amount of water used per sack of cement , Fig. 10 . This is more easily comprehended when we consider that the water and the cement combine chemically to make a binding paste or glue , which is weakened if the proportion of water is increased . The practical figure meaning of this truth is that the strength of , say , 1:2:4 concrete is indefinite unless the amount of water used is known . The minimum practicable amount of water is that which will produce concrete with the required workability , which will always be somewhat in excess of the minimum chemically required for crystallization . For mass concrete the water ratio can be low , since the concrete can be easily compacted . As the quantity of reinforcement within the forms is increased , it becomes more difficult to compact comparatively dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , and the amount of water must be increased to obtain the required workability . But increasing the amount of water per cubic foot or  | cement decreases its strength unless the amount of cement is increased proportionately . The water-cement-ratio method may be defined as that which selects a ratio which will produce a concrete with the required unit strength and using as much aggregate , fine and coarse , as the required workability will permit . The strength of such concrete is definite . On the other hand , if a mixture of , ay , 1:2:I concrete is found to be too stiff to be workable , merely adc , . ' ilg water will inevitably decrease its strength . But since the water must be added to make the concrete sufficiently workable , the required unit strength can be maintained by also adding enough cement to keep the water-cement ratio constant . The degree of workability required by the structural conditions is indicated by the " slump test , " to be described later . Accuracy and uniformity of results require that the total amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " surface water " ( in contradistinction to the water of absorption ) in damp or wet sand and stone as it is brought to the site of the work . The methods of determining the amount of this water in wet aggregate have already been given . A series of experiments made at the Watertown Arsenal for Mr. George A. Kimball , Chief Engineer of the Boston Elevated Railway Company , in 1899 , was one of the best sets of tests that have 45  | been published , and the results are given in Table II . Portland cement , coarse sharp sand , and stone up to 21 inches were used ; and when thoroughly rammed , the water barely flushed to the surface . But it should be noted that these tests , made many years ago , give no figures as to the amount of water used , except the indefinite statement that " when thoroughly rammed the water barely flushed to the surface . " Although not definite , this implies that the amount . of water was as little as the aggregate could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to cement ) in the 1:3:6 than in the 1 : 2:4 concrete , which of course made it weaker , as was shown by the tabulated results , and also that , based on the water-cement ratio curves of strength , as shown by test , the ratio for the 1:2:4 concrete was probably nearly 7 , and for the 1:3:6 concrete was about 7.3 . Correction for Moisture and Absorption. * " The correction for bulking is made by adding proportionately larger amounts of the bulked aggregate to secure any desired actual volume of dry compact aggregate . " A typical numerical example will readily explain the method . Thus , if a dry compact mix of 1:21:31 is to be used with the above aggregates in Table III , the proportion based on volume of loose sand will be 24 X1.21 =2.7 and of the coarse aggregate 3 z X 1.06 =3.7 , giving a. field mix of 1:2.7:3.7 . To maintain uniform amounts of aggregate at the mixer , allowance for changes in bulking due to changes in moisture content should be made by corresponding changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During recent years , the necessity for using a high ratio of cement to aggregate , in order to produce a concrete that will be durable in exposed situations , such as where the concrete is subjected to sea water or alkaline water , has led to the use of a water-cement ratio as low as 51 . Tests have shown that this will make a concrete which will carry 3500 pounds per square *The greater part of this discussion on water-cement ratio has been condensed ( or copied ) , by permission , from the pamphlet " llesigtn and Control of Concrete Mixtures , " as published by the Portland Cement Association  | figure inch compression in 28 days , which is perhaps more than would otherwise be required . As the exposure conditions diminish , the watercement ratio can be safely increased . The recommended values which should be used under varying conditions have been tabulated in Table IV . Table IV shows that , for the interior work in buildings , where to structural members are protected , the ratio 71- may be used . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , days of a little over 2110 ( 1 pounds , and when special care is taken to select sand and stone so as to give the maximum density the strength will be still more . But if a , strength of 25 ( 1 ( 1 pounds in 28 days is needed , the water-cement ratio should be cut to The exterior columns and wall girders of a building , where not protected by a facing of brick or tile , should use the ratio 61 . As the degree of exposure to weather , frost , or chemicals increases , the number of gallons of water per sack of cement should diminish . A " sack " of cement is officially 94 pounds . While its volume may be varied slightly by compacting , the volume of a sack is always estimated as exactly one cubic foot , whenever it is necessary or desirable to consider its volume . The ratio of " gallons of water per sack of cement " is the most convenient for actual working . The 71 ratio , for exCoarse : Aggregate 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic feet of water to l cubic foot of cement . Slump Test . The proportions of cement to fine and to coarse aggregate depends on the character of the sand and stone which will actually be used for the particular work to be designed . The proportions must be somewhat varied in accordance with the aggregates which are commercially and economically obtainable for that work . The slump will depend on the desired workability of the concrete in the various parts of the structure . For example , in footings , where the reinforcing steel is usually spaced several inches apart , there is no difficulty in compacting a comparatively dry concrete . On the other hand , in a column , or a narrow and deep beam , where the reinforcement interferes with the free use of a tamping iron , and even clogs the free flow of concrete when it is poured , a much wetter and more workable concrete must be used . The slump test is made by filling with concrete a mould , which is a metal frustrum of a cone , as shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top or bottom , is placed on a flat non-absorbent surface . The mould is filled with layers of  | concrete , lightly tamped , the final layer being smoothed off level with the top . At exactly three minutes after being filled , the mould is raised vertically . The concrete will at once begin to slump . When quiescent , the slump from the 12-inch height is measured . This is readily done by placing the metal mould alongside the figure specimen , placing a straightedge horizontally across the mould and above the specimen . A foot-rule then readily measures the slump . A very stiff concrete may slump less than 1 inch ; a very wet concrete may slump as much as 8 inches , but that is the limit . Slumps of 3 to ( i should ordinarily be used for reinforced work , bearing in mind that concretes with least slumps are the most economical , provided it is practicable to spade and ram the concrete around the reinforcing 4 )  | steel sufficiently to make the concrete really dense and without holes , and provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not more expensive than to use more water ( and of course proportionately more cement ) for the same amount of aggregate . Proportions of Cement and Aggregates . Where the magnitude of the work will justify it , the proportioning is best done by selecting the aggregates several weeks before any concreting is done . This allows time for testing several combinations of cement and aggregates , using at least four different water-cement ratios and plotting the several results as to density and compressive strength . From the curves thus plotted , the particular combination which will furnish a concrete having the required density and strength , but will also be most economical of cement , may be selected . And even this combination may need to be varied somewhat , as the work proceeds . in case there is any material change in the character ( size or quality ) of the sand or coarse aggregate which is brought to the work . Frequency of Making Tests . " The frequency of making tests will depend largely upon the uniformity of the aggregates . At the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more times a day , but as the work progresses they may be made at longer intervals . When the aggregates are uniform and are properly handled to maintain this uniformity , it may be necessary to make some of the tests only at infrequent intervals . Usually moisture tests are made once or twice a day . After the inspector has made a few tests , he will be able to judge the moisture content fairly accurately and it will be necessary to make a test only when the change is apparent . The slump test is made whenever the appearance of the concrete indicates a change in consistency or as a matter of routine inspection for record . " Measuring Equipment . Concrete of definitely known strength can not be made unless the absolute quantities of all the materials , including the water , are known and are used in definite proportions . The foregoing pages have shown the variation in strength produced by a change in proportions , which are in turn due to the change in volume on account of bulking and to the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of the work . Uncertainty regarding these quantities makes equally uncertain the real strength of the concrete . On work of any importance this justifies the use of  | equipment which will , more or less automatically , measure definite ( laamrtities ( or weights , not volumes ) of the materials . There are devices for " inundating " the sand , which automatically avoid the necessity for making any allowance for bulking . Water tanks are made with automatic shut-offs , to operate when the required amount of water has been introduced into the mixture . These devices are locked so that no extra water can be used except by direct authorization of the engineer or inspector . Even the older types of machine mixers can be calibrated so that , after making the proper allowance for bulking , the true quantities may be readily measured ; and still further allowances , plus or minus , may be made for the variations in the aggregates , which frequent testing has shown to be necessary . Time of Mixing . Tests show that the strength of concrete and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the time of mixing . There is a rapid increase in strength up to two minutes , and an additional percentage of increase when the time of mixing is made five minutes . The added strength , workability , and imperviousness are cheaply bought by increasing the time of mixing . Time-locking device : ? lave been used to insure full-time mixing . The time should never be less than two minutes ; three or four minutes are justified by the ten per cent increase in strength . When imperviousness is a vital quality of the work , four or five minutes ' mixing should be required in the specifications . Water=Cement Ratio for Average Materials. * " Where no preliminary tests of the materials to be used are made , the water-cement ratios shall not exceed the values in Table V. The mixes shown in the table are approximate only , and may require adjustment to give proper workability . " The amounts of materials used per cubic yard for various proportions are given in Tables VI , VII , VIII , and IX . Proper Proportions Determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions of concrete is by trial batches . The apparatus consists of a scale and a cylinder which may be a piece of wrought-iron pipe from 10 to 12 inches in diameter capped at one end . Measure and weigh the cement , sand , stone , and water and mix on a piece of sheet steel , the mixture having footnote " From the Joint Code , Building negulations for Reinforced Concrete , as adopted by the American Concrete Institute , and also by the Reinforcing Steel . Institute . 51  | a consistency the same as to be used in the work . The mixture is placed in the cylinder , carefully tamped , and the height to which the pipe is filled is noted . The pipe should be weighed before and after being filled so as to check the weight of the material . The cylinder is then emptied and cleaned . Mix up another batch using the same amount of cement and water , slightly varying the ratio of the sand and stone but having the same total weight as before . Note the height in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batches to be tried . Several trials are made until a mixture is found that gives the least height in the cylinder , and at the same time works well while mixing , all the stones being covered with mortar , and which makes a good appearance . This method gives very good results , but it does not indicate the changes in the physical sizes of the sand and stone so as to secure the most economical composition , as would be shown in a thorough mechanical analysis .  | figure  | There has been much concrete work done where the proportions were selected without any reference to voids , which has given much better results in practice than might be expected . The proportion of cement to the aggregate depends upon the nature of the construction and the required degree of strength , or water-tightness , as well as upon the character of the inert materials . Both strength and imperviousness increase with the proportion of cement to the aggregate . Richer mixtures are necessary for loaded columns , beams in building construction and arches for thin walls subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The actual measurements of materials as actually mixed and used usually show leaner mixtures than the nominal proportions specified . This is largely due to the heaping of the measuring boxes . Methods of Mixing . The method of mixing concrete is immaterial , if a homogeneous mass , containing the cement , sand , and stone in the correct proportions is secured . The value of the concrete depends greatly upon the thoroughness of the mixing . The color of the mass must be uniform and every grain of sand and piece of the stone should have cement adhering to every point of its surface . Transporting and Depositing Concrete . Concrete is usually deposited in layers of 6 inches to 12 inches in thickness . In handling and transporting concrete , care must be taken to prevent the separation of the stone from the mortar . The usual method of transporting concrete is by wheelbarrows , " buggies , " or through chutes . On larger operations it is loaded into large skips , which are raised by power hoists as high as desired , and then dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the points of deposition or into wheelbarrows or buggies , which distribute it as needed . Of course the hoists must be extended and the chutes rearranged as the work proceeds . In any case the essential requirement is that the concrete shall flow in a steady stream and not fall in such a way that the mixture disintegrates and separates the mortar from the aggregate . Skill and ingenuity are required to so design such a distributing system , which is necessarily quite expensive , that the maximum amount of concrete shall be distributed for each shift of the distributing system , and also that the conerte mixture does not disintegrate .  | Ramming Concrete . Immediately after concrete is placed , it should be rammed or puddled , care being taken to force out the air bubbles . The amount of ramming necessary depends upon how much water is used in mixing the concrete . If a very wet mixture is used , there is danger of too much ramming , which results in wedging the stones together and forcing the cement and sand to the surface . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expel the bubbles of air . The style of rammer used depends on whether a dry , medium , or very wet mixture is used . A rammer for dry concrete is shown in figure Fig. 12 ; and one for wet concrete in Fig. 13 . In very thin walls , where a wet mixture is used , often the tamping or puddling is done with a part of a reinforcing bar . A common spade is often employed for the face of work , being used to push back stones that may have separated from the mass , and also to work the finer portions of the mass to the face , the method being to work the spade up and down the face until it is thoroughly filled . Care must be taken not to pry with the spade , as this will spring the forms unless they are very strong . Bonding Old and New Concrete . To secure a water-tight joint between old and new concrete requires a great deal of care . Where the strain is chiefly compressive , as in foundations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be washed with clean water , no other precautions being necessary . In walls and floors , or where  | a tensile stress is apt to be applied , the joint should be thoroughly washed and soaked , and then painted with neat cement or a mixture of one part cement and one part sand , made into a very thin mortar . In the construction of tanks or any other work that is to be water-tight , in which the concrete is not placed in one continuous operation , one or more square or V-shaped joints are necessary . These joints are formed by a piece of timber , say 4 inches by 6 inches , being imbedded in the surface of the last concrete laid each day . On the following morning when the timber is removed , the joint is washed and coated with neat cement or 1 : 1 mortar . The joints may be either horizontal or vertical . The bond between old and new concrete may be aided by roughening the surface after ramming or before placing the new concrete . Effects of Freezing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuously denied , that concrete is uninjured if it freezes before it sets , provided that it is not disturbed and not subjected to any stress when it thaws and has a proper opportunity to set afterward . Of course the setting and hardening is greatly retarded and the forms must not be disturbed until there is positive evidence that the concrete has really hardened and set and has not merely frozen . But , in spite of occasional instances when concrete , which has frozen before setting , has afterward hardened satisfactorily , the results are always uncertain , and good practice always avoids the placing of concrete in freezing weather unless certain preventive methods are employed , the extra expense of which is justified by the circumstances . Preventive Methods . There are two methods which may be used to prevent injury to concrete when laid in freezing weather : First : Heat the sand and stone and use hot water in mixing the concrete . Second : Protect the green concrete by enclosing it and keeping the temperature of the enclosure above the freezing point . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate , the frost is driven from it ; hot water alone is insufficient to get the frost out of the frozen lumps of sand . If the heated aggregate is mixed with water which is hot but not boiling , experience has shown that a comparatively high temperature can be maintained for several hours , which will usually carry it through the initial set  | safely . The heating of the materials also hastens the setting of the cement . If the fresh concrete is covered with canvas or other material , it will assist in maintaining a higher temperature . The canvas , however , must not be laid directly on the concrete , but an air space of several inches must be left between the concrete and the canvas . The aggregate is heated by means of steam pipes laid in the bottom of the bins or by having pipes of strong sheet iron , about 18 inches in diameter , laid through the bottom of the bins , and fires built in the pipes . The water may be heated by steam jets or other means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe weather , by the use of a steam coil on the outside , and jets of steam on the inside . The second method is the most expensive , kd is used only in building construction . It consists in construcMlg a light wood frame over the site of the work , and covering the frame with camas or other material . The temperature of the enclosure is maintained above the freezing point by means of stoves or " salamanders . " Sometimes the first method is used alone , say during the spring months or early fall , or in southern climates when it is considered that the heat in the materials will prevent freezing until the concrete has set sufficiently and has reached the stage of crystallization where freezing is impossible . For all important work in the construction of buildings , especially during the winter months in northern climates , both methods are combined . WATERPROOFING CONCRETE Concrete Not Generally Water=Tight . Concrete as ordinarily mixed and placed is not generally water-tight , but experience has shown that where concrete is proportioned to obtain the greatest practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . However , it is difficult , on large masses of actual work , to produce concrete of such close texture as to prevent seepage at all points . It has frequently been observed that when concrete was green there was a considerable seepage through it , and that in a short time all seepage stopped . Concrete has been made practically water-tight by forcing through it water which contained a small amount of cement or cement and fine sand .  | Nature of Waterproofing Methods . Compounds of various kinds have been mixed with concrete or applied as a wash to the surface to make the concrete water-tight . Many of the compounds are of but temporary value and in time lose their usefulness as a waterproofing material . E , f'ect of Steel Reinforcement . Reinforcing steel properly proportioned and located both horizontally and vertically in long walls , subways , and reservoirs , will greatly assist in rendering the concrete impervious by reducing the cracks so that if they do occur they will he too minute to permit leakage , or the small cracks will soon fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walls . Several successful methods of waterproofing will be given here , and most of these methods will also apply to stone and brickwork . In the operation of waterproofing , a very common mistake is made in applying the waterproofing materials on the wrong side of the wall to be made water-tight . That is , if water finds its way through a cellar wall , it is useless to apply a waterproofing coat on the inside surface of the wall , as the pressure of the water will push it off . If , however , there is no great pressure behind it , a waterproofing coat applied on the inside of the wall may be successful in keeping moisture out of the cellar . To be successful in waterproofing a cellar wall , the waterproofing material should be applied on the outside surface of the wall ; and if properly applied , the wall , as well as the cellar , will be entirely free of water . In tank or reservoir construction , the conditions are different , in that it is generally desired to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterproofing is applied on the inside surface , and is supported by the materials used in constructing the tank or reservoir . The structure should always be designed so that it can be properly waterproofed , and the waterproofing should always be applied on the side of the wall on which the pressure exists . Waterproofing Methods . Plastering . For cisterns , swimming pools , or reservoirs , two coats of Portland cement grout ? 1 part cement , 2 parts sand ? applied on the inside , have been used to make the concrete water-tight . One inch of rich mortar has usually been found effective under medium pressure . 58  | At Attleboro , Mass. , a large reinforced concrete standpipe , 50 feet in diameter , 106 feet high from the inside of the bottom to the top of the cornice , and with a capacity of 1,500,000 gallons , has been constructed , and is in the service of the waterworks of that city . The walls of the standpipe are 18 inches thick at the bottom and 8 inches thick at the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 4 parts broken stone , the stone varying from 4 inch to 1 i inches , was used . The forms were constructed , and the concrete placed , in sections of 7 feet . When the walls of the tank had been completed , there was some leakage at the bottom with a head of water of 100 feet . The inside walls were then thoroughly cleaned and picked , and four coats of plaster applied . The first coat contained 2 per cent of lime to 1 part of cement and 1 part of sand ; the remaining three coats were composed of 1 part sand to I kart cement . Each coat was floated until a hard dense surface was produced ; then it was scratched to receive the succeeding coat . On filling the standpipe after the four coats of plaster had been applied , the standpipe was found to be not absolutely water-tight . The water was drawn out ; and four coats of a solution of castile soap and one of alum , were applied alternately ; and , under a 100-foot head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leakage occurred - at the joints ; but in several instances a mixture somewhat wetter than usual was used , with the result that the spading and ramming served to drive the stone to the bottom of the batch being placed , and , as a consequence , in these places porous spots occurred . The joints were obtained by inserting beveled tonguing pieces , and by thoroughly washing the joint and covering it with a layer of thin grout before placing additional concrete . Mum and Soap ; Linseed Oil . Mortar may be made practically non-absorbent by the addition of alum and potash soap . One per cent by weight of powdered alum is added to the dry cement and sand , and thoroughly mixed ; and about one per cent of any potash soap ( ordinary soft soap ) is dissolved in the water used in the mortar . A solution consisting of 1 pound of concentrated lye , 5 pounds of alum , and 2 gallons of water , applied while the concrete is green and until it lathers freely , has been successfully used . Coating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be absorbed is another method that has been used with success .  | hydrated Lime . Hydrated lime has been successfully used to render concrete impervious . The very fine particles of the lime fill the voids that would be otherwise left , thereby , increasing the density of the concrete . For a 1 : 2 : 4 concrete hydrated lime amounting to six to eight per cent of the weight of the cement is used . When it is used in a leaner mixture the percentage of lime is increased , that is , for a 1:3:6 concrete a percentage of lime up to 16 or 18 per cent is sometimes used . Sylvester Process . The alternate application of washes of castile soap and alum , each being dissolved in water , is known as the Sylvester process of waterproofing . Castile soap is dissolved in water , 4 of a pound of soap to a gallon of water , and applied boiling hot to the concrete surface with a flat brush , care being taken not to form a froth . The alum dissolved in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is applied 24 hours later , the soap having had time to become dry and hard . The second wash is applied in the same manner as the first , at a temperature of 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The alternate coats of soap and alum are repeated every 24 hours . Usually four coats will make an impervious coating . The soap and alum combine and form an insoluble compound , filling the pores of the concrete and preventing the seepage of water . The walls should be clean and dry , and the temperature of the air not lower than 50 degrees Fahrenheit , when the composition is applied . The composition should be applied while the concrete is still green . This method of waterproofing has been used extensively for years , and has generally given satisfactory results for moderate pressures . Asphalt . Asphalt is laid in thicknesses from 4 inch to 1 inch as a waterproofing course . It is usually laid in one or more continuous sheets . It is also used for filling in contraction joints in concrete . The backs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick , are often coated with asphalt to make them waterproof , the asphalt being applied hot with a mop . The bottoms of reservoirs have been constructed of concrete blocks six to eight feet square with asphalt joints inch to z inch in thickness and extending at least halfway through the joint , that is , for a block 6 inches in thickness the asphalt would extend down at least 3 inches . Asphalt is a mineral substance composed of different hydrocarbons , which are widely scattered throughout the world . There  | is a great variety of forms in which it is found , ranging from volatile liquids to thick semi-fluids and solids . These are usually intermixed with different kinds of inorganic or organic matter , but are sometimes found in a free or pure state . Liquid varieties are known as naphtha and petroleum ; the viscous or semi-fluid as maltha or mineral tar ; and the solid as asphalt or asphaltvm . The most noted deposit of asphalt , which is used extensively in this country for paving and roofing materials , is found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bituminous limestone deposited at Seyssel and Pyrimont , France ; in Val-de-Travers , Canton of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; and at Ragusa , Sicily , are known as rock asphalt and are perhaps the best for waterprofing purposes . In the construction of the filter plant at Lancaster , Pa. , in 1905 , a pure-water basin and several circular tanks were constructed of reinforced concrete . The pure-water basin is 100 feet wide by 200 feet long and 14 feet deep , with buttresses spaced 12 feet 6 inches center to center . The walls at the bottom are 15 inches thick , and 12 inches thick at the top . Four circular tanks are 50 feet in diameter and 10 feet high , and eight tanks are 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet high . The walls are 10 inches thick at the bottom , and 6 inches at the top . A wet mixture of 1 part cement , 3 parts sand , and 5 parts stone was used . No waterproofing material was used in the construction of the tanks ; and when tested two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two had a few leaks where wires which had been used to hold the forms together had pulled out when the forms were taken down . These holes were stopped up and no further trouble was experienced . In constructing the floor of the pure-water basin , a thin layer of asphalt was used as shown in Fig. 14 , but no waterproofing material was used in the walls , and both were found to be water-tight . Felt Laid with Asphalt , Alternate layers of paper or felt are laid with asphalt or tar , and are frequently used to waterproof floors , tunnels , subways , roofs , arches , etc . These materials range from ordinary tar paper laid with coal-tar pitch or asphalt to asbestos or asphalt felt laid in coal-tar or asphalt . Coal-tar products have come into very common use for this work but the coal-tar should contain a large percentage of carbon to be satisfactory . st  | In using these materials for rendering concrete water-tight , usually a layer of concrete or brick is first laid . On this is mopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then laid on the asphalt , the latter being lapped from 6 to 12 inches . After the first layer of felt is placed , it is mopped over with hot asphalt compound , and another layer of felt or paper is laid , the operation being repeated until the desired thickness is secured , which is usually from 2 to 10 layers or , in other words , the waterproofing varies from 2-ply to 10-ply . A waterproofing course of this kind , or a course as described in the paragraph on asphalt waterproofing , forms a distinct joint , and the strength in bending of the concrete on the two sides of the layer must be considered independently . figure When asphalt , or asphalt laid with felt paper , is used for waterproofing the interiors of the walls of tanks , a 4-inch course of brick is required to protect and hold in place the waterproofing materials . Fig. 15 shows a wall section of a reservoir ( Engineering Record , Sept. 21 , 1907 ) constructed for the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this reservoir consist of 4-ply " Hydrex " felt , and " Hydrex " compound was used to cement the layers together . Fig. 16 is an illustration of the method used by the Barrett Manufacturing Company in applying their 5-ply coal-tar pitch and felt roofing material . It illustrates in a general way the method used in applying waterproofing . The surfaces to be waterproofed are mopped with pitch or asphalt . While the pitch is still hot , a layer of felt is placed , which is followed with alternate layers of pitch or asphalt until the required number of layers of felt has been secured . In no place should one layer of felt be permitted to touch 62  | the layer above or below it . When the last layer of felt is laid and thoroughly mopped with the coal-tar , something should be placed over the entire surface waterproofed to protect it from being injured . For roofing , this protection is gravel , as shown in Fig. 16 . In water-figure proofing the back of concrete or stone arches usually a layer of brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with pitch . Bricks used in this manner also assist in holding the waterproofing in place . Five layers of felt and pitch should be a sufficient protection against a head of water of ten feet . PRESERVATION OF STEEL IN CONCRETE Short Time Tests . Tests have been made to find the value of Portland cement concrete as a protection of steel or iron from corrosion . Nearly all of these tests have been of short duration ( from a few weeks to several months ) ; but they have clearly shown , when the steel or iron is properly imbedded in concrete , that on being removed therefrom it is clean and bright . Steel removed from concrete containing cracks or voids usually shows rust at the points where the voids or cracks occur ; but if the steel has been completely 63  | covered with concrete , there is no corrosion . Tests have shown that if corroded steel is imbedded in concrete , the concrete will remove the rust . To secure the best results , the concrete should be mixed quite wet , and care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete . Cinder vs . Stone Concrete . A compact cinder concrete has proven about as effective a protection for steel as stone concrete . The corrosion found in cinder concrete is mainly due to iron oxide or rust in the cinders , and not to the sulphur . The amount of sulphur in cinders is extremely small , and there seems to be little danger from that source . A steel-frame building erected in New York in 1498 had all its framework , except the columns , imbedded in cinder concrete ; when the building was demolished in 1903 , the frame showed practically no rust which could be considered as having developed after the material was imbedded . Practical Illustrations . Cement washes , paints , and plasters have been used for a long time , in both the United States and Europe , for the purpose of protecting iron and steel from rust . The engineers of the Boston Subway , after making careful tests and investigations , adopted Portland cement paint for the protection of the steel work in that structure . The railroad companies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from corrosion . Two coats of the cement paint and sand are applied with leather brushes . A concrete-steel water main on the Monier system , 12 inches in diameter , 1.6 inches thick , containing a steel framework of 4-inch and 1 6-inch steel rods , was taken up after 15 years ' use in wet ground , at Grenoble , France . The adhesion was found perfect , and the metal absolutely free from rust . William Sooy Smith , ' 1 . Am . Soc . C. E. , states that in removing a bed of concrete at a lighthouse in the Straits of Mackinac , twenty years after it was laid , and ten feet below water surface , imbedded iron drift-bolts were found free from rust . A very good example of the preservation of steel imbedded in concrete is given by Mr. 11 . C. Turner ( Engineering News , January 16 , 1908 ) . Mr. Turner 's company has recently torn down a one-story reinforced-concrete building erected by his company in 1902 , at New Brighton , Staten Island . The building had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean tide level . The footings , side walls ,  | columns , and roof were all constructed of reinforced concrete . The portion removed was 30 by 60 feet , and was razed to make room for a five-story building . In concluding his account , Mr. Turner says : " All steel reinforcement was found in perfect preservation , excepting in a few cases where the hoops were allowed to come closer than 4 inch to the surface . Some evidence of corrosion was found in such cases , thus demonstrating the necessity of keeping the steel reinforcement at least 4 inch from the surface . The footings were covered by the tide twice daily.The concrete was extremely hard , and showed no weakness whatever from the anion of the salt water . The steel bars in the footings were perfectly preserved , even in cases where the concrete protection was only inch thick . " Tests by Professor Norton . Professor C. L. Norton made several experiments with concrete bricks , 3 by 3 by 8 inches , in which steel rods , sheet metal , and expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes with unprotected steel and were exposed for three weeks . One portion was exposed to steam , air , and carbon dioxide ; another to air and steam ; another to air and carbon dioxide ; and another was left in the testing room . In these tests , Portland cement was used . The bricks were made of neat cement of 1 part cement and 3 parts sand ; of 1 part cement and 5 parts stone ; and of 1 part cement and 7 parts cinders . After the steel had been imbedded in these blocks three weeks , they were opened and the steel examined and compared with specimens which had been unprotected in corresponding boxes in the open air . The unprotected specimens consisted of rather more rust than steel ; the specimens imbedded in neat cement were found to be perfectly protected ; the rest of the specimens showed more or less corrosion . Professor Norton 's conclusions were as follows : 1 . Neat Portland cement is a very effective preventive against rusting. 2 . Concrete , to be effective in preventing rust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be mixed wet when applied to steel . 3 . The corrosion found in cinder concrete is mainly due to iron oxide in the cinders , and not to sulphur . 4 . Cinder concrete , if free from voids and well rammed when wet , is about as effective as stone concrete . 5 . It is very important that the steel be clean when imbedded in concrete . FIRE PROTECTIVE QUALITIES OF CONCRETE High Resisting Qualities . The various tests which have been conducted ? including the involuntary tests made as the result of fires have shown that the fire-resisting qualities of concrete , and  | even resistance to a combination of fire and water , are greater than those of any other known type of building construction . Fires and experiments which test buildings of reinforced concrete have proved that where the temperature ranges from 1400 to 1900 degrees Fahrenheit , the surface of the concrete may be injured to a depth of to 4 inch or even of one inch ; but the body of the concrete is not affected , and the only repairs required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thickness of Concrete Required for Fireproofing . Actual fires and tests have shown that 2 inches of concrete will protect an I-beam with good assurance of safety . Reinforced concrete beams and girders should have a clear thickness of 1-1 inches of concrete outside the steel on the sides and 2 inches on the bottom ; slabs should have at least 1 inch below the slab bars , and columns 2 inches . Structural steel columns should have at least 2 inches of concrete outside of the farthest projecting edge . Theory . The theory of the fireproofing qualities of Portland cement concrete given by Mr. Spencer B. Newberry is that the capacity of , the concrete to resist fire and prevent its transference to steel is due to its combined water and porosity . In hardening , concrete takes up 12 to 1 S per cent of the water contained in the cement . This water is chemically combined , and not given off at the boiling point . On heating , a part of the water is given off at 500 degrees Fahrenheit , but dehydration does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass is kept for a long time at comparatively low temperature by the vaporization of water absorbing heat . A steel beam imbedded in concrete is thus cooled by the volatilization of water in the surrounding concrete . Resistance to the passage of heat is offered by the porosity of concrete . Air is a poor conductor , and an air space is an efficient protection against conduction . The outside of the concrete may reach a high temperature ; but the heat only slowly and imperfectly penetrates the mass , and reaches the steel so gradually that it is carried off by the metal as fast as it is supplied . Cinder vs . Stone Concrete . Mr. Newberry says : " Porous substances , such as asbestos , mineral wool , etc. , are always used as heat-insulating material . For this same reason , cinder concrete , being highly porous , is a much better non-conductor than a dense  | concrete made of sand and gravel or stone , and has the added advantage of being light . " Professor Norton , on the other hand , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Baltimore fire of February , 1904 , states that there is but little difference in the two concretes . The burning of bits of coal in poor cinder concrete is often balanced by the splitting of stones in the stone concrete . " However , owing to its density , the s ' zee concrete takes longer to heat through . " Fire and Water Tests . Under the direction of Prof. Francis C. Van Dyck , a test was made on December 26 , 1905 , on stone and cinder reinforced concrete , according to the standard fire and water tests of the New York Building Department . A building was constructed 16 feet by 25 feet , with a wall through the middle . The roof consisted of the two floors to be tested . One floor was a reinforced cinder concrete slab and steel I-beam construction ; and the other was a stone concrete slab and beam construction . The floors were designed for a safe load of 150 pounds per square foot , with a factor of safety of four . The object of the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , a temperature of about 1700 degrees Fahrenheit , during four hours , a load of 150 pounds per square foot being upon them ; and second , a stream of water forced upon them while still at about the temperature above stated . A column was placed in the chamber roofed by the rock concrete , and it was tested the same way . The fuel used was seasoned pine wood and the stoking was looked after by a man experienced in a pottery ; hence a very even fire was maintained , except at first , on the cinder concrete side , where the blaze began in one corner and spread rather slowly for some time . The water was supplied from a pump at which 90 pounds pressure was maintained , and was delivered through 200 feet of new cotton hose and a 1k-inch nozzle . Each side was drenched with water while at full temperature , apparently ; and the water was thrown as uniformly as possible over the surface to be tested , for the required time . The floors were then flooded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors and the column were the only parts submitted for tests , the slight cracking and pitting of the walls and partition need not be detailed . 67  | The column was practically intact , except that a few small pieces of the concrete were washed out where struck by the stream at close range . The metal , however , remained completely covered . On the rock concrete side , the beams showed naked metal up to within about 7 inches of the ends on one beam , and about 2 feet from the ends on the other beam . The reinforcing bars were denuded over an area of about 30 square feet near the center ; but no cracks developed , and the water poured on top seemed to come down only through the pipe set in for the pyrometer . On the cinder concrete side , the beams lost only a little of the edges of the covering , not showing the metal at all . There were no cracks on this side either , and the water came down through the pyrometer tube as on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area of about 24 square feet near the center . During the firing , both chambers were occasionally examined , and no cracking or flaking-off of the concrete could be detected . Hence the water did all the damage that was appparent at the end . During the test the floors supported the load they were designed to carry ; and on the following day the loads were increased to 600 pounds per square foot . The following is taken from Professor ' %an Dyck 's report : " ' rhe maximum deflection of the stone concrete before the application of water , was 2i F inches ; after application of water , 3-6 inches ; with normal temperature and original load , 3116 inches ; deflection after load of 600 pounds was added , 3f- inches . " The maximum deflection of the cinder concrete before the application of water , was 6A inches ; after application of water , 62 inches ; with normal temperature and original load , 51 inches ; deflection after a load of 600 pounds was added , 6 inches . These measurements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Results Shown in Baltimore Fire . Engineers and architects , who made reports on the Baltimore fire of February , 1904 , generally state that reinforced concrete construction stood very well much better than terra cotta . Professor Norton , in his report to the Insurance Engineering Experiment Station , says : " Where concrete floor-arches and concrete-steel construction received the full force of the fire , it appears to have stood well , distinctly better than the terra cotta . The reasons , I believe , are these : The concrete and steel expand at sensibly the same rate , and hence , when heated , do not subject each other  | to stress ; but terra cotta usually expands about twice as fast with increase in temperature as steel , and hence the partitions and floor-arches soon become too large to be contained by the steel members which under ordinary temperature properly enclose them . " METHODS OF MIXING CONCRETE Two methods are used in mixing concrete ? by hand and by machinery . Good concrete may be made by either method and in either case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a large quantity o concrete is required , it is cheaper to mix it by machinery . On smt jobs where the cost of erecting the plant , together with the interest and depreciation , divided by the number of cubic yards to be made , constitute a large item , or if frequent moving is required , it is very often cheaper to mix the concrete by hand . The relative cost of the two methods usually depends upon circumstances , and must be worked out in each individual case . Mixing by Hand . The placing and handling of materials and arranging the plant are varied by different engineers and contractors . In general the mixing of concrete is a simple operation , but should be carefully watched by an inspector . He should see ( 1 ) That the exact amount of stone and sand are measured out ; ( 2 ) That the cement and sand are thoroughly mixed ; ( 3 ) That the mass is thoroughly mixed ; ( 4 ) That the proper amount of water is used ; ( 5 ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6 ) That it is thoroughly rammed . Mixing Platform . The mixing platform , which is usually 10 to 20 feet square , is made of 1-inch or 2-inch plank planed on one side and well nailed to stringers , and should be placed as near the work as possible , but so situated that the stone can be dumped on one side of it and the sand on the opposite side . A very convenient way to measure the stone and sand is by the means of bottomless boxes . These boxes are of such a size that they hold the proper proportions of stone or sand to mix a batch of a certain amount . Cement is usually measured by the package , that is , by the barrel or bag , as they contain a definite amount of cement . Process of Mixing . The method used for mixing the concrete has little effect upon the strength of the concrete , if the mass has 69  | been turned a sufficient number of times to thoroughly mix them . One of the following methods is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ( a ) Cement and sand mixed dry and shoveled on the stone or gravel , leveled off , and wet as the mass is turned . ( b ) Cement and sand mixed dry , the stone measured and dumped on top of it , leveled off , and wet , as turned with shovels. ( c ) Cement and sand mixed into a mortar , the stone placed on top of it , and the mass turned . ( d ) Cement and sand mixed with water into a mortar which is shoveled on the gravel or stone and the mass turned with shovels. ( c ) Stone or gravel , sand , and cement spread in successive layers , mixed slightly and shoveled into a mound , water poured into the center , and the mass turned with shovels . The quantity of water is regulated by the appearance of the concrete . The best method of wetting the concrete is by measuring the water in pails . This insures a more uniform mixture than by spraying the mass with a hose . Mixing by Machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery . The economy is not only in the mixing itself but izr the appliances introduced in handling the raw materials and the mixed concrete . If all materials are delivered to the mixer in wheelbarrows , and if the concrete is conveyed away in wheelbarrows , the cost of making concrete is high , even if machine mixers are used . If the materials are fed from bins by gravity into the mixer , and if the concrete is dumped from the mixer into cars and hauled away , the cost of making the concrete should be very low . On small jobs the cost of maintaining and operating the mixer ill usually exceed the saving in hand labor and will render the expense with the machine greater than without it . Machine vs . Hand Mixing . It has already been stated that good concrete may be produced by either machine or hand mixing . if it is thoroughly mixed . Tests made by the U. S. Government engineers at Duluth , Minn. , to determine the relative strength of concrete mixed by hand and mixed by machine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handmixed concrete possessed only 53 per cent of the strength of the machine-mixed concrete ; at 28 days , 77 per cent ; at 6 months , 84 per cent ; and at one year , 88 per cent . Details of these tests are given in Table X.  | figure It should be noted in this connection , that the variations in strength from highest to lowest were greatest in the hand-mixed samples , and that the strength was more uniform in the machinemixed . Since the tensile strength of concrete is never utilized in structural calculations , these tests and Table N are chiefly useful as a demonstration of superiority of machine mixing over hand mixing . STEEL FOR REINFORCING CONCRETE Quality of Reinforcing Steel . Four classes of steel are used for reinforcing bars : three grades of billet steel and the steel of old railroad rails . The three grades of billet steel are the structural steel grade , the intermediate and the hard . Billet steel is made from new billets of either Bessemer or open-hearth steel , which definitely excludes re-rolled material . Old-rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the tensile strength and yield point are higher than the other grades , but they are more brittle and the elongation , when tested , is less than for structural steel . The structural steel grade can only be used with a working tension not to exceed 16,00 ( 1 pounds per square inch , which may be increased to 18,000 pounds for rail steel , or the intermediate or hard grades of billet steel . The intermediate grade is in favor for high-class work , since it combines higher permissible tensile stress and greater ductility than 71  | the hard grade , which makes it safer under vibrating loads . The old-rail steel is popular on account of- its lower price . Open-hearth steel is generally more uniform in quality , but is usually a little higher priced . TYPES OF BARS The steel bars used in reinforcing concrete usually consist of small bars of such shape and size that they may easily be bent and placed in the concrete so as to form a monolithic structure . To distribute the stress in the concrete , and secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required must be supplied in comparatively small sections . All types of the regularly rolled small bars of square , round , and rectangular section , as well as some of the smaller sections of structural steel , such as angles , T-bars , and channels , and also many special rolled bars , have been used for reinforcing concrete . These bars vary in size from 4 inch for light construction , up to 1. - I-  inches for heavy beams , and up to 2 inches for large columns . In Europe plain round bars have been extensively used for many years and the same is true in the United States , but not to the same extent as in Europe ; that is , in America a very much larger percentage of work has been done with deformed bars . Plain Bars . With plain bars , the transmission of stresses is dependent upon the adhesion between the concrete and the steel . Square and round bars show about the same adhesive strength , but the adhesive strength of flat bars is far below that of the round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle and easier obtained , and have , therefore , generally been used when plain bars were desirable . Structural Steel . Small angles , T-bars , and channels have been used to a greater extent in Europe than in this country . They are principally used where riveted skeleton work is prepared for the steel reinforcement ; and in this case , usually , it is desirable to have the steel work self-supporting . Deformed Bars . There are many forms of reinforcing materials on the market , differing from one another in the manner of forming the irregular projections on their surface . The object of all these special forms of bars is to furnish a bond with the concrete , independ-  | ent of adhesion . This bond formed between the deformed bar and the concrete is usually called a mechanical bond . Some of the most common types of bars used are the square twisted bar ; the corrugated ; the IIavemeyer ; and the Kahn . Square Twisted Bar . The twisted bar , shown in Fig. 17 , was one of the first steel bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of bar is a commercial square bar twisted while cold . There are two objects in twisting the bar first , to give the metal a mechanical bond with the concrete ; second , to increase the elastic limit and ultimate strength of the bar . In twisting the figure bars , usually one complete turn is given the bar in nine or ten diameters of the bars , with the result that the elastic limit of the bar is increased from 40 to 50 per cent , and the ultimate strength is increased from 25 to 35 per cent . These bars can readily be bought already twisted ; or , if it is desired , square bars may be bought and twisted on the site of the work . Corrugated Bar . The " corrugated " bar , which has corrugations as shown in Fig. 18 , was invented by Mr. A. L. Johnson , M. Am . Soc . C. E. These corrugations , or square shoulders , are placed at right angles to the axis of the bar , and their sides make an angle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ing the angle of friction between the bar and concrete . In size they range from 4 inch to 14 inches , their sectional area being the same as that of plain bars of the same size . These bars are rolled in both the common types round and square . Harenieyer Bar . The Havemeyer bar , Fig. 19 , was invented by Mr. J. F. Havemeyer . This has a uniform cross section throughout its length . The bonding of the bar to the concrete is uniform at all points , and the entire section is available for tensile strength . figure Kahn Bar . The Kahn bar , Fig. 20 , was invented by Mr. Julius Kahn , M. Am . Soc . C. E. This bar is designed with the assumption that the shear members should be rigidly connected to the horizontal members . The bar is rolled with a cross section as shown in the figure . The thin edges are cut and turned up and form the shear members . These bars are manufactured in several sizes . Standard Sizes . In September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Distributors , and Users of Concrete Reinforcement Bars was held in Washington , when they unanimously adopted the areas and sizes of bars as shown in Table XI , to become effective as applying to new production January 1 , 192.1 ; every effort to be made to clear current orders of eliminated sizes before March 1 , 1925 . This action cuts the number of standard sizes to eleven and eliminates many sizes which were formerly quite commonly used . The gradation , in percentage of increase from one size to the next larger , is so nearly uniform that there is no material disadvantage , while the conservation economy resulting from the elimination of needlessly small variations in sizes is very great . All designs in this course are based on the eleven sizes given in Table XI . Expanded Metal . Expanded metal , Fig. 21 , is made from plain sheets of steel , slit in regular lines and opened into meshes of any  | figure desired size or section of strand . It is commercially designated by giving the gage of the steel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most common manufactured sizes are given in Table XII . 75  | Steel Wire Fabric . Steel wire fabric reinforcement consists of a netting of heavy and light wires , usually with rectangular meshes . The heavy wires carry the load , and the light ones are used to space the heavier ones . There are many forms of wire fabric on the market . *SPECIFICATIONS FOR BILLET=STEEL REINFORCING BARS Process of Manufacture . Steel may be made by either the open-hearth or Bessemer process .

Methods of mixing and handling concrete by machinery is discussed in Part IV . Various details of the use of concrete in the construction of foundations , etc. , is discussed during the treatment of the several kinds of work . Rubble Concrete . Rubble concrete includes any class of concrete in which large stones are placed . The chief use of this concrete is in constructing dams , lock walls , breakwaters , retaining walls , and bridge piers . The cost of rubble concrete in large masses should be less than that of ordinary concrete , as the expense of crushing the stone used as rubble is saved , and each large stone replaces a portion of cement and aggregate ; therefore , this portion of cement is saved , as well as the labor of mixing it . The weight of a cubic foot of stone is greater than that of an equal amount of ordinary concrete , because of the pores in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases its value for certain classes of work . In comparing rubble concrete with rubble masonry , the former is usually found cheaper because it requires very little skilled labor . For walls 3 or 32 feet thick , the rubble masonry will usually be cheaper , owing to the saving in forms . Proportion and Size of Stone . Usually the proportion of rubble stone is expressed in percentage of the finished work . This percentage varies from 20 to 65 per cent . The percentage depends largely on the size of the stone used , as there must be nearly as much  | space left between small stones as between large ones . The percentage therefore increases with the size of the stones . When " oneman " or " two-man " rubble stone is used , about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the finished work is composed of these stones . When the stones are large enough to be handled with a derrick , the proportion is increased to about 23 per cent ; and to 55 per cent , or even 65 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic yards each . The distance between the stones may vary from 3 inches to 15 or IS inches . With a wet mixture of concrete , which is generally used , the stones can be placed much closer than if a dry mixture is used . With the latter mixture , the space must be sufficient to allow the concrete to be thoroughly rammed into all of the crevices . Specifications often state that no rubble stone shall be placed nearer the surface of the concrete than 6 to 12 inches . Rabble Masonry Faces . The faces of dams are very often built of rubble , ashlar , or cut stone , and the filling between the faces made of rubble concrete . For this style of construction , no forms are required . For rubble concrete , when the faces are not constructed of stone , wooden forms are constructed as for ordinary concrete . Comparison of Quantities of Materials . The mixture of concrete used for this class of work is often 1 part Portland cement , 3 parts sand , and 6 parts stone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Table VIII , Part I , are 1.05 bbls. cement , 0.44 cu . yd. sand , and 0.55 cu . yd. stone . If rubble concrete is used , and if the rubble stone laid averages 0.40 cubic yard for each yard of concrete , then 40 per cent of the cubic contents is rubble , and each of the other materials may be reduced 40 per cent . Reducing these quantities gives 1 .05 X 0.60 = 0.63 bbl. of cement ; 0.44X0.60=0.26 en . yd. sand ; and O.SSXO.60=0.53 cu . yd. of stone , per cubic yard of rubble concrete . The construction of a darn on the Quinebaug River is a good example of rubble concrete . The height of the dam varies from 30 to 45 feet above bed rock . The materials composing the concrete consist of bank sand and gravel excavated from the bars in the bed of the river . The rock and boulders were taken from the site of the dam , and were of varying sizes . Stones containing 2 to 24 cubic yards were used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of So  | the dam smaller stones were used . The total amount of concrete used in the dani was about 12,000 cubic yards . There was 1 cubic yards of concrete for each barrel of cement used . The concrete was mixed wet , and the large stones were so placed that no voids or hollows would exist iii the finished work . Depositing Concrete Under Water . In depositing concrete under water , some means must be taken to prevent the separation of the materials while passing through the water . The three principal methods are by means of closed buckets ; by means of cloth or paper bags ; and by means of tubes . Buckets . For depositing concrete by the first method , special buckets are made with a closed top and hinged bottom . Concrete deposited under water must be disturbed as little as possible and , in tipping a bucket , the material is apt to be disturbed . Several different types of buckets with hinged bottoms have been devised to open automatically when the place for depositing the concrete has been reached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are released by the slackening of the rope when the bucket reaches the bottom , and the doors are open as soon as the bucket begins to ascend . In another type , in which the handle extends do ? n the sides of the bucket to the bottom , the doors are opened by the handles sliding down when the bucket reaches the bottom . The doors are hinged to the sides of the bucket and , when opened , permit the concrete to be deposited in one mass . In depositing concrete by this means , it is found rather difficult to place the layers uniformly and to prevent the formation of mounds . Bags . This method of depositing concrete under water is by means of open-woven bags or paper bags , two-thirds to three-quarters filled . The bags are stink in the water and placed in courses ? if possible , header and stretcher system ? arranging each course as laid . The bagging is close enough to keep the cement from washing out and , at the same time , open enough to allow the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bags are crushed into irregular shapes which fit into each other tends to lock them together in a way that makes even an imperfect joint very effective . When the concrete is deposited in paper bags , the water quickly soaks the paper ; but the paper retains its strength long enough for the concrete to be deposited properly . 83  | Tubes . The third method of depositing concrete under water is by means of long tubes , 4 to 14 inches in diameter . The tubes extend from the surface of the water to the place where the concrete is to be deposited . If the tube is small , 4 to ( i inches in diameter , a cap is placed over the bottom , the tube filled with concrete and lowered to the bottom . The cap is then withdrawn , and as fast as the concrete drops out of the bottom , more is put in at the top of the tube , and there is thus a continuous stream of concrete deposited . When a large tube is used to deposit concrete in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if filled before being lowered . The foot of the tube is lowered to the bottom , and the water rises into the chute to the same level as that outside ; and into this water the concrete must be dumped until the water is wholly replaced or absorbed by the concrete . This has a tendency to separate the cement from the sand and gravel , and will take a yard or more of concrete to displace the water in the chute . There is a danger that this amount of badly washed concrete will be deposited whenever it is necessary to charge the chute . This danger occurs not only when the charge is accidentally lost , but whenever the work is begun in the morning , or at any other time . Whenever the work is stopped , the charge must be allowed to run out , or it would set in the tube . The tubes are usually charged by means of wheelbarrows , and a continuous flow of concrete must be maintained . When the chute has been filled , it is raised slowly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a conical heap at the foot . This method has also been used for grouting stone . In this case , a 2-inch pipe , perforated at the bottom , is used . The grout , on account of its great specific gravity , is sufficient to replace the water in the interstices between the stones , and firmly cement them into a mass of concrete . A mixture of one part cement and one part sand is the leanest mixture that can be used for this purpose , as there is a great tendency for the cement and sand to separate . FOUNDATIONS Importance of Foundations . It would be impossible to overemphasize the importance of foundations , because the very fact that the foundations are underground and out of sight detracts from the consideration that many will give to the subject . It is probably  | true that a yielding of the subsoil is responsible for a very large proportion of the structural failures which have occurred . It is also true that many failures of masonry , especially those of arches , are considered as failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masonry of the superstructure , which have really been due , however , to a settlement of the foundations , resulting in unexpected stresses in the superstructure . It is likewise true that the design of foundations is one which calls for the exercise of experience and broad judgment , to be able to interpret correctly such indications as are obtainable as to the real character of the subsoil and its probable resistance to concentrated pressure . Character of Soil . The character of soil on which it may be desired to place a structure varies all the way from the most solid rock to that of semi-fluid soils whose density is but little greater than that of water . The gradation between these extremes is so uniform that it is practically impossible to draw a definite line between any two grades . It is convenient , however , to group subsoils into three classes , the classification being based on the method used in making the foundation . These three classes of subsoils are : firm ; compressible ; and semi-fluid . Firm Subsoils . These comprise all soils which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth , that no treatment of the subsoil , or any other special method , needs to be adopted to obtain a sufficiently firm foundation . This , of course , practically means that the soil is so firm that it can safely withstand the desired unit pressure . It also means that a soil which might be classed as firm soil for a light building should be classed as compressible soil for a much heavier building . It frequently happens that the top layers must be removed from rock because the surface rock has become disintegrated by exposure to the atmosphere . Nothing further needs to be done to a subsoil of this kind . Compressible Subsoils . These include soils which might be considered as firm soils for light buildings , such as dwelling houses , but which could not withstand the concentrated pressure that would be produced , for example , by the piers or abutments of a bridge . Such soils may be made sufficiently firm by methods described later . Semi-Fluid Subsoils . These are soils such as are frequently round on the banks or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85  | they can not sustain , without settlement , even the load of a house , to say nothing of a heavier structure ; nor can they be materially improved by any reasonable method of compression . The only possible method of placing a heavy structure in such a locality consists in sinking some sort of a foundation through such soft soil until it reaches and is supported by a firm soil or by rock , which may be 50 or even 100 feet below the surface . The general methods of accomplishing these results will be detailed in the following pages . Examination of Soil with Auger . The first step is to excavate the surface soil to the depth at which it would be convenient to place the foundation and at which the soil appears , from mere inspection , to be sufficiently firm for the purpose . An examination of the trenches or foundation pits with a post auger or steel bar will generally be sufficient to determine the nature of the soil for any ordinary building . The depth to which such an examination can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nature of the soil . In ordinary soils there will not be much difficulty in extending such an examination 3 to 6 feet below the bottom of the foundation pits . In common soils or clay , boring 40 feet deep , or even deeper , can readily be made with a common wood auger , turned by men . From the samples brought up by the auger , the nature of the soil can be determined ; and some knowledge regarding the compactness of the soil can be determined in this manner . Testing Compressive Value of Soil . In order to test a soil to find its compressive value , the bottom of the pit should be leveled for a considerable area , and stakes should be driven at short intervals in each direction . The elevations of the tops of all the stakes should be very accurately taken with a spirit level . For convenience , all stakes should be driven to the same level . A mast whose base has an area one foot square can support a platform which may be loaded with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steel , etc . This load can be balanced with sufficient closeness so that some very light guys will maintain the unstable equilibrium of the platform . As the load on the platform is greatly increased , at some stage it will be noted that the mast and platform have begun to sink slightly , and also that the soil in a circle around the base of the mast has begun to rise . This is indicated by the rising of the tops of the stakes . Even a very ordinary soil may require a load of five or six 1  | tons on a square foot before any yielding will be observable . One advantage of this method lies in the fact that the larger the area of the foundation , the greater will be the load per square foot which may be safely carried , and that the uncertainty of the result is on the safe side . A soil which might yield under a load concentrated on a mast one foot square would probably be safe under that same unit load on a continuous footing which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a factor of safety of three or four was used , there would probably be no question as to the safety . Such a test need be applied only to an earthy soil . It would be practically impossible to produce a yielding by such a method on any kind of rock or even on a compacted gravel . Bearing Power of Ordinary Soils . A distinction must be maintained between the crushing strength of a cube of rock or soil , and the bearing power of that soil when it lies as a mass of indefinite extent under some structure . A soil can fail only by being actually displaced by the load above it , or because it has been undermined , perhaps by a stream of water . A sample of rock which might crush with comparative ease , when tested as a six-inch cube in a testing machine , will probably withstand as great a concentration of load as it is practicable to put upon it by any engineering structure . Even a gravel , which would have absolutely no strength if an attempt were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be practically immovable when lying in a pit where it is confined laterally in all directions . Rock . The ultimate crushing strength of stone varies greatly . The crushing strength is usually determined by making tests on small cubes . Tests made on prisms of a less height than width show a much greater strength than tests made on cubes of the same material , which shows that the bearing strength of rock on which foundations are built is much greater than the cubes of this stone . Sand and Gravel . Sand and gravel are often found together . Gravel alone , when of sufficient thickness , makes one of the firmest and best foundations . Dry sand or wet sand , when prevented from spreading laterally , forms one of the best beds for foundations ; but it must be well protected from running water , as it is easily moved by scouring . Clean , dry sand will safely support a load of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds per square foot ; and when compact and well cemented ,  | from 8,000 to 10,000 pounds per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely bear a load of 6,000 to 8,000 pounds per square foot ; and when well cemented , from 12,000 to 16,000 pounds per square foot . Cloy . There is great variation in clay soils , ranging from a very soft mass which will squeeze out in all directions when a very small pressure is applied , to shale or slate which will support a very heavy load . As the bearing capacity of ordinary clay is largely dependent upon its dryness it is , therefore , very important that a clay soil should be well drained , and that a foundation laid on such a soil should be at a sufficient depth to be unaffected by the weather . If the clay can not be easily drained , means should be taken to prevent the penetration of water . When the strata are not horizontal , great care must be taken to prevent the flow of the soil under pressure . When gravel or coarse sand is mixed with the clay , the bearing capacity of the soil is greatly increased . The bearing capacity of a soft clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thick bed of medium dry clay , - 1,000 to 8,000 pounds per square foot , and for a thick bed of dry clay , 8,000 to 10,000 pounds per square foot . Soft or Senri-Li , goid Soils . The soils of this class include mud , silt , quicksand , etc. , and it is necessary to remove there entirely or to reach a more solid stratum under the softer soil ; or , sometimes , the soil can be consolidated by adding sand , stone , etc . The manner of improving such a soil will be discussed later . In the same way that water will bear up a boat , a semi-liquid soil will support , by the upward pressure , a heavy structure . For a soil of this kind , it is very difficult to give a safe bearing value ; perhaps 500 to 1,500 pounds per square foot is as much as can be supported without too great a settlement . Improving a Compressible Soil . The general method of improving a compressible soil consists in making the soil more dense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles into the soil , especially if the piles will be always under the water line in that ground . Driving the piles compresses the soil ; and if the piles are always under water , they will be free from decay . If the soil is sufficiently firm so that the pile can be withdrawn and the hole will retain its form even temporarily , the pile may be drawn and then the hole  | immediately filled with sand , which is rammed into the hole as compactly as possible . This gives us a type of piling known as sand piles . A soft , clayey subsoil may frequently be improved by covering it with gravel , which is rammed and pressed into the clay . Such a device is not very effective , but it may sometimes answer . A subsoil is often very soft because it is saturated with water which can not readily escape . Frequently , a system of deep drainage , which will reduce the natural level of the ground water considerably below the desired depth of the bottom of the foundation , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is amply strong for its purpose . Even when the subsoil is very soft , it will sustain a heavy load , provided that it can be confined . While excavating for the foundations of the tower of Trinity Church in New York City , a large pocket of quicksand was discovered directly under the proposed tower . Owing to the volume of the quicksand , it was found to be impracticable to drain it all out ; but it was also discovered that the quicksand was confined within a pocket of firm soil . A thick layer of concrete was , therefore , laid across the top , which effectively sealed up the pocket of quicksand , and the result has been perfectly satisfactory . Preparing the Bed on Rock . The preparation of a rock bed on which a foundation is to be placed is a simple matter compared with that required for some soils on which foundations are placed . The bed rock is prepared by cutting away the loose and decayed portions of the rock and making the plane on which the foundation is placed perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an inclined plane , a series of steps can be made for the support of the foundation . Any fissures in the rock should be filled with concrete . Whenever it is necessary to start the foundation of a structure at different levels , great care is required to prevent a break in the joints at the stepping places . The precautions to be taken are that the mortar joints must be kept as thin as possible ; the lower part of the foundations should be laid in cement mortar ; and the work should proceed slowly . By following these precautions , the settlement in the lower part will be reduced to a minimum . These precautions apply to foundations of all classes . 89  | Preparing the Bed on Firm Earth . Under this heading is included hard clay , gravel , and clean , dry sand . The bed is prepared by digging a trench deep enough so that the bottom of the foundation is below the frost line , which is usually 3 to 6 feet below the surface . Some provision , similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Care should be taken to proportion the load per unit of area so that ; the settlement of the foundation will be uniform . figure Trencher Preparing the Bed on Wet Ground . The chief trouble in making an excavation in wet ground is in disposing of the water and preventing the wet soil from flowing into the excavation . In moderately wet soils , the area to be excavated is enclosed with sheet piling , as in Fig. 23 . This piling usually consists of ordinary plank , 2 inches thick and 6 to 10 inches wide , and is often driven by hand ; or it may be driven by methods that will be described later . The piling is driven in close contact , and in very wet soil it is necessary to drive a double row of the sheeting . To prevent the sheeting from being forced 90  | inwards , cross braces are used between the longitudinal timbers . When one length of sheeting is not long enough , an additional length can be placed inside . A more extended discussion of pile driving will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The water can sometimes be bailed out , but it is generally necessary to use a hand or steam pump to free the excavation of water . Quicksand and very soft mud are often pumped out along with the water by a centrifugal or mud pump . Sometimes , areas are excavated by draining the water into a hole the bottom of which is always kept lower than the general level of the bottom of the excavation . A pump may be used to dispose of the water drained into the hole or holes . When a very soft soil extends to a depth of several feet , piles are usually driven at uniform distances over the area and a grillage is constructed on top of the piles . This method of constructing a foundation is discussed in the section on " Piles . " FOOTINGS Requirements of Footing Course . The three requirements of a footing course are : ( 1 ) That the area shall be such that the total load divided by the area shall not be greater than the allowable unit pressure on the subsoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , or pier , shall be directly over the center of gravity ? and hence the center of upward pressure ? of the base of the footings. ( 3 ) That the footing shall have sufficient structural strength so that it can distribute the load uniformly over the subsoil . When it has been determined with sufficient accuracy how much pressure per square foot may be allowed on the subsoil and when the total load of the structure has been computed , it is a very simple matter to compute the width of continuous footings or the area of column footings . The second requirement is very easily fulfilled when it is possible to spread the footings in all directions as desired , as shown in Fig. 28 . A common exception occurs when putting up a building which entirely covers the width of the lot . The walls are on the building line ; the footings can expand inward only . The lines of pressure do not coincide , as shown in Fig. 2-1 . A construction as shown in the figure will almost inevitably result in cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adopted to prevent them . One general method is to introduce a tie of sufficient strength from a to b . The other general method is to introduce cantilever beams under the basement , which either extend clear across the building or else carry the load of interior columns so that the center of gravity of the combined loads will coincide with the central pressure line of the upward pressure of the footings . The third requirement practically means that the thickness of the footing ( be , Fig. 25 ) shall be great enough so that the footing can resist the transverse stresses caused by the pressure of the subsoil on the area between c and d . When the thickness must be made very great , such as fh , Fig. 26 , on account of the wide offset gh , material may be saved by cutting out the rectangle eknil . The thickness mo is computed for the offset go , just as in the first case ; while the thickness km of the second layer may be computed from the offset Where the footings are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength is always low , the offsets are necessarily small ; but when using timber , reinforced concrete , or steel I-beams , the offsets may be very wide in comparison with the depth of the footing . Calculation of Footings . The method of calculation is to consider the offset of the footing as an inverted cantilever which is loaded with the calculated upward pressure of the subsoil against the footing . If Fig. 25 is turned upside down , the resemblance to the ordinary loaded cantilever will be more readily apparent . Considering a unit length 1 of the wall and the amount of the offset o equal to de in Fig. 25 , and calling P the unit pressure from the subsoil , we have Pol as the pressure on that area , and its lever arm about the point c is o . Therefore , its moment equals a Poll . If t represents the thickness be of the footing , the moment of resistance of that section equals WO , in which R equals the unit compression ( or unit tension ) in the section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of the offset to its thickness . The solution of the above equation , using what are considered to be conservatively safe values for R for various grades of stone and concrete , is given hi Table XV . 93  | The computation of the dimensions of such footings when they are made of reinforced concrete is taken up during the development of this specialized form of Masonry in Part III . Instead of figuring the dimensions of a footing as just described , they may be designed by carefully drawing a few lines . After finding the size of a footing under a pier or a column , or the width of a footing under a wall , the projections and depths of the masonry for the footing is found as shown in Fig. 27 . A line is drawn from the point a , at an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical , and extending to the outer edge of the footing . The point a may be the edge of a wall , column , or column base .  | The height ac is then divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footing drawn . The dimensions can be either figured or scaled if the drawing has been carefully made . This type of footing is used only for plain concrete , stone , or brick masonry . Beam Footings . Steel , and even wood , in the form of beams , are used to construct very wide offsets . This is possible on account of their greater transverse strength . The general method of calculation is identical with that given above , the only difference being that beams of definite transverse strength are so spaced that one beam can safely resist the moment developed in the footing in that length of wall . Wood can be used only when it will be always under water . Steel beams should always be surrounded by concrete for protection from corrosion . Using Wood Begins . If we call the spacing of the beams s , the length of the offset o , and the unit pressure from the subsoil P , the moment acting on one beam equals i Pi2s . Calling w the width of the beam , t its thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maximum permissible moment equals 4Rwt2 . Placing these quantities equal , we have the equation z Pots= j ( 2 ( 3 ) having decided on the size of the beam , the required spacing may be deterrnined . Example . An 18-inch brick wall carrying a load of 12,000 pounds per running foot is to be placed on a soft , wet soil where the unit pressure can not be relied on for more than 2,000 pounds per square foot . What must be the spacing of 10- by 12-inch footing timbers of long-leaf yellow pine ? figure  | This shows that the beams must be spaced 56.9 inches apart , center to center . These beams should be underlaid with thick planks , or even beams , laid close together , parallel with the wall , and for the entire width of the footing , for the double purpose of providing the full pressure area needed and also to tie the beams together . The span of the crossbeams is 56.9 inches or 4.74 feet . The clear space is 4.74- .83 or 3.91 feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even four feet . Then At= ( 2000X4 ) X48=8 or 48,000 inch-pounds . Placing this equal to ( Rbh2 ) 6 , in which b =12 , then h =4.48 inches . The plank would be 5 inches thick . Using Steel I-Beams . The method of calculation is the same as for wood beams , except that , since the strength of I-beams is more readily computable by reference to tables in the handbooks published by the manufacturers , such tables will be utilized . The tables always give the safe load which may be carried on an I-beam of given dimensions on any one of a series of spans varying by single feet . If we call W the total load ( or upward pressure ) to be resisted by a single cantilever beam , this will be one-fourth of the load which can safely be carried by a beam of the same size and on a span equal to the offset . Example . Solve the previous example on the basis of using steel I-beams . Solution . The offset is , necessarily , 2.25 feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried by the beams is 4,500 pounds for each foot of length of the wall . By reference to the tables and interpolating , a 6-inch I-beam weighing 12.50 pounds per linear foot will carry about 34,860 pounds on a 2-foot 3-inch span . One-fourth of this , or 8,715 pounds , is the load carried by a cantilever of that length . Therefore , 8,715+4,500=1.936 feet =23.25 inches , is the required spacing of such beams . When comparing the cost of this method with the cost of others , the cost of the masonry-concrete filling must not be overlooked . A thick layer of concrete should be placed on the leveled subsoil ; the steel should be immediately placed at the proper spacing ; then the spaces between the beams should be filled in with concrete , care being taken to ram the concrete so thoroughly as to prevent voids . The concrete should extend up to a level at least two inches above the beams so as to protect the steel from rusting . In this case the spacing is 23.25 inches , and the net clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper than this , we may say , without numerical calculation , that the arching action of the concrete be-96  | tween the beams would be ample to withstand the soil pressure . The spacing of the beams should be neither so wide as to preclude safe arching action ? which is unlikely ? nor so narrow as to hinder thorough tamping of the concrete between them . Design of Pier Footings . The above designs for footings have been confined solely to the simplest case of the footing required for a continuous wall . A column or pier must be supported by a footing which is offset from the column in all four directions . It is usually made square . The area is very readily obtained by dividing the total load by the allowable pressure per square foot on the soil . 97  | The quotient is the required number of square feet in the area of the footing . If a square footing is permissible ? and usually it is preferable : the square root of that number gives the length of one side of the footing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special shape . The problem of so designing a footing that the center of pressure of the load on a column shall be vertical over the center of pressure of the subsoil is solved in detail under " Column Footing , " Part III . A column placed at the corner of a building which is located at the extreme corner of the property , and which can not extend over the property line , must usually be supported by a compound footing . The principles involved are discussed in detail , under " Compound Footings , " Part III . The determination of the thickness of a footing depends somewhat upon the method used . When the grillage is constructed of I-beams , as illustrated in Fig. 28 , the required strength of each series of beams is readily computed from the offset of each layer . If the footing consists of a single block of stone or a plate of concrete , either plain or reinforced , the thickness must be computed on the basis of the mechanics of a plate loaded on one side with a uniformly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is , practically , concentrated in the center . This problem is taken up under " Simple Footings , " Part M. Example . A column with a base 3 feet 4 inches square , carrying a total load of 630,000 pounds , is to be supported on a soil on which the permissible loading is estimated as three tons per square foot ; an I-beam footing is to be used . Required , the design of the I-beams . Solution . The required area of the footing is evidently 630,000+6,000 =-105 square feet . Using a footing similar to that illustrated in Fig. 28 , we shall make the lower layer of the footing , say 10 feet 6 inches by 10 feet wide . The length of the beams being 126 inches , and the column base being 40 inches square , the offset from the column is 43 inches , or 3.58 feet on each side . Looking at a table of standard I-beams , we find that a 9-inch beam weighing 21 pounds per linear foot will carry 50,320 pounds on a span of four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowable load is X50,320 , or 56,220 pounds . Tak3.58 ing one-fourth of this , as in the example on page 84 , we have 14,055 pounds which may be carried by each beam acting as a cantilever . The upward pressure of an offset , 3.58 feet long and 10 feet wide , at the rate of 6,000 pounds per square foot , would he 214,800 pounds . Therefore , 15 such beams , each 10 feet 6 inches long , would be required in the lower layer . The upper layer must consist of beams 10 feet long on which the offset from the pier is 40 inches on each side . us  | The group of beams under each of these.uppe offsets carries an upward pressure of 6,000 pounds per square foot on an area of 10 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 4 inches ; total pressure , 210,000 pounds . The total load on each foot of width of the upper layer is 63,000 pounds . Looking at the tables , a 15-inch I-beam weighing 42 pounds per foot can carry a load , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cantilever of this length would be one-fourth of this , or 15,700 pounds . The permissible load on a cantilever 3 feet 4 inches long will be in the ratio of 10 feet to 3 feet 4 inches , or , in this case , exactly three times as much , which would be 47,100 pounds . The total of 210,000 pounds , divided by 47,100 , will show that although five such beans will have a somewhat excessive strength , four would not be sufficient ; therefore five beams should be used . The lower layer of beams have a flange width of 4.33 inches each . The 15 beams . distributed over a space of 10 feet , or 120 inches , would be about 8 inches apart , leaving 3.67 inches net space between them , which is sufficient for ramming the concrete . The five upper beams each have a , flange width of 5.5 inches , which would use up 27.5 inches of the 40 inches width of the column base , leaving 12.5 inches for the four spaces , or 34 inches per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as close as is desirable . It should not be forgotten that surrounding all these beams in both layers with concrete adds somewhat to the strength of the whole footing , but that no allowance is made for this additional strength in computing dimensions . It merely adds an indefinite amount to the factor of safety . PILE FOUNDATIONS Piles . When it is necessary to construct a building on a soft or unreliable ground and spread footings are not adequate to carry the load , or if a very large load is to be supported on a small area , then some form of pile foundations is used . The term " pile " until recent years was generally understood to be a stick of timber driven in the ground to support a structure . In the last few years , concrete piling has been extensively used and today is more widely used than wood piling . The concrete piles have several advantages over the wood piles for many jobs . Also , steel sheet piling is taking the place on many jobs of wood sheet piling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood sheet piling can not be used . Also it can be withdrawn in good shape and used over many times where temporary sheet piling is required . Wood Bearing Piles . Since wood piles are often used for the support of buildings , they will be briefly described in this text . A wood pile is cut from the body of a small tree . The small end of the pile is seldom less than seven inches in diameter , and the large end may be as much as eighteen inches or more in diameter under the bark . In length , they will vary from sixteen feet to eighty feet or more . These sticks of timber must be fairly straight . They should 99  | be cut from sound , close-grained trees free from defects such as ring shakes , unsound knots , decay , or other defects that will materially reduce their strength . Wood piles , when used for foundations in permanent work , must always be under water . Where piles are not entirely covered with water , and also to keep the marine animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are creosoted . The bark should be removed from the pile . They are cut square at the driving end and pointed at the small end ; or if they are driven in hard ground , it is often necessary to use a steel shoe , as shown in Fig. 29. figure The usual safe load for a fair-sized wood pile is fifteen tons . Under very favorable conditions , a slightly larger load may be used . The carrying capacity of the pile can be tested by driving specimen piles and placing a load on them , or by the use of a formula which will be given later . White pine , spruce , or hemlock may be used in soft soils , especially for small loads . In firm soils , yellow pine or oak is usually used . In driving a cluster of piles for the support of a column , the usual spacing of the piles is two feet six inches on centers . They 100  | should never be closer than two feet six inches on centers unless they are small piles and of short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with reinforced concrete below the water line . Sheet Piling . Ordinary planks , 2 or 3 inches thick , and wider than they are thick , are , when driven close together , known as sheet piling , Fig. 30-a . The leakage between the planks may be greatly reduced by using a second row of plank , breaking joints with the first row , as shown in Fig. 30-b . When it is required that the sheet piling shall form a water-tight wall , such as a cofferdam , three thicknesses of plank are generally used with joints as arranged in Fig. 31. figure Sheet piling is usually driven in close contact , either to prevent leakage , to confine puddle in cofferdams , to prevent the materials of a foundation from spreading , or to guard a foundation from being undermined by a stream of water . To make wood piles drive with their sides close against each other , they are cut obliquely at the bottom , as shown in Fig. 32 . They are kept in place , while being driven , by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gage piles previously driven , which are several feet apart .  | Steel Sheet Piling . The increased cost of timber and the large percentage of deterioration and destruction during its use for a single cofferdam have developed the manufacture of steel sheet piling , which can be re-drawn and used many times . The forms of steel for sheet piling are nearly all patented . The cross sections of a few of them are shown in Fig. 33 . One feature of some of the designs is the possible flexibility secured in the outline of the dam without interfering with the water-tightness . In recent years steel sheet piling has been used in constructing retaining walls , especially along the water front , where it can be jetted in place . A deep section , similar to Fig. 33-c , is used on account of its lateral strength . The wall can be finished by covering the top with concrete which extends down at least to the low water line . The arch sections should always be used as the straight sections lack the strength to resist the load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem to be any very definite depth to which this piling should be driven , but if it is driven into the ground one and one-half times as far as it extends above the water line , it should safely support the load behind it . This piling is usually driven by a combination of jetting and hammering . Concrete and Reinforced Concrete Piles . Concrete and reinforced concrete piles have some advantages over wood piles . They are more permanent since they are not subject to decay , the attacks of wood borers , and destroyers in sea water ; more economical because figure of their greater carrying capacity , reduction iii the size of footing due to the reduction in the number of piles ; and often the amount of shoring , sheet piling , pumping , and excavation is reduced when concrete piles are used rather than wood piles . The load that can be placed on a concrete pile will depend on the type of pile , size , length , the ground in which it is placed , etc. , but thirty tons is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concrete and reinforced-concrete piles may be classified wider two headings : ( a ) those where the piles are formed , hardened , and driven very much the same as any pile is driven ; ( b ) those where a hole is made in the ground , into which concrete is rammed and left to harden . Ins  | Reinforced-concrete piles which have been formed on the ground are designed as columns with vertical reinforcement connected at intervals with horizontal bands . These piles are usually made square or octagonal in section , and a steel or cast-iron point is used . figure  | They are usually molded in a vertical position and as soon as they can be handled are jetted in place . These piles are not dependent on the friction of the surface of the concrete with the sand but can figure convey the load direct to the sand under the enlarged end . Piles of this type have been used for loads of 50 to 60 tons . They can also be used in clusters . Raymond Concrete Pile . The Raymond concrete pile , Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile core is encased in a 105  | thin , closely-fitting , sheet-steel shell . The core and shell are driven to the required depth by means of a pile driver . The core is so constructed that when the driving is finished , it is collapsed and withdrawn , leaving the shell in the ground , which acts as a mold for th concrete . When the core is withdrawn , the shell is filled with concrete , which is tamped ( luring the filling process . These piles are usually 18 to 20 inches in diameter at the top and 8 inches at the point . When it is desirable , the pile can be made larger at the small end . The figure Simplex : Concrete Pile . The different methods for producing the Simplex pile cover the two general classifications of concrete panes ? namely , those molded in place , and those molded above ground and driven with a pile driver . Fig. 37 shows the standard methods of producing the Simplex pile ; a steel point is shown which has been driven and imbedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially and entirely withdrawn . The concrete is deposited in the steel form by means of drop-bottom buckets , holding about 600 pounds for each charge . This method of dropping concrete in mass is used to prevent voids . Goe , Caisson Pile . The Gow system of piling consists of constructing a single cylindrical shaft of concrete of sufficient size to carry the entire weight of a building column through an unsatisfactory soil to one that will safely support the load when properly distributed . The supporting material for these piles should be rock , hard shale , cemented gravel , or other material of a very compact nature . In figure  | constructing these piles , a cylindrical excavation is made to a depth of 6 ' 0 " to 8 ' 0 " , depending on the nature of the soil penetrated , and then a steel cylinder is placed in the hole . The excavation is continued until the depth of the hole is as great or greater than the length of the steel form . A second form is placed inside of the first form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satis-figure factory bearing is found . To secure a greater bearing area , the shaft is " belled out " as shown in Fig. 38-a . Fig. 38-b shows the concrete being placed and the cylinders being removed . The cylinder is not withdrawn before the concrete is placed . In Fig. 38-c , the finished pile is shown with steel dowels in place for anchoring the column above . For example , suppose a load of 750,000 pounds is to be supported by one of these piles . If a concrete with a working stri ss of 500  | pounds is used , the diameter of the smallest cylinder would be computed from figure Therefore , the diameter would be 21.8 X2 =43.6 inches . The diameter of the cylinder in this case would be 44 inches . If the bearing material was a soft rock that would support a load of 15 tons per square foot , then the diameter of the bell would be figure Therefore , the diameter of the bell at the bottom would be 2.82 X 2=5.64 feet , or , 5 feet 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MacArthur Concrete Pile and Foundation Company . A core and cylindrical casing are first driven to the required depth as shown in Fig. 39-a . The core is then removed and a charge of concrete dumped in the casing . The core is replaced and used as a rammer to compress the concrete into the soil . The process is repeated until a base about three feet in diameter is formed as indicated in Fig. 39-d . The cylindrical casing is then filled and the casing is withdrawn . The concrete column is 17 inches in diameter . This pile has the advantage of having a direct bearing of a few square feet at the bottom as well as the frictional resistance of its surface . Bearing Power of Piles . Pile foundations act in a variable combination of two methods of support . In one case the piles are driven into the soil to such a depth that the frictional resistance of the soil to further penetration of the pile is greater than any load which will be placed on the pile . As the soil becomes more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less and less ; and it then becomes necessary that the pile shall penetrate to a stratum of much greater density , into which it will penetrate but 108  | little if any . Under such conditions , the structure rests on a series of columns ( the piles ) which are supported by the hard subsoil , and whose action as columns is very greatly assisted by the density of the very soft soil through which the piles have passed . It practically makes but little difference which of these methods of support exists in any particular case . The piles are driven until the resistance furnished by each pile is as high as is desired . The resistance against the sinking of a pile depends on such a very large variety of conditions , that attempts to develop a formula for that resistance , based on a theoretical computation taking in all these various factors , are practically useless . There are so many elements of the total resistance , which are so large and also so very uncertain , that they entirely overshadow the few elements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based on the general proposition that the resistance of the pile multiplied by the distance hich it moves ( luring the last blow equals the weight of the hammer 109  | multiplied by the distance through which it falls . Expressing this algebraically , we have figure where I ? is resistance of pile ; s is penetration of pile during last blow ; w is weight of hammer ; and h is height of fall of hammer . Practically , such a. formula is considerably modified , owing to the fact that the resistance of a pile , or its penetration for any blow , depends considerably on the time which has elapsed since the previous blow . This practically means that it is far easier to drive the pile when the blows are delivered very rapidly ; and also that when a pause is made in the driving , for a few minutes or for an hour , the penetration is very much less ( and the apparent resistance very much greater ) , on account of the earth settling around the pile during the interval . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Engineering News formula , which , when used for ordinary hammer-driving , is figure This formula is fundamentally the same as the above formula , except that R is safe load , in pounds ; s is penetration per blow in inches ; w is weight of hammer in pounds ; and h is height of fall of hammer in feet . In the above equation , w is considered a free-falling hammer ( not retarded by hannmer rope ) striking a pile having a sound head . If a friction-clutch driver is used , so that the hammer is retarded by the rope attached to it , the penetration of the pile is commonly assumed to be just one-half what it would have been had no rope been attached , that is , had it been free-falling . Also , the quantity s is arbitrarily increased by 1 , to allow for the influence of the settling of the earth during ordinary hammer pile driving , and a factor of safety of 6 for safe load has been used . In spite of the extreme simplicity of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for all possible modifying causes , this formula has been found to give very good results . When computing the bearing power of a pile , the penetration of the pile during the last blow is determined by averaging the total penetration during the last five blows . ( 4 )  | The pile-driving specifications adopted by the American Railway Engineering Association , require that : All piles shall be driven to a firm bearing satisfactory to the Engineer , or until five blows of a hammer weighing 3,000 pounds , falling 15 feet ( or a hammer and fall producing the same mechanical effect ) , are required to drive a pile one-half ( a ) inch per blow , except in soft bottom , when special instructions will be given . This is equivalent to saying ( applying the Engineering New formula ) that the piles must have a hearing power of 60,000 pounds . Steel-Shelled Concrete Piles . In excavating for the foundation of a 1 ( i-story building at 14th Street and 5th Avenue , New York , a pocket of quicksand was discovered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general excavation . A wall column of the building to be constructed was located at this , point , with its center only 15 inches from the party line . The estimated load to be supported by this column was about 500 tons . It was finally decided to adopt steel piles which would afford the required carrying capacity in a small , compact cluster , and would transfer the load , as well as the other foundations , to the solid rock . These piles , 5 in number , w ere driven very close to an existing wall and without endangering it . Each pile was about 15 feet long , and was made with an outer shell consisting of a steel pipe , inch thick and 12 inches inside diameter , filled with Portland-cement concrete , reinforced with four vertical steel bars , 2 inches in diameter . This gave a total cross-sectional area of 27.2 square inches of steel , with an allowed load of 6,000 pounds per square inch , and 100.5 square inches of concrete on which a unit stress of 500 pounds was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enables the concrete filling to be loaded to the maximum permitted by the New York Building Laws . The tubes and bars have an even bearing on hard bed rock , to which the former were sunk by the use of a special air hammer and an inside hydraulic jet . The upper ends of the steel tubes and reinforcing bars were cut off after the piles were driven . The work was done with care , and a direct contact was secured between them and the finished lower surfaces of the castiron caps , without the intervention of steel shims. * footnote *Condensed from , E , e , , eerin0 Xerord , Feb. 22 , IJUti. 111  | Examples . 1 . The total penetration during the last five blows was 14 inches for a pile driven with a 3,000-pound hammer . During these blows the average drop of the hammer was 24 feet . How much is the safe load ? figure 2 . It is required , if possible , to drive piles with a 3,000-pound hammer until the indicated resistance is 70,000 pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows when the fall is 25 feet ? figure The last problem suggests a possible impracticability , for it may readily happen that when the pile has been driven to its full length its indicated resistance is still far less than that desired . In some cases , such piles would merely be left as they are , and additional piles would be driven beside them , in the endeavor to obtain as much total resistance over the whole foundation as is desired . The above formula applies only to the drop-hammer method of driving piles , in which a weight of 2,500 to 3,000 pounds is raised and dropped on the pile . When the steam pile driver is used , the blows are very rapid . about 55 to 65 per minute . On account of this rapidity the soil does not have time to settle between the successive blows , and the penetration of the pile is much more rapid , while of course the resistance after the driving is finished is just as great as is secured by any other method . On this account , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to s is changed from one to 0.1 , and the formula becomes figure Methods of Driving Piles . There are three general methods of driving piles ? namely , by using ( 1 ) a falling weight ; ( 2 ) the erosive action of a water jet ; or ( 3 ) the force of an explosive . The third method is not often employed , and will not be further discussed . Drop-Hammer Pile Driver . This method of driving piles consists in raising a hammer made of east iron , and weighing 2,5 ( 1 ( 1  | to 3,000 pounds , to a height of 10 to 30 feet , and then allowing it to fall freely on the head of the pile . The weight is hoisted by means of a hoisting engine . When an engine is used for the hoisting , the winding drum is sometimes merely released , and the weight in falling drags the rope and turns the hoisting drum as it falls . This reduces the effectiveness of the blow , and lowers the value of s in the formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in falling , a. frame , consisting of two uprights called leaders , about 2 feet apart , is erected . The uprights are usually wood beams , and are from 10 to 60 feet long . Such a simple method of pile driving , however , has the disadvantage , not only that the blows are infrequent ? not more than 20 or even 10 per minute ? but also that the effectiveness of the blows is reduced on account of the settling of the earth around the piles between the successive blows . On this account , a form of pile driver known as the steam pile driver is much more effective and economical , even though the initial cost is considerably greater . Steam-Hammer Pile Driver . The steam pile driver is essentially a hammer which is attached directly to a piston in a steam cylinder . The hammer weighs about 4,000 pounds , is raised by steam to the full height of the cylinder , which is about 40 inches , and is then allowed to fall freely . Although the height of fall is far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hammer is about double , and the blows are very rapid ( about 50 to 65 per minute ) . As before stated , on account of this rapidity , the soil does not have time to settle between blows , and the penetration of the pile is much more rapid , while , of course , the ultimate resistance , after the driving is finished , is just as great as that secured by any other method . Driving Piles with Water Jet . It is generally difficult to drive piles in sand with a drop-hammer or even a steam-hammer pile driver , therefore , the jetting method is often used . A good water pressure is necessary and can be secured by the use of a pump . A hose , about two inches in diameter , with a nozzle of one inch is attached to a pole , which is about the same length as the pile to be jetted . A hole is made in the ground at the place where the pile is to be located , by the water under pressure , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole and held there until the sand settles around it . When all the piles for a footing have been jetted the excavation for the footing is made and the piles hammered to 113  | settle them firmly in place . Only short piles can be driven in this way . Sometimes a combination of jetting and driving can be used to an advantage . Of course , the only method of testing such resistance of the pile is by actually loading a considerable weight upon it . This method of using a water jet is chiefly applicable in structures which are on the banks of streams or large bodies of water . Splicing Piles . On account of the comparatively slight resistance offered by piles in swampy places , it sometimes becomes necessary to splice two piles together . The splice is often made by cutting the ends of the piles perfectly square so as to make a good butt joint . A hole 2 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep is bored in each of the butting ends , and a dowel pin 23 inches long is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second pile is then fitted on the first one . The sides of the piles are then flattened , and four 2- by 4-inch planks , 4 to 6 feet long , are securely spiked on the flattened sides of the piles . Such a joint is weak at its best , and the power of lateral resistance of a joint pile is less than would be expected from a single stick of equal length . Nevertheless , such an arrangement is in some cases the only solution . Pile Caps . One practical trouble in driving piles , especially those made of soft wood , is that the end of the pile will become crushed or broomed by the action of the heavy hammer . Unless this crushed material is trimmed off the head of the pile , the effect of the hammer is largely lost in striking this cushioned head . This crushed portion of the top of a pile should always be cut off just before the test blows are made to determine the resistance of the pile , sine ( ' the resistance of a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broomed , will apparently be far greater than the actual resistance of the pile . The steam pile driver does not produce such an amount of brooming as is caused by the ordinary pile driver and this is another advantage in its favor . Whenever the hammer bounces off the head . of the pile , it shows either that the fall is too great or that the pile has already been driven to its limit . Whenever the pile refuses to penetrate appreciably for each blow , it is useless to drive it any farther , since added blows can only have the effect of crushing the pile and rendering it useless . It has frequently been discovered i 114  | that piles which have been hammered after they had been driven to their limit have become broken and crushed , perhaps several feet underground . In such cases , their supporting power is very much reduced . I-sually about two inches of the head is chamfered off to prevent this bruising and splitting in driving the pile . A steel band , 2 to 3 inches wide and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the pile to assist in keeping it from splitting . These devices have led to the use of a cast-iron cap for the protection of the head of the pile .. The cap is made with two tapering recesses , one to fit on the chamfered head of the pile , while in the other is placed a piece of hard wood , on which the hammer falls . See Fig. 43 . Sawing Off the Piles . When the piles have been driven , they are sawed off to bring the tops of them to the same elevation , that they may have an even bearing surface . When the tops of the piles are above water , this sawing is usually done by hand ; and when under water , by machinery . The usual method of cutting piles off under water is by means of a circular saw on a vertical shaft , which . is supported on a special frame , the saw being operated by the engine used in driving the piles . Finishing the Foundations . A pile supports a load coming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacing between the piles . This area , of course , is several times the area of the top of the pile . It is therefore necessary to cap at least a group of the piles with a platform or grillage which not only will support any portion of the load located between the piles , but which also will tend to prevent a concentration of load on one pile . When the heads of the piles are above water , a layer of concrete is usually placed over them , the concrete resting on the ground between the piles , as well as on the piles themselves . It is necessary to use a thick plate of concrete , so that a concentrated load will be distributed over a number of piles , Fig. 40 . A concrete grillage is usually laid with its lower surface 8 to 12 inches below the tops of the piles . The piles are thus firmly anchored together at their tops . When reinforced-concrete structures are supported on piles or other concentrated points of support , the heads of the piles are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . Sometimes a platform of heavy timbers is constructed on 115  | top of the piles , to assist in distributing the load ; and in this case the concrete is placed on the platform , as shown in Fig. 41 . When the heads of the piles are under water , it is always necessary to construct a grillage of heavy timber and float it into place , unless a cofferdam is constructed and the water pumped out , in which case the foundation can be completed as already described . The timbers used to cap the piles in constructing a grillage are usually about 12 by 12 inches , and are fastened to the head of each pile by a driftbolt a plain bar of steel . A hole is bored in the cap and into the head of the pile , in which the driftbolt is driven . The section of figure the driftbolt is always larger than the hole into which it is to be driven ; that is , if a 1-inch round driftbolt is to be used , a a-inch auger would be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grillage are driftbolted to the caps . Advantage of Concrete and Reinforced=Concrete Piles . A reinforced-concrete pile foundation does not materially differ in construction from a timber pile foundation . The piles are driven and capped , in the usual manner , with concrete ready for the superstructure . In comparing this type of piles with timber piles , they have the advantage of being equally durable in a wet or dry soil , and the disadvantage of being more expensive in first cost . Sometimes their use will effect a saving in the total cost of the foundation by obviating the necessity of cutting the piles off below the water line . The depth of the excavation and the volume of masonry may be greatly reduced , as shown in Fig. 42 . In this figure is shown a comparison of the relative amount of excavation which would be 116  | necessary , and also of the concrete which would be required for the piles , thus indicating the economy which is possible in the items of excavation and concrete . There is also shown a possible economy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made of any desired diameter , while there is a practical limitation to the diameter of wood piles . Therefore a less number of concrete piles will furnish the same resistance as a larger number of wood figure piles . In Fig. 42 it is assumed that the three concrete piles not only take the place of the four wood piles in the width of the foundation , but there will also be a corresponding reduction in the number of piles in a direction perpendicular to the section shown . The extent of these advantages depends very greatly on the level of the groundwater line . When this level is considerably below the surface of the ground , the excavation and the amount of concrete required , in order that the timber grillage and the tops of the piles shall be always below the water line , will be correspondingly great , and the possible economy of concrete piles will also be correspondingly great . The pile and cap being of the same material , they readily bond together and form a monolithic structure . The capping should be thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven in almost any soil that a timber pile can penetrate , and they are driven in the same manner as the timber piles . A combination of the hammer and water jet has been found to be the most successful manner of driving them . The hammer should be heavy and drop figure a short distance with rapid blows , rather than a light hammer dropping a greater distance . For protection while being driven , a hollow cast-iron cap filled with sand is placed on the head of the pile . The cap shown in Fig. 43 has been used successfully in driving concrete piles . A hammer weighing 2,500 pounds was dropped 25 feet , 20 to 30 times per minute , without injury to the head . Loading for Piles . The spacing for wood piles is generally 30 inches on centers . The loading of wood piles , with 12-inch butts , driven through wet , loose soil to a good bearing , is taken usually at 10 to 12 tons per pile . When driven through a firm soil the loading may be increased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , concrete piles 16 inches in diameter at the top and tapering to S or 10 inches at the bottom support loads of 25 to 30 tons . HAMMER OF HOSE If '  | Cost . In comparing the cost of timber piles and concrete or reinforced-concrete piles , the former are found to be much cheaper per linear foot than the latter . As already stated , however , there are many cases where the economy of the concrete pile as compared with the wood pile is worth considering . In general , the requirements of the work to be done should be carefully noted before the type of pile is selected . The cost of wood piles varies , depending on the size and length of the piles , and on the section of the country in which the piles are bought . Usually piles can be bought of lumber dealers at 20 to 40 cents per linear foot for all ordinary lengths ; but very long piles will cost more . The cost of driving piles is variable , ranging from 5 or 6 cents to 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles have been driven for which the contract price ranged from 35 cents to 50 cents per linear foot of pile driven . The length of the pile driven is the full length of the pile left in the work after cutting it off at the level desired for the cap . The contract price for concrete piles about 16 inches in diameter and 25 to 30 feet long is approximately $1.50 per linear foot . When a price of $1.50 per linear foot is given for a pile of this size and length , the price will generally be somewhat reduced for a longer pile of the same diameter . Concrete piles have been driven for $1.20 per linear foot , and perhaps less ; and again , they have cost much more than the approximate price of $1.50 per linear foot . Piles for the Charles River Dam . The first piles driven for the ( ' ambridge , Massachusetts , conduit of the Charles River Dam were on the Cambridge shore . On January 1 , 1907 , 9,969 piles had been driven in the Boston and Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock , the average length of the piles , after being cut off , was 29 feet ; and under the sluices , 31 feet 4 inches . The specifications called for piles to be winter-cut from straight , live trees , not less than 10 inches in diameter at the butt when cut off in the work , and not less than 6 inches in diameter at the small end . The safe load assumed for the lock foundations was 12 tons per pile , and for the sluices 7 tons per pile . The Engineering News formula was used iva determining the bearing power of the piles . The piles under the lock walls were driven very close together ; and , as a result , many of them rose dur-119  | ing the driving of adjacent piles , and it was necessary to re-drive these piles. * Pile Foundation for Sea Wall at Annapolis . The piles for constructing the sea wall , Fig. 44 , at Annapolis , Maryland , ranged in length . from 70 to 110 feet . On the outer end of the breakwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles were in one length , single sticks . Toward the inner end of the breakwater , lengths of 100 to 110 feet were required . Single sticks of this length could not be secured , and it was therefore necessary to resort to splicing . After a trial of several methods , it was found that a splice made by means of a 10-inch wrought-iron pipe was most satisfactory . When the top of the first pile had been driven to within three feet of the water , it was trimmed down to 10 inches in diameter . On this end was placed a piece of 10-inch wrought-iron pipe 10 inches long . The lower end of the top pile was trimmed the same as the top of the first pile , and , when raised by the leads , was fitted into the pipe and driven until the required penetration was reached . The piles were cut off 44 feet below the surface of the water , by a circular saw mounted on a vertical shaft . t footnote " From Engineering-Con ' , art , ag . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XXIII , No. 3. 120  | RETAINING WALLS A retaining wall is a wall built to sustain the lateral pressure of earth . The pressure that will be exerted on the wall will depend on the kind of material to be supported , the manner of placing it , and the amount of moisture that it contains . Earth and most other granular masses possess some frictional stability . Loose soil or a hydraulic pressure will exert a full pressure ; but a compacted earth , such as clay , may exert only a small pressure due to the cohesion in the materials . This cohesion can not be depended upon to relieve the pressure against a wall , for the cohesion may be destroyed by vibration due to moving loads or to saturation . In designing a wall the pressure due to a granular mass or a semifluid without cohesion must always be considered . Causes of Failure of Walls . There are three ways in which a masonry wall may fail : ( 1 ) by sliding along a horizontal plane ; ( 2 ) by overturning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its footing . These are the three points that must be considered in order to design a wall that will be successful in resisting an embankment . A wall , therefore , must be of sufficient size and weight to prevent the occurrence of sliding , rotation , or crushing . Stability of Wall Against Sliding . Stability against sliding is secured by making the structure of sufficient weight so that there will be no danger of a movement at the base . In Fig. 45 let E be the horizontal pressure and W the weight of all materials above the joint . A movement will occur when E equals f 1T ' , where f is the coefficient of friction . Let n be a number greater than unity , the factor of safety , then in order that there be no movement n must be sufficiently large so that nE equals f IV . A common value for n is 2 , but sometimes it is taken as low as 12 . Substituting 2 for n , figure Average values of the coefficients of friction of masonry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.50 ; for masonry on wet clay , 0.33 ; masonry on gravel , 0.60 ; masonry on wood , 0.50 . Stability Against Rotation . The stability against rotation of a 121  | wall is secured by making the wall of such dimension and weight that the resultant R of the external forces will pass through the base and well within the base , as shown in Fig. 45 . Generally in designing , the resultant is made to come within or at the edge of the middle third . The nearer the center of the base the resultant comes , the more evenly the pressure will be distributed over the foundation for the wall . When R passes 6URCh'f7if4f through d the wall will fail by rotation . Stability Against Crushing . The compressive unit stresses in walls must not be ti greater than the unit stresses permitted for safe working loads of masonry when the wall is built on a stone foundation ; but when it Foundations . The foundations for a retaining wall must be below the frost line , which is about three feet below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold climate . The foundation should be of such a character that it will safely support the wall . If necessary , the soil should be tested to determine if it will safely support the wall . The foundation should always be well drained . Many failures of walls have occurred owing to the lack of drainage . Water behind a wall greatly increases the stresses in the wall . When water freezes behind a wall it usually causes it to bulge out , which is the first step in the failure of the wall . On a clay foundation the friction is greatly reduced by the clay becoming thoroughly soaked with water . On page 109 it is shown that the difference of the coefficients of friction of masonry on dry clay and wet clay is 0.17 . There are different ways of draining a fill behind a retaining wall . The method shown in Fig. 22 for drainage often can be used . Pipes two to four inches in diameter are often built in the wall , as shown in Fig. 45 . Design of Wall . In designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall are generally assumed and then the section investigated graphically to see if it is right for the conditions assumed . There are theoretical formulas for designing walls which will be figure  | given . In designing a wall , the student is advised to first make the section according to the formulas and investigate it graphically . Fill Behind Wall . The fills behind the walls are sometimes made horizontal with the top of the wall ; at other times the fill is sloped back from the top of the wall , as shown in Fig. 45 . When there is a slope to be supported , the wall is said to be surcharged , and the load to be supported is greater than for a horizontal fill . Faces of Wall . The front or face of retaining walls is usually built with a batter . This batter varies from vertical to a batter of perhaps 1 z inches horizontal per foot of height . The rear face may be built either straight , with a batter , or stepped up . A masonry wall should never be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless the wall is a very small one . In that case , probably a width of 12 to 18 inches would be sufficient for the top . Width of Base . The following values for the width of the base of a wall are taken from Trautwine 's Handbook and are based on the fill behind the wall being placed loosely and not above the level of the top of the wall . Wail of cut stone or of first-class large-ranged rubble , in mortar .35 of its entire vertical height Wall of good common mortar rubble or brick .4 of its entire vertical height Wall of well-laid dry rubble .5 of its entire vertical height In recent years concrete has come into extensive use in building retaining walls . A wall built of a 1:3:6 concrete should be equal in strength to a wall built of cut stone or large-ranged rubble . In heavy walls large stones , twenty-five to fifty per cent in volume , are often placed in the concrete . This , usually , greatly reduces the cost of the wall and does not weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Study of Existing Walls . When designing a retaining wall , all existing walls in that vicinity should be examined to determine their dimensions and to discover if they have been successfully designed . Often , existing walls will give more information to an engineer than lie will obtain by a theoretical or graphical study . Pressure Behind Wall . The development of the formulas for finding the pressure behind a wall is a long , complicated theory , and the demonstration will not be given here . The formulas given are 123  | those usually found in textbooks . They are based on the Rankine theory , which considers that the earth is a granular mass with an assumed angle of repose of 1.5 to 1 , which in degrees is 33 ? 42 ' . In applying this method it is immaterial whether the forces representing the earth pressure are considered as acting directly upon the back of the wall , or are considered as acting on a vertical plane passing through the extreme back of the footing . In the latter case , the force representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vertical force representing the weight of the earth prism between the back of the wall and the vertical plane considered ; and ( 2 ) combined with the vertical force representing the weight of the wall itself . In the formulas for determining pressures behind a wall let E equal total pressure against rear face of wall on a unit length of wall ; NV equal weight of a unit volume of the earth ; h equal height of wall ; and equal angle of repose . When the ' upper surface of the earth is hori. ootal , the equation is figure Since the angle of repose for the earth behind the wall has been taken as 33 ? 42 ' , Equation ( 7 ) may be reduced to the following form by substituting the value of the tangent of the angle in the equation figure When a wall nwst sustain a surcharge at the slope of 1.5 to 1 , the equation is figure The force E is applied at one-third the height of the wall , measured from the bottom , but for surcharged wall it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that passes just behind the wall . This is clearly shown in the different figures illustrating retaining walls . figure  | The direction of the center of pressure E is assumed as being parallel to the top of the earth back of the wall . The angle of the surcharge is generally made 1.5 to 1 . Example . What is the pressure per foot of length of a wall 18 feet high , earth weighing 100 pounds per cubic foot , if the fill is level with the top of the wall ? figure Pressure on Foundation . The formulas for determining the pressure on the foundation , recommended to the American Railway Engineering Association by a committee appointed by that Society to investigate the subject of retaining walls , are as follows , see Fig. 46 : NOTE : When P equals the vertical component of the resultant pressure on the base , B is the full width of the base in feet , and Q is the distance from t lie toe to where the force R cuts the base . , 9 ,  | figure P is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle and finding the weights and the center of gravity of each , and also that of the triangle of 126  | earth back of the wall ; and then finding the combined weights and the center of gravity of the wall and earth . Assume that the weight of the masonry is 140 pounds per foot and the earth 100 pounds per cubic foot , and consider the section of wall as being one foot in length . The center of gravity of the wall may be obtained thus : figure Distance from A to center of gravity =390=120=3.25 feet Weight of wall per lineal foot =120 X I40 =16,800 pounds Static moment about A=16,800 X3.25 =54,600 foot-pounds Center of gravity of the earth is at one-third of the distance from the back of the triangle , or 7.0 feet from the face of the wall . figure Produce the line E to meet the vertical line passing through the combined center of gravity . On this vertical line lay off the value of P , which is 22,800 , to any convenient scale . At the lower end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line lay off the value of E , which is 5,720 . Draw line ab , which is the resultant of the two forces . This line cuts the base at a scaled distance of 2.6 feet from the toe , which is a point without the middle third of the base , therefore , Q is less than B3 . figure Lay off Ad , at any convenient scale , equal to 6,330 pounds and on the base lay off a distance equal to 3Q =7.8 feet . Through this point draw de and scale the force shown from e to the base line , which is 1,000 pounds . The examination of this section of wall shows that the pressure of the toe is not excessive for an ordinary foundation , such as clay . At the heel there is an uplift of 1,000 pounds . This uplift would be overcome by the friction of the materials in the fill . This section would probably support an embankment 127  | 20 feet high , although the resultant does not come in the middle third of the base . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 140 pounds per cubic foot . This is the weight of 1:3:6 concrete . If closely laid stone were used , the weight of the masonry per cubic foot would be increased to 160 pounds at least . This increased weight would bring the resultant within the middle third . The wall will next be investigated for stability against sliding on its base . Suppose that the wall is to be built on dry clay . The horizontal thrust E is 5,720 pounds , the total weight is 22,800 pounds , and the coefficient of friction of masonry on dry clay is .50 . Substituting in equation ( 6 ) , figure The approximate equality of the equation shows that there is a factor of two against sliding on such a base . On a base of wet clay the factor against sliding would be less than one and a quarter and it would be necessary to secure the wall against sliding in some way . Types of Walls . In Fig. 48 is shown a type of wall that has sometimes been used . The tendency to slide outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is resisted by making the lower course with the joints inclined towards the rear . This method of construction makes the joints nearer perpendicular to the line of pressure than in a vertical wall . The weakness of this type of wall is that water running down the face of it will enter the joints and produce an additional pressure to that of the earth . There is figure  | also the danger of this water freezing behind the wall and causing the wall to bulge out . A type of wall often used in railroad work is shown in Fig. 49 . It should be noted that the width of the base is nearly one-half the height but that this width is only carried up a short distance . The back is stepped , therefore it receives the assistance of the maximum vertical pressure of the earth on the horizontal steps . The wall is anchored to the foundation by a projection below the base of the wall . Location . The outline design of a long bridge which requires several spans involves many considerations : ( 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wide channel must be left for navigation . The placing of piers , the clear height of the spans above high water , and the general plans of all bridges over navigable rivers are subject to the approval of the - United States Government . ( 2 ) A long bridge always requires a solution of the general question of few piers and long spans , or more piers and shorter spans . No general solution of the question is possible , since it depends on the required clear height of the spans above the water , on the required depth below the water for a suitable foundation , and on several other conditions ( such as swift current , etc. ) which would 129  | influence the relative cost of additional piers or longer spans . Each case must be decided according to its particular circumstances . ( 3 ) Even the general location of the line of the bridge is often determined by a careful comparison , not only of several plans for a given crossing , but even a comparison of the plans for several locations . Sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of the two spans resting on a pier are usually such that a - pier with a top as large as thus required , and with a proper batter to the faces , will have all the strength necessary for the external Forces acting on the pier . For example , the channel pier of one of the large railroad bridges crossing the Mississippi River was capped by a course of stonework 14 feet wide and 29 feet long , besides two semicircles with a radius of 7 feet . The footing of this pier was 30 feet wide by 70 feet long , and the total height from subsoil to top was about 170 feet . This pier , of course , was unusually large . For trusses of shorter span , the bridge seats are correspondingly smaller . The elements which affect stability are so easily computed that it is always proper , as a matter of precaution , to test every pier designed to fulfill the other usual requirements , to see whether it is certainly safe against certain possible methods of failure . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supporting the truss are , fortunately , just such as give the pier the most favorable formation so that it offers the least obstruction to the flow of the current in the river . In other words , since the normal condition is for a bridge to cross a river at right angles , the bridge piers are always comparatively long , in the direction of the river , and narrow in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the current . The rectangular shape , however , is modified by making both the upper and the lower ends pointed . The pointing of the upper end serves the double purpose of deflecting the current . and thus offers less resistance to the flow of the water ; and it also deflects the floating ice and timber , so that there is less danger of the formation of a jam during a freshet . The lower end should also be pointed in order to reduce the resistance to the flow of the water . The ends of the piers are sometimes made semicircular , but a better plan is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which intersect at a ? point .  | Causes of Failure . The forces tending to cause a bridge pier to fail in a direction perpendicular to the line of the bridge include the action of wind on the pier itself , on the trusses , and on a train which may be crossing the bridge . They will also include the maximum possible effect of floating ice in the river and of the current due to a freshet . It is not at all improbable that all of these causes may combine to act together simultaneously . The least favorable condition for resisting such an effect is that produced by the weight figure of the bridge , together with that of a train of empty cars , and the weight of the masonry of the pier above any joint whose stability is in question . The effects of wind , ice , and current will tend to make the masonry slide on the horizontal joints . They will also increase the pressure on the subsoil on the downstream end of the foundation of a pier . They will tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier to tip over . Another possible cause of failure of a bridge pier arises from forces parallel with the length of the bridge . The stress produced on a bridge by the sudden stoppage of a train thereon , combined with a wind pressure parallel with the length of the bridge , will tend to cause the pier to fail in that direction , Fig. 50 . Although these forces are never so great as the other external forces , yet the resisting  | power of the pier in this direction is so very much less than that in the other direction , that the factor of safety against failure is probably less , even if there is no actual danger under any reasonable values for these external forces . Abutment Piers . A pier is usually built comparatively thin in the direction of the line of the bridge , because the forces tending to produce overturning in that direction are usually very small . When a series of stone arches are placed on piers , the thrusts of the two arches on each side of a pier nearly balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier to be sufficiently rigid to withstand the effect of an eccentric loading on the arches ; but if , by any accident or failure , one arch is destroyed , the thrust on such a pier is unbalanced and the pier will probably be overturned by the unbalanced thrust of the adjoining arch . The failure of that arch would similarly cause the failure of the succeeding pier and arch . On this account a very long series of arches usually includes an abutment pier for every fourth or fifth pier . An abutment pier is one which has sufficient thickness to withstand the thrust of an arch , even though it is not balanced by the thrust of an arch on the other side of the pier . Abutment piers are chiefly for arch bridges ; but all piers should have sufficient rigidity in the direction of the line of the bridge so that any possible thrust which may come from the action of a truss of the bridge may be resisted , even if there is no counterbalancing thrust from an adjoining truss . ABUTMENTS Requirements of Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bridge , but also what is virtually a retaining wall for the bank behind it . In the case of an arch bridge , the thrust of the arch is invariably so great that there is never any chance that the pressure of the earth behind the abutment will throw the abutment over , and therefore the abutment never needs to be designed as a retaining wall in this ease ; but when the abutment supports a truss bridge which does not transmit any horizontal thrust through the bridge , the abutment must be designed as a. retaining wall . The conditions of stability for such structures have already been discussed . This principle of the retaining wall is especially applicable if the abutment consists of a perfectly straight 132  | wall . There are other forms of abutments which tend to prevent failure as a retaining wall , on account of their design . Abutments with Flaring Wing Walls . These are constructed substantially as shown in Fig. 51 . The wing walls make an angle of about 30 ? to 45 ? with the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will just catch the embankment formed behind it , the slopes of the embankment probably being at the rate of 1.5 : 1 . If the bonding of the wing walls , and especially  | the bonding at the junction of the wing walls with the face of the abutment , are properly done , the wing walls will act virtually as counterforts and will materially assist in resisting the overturning tendency of the earth . The assistance given by these wing walls will be much greater as the angle between the wing walls and the face becomes larger . U=Shaped Abutments . These consist of a head wall and two walls which run back perpendicular to the head wall , Fig. 52 . This form of wall is occasionally used , but the occasions are rare when such a shape is necessary or desirable . T=Shaped Abutments . As the name implies , these consist of a head wall which has a core wall extending perpendicularly back from the center . The core wall serves to tie the head wall and prevent its overturning . Of course such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care in the construction of the wall , so that the bonding is very perfect and so that the wall has very considerable tensile strength ; otherwise the core wall could not resist the overturning tendency of the earth pressure against the rear face of the abutment . CONCRETE WALKS Foundations . ' 1'he depth of the excavation of the foundation for sidewalks should he at least 18 inches . In cold climates it may be necessary to make the excavation deeper unless the soil is very porous . Where the sidewalks are built on filled ground , the fill must be well tamped clay , gravel , or cinders from which all decomposed wood or other objectionable materials have been removed . Sidewalks should never be laid on new fills as the fills will settle and cause the concrete work to crack badly . Where sidewalks are laid on filled earth , the embankments on each side of the sidewalks should never be less than two and one-half to three feet wide . When porous materials are used under the pavements , such as coal ashes , slag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain off all water so as to prevent freezing under the walk and breaking of the concrete . Concrete Base . The concrete for the base of walks is usually composed of one part Portland cement , three parts sand , and five parts stone or gravel . Sometimes , however , a richer mixture is  | used , consisting of one part cement , two parts sand , and four parts broken stone : but this mixture seems to be richer than what is generally required . The concrete should be thoroughly mixed and rammed , Fig. 53 , and cut into uniform blocks . The size of the broken stone or gravel should not . be larger than one inch , varying in size down to one-quarter inch , and free from fine screenings or soft stone . All stone or gravel under one-eighth inch is considered sand . The thickness of the concrete base will depend upon the location , the amount of travel , or the danger of being broken by frost . The usual thickness in residence districts is three inches , with a wearing thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fig. 54 . In business sections , the walks vary front four to six inches in total thickness , in which the finishing coat should not be less than one and one-quarter inches thick . The concrete base is cut into uniform blocks . The lines and grades given for walks by the Engineer should be carefully followed . The old strips should be firmly blocked and kept perfectly straight to the height of the grade given . The walks usually are laid with a slope of one-quarter inch to the foot toward the curb . The blocks are usually from four to six feet square , but sometimes they are made much larger than these dimensions . The joints made by cutting the concrete should be filled with dry sand , 135  | and the exact location of these joints should be marked on the forms . The cleaver or spud that is used in making the joints should not be less than one-eighth of an inch or over one-quarter of an inch . in thickness . Top Surface . The wearing surface is usually one inch in thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three parts of good coarse sand which will pass through a one-quarterinch screen . This mortar should be thoroughly mixed and applied to the base as soon as the base is placed , so that the top finish and the base will bond together and form one solid mass . The top coat is leveled off with a straightedge and floated down with either a steel or wood float . The surface should not be excessively troweled or floated as it will work the fine particles of cement and sand to the surface and there will be danger of cracking off . Excessive troweling causes the accumulation of laitance just under the surface and the bond between the fine material on top and the mortar under is broken . The top surface is cut directly over the cuts made in the base , care being taken to cut entirely through the top and base all around each block to form a joint which will permit expansion in warm weather . These joints will be finished with a jointer , Fig. 55 , and all edges rounded or beveled . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is better to mop up the excessive water than to add a dryer consisting of cement and sand 136  | to take up the excessive water . A dot roller or line roller , Figs. 56 and 57 , can be used to relieve the smoothness caused by troweling . Reinforcing Pavements . Sidewalks are often reinforced with wire mesh or bars to assist in reducing the amount of expansion and contraction caused by the changes of temperature . Also , sidewalks laid on filled ground may be strengthened by being reinforced near the bottom of the slab . All reinforcing steel or mesh should be thoroughly protected so that the moisture will not cause the steel to rust and break up the slab . Monolithic Slab . Instead of using a base slab with a wearing surface , the entire surface can be poured at one time . If the concrete has been thoroughly tamped and the top surface is proven to be even with a straightedge , the top is floated or troweled to a smooth surface . If it is desirable to secure a natural finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush and water while the concrete is green , and therefore exposing some of the coarse aggregate . The proportions of the ingredients of the concrete to be used in such work should be one part Portland cement , two and one-half parts coarse sand , and four to four and one-half parts of crushed stone or pebbles . The stone or pebbles to be used in this work should be graded from one-quarter inch to three-quarter inch in size . 137
