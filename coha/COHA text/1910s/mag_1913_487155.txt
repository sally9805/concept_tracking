Figures of the vote at the last election in New York State on the Constitutional amendments have been coming in very slowly , but they leave no room to doubt that Amendment NUmber Two has been ratified by a heavy majority . This result was a foregone conclusion There was virtually no opposition . The amendment removes all limitations which the New York Constitution might otherwise be construed to place upon the power of the Legislature to enact laws for the protection of the lives or safety of employees or for any desired system of workmen 's compensation for injuries or death . Yet this highly important amendment was not only passed by two successive Legislatures , with very little difficulty , but went to the people with the explicit endorsement even of newspapers of the most extreme " capitalistic " type . The decision of the Court of Appeals in the Ives case , pronouncing unconstitutional the workmen 's compensation act draivn by the Wainwright Commission , was the occasion for this amendment of the State Constitution . In the opinion of some excellent lawyers , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints which for a long time was prevalent among our courts , though it is now in a fair way to disappear altogether , and is in distinct contrast to the spirit shown for some years past by the Supreme Court of the United States That Court has unanimously upheld an employers ' liability act whose constitutionality had been disputed on essentially the same grounds as those asserted in the Ives case ; and in a number of decisions concerning the scope of the police power it has laid down doctrines based upon liberal interpretation . This Ives decision has furnished no end of capital to Mr. Roosevelt and his followers . They have pointed to it as showing the urgent need of his scheme for the recall , or reversal , of judicial decisions by popular vote . Now the object has been accomplished , not only with great ease , but with great promptness , while leaving the functions of the judiciary unimpaired ; yet there is no telling but the Rooseveltians may regard this not as a disproof , but as a vindication , of their position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that you have found it easy to amend the Constitution , while we have been talking as though it were next to impossible ; but would n't our way have been much better " Why not just set aside the objection to the particular law you want , instead of going to the length of amending the Constitution itself ? If the Court was wrong in its interpretation , would it not be best simply to reject this in the specific in-Stance , and let the future take care of itself ? " The plea is not without plausibility But there is a fundamental and fatal objection to it The process of popular appeal upon specific decisions can not possibly be limited to cases in which the Court 's interpretation of the Constitution is " wrong " It is bound to work out in practice as simply a vote on the disputed legislative measure ; and , however sound and wise may have been the decision of the Court as a matter of Constitutional interpretation , the people would vote it down if they wished the measure enacted Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall-of-decisions project , drops the Constitutional element completely , the question to be put to the people being simply whether the law in controversy shall stand or not . It is a tenable position that we should be better off without any written Constitution ; it is a tenable position that , even with a written Constitution , the judiciary should have no power to declare laws unconstitutional . But to have a written Constitution , and to give the courts the power to pass upon the validity of a law under it , and then to permit Constitution and judicial decision alike to be reduced to so much waste paper whenever a popular majority desires to have its way in spite ot them , is a palpable absurdity . One feature of our judicial system which is clearly in need of alteration is pointed to in the situation arising out of the adoption of Amendment Number Two . The United States Constitution contains a provision essentially identical with that in the State Constitution upon which the Ives decision was based . It is by no means inconceivable that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Albany this winter , were to be challenged as a violation of the Constitution of the United States , the Court of Appeals might decide against the law . Probably it would not , since the Supreme Court 's precedents would then be binding ; but it is possible that the new law would involve some feature not covered by the precedents . Now , if the Court of Appeals were to decide against the law as violating the United States Constitution , an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States ought to be possible . But it is not . Under the Federal statutes , such an appeal does lie from a decision upholding the law , but not from a decision invalidating it . This is an anomaly , though it is not difficult to see how it may naturally have arisen . But all that is required to remove it is the passing of an act of Congress . This ought to be done at a very early date . It would remove a real grievance . The matter has been brought forward from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer inertia It would be a particularly happy stroke for Senator Root to advocate this reform and push it to speedy accomplishment . EUGENICS AND COMMON-SENSE . A decided reaction from the first fine frenzy ot the militant eugenists is revealed in the latest literature on the subject . It is a reaction based less on the fundamental principles of the new " science " than on the application of such principles ; based less on the contention that eugenics is ! utterly wrong than on the contention that we do not know enough of the subject to justify us in formulating definite rules of conduct for individuals or the state . From the eugenic laboratories in England , where the doctrine had its origin , there now come warnings against the dangers that lie in overhasty assumptions and generalizations . This was the tenor of Professor Bateson 's speech at Um recent International Congress of Medicine in London , and it was the point driven home by another English student of repute in his recent animated controversy with Prof. C. B Davenport , who probably stands at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difficulty is not one of ascertaining the end towards which the laws of heredity should be directed  --  always a tremendous objection to the " stock-farm " argument . We simply do not know enough about the laws of heredity . Theory is outrunning fact . This would seem to be admitted even by those who have lost no time in advocating the application of eugenic principles to life . Professor Davenport has admitted that his recent pronouncement concerning the mating of strength with weakness , for which he was so violently assailed by an English critic , was dictated , in the last resort , not by strictly scientific considerations but by common-sense . And common-sense is always bound to make itself heard under such circumstances . Common-sense has no authority in the field of pure science where discoveries frequently consist in establishing the truth of things that the ordinary sense of men has declared impossible . But once the principles of science are brought into touch with life , the corrective and inhibiting influence of common-sense must enter . It is then , when we are facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest teachings of science have been anticipated by the ordinary experiences of mankind . Those few principles of eugenics which we are to-day bound to recognize have been recognized , and applied , for ages . Eugenics is embodied in the laws and regulations of marriage obtaining among all peoples , and all creeds and legal systems . The prohibition of marriage within certain degrees of kinship is largely based on eugenic principles , consciously or unconsciously . The Catholic Church , in forbidding the marriage of cousins , is more thoroughly eugenic than some of our cautious eugenists are inclined to be to-day . Science renders immense service by giving definite expression to , and supplying a conscious basis for , practices that men have developed in the harsh experience of the ages . And this long continuity of human experience must always remain as one of the tests for legislation dealing with the intimacies of life . Common-sense , as applied to this question of eugenics , denotes something far different from a Gradgrind philosophy of hard facts and strictly prudential considerations . Common-sense connotes sentiment , poesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctity of life , of love , and of human purpose against the stock-farm interpreters of eugenism . Common-sense is much more philosophical than the mass of pseudoscientific eugenists when it refuies to fix its attention upon an isolated pro-blem to the overlooking of counter-problems . Common-sense refuses to grow excited over the necessity of preventing the " degeneration " of the race because it recognizes that no such process is under way ; because it recognizes that the health of the race is improving , that the span of human life is increasing , and that a greater proportion of the race is tasting a greater share of happiness than ever before . Common-sense is aware , for instance , that discoveries are constantly and continually made in the field of medicine which at one stroke do more for the health and well-being of the race than the eugenists could hope to attain through ages of painful effort . In general , common-sense recognizes that , as compared with the difficult and uncertain business of improving the race by regulating birth , a vastly greater amount of good can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To drop into scientific vernacular , common-sense opposes the well-proven influence of environment to the still dubious functioning of heredity . It recognizes that poverty , alcoholism , and crime are not prenatally determined , but are the product largely of social conditions . It was Prof. Karl Pearson , the most distinguished of Gal-ton 's followers , who conducted an investigation some years ago into the effects of alcoholism upon the young , and found that the children of alcoholic parents are not noticeably inferior in health to the children of sober parents . The eugenists are appalled by the birth-rate in the English slums , and foresee the swamping of the fit of the nation by the unfit . But common-sense ventures to doubt whether the English lower classes have ever been better off than they are today , and asks to what extent a rapidly growing population has been justified by the peopling of the waste places of the earth and the upbuilding of an empire with its millions of prosperous colonists . It is not a simple problem . Every broad assertion made in behalf of common-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a healthier race towards which the eugenist strives can not wisely be put aside by any man of sense . Nor can certain contentions of the eugenist be dismissed , such as the demand for the regulation of marriage among the notoriously diseased or otherwise obviously unfit . But the great objection is that , passing from what is absolutely justified , the eugenists , on the basis of principles whose validity is by no means established , have been clamoring for a short and easy way with problems of the utmost concern for the future of the race . 111EXICANIZING ENGLAND . If we may believe the dispatches , the British Isles will soon be filled with rival armies . In Ulster fifty or sixty thousand men are drilling  --  with wooden guns . Not to be outdone by Belfast , Dublin has begun the recruiting of an " army . " Ten thousand men enrolled the first day . They will presumably drill with shillelahs . But the thing does not stop there . The striking Transport Workers in Dublin ? are catching up the idea . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Larkin will take the field against General Redmond , with General Carson perhaps moving against both from the North of Ireland . And at the same time the embattled ladies under General Drummond may be marching on Downing Street . It will soon be so that every political faction , even every clique , will have its " army . " The Labor party and the trades unions are growing restless , with everybody else arming , and say that the time is drawing near when they also will cease to depend upon voting to get what they want , and will seize guns to extort it from the Government . The whole thing , if we are to accept the reports as printed , has a Mexican air . Sir Edward Carson does not like what the Government proposes to do in Ireland , and so he issues his pronunciamiento in Belfast , just as if his first name were Eduardo and his last Orozco . John Redmond looks with dislike and envy upon this North of Ireland insurrection , and raises his " cry " in Dublin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then there are the " plans " of Larkin and the suffragettes and the labor unions , put out with all the prolixity and the vehemence of a Comonfort or a Madero rushing to arms . An alarmed and too credulous observer might think that , by a year from now , Prime Minister Asquith will be in London like another Huerta in Mexico City , giving out bulletins about the operations against rebels in all parts of the United Kingdom . In the very fact that all this sounds comic lies the best hope that a peaceful and sensible way out will be found . Englishmen , too , have an " ancient humor " which will save them at the last . The process of raising an " army " to enforce every local or factional demand will soon reduce itself to the absurd ; and then the armies will disband amid a universal smile . Batteries of public ridicule will be opened on the fierce paper-warriors . This kind of firing has , indeed , already begun  --  it is probably the only firing that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure it in England as it is on the Boulevards of Paris . Several months must pass before any of the Irish armies will have any excuse for mobilizing , and when the time comes it will very likely be the old story over again of thousands of infuriated and determined patriots who would have risen had they not been prevented by the police . That the ' entire matter has a deeply serious aspect , however , no one who stops to think will deny . Not without disquietude can those accustomed to associate England with ordered liberty read of these threats of violence and of civil war . English political methods have always been rough . The Chartist movement had its fringe of incendiarism and murder . What the Fenians did and attempted , it is not necessary to re . count . The lawless outrages by the suffragists can plead many bad precedents . But those English agitators misread the history of their own country who think that anything is to be gained by terrorism . It was not the burning and killing threatened by the Chartists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulling down of the Hyde Park railings , so often cited mistakenly ; but the long - appeal to reason and justice made by the Quaker , John Bright , and those who fought by his side , using only weapons of warfare that were spiritual . This is the kind of peaceful triumph of an idea that we like to think of as characteristic ' of England ; and every friend of hers is shocked and pained to read of this ) ow incursion of rowdyism in English public life ; every man proposing to do what is right in his - own eyes , regardlaas of the laW , and throwing away the eallc ' n order to grasp the bludgeon . For these sporadic outbreaks of warlike talk and action , the example set by Ulster is no doubt largely responsible . Sir Edward Carson and his followers have much to answer for in cultivating the spirit of violent resistance to the law of the land . The thing could not be confined to their corner of Ireland . No sooner do the men of Belfast undertake to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulster will fight , and Ulster will be right , " than the men of Dublin , shout in response , " Leinster will fight , and Leinster will be right " To this kind of angry separatism has led a movement avowedly started in the name of the Empire ! It is one of the huge absurdities of the notion of raising armies to get what you are too rash and impatient to seek to obtain by the slower methods of discussion and lawmaking . First evoked by professed Imperialists , the spirit of violence has speedily given us a Larkin , addressing great audiences in England and crying out , " Damn the Empire ! " COMBINING IN SOCIAL WORK . Germany has lately shown the possi-bility of two institutions , one formed for the practical treatment of a social evil , the other for its theoretical study , existing in ignorance of each other , though by joining they could heighten their effectiveness . At the International Congress of Criminologists at Copen-hagen last summer , emphasis was laid upon a proposal for a Kriminalistzsches Reichainstitut at Berlin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatry ; police methods , trial meth-ods , and the Bertillon and other sys-tems of identification ; with prisons and penal systems in detail . In the course of discussion , however , so Professor von Liszt writes in Die Woche , Chief of Po-lice Lindenau , of Berlin , and the rep-resentatives of the University of Berlin discovered that in two divided parts the Rezclisinstitut already existed . One was the Polizez-Prasidium , with a special museum , a criminal laboratory , a sys-tem of graphic charts , and a collection of criminal archives . The other was a department of the University , a Krimi-nalistisch , es Seminar , enrolling large classes . No one doubted the value of a Royal Institute ; but why spend thou-sands for one when by throwing open the doors between classroom and bureau a perfect substitute could be cre-ated ? This is an example of shortsightedness in sociological work . Of the necessity for coordinating schemes of social benevolence we hear much ; some plans for central supervision of philanthropies have actually been put into operation But they meet a need coming after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social evil with those for its theoretical study Any positive maladjustment in society calls into being an agency to deal with it . Such agencies are remedial . Of another sort are those reform organizations which study social questions in a scientific spirit . The boundary line between the two is more and more broken down But even in so complex and advanced a matter as criminology the division is still found , as the German criminologists discovered . It is natural to demand that the reform agencies shall cover both grounds . The primary basis for this is not economy of effort and money ; rather , it is the feeling that social schemes should be planned upon the broadest possible scale . The proposal for the Retchstnstitut is typical of this new requirement ; it was to unite the effective with the theoretical , the permanent reform with the immediate remedy , the humanitarian with the philosophical . It is a partial estimate of the need for inclusiveness of scope which prompts to expand one or the other isolated agency , without an effort to bring the two together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions indefinitely , as might also the Seminar of the University ; yet neither would have reached its full usefulness , since their constitutions forbade trenching on each other 's field But once the largest possible view is taken , a hundred agencies spring to their places in the plan . It is a frequent criticism of schemes of practical reform that they are , Fanting in breadth and in insight into the future . Theoretical studies are said to be remote , intangible , and academic . The winning forward of social movements is by eliminating the deficiencies of , the two and joining their virtues . In a recent issue of the Nineteenth Century , an article : upon " Blundering Social Reform , " by Sir Guilford L. Molesworth , gathers together a number of instances of costly errors on the part of institutions prominent iu philanthropic work in the British Isles . The conclusion of the writer is that too often the eyes of England 's legislators and social reformers are fixed either upon the ground at their feet , or upon nothing but the distant horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . " There are two consequences in history- an immediate one , at once recognized ; and one in the distance , which is not at first perceived These consequences often contradict each other . " His conclusion is that , while the breach between the practical and the theoretical schools of social reformers is often bridged , the very complexities of modern reform keep the necessity for eternal vigilance always present . And he tries to show in England to-day the necessity for that broadness of purpose which , in Herbert Spencer 's phrase , holds in mind not merely " the immediate object to be achieved , but the indirect and far-off result . " BARBARA FRIETCHIE AND FAME . The story of Barbara Frietchie is again under fire . Whittier 's account of the supposed incident of September 13 , 1862 , is felt as an aspersion upon the Confederate troops , and so testimony is offered concerning the affair that would delight the heart of a district attorney . Why any one should be offended by the tale is not evident . " Who touches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented as exclaiming , " dies like a dog March on ! " Surely this is true Southern chivalry . But it does not satisfy the critics in the Southland , and they remind us accordingly , not simply that the story is false , but that it has been proved so by the mouths and the pens of several persons who ought to know . Here is a letter written from Frederick City only nine years after the war by Valerius Ebert , nephew of Barbara and administrator of her husband 's estate , setting forth that Jackson and his troops did not pass nearer the Frietchie residence than three hundred yards , that they were never on the same street as the house , and that the lady herself , being ninety-six years old , was bedridden , and so far from being able , to clamber to the attic window that she could not even get upon her feet without assistance . Finally , Whittier himself is said to have acknowledged that he had been misled and to have expressed his regret over the occurrence . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a later version , come fresh from Frederick City , which tears it to shreds . Two of Jackson 's men , so this rendering goes , having entered the Frietchie house to take down the offending flag , Dame Frietchie chased them back into the street with a broom . It is possible that in this form the tale will be no more palatable to its critics than it is in the orthodox version , but when you set out to dispose of a myth , you can not object to others who are engaged in the same laudable endeavor . But those who resent the story as Whittier told it do not stop with destructive criticism ; they attempt to put it entirely out of the way by showing its probable origin . To Col. Kyd Douglas of Jackson 's staff belongs the credit for the following narrative : Two very pretty girls , with ribbons of red , white , and blue floating from their hair , small Union flags in their hands , rushed out of a house as we passed , came to the curbstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the General He bowed , raised his hat , and turning with his quiet smile to the staff , said , " We evidently have no friends in this town " " Doubtless , " comments the Charlotte , N. C , Observer , " girls or women who were Union sympathizers waved Union flags at Confederate invaders in the border States or the Union States beyond . " But as for anything such as is related in connection with Barbara Frietchie , perish the thought ! Why should one have a grudge against myths ? Well , the truth is that very few persons are so enamoured of fact as to wish to war against myths . All that most of us care to do is to crush a particular myth that offends us Some of the leading critics of this Barbara Frietchie tale , for instance , become stanch supporters of a myth , or at least of an extremely doubtful story , when any one ventures to wonder about the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence . The shoe is then on the other foot . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is greeted as entitled to respect . Any one contemplating an attack upon a myth of any standing would do well , therefore , to begin doubtfully and far away . If you have reason to suspect the authenticity of the Boston Tea Party , com mence your war upon it in Nevada or Arizona . Point out the considerations that incline Bostonians to cling to any tale that does honor to Revolutionary traditions of this kind . Pour scorn upon the narrowness of the spirit that prefers local glory to the pure and unadulterated truth . Your Nevada or Arizona audience , not being especially concerned in the issue , will agree with you heartily , and in time you may create a sentiment regarding the famous Party that will put Boston decidedly on the defensive . If one looks at the story of Barbara Frietchie in cold blood , one fails to see why the exact truth about it should greatly matter . Prove it to be false , and what have you achieved except to deprive a picturesque figure of its halo ? But we do not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should not care for them . When we read about Barbara , we are not a jury in the box , making up our minds about the relative weight of evidence in the case of Jackson vs . Frietchie . Not at all . We are up there in the attic window with the intrepid old woman . More than that ; it is our hands that seize the flag as it falls from its shattered staff . It is our hands that wave It defiantly before the advancing guns , our voice that shouts the challenge that may mean its silencing for- ? ever , and our victory for a cause that is dearer to us than life . We value myths , not for their truth to history , but for the tribute they pay to the possibilities of human nature . We cling to them , not because their destruction would deprive us of our ideas of the past , but because it would strike a blow at our faith in ourselves .               @ @ @ @ @ @
