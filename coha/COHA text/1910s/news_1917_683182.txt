txt Lord CURZON tells England that " the " Americans are already putting their " full weight into the war . " It is true , and if it surprises England it was not altogether expected by us . It is a variation from our record , and not what is customary either with England or with this country . Our ancient custom has been to begin a war by degrees , and it has been England 's , too . This is the first war we ever went into in which we began as if we were going to have a big job on our hands . England did not begin this war in that way , and undoubtedly did not expect us to do it . What is. more important , neither did Germany . If England ' is surprised at learning it , Germany will be astounded when she learns it . We have already relieved our allies of their financial difficulties , as Sir HARDMAN LITER points out . That is a mighty blow in the prosecution of the war , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We are now ordering the raising of an army , and not of a languidly raised force of volunteers . Germany calculated with absolute confidence on our going about the thing in our immemorial way ; she knew we would learn by the failure of our volunteer system that we would have to raise a real army , but believed that we would not learn it until we had experimented with the volunteer system for a year . So she put the raising of a real army at a date about a year from the declaration of war . We shall be setting about it within a month , instead . We have ordered and have well under way the mobilization of the industrial resources of the country . England did not learn the necessity of that for some time after she entered the war , but instead of repeating her mistake we have profited by The whole nation Is anxious to help , and the way is being found for everybody . We are in the way of putting the nation 's supplies ' In the Government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the submarine problem , and for once the rule that defensive appliances keep pace in war with offensive ones has not yet worked ; but that is not the fault of any inexperience of ours , for the problem has baffled our allies , too , and it may soon be solved , There is nothing half way about our spirit in trying to cope with it . Our first sally in that direction , the creation of the wooden fleet , was made with an energy that contains the promise of More when other measures for the same purpose are devised . There ? is encouragement , too , ha the report that the labors of the Naval Consulting Board have been fruitful , that a way of combating the pirates has been devised . Sir HARDMAN LEVER says he always thought that once America made up her mind as to her duty " she would jump into the war with both feet . " Such an opinion was not based on our record , but it has been justified . This is one war in which the whole brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has to do from the moment it found it had to do it .
