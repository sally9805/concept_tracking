txt The public will be asked soon by the government to broaden their list of war sacrifices to include electric lights and gas as a means of saving fuel . Instead of shutting down all non-war industries to save fuel , thereby throwing many persons out of employment and reducing the economic resources , an effort will be made to effect such a reduction in the private consumption of coal that many factories will be enabled to operate part time at least . One suggestion being studied is to notify all households that they may consume hereafter only half of the average amount of electricity and gas burned ? each month during the last year . If that amount should be reached before the end of the month the supply would be cut off for the remaining days of that month . ? Compensation to the public utilities companies for their loss in business has been taken up only tentatively as yet . Raises in rates may be recommended .                   @ @
