SIR : Naturally the article on " What Do Soldiers Read ? " in the Nation of October 25 , appealed to me with peculiar interest . What I read , wherewithal I while away my hours of leisure , that is one of my largest little problems . I set myself a certain vague standard , and only very seldom , when none of my genuine " eligibles " are obtainable , am I compelled to resort to books of no particular reputation . Perhaps the Nation would like to have my list , carefully kept , of the books I have read since my arrival in France in July , 1915 . I consider it rather an accomplishment : " The Cloister and the Hearth , " Reade ; " Toilers of the Sea , " Hugo ; " Adam Bede , " Eliot ; " Adrian Savage , " " Lucas Mallet " ; " Last Days of Pompeii , " Bulwer-Lytton ; " Incomparable Bel-lairs , " A , and E. Castle ; " If Youth but Knew , " A and E. Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The American , " James ; " Hard Times , " Dickens ; " Pictures from Italy , " Dickens ; " Sense and Sensibility , " Austen ; " Lorna Doane , " Blackmore ; " Thaddeus of Warsaw , " Porter ; " Theatre , Choisi de " ( 2 vols. , 12 plays , in French ) , Corneille ; " Owd Bob , " Oliphant ; " A Son of Hagar , " Caine ; " The Right of Way , " Parker ; " Seats of the Mighty , " Parker ; " When Valmond Came to Pontiac , " Parker ; " Donovan Pasha , " Parker ; " The Marriage of William Asho , " Ward ; " Woodstock , " Scott ; " The King 's Mirror , " Hope ; " Let the Roof Fall In , " Denby ; " Jeanne " ( in French ) , Sand ; " Westward Ho ! " C. Kingsley ; " Vailima Letters , " Stevenson ; " Sketch Book , " Irving ; " The Bible in Spain , " Borrow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? re Serge " ( in French ) , Tolstoy . Periodicals ? The Nation , Life , Punch , London Opinion . And of more or better , what need has any man ? Some of these books I found in hospitals , some I bought almost in the trenches where civilians still clung to the wreckage , some I borrowed from Y. M. C. A. libraries , some I raked out of the jaws of " death by incinerator , " some I swapped with comrades , and others I simply " acquired " ( whereof the less said the better ) . The best and largest Y. M. C. A. library I have ever seen in France is at 31 , Avenue Montaigne , in Paris , and American soldiers of literary bent should consider themselves fortunate in the way their needs have there been met . During my ten days ' leave to Paris , the American Y. M. C. A. was the chief centre of interest . One may read the Nation there , too . If you consider that any of the above facts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to communicate them in whole or in part to people in New York . They constitute one experience among many thousands ; perhaps they are not even approximately typical . They are merely the reply of " One who has done so " to the question , " What Do Soldiers Read ? " RUNDALL M. LEWIS Somewhere in France , November 25 Our Provincial Education To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Professor Judd was undoubtedly right in saying , in the Nation for December 13 , that foreign languages are badly taught in many of our urban elementary schools . But it may be doubted whether he was right in asserting that the introduction of such languages in the schools was because , as he says , " somebody from Europe wanted it done for reasons nationalistic but not American . " Is it un-American to teach foreign languages to American school children ? On the contrary , it ought to be decidedly the American school policy to teach American children a good deal about non-American peoples and institutions . It is one of the sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little about non-American affairs . Take the man in the street  --  the product of our American schools  --  and how clearly , if he knows it at all , does he know the difference between the flexible parliamentary system of government as exemplified in Great Britain and the fixed-term system of our government ? A monarchy is a monarchy . England and Germany are monarchies ; therefore they are both alike in government ! Guatemala and Switzerland are both republics ; therefore they are alike in form and substance ! The man in the street can perhaps tell you where Berlin and Dresden are on the map , but if you ask him about plural voting and responsibility of the German Prime Minister to the people , he is in the densest ignorance . Suppose you ask for a comparison of the power of the German Emperor and the British King in actual government  --  and what is the answer from your average American voter  --  the man who in the aggregate ultimately determines the position of America in the world , and occasionally , as in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nothing but the abysmal ignorance of the AmeHcan people on foreign affairs that stayed Mr. Wilson 's hand from declaring war long before he did . He had to wait until our people could grasp the true inwardness of the international situation and the relation of America to the rest of the world  --  because the American schools had not done their duty towards the American child in the past . In the case of German , while there may have been more or less propaganda work , Americans without a trace of German blood in their veins or the slightest admiration for German methods favored the study of foreign languages , hoping that thereby young Americans might know something about peoples and institutions outside the United States . By the same token there is a strong demand among alert school men for modern European history and elementary political science in the public schools . If that sort of work had been well done a generation ago , thousands of lives and millions of treasure might have been spared for America . E. L. C. MORSE Chicago , Ill. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It has been commonly said that Walt Whitman was the father of modern free verse , and that his first published free-verse poem was " Blood-Money , " his second being " Wounded in the House of Friends , " both of which he reprinted in his Collect . But the true date of the first publication of these poems has never been known . The date assigned in the Collect to the former , April , 1843 , is so wofully incorrect as to remind us again that Whitman had no memory for dates . The first appearance of these two poems has recently been discovered . " Blood-Money " was originally published , over the signature " Walter Whitman , " in the supplement to the daily edition of Horace Greeley 's New York Tribune on March 22 , 1850 . Although the editor called attention to several features of interest to be found in the Supplement , he had nothing to say of the single and singular poem in it which began a movement in literature the proportions of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say the discerning Greeley , for he was one of the first , if not the first , to recognize Whitman as a new force in literature . Not only did he honor himself by publishing in quick succession these unrhymed , irregular , and for the most part unmetrical poems some five years before Emerson " discovered " the new bard , but he went so far as to champion , in a lecture in the 1850 's , " Walt Whitman 's rare poetic genius " ? a championship which cost the lecturer a severe ridiculing . One wonders whether Whitman adopted the Greeley hat  --  the " wide-awake "  - -   - -  in perpetual acknowledgment of this chivalrous treatment of his muse . " Wounded in the House of Friends " first appeared as " The House of Friends , " signed " Walter Whitman , " in the Tribune of June 14 , 1850 . The original version contains two passages which the author saw fit to omit in the Collect reprint . One of these excised passages I quote : Vaunters of the Free , Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama ? Sweep first before your own door ; Stop this squalling and this scorn Over the mote there in the distance ; Look well to your own eye , MassachusettsYours , New-York and Pennsylvania ; ? I would say yours too , Michigan , But all the salve , all the surgery Of the great wide world were powerless there . These sentiments were , in general , those of Emerson on the subject of slavery . A third free-verse poem was printed in the Tribune on June 21 , 1850 . It was called " Resurgemus , " and was signed " Walter Whitman . " It now appears in the collected editions of the author 's poems under the title " Europe , the 72d and 73d Years of These States , " with few alterations in the phraseology but many in the line-length . Even in its original form it reveals the fact that Whitman had already made the unit of thought the measure of his line , and that something more than a rudimentary rhythm had been evolved . The theme , it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , democracy , the future . These three poems were , so far as I have been able to discover , the first of Whitman 's free-verse poems to he published ; but they were not the first to be written . There is another , " New Year 's Day , 1848 , " written in an album in that year , but not published until the time of the poet 's death ( in the New York Home Journal of March 30 , 1892 ) . Still another is " Isle of La Belle Riviere , " written on Blennerhasset Island , in the Ohio , and dated " April 30 " ( first published in the Cincinnati Post , on April 30 , 1892 ) . This date of composition would seem to indicate that the poem was written on one of the all-but-unknown visits which Whitman paid to the South after his trip to New Orleans in 1848 , for this latter visit came to an end when Whitman was not yet twenty-nine years old . A still more illuminating record of the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in a notebook of Whitman 's ( now before me ) , dated 1847 , the year before the poet 's well-known but much overrated visit to New Orleans . In it are preserved many lines and passages that , in slightly altered form , were in 1855 woven into the poems of the first edition . This material , together with a large collection of poems and prose pieces , all of which have until now remained uncollected , many of which have hitherto been unknown , and not a few which date back to the very beginning of Whitman 's literary career in 1839 , will before long be published in a form that will make them accessible to students of this poet , whose real development has been so obscure to critic and to biographer alike . EMORY HOLLOWAY Adelphi College , Brooklyn , November 3 An Explanation To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Your edition of November 29 contains a review of my study , " The French Criticism of American Literature before 1850 . " Will you allow me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and of the selection of materials used ? My interest in the various American writers and in their French critics , as individuals , was only secondary . What I sought to determine was the point of view of the French in their contact with the United States as a literary nation . To get this idee moyenne I thought it necessary to discount such criticism as was made from another point of view than the literary one . Thus , a careful examination of many years of the files of the Journal des Debats convinced me that the political intention of this periodical generally influenced its reviews . Further , among the literary journals , it was imperative to abandon those which seemed prejudiced for or against a literary school . The Globe was perhaps the most tempting of all the periodicals of the time , but it represented anything rather than the idee moyenne . I investigated , often very minutely , about five times as many periodicals as are cited in my bibliography . On the other hand , a complete account was given of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were extremely numerous , but those treating of American literature , in theory or in detail , are surprisingly few . The prevalent idea appears to have been , that literature as understood in Europe was not to be expected of the new land . But I have reported some notable criticism which served as a corrective to this view . On p. viii I made the following statement : . . . these periodicals have been selected merely as containing judgments fairly representative of the general Frencn idea of our literature . Not only is no complete bibliography intended  --  although such a work would have been much appreciated had it existed  --  but no analysis is attempted of many articles or books touching the subject . . . . The present volume . . . is intended to supply a general view of its department of French criticism until the bibliography shall have bee-i. made . I omitted certain interesting notices , such as the article by Balzac mentioned by your reviewer . These I hope to note , before lone . in a continuation of the study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even modify , the views I have expressed regarding the attitude of the old civilization towards the new one , which was trying to express itself in a literature . HAROLD ELMER MANTZ New Deco3lb , - 7 Joseph Young Bergen To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Joseph Young Bergen , widely known as an educator and author of several textbooks of high excellence , died at his home in Cambridge , Mass. , October 10 , 1917 . He was born at Red Beach , Me. , February 22 , 1851 , and graduated from Antioch College in 1872 . His first scientific work was done on the Ohio Geological Survey . In 1887 he became a teacher of physics in the Boston Latin School and as a result of his experience in this field produced in collaboration with Prof. E. H. Hall , of Harvard University , a textbook of physics which has passed through three editions and is now widely used in secondary schools . For many years he was an instructor in biology in the Boston English High School . In collaboration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays on the evolutionary theory , and in 1896 he brought out under the title of " Elements of Botany " the first of a series of notable textbooks upon this subject . This work in somewhat modified form later bore the title " Essentials of Botany . " In 1901 he published his " Foundations of Botany " ? a more extended text including an abbreviated flora for school use ; subsequently , with the collaboration of Dr. 0 . W. Caldwell , " Practical Botany , " and with Prof. Bradley M. Davis , " Principles of Botany . " It is probable that no textbooks dealing with botany have been more widely used in America during the last two decades than these prepared by Mr. Bergen . They have to a great extent taken the place of the widely known textbooks of Dr. Asa Gray , which , notable in their time , were too exclusively confined to morphology and taxonomy to permit.their satisfactory use in modern school laboratories . The excellence of Mr. Bergen 's textbooks is clearly owing to prolonged personal experience in actual teaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teacher and of pupil , scholarly familiarity with the various fields into which botany has become subdivided , sound judgment , and fine sense of proportion , as well as untiring effort for clarity in both letterpress and illustrations . About 1901 Mr. Bergen retired from active teaching and spent several years in southern Italy , where he was able to enjoy the facilities for scientific study afforded by the Biological Station at Naples . Returning to Cambridge , Mass. , in 1904 , he lived in retirement , devoting much time to the revision and elaboration of his textbooks . He had a wide circle of scientific friends and correspondents , and his judgment was very often sought on matters connected with evolution and with the teaching of biology . Although honored by election to several scientific societies of prominence , Mr. Bergen was rarely able to attend their meetings . In 1915 he was chosen one of the members of the visiting committee of the botanical department of Harvard University . He was the author of a number of scientific papers , chiefly in the field of ecology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forceful style . BENJAMIN L. ROBINSON Harvard University , November 15
