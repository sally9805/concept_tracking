Sin ' In my judgment the opinion of Professor Lounsbury on the matter of " compulsory composition in colleges " deserves deep consideration . I can speak from experience of " English A " in Harvard University  --  one of the most exacting freshman composition courses in any college , and compulsory . At the time I thought it wholly admirable as just the training needed by young men ( though most students disliked it cordially ) . I am since convinced , however , that my power of expression was no greater after the training than before , except as it would naturally gain with the wider scope come with college life and increased maturity . That spontaneity suffered I am certain , and I well remember the lapse of time that was necessary to outgrow the rigidity of style and dry rhetorical precision acquired in the course , where conscious form was everything and facility dwindled to the vanishing SIR : In reading a work of Josd de Acosta , a learned Jesuit of the sixteenth century , I chanced upon an opinion concerning the practicability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Natural and Moral History of the Indies , " Bk iii , chap 10 ( Seville , 1590 , translated into English by Edward Grimston , London , 1604 , and reprinted by the Hakluyt Society , 1380 ) : ' Some have discoursed and propounded to cut through this passage of seaven leagues , and to ioyne one sea to the other , to make the passage from Peru more commodious and easie , for that these eighteene leagues of land betwixt Nombre de Dios and Panama is more painefull and chargeable than 2,300 by sea , whereupon some would say it were a meanes to drowns the land , one sea being lower than another .

As a merchant , the author naturally gave his attention chiefly to the problems of China 's material development , though some of the papers , which are literary and philosophical , show him to have been much more than a business man . He learned the language and went freely among the common people ; in the course of many journeys , he probably obtained a better knowledge of the face of the country than any European of his time ; and the outcome of this preparation provides information and reflections nowhere else to be found . Two features characterize this collection in a way that marks its chapters already as a little quaint : one of them , the reiterated complaint that the Chinese decline to accept the utilities of the Western world , and the other , the ogre of Russian predominance which looms up now and then , both serve to emphasize the change which has come over the Far Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors , he regards Americans as more formidable to British primacy in the East than Germans  --  which is not the burden of our Consular Reports  --  though he can not see " any necessary conflict of international interests in China ; the field is so immense that there is room for the occupation of all the spare capital of both Europe and America for a century to come in exploiting the undeveloped resources of this huge empire . " Mr. Little has much to tell at first hand of the province of Szechuan , the Far West of China , where the present revolt first broke out . He made a notable attempt some score of years ago to introduce steamers into this region up the Yang-tse gorges . The effort ended in . failure , but not in loss , for the Chinese , in order to end a troublesome matter , bought up the enterprising promoter 's steamer and all his belongings .

It gives us a new notion of the so-called " unchanging East " to learn that the whole population of this area , the size of France , is as recent in its origin as that of eastern Canada . Mr. Little 's fair and friendly estimate of the value of mission enterprise in China is the only chapter of this volume which has never before been printed . Though deploring the tendency of missionaries to impose dogma upon the common people , he thinks well of the results of their work as a whole , and tells us out of an abundant personal experience that their converts are much the most trustworthy class to be found in the country . It is the example of Christian living , he concludes , rather than preaching , that counts with the natives , who are about the most shrewdly watchful folk on earth . - Mr. Little 's opinions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Englishman whose " Chinese Appeal to Christendom Concerning Christian Missions , " purporting to be written by a Chinaman , is a self-confessed deceit . " Lin Shao-yang , " in a letter to the London Spectator last September , writes : " I plead guilty to the charge of being a European resident in China , and throw myself on the mercy of the court . " His " Appeal , " being a forgery in so far as it pretends to represent Chinese opinions , demands very slight consideration . Its author shows no knowledge of Chinese and little of missionary literature , basing his charges against all evangelizing enterprise upon the reports of one mission during a single year . There are plenty of criticisms of missionary methods to be made , especially if the mistakes of the past , which are now avoided by the great majority of missionaries , come up for review , but they must be presented by an honest man to command respectful notice . A sufficient answer to the animadversions of this anonymous critic is Miss Burton 's " Education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has thus far been accomplished by mission schools for the instruction of girls in the Empire . The author , after a six months ' visit in China in 1909 , returned to this country to " learn from the best available authorities the character of such education for women as existed before the entrance of Western influences , and to trace the history of modern education , using , as far as possible , original sources . " Her personal acquaintance with the country seems to have been limited to the eastern provinces , but , though a larger experience might have added to the value of herrecord , her knowledge of the subject amply qualifies her to write a book of considerable interest and usefulness . While we are inclined to distrust her conclusion , that there were virtually no educated women in the land a generation ago , the fact remains that they were few and that foreigners never came into contact with them . Until recent years missionaries met with much opposition in. their endeavors to establish girls ' schools , but the good sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance with the results . One of the most striking evidences of the volte face in the China of to-day is the eagerness with which parents now seize upon chances to get their girls into school . Indeed , it threatens already to become a mania with the sex . The new woman , drunk with the wine of her new learning , has begun to reel a little and does n't know where to stop . A pathetic instance of this is given in the story of a lady of high rank who could think of no better way to display her accomplishments than by singing the ragtime Waltz Me Around , Willie " to a room-full of dignified and ceremonious guests . China 's great need at present is a few central women 's colleges to provide teachers for the schools which the Government has ordained but can not equip with instructors . The eagerness of the " liberty girls " in an awakening nation is , according to Professor Ross , more likely to be controlled by the mission than by Government schools .

Nevertheless oxygen . is good for fish . Just so when foreign example breaks a hole in the rigid custom that confines Chinese womanhood , the eager rush of young women toward the life-giving liberty and knowledge may leave some of them clear outside their native element . " This book is the contribution of a trained observer .

European readers might complain of a rather exaggerated appreciation of the part played by America in this record , but such criticism would not be likely to discover any actual misstatements in his narrative . An erroneous impression may result now and then from efforts towards extreme condensation . The return by America of her unexpended share in the Boxer indemnity , for example , was not made , as implied , at the close of the peace negotiations , nor was the " fund " invested by the Peking Government for the education of Chinese boys abroad ; it is allocated as it becomes due .

Jean-Christophe in Paris : The Market-Place : , Antoinette ; The House . By Romain Rolland . Translated by Gilbert Cannan . New York : Henry Holt &; Co . Readers who hoped that these final chapters in the life of a German musician would not be so formless as the first four chapters published last year with the title " Jean-Christophe , " have hoped in vain . The author sticks to his former plan of trying to present the in-edited history of a soul . No spiritual adventure is too trivial to be remarked , and no sentiment that is sincere requires apology . The result to the reader is a world which seems strangely archaic and recalls that literary age in Germany when two men , having made the great discovery of a mutual sympathy , would look into each other 's eyes and cry out in unison  --  so perfect was the sympathy ? " I love you . " As is generally the case with relentless explorers of the soul , M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place more than at the outset of this volume . For even the musical soul of Jean-Christophe might be expected to summon some show of resistance from his admittedly robust body to the clangorous onslaught of Paris . The picture he makes on his first walk about the streets , with tears of sensitive revulsion running down his cheeks , his face twisted with grief , shows a human being , as it were , wrong side out . The problem of crystallizing the inmost workings of the soul even the ranging suggestion of poetry has not mastered without calling in a sturdy , variegated framework of outward facts : Subjective matter needs objective support , in literature as elsewhere . And in the account of JeanChristophe the reader never ceases to retort that this is not the whole story . The point is best illustrated by the episode of Antoinette , a girl barely twenty , who for six years struggles for the sake of her younger brother 's education . The author fixes attention entirely upon the struggle of her soul , and though her attic is near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant of physical joy from its trees and flowers  --  all is suffering sustain-. ed by pluck , all is therefore melodrama . If M. Rolland , with his sure , grasp of the least articulate of human feelings and his faculty of extracting romance from the pursuit of mere ideas , could only have collaborated with , let us say , Balzac or Flaubert ! The plot of the story is no plot at all : Jean-Christophe has reached Paris , having fled from his little town on the Rhine after an altercation with the pa lice , and proceeds in his honest , downright way to take a reckoning of the intellectual and spiritual activity of the French . His own message is held in abeyance while with open mind he searches for great ideas in others  --  but in vain . Direst poverty fails to make him compromise with the truth , and after discovering that France is meretricious through and through , he is about to work out his salvation from within , when he comes upon Olivier , the brother of Antoinette , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's frail body dwells a subtler mind than the German 's , though not less honest , and through him Christophe 's notions are tempered to sanity . He is now in complete possession of his powers and his musical creations begin to grip the thoughtful . The Beacon . By Eden Phillpotts . New York : John Lane Co . The materials of which this tale is built are a trifle over-familiar to readers who are on easy terms with their Phillpotts . The Nation has often expressed respect and liking for his studies of life , as ' it is seen faithfully upon Dartmoor , and as it is thereby seen in the large . We can not help knowing and delighting in this moor-country , its fiat lands and quiet rills , its storm-swept tors , its mists and its passions . It is not a place to tire of , but its people , we now feel for the first time , are capable of becoming tiresome . In the present tale , a ? usual , Dartmoor , a high tor , a woman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace or two back lowers a grisly ancient whose distinction ( without real difference ) is that he is even closer kin to primitive man than are the chief persons . Herein lies the charm of these moor folk . We are of like passions , the springs of our action are much the same , but we live under a mask . The rustic New Englander , for instance , is a relatively conventional person . He has the grimness and canniness of the moor people , but his inner experience is his own unconfessed even when betrayed by chance . The most striking trait of Dartmoor humanity , on the other hand , is its explicitness If one man hates another , he tells him so , and gives his reasons Or if he loves a married woman , he is equally unabashed . The most searching home-truths are habitually exchanged at the bars of these uncouth inns . And yet outward deeds of violence are rare . The desperate man , instead of shooting up the town , tells everybody what he thinks of them and of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops himself into a tarn , and there an end . Such is the fate of the grisly ancient in this tale  --  though he commits murder first , it is true , by way of marking his superiority to the Dartmoor rabble . Of the two other men the woman marries the weakling , and presently loves the strong fellow . Mr. Phillpotts has told the story before : this rendering of it is saved from superfluity by the . extraordinary and moving denouement  --  a consummation as striking as that of " The ' Whirlwind . " In detail , the book has the usual excellences of clearness and picturesqueness . Ther.e are perhaps fewer than common of those passages of emotional prose in which the writer paints his favorite landscape . And , on the whole , one gets the impression of a hand which , without flagging , begins to work a little mechanically with a stiffening material bundle of true love ? " " They are some women in the world , if a man was to seal up his trouble in a termater can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go after him to get it out . " John Temple . By Ralph Durand . Nevi York : The Macmillan Co . A seldom trodden byway of history , the Portuguese attempt to conquer Southeast Africa in the sixteenth century , furnishes the background and much of the action of this novel . John Temple , an English adventurer , captured by the- Portuguese in India , is compelled to join Francisco Barreto 's expedition against the African prince Monomatapa . The " Sao Raphael , " on which ho sails from Goa for Mozambique , is wrecked on the African coast far to the south , and the survivors reach the Portuguese outposts only after terrible hardships . Temple distinguishes himself on this march and is rewarded by a captaincy in Barreto 's army . He takes part in the disastrous expedition up the Zambesi , and as a solitary envoy to the court of Monomatapa , he terrifies that potentate into receiving him as an equal . A heroine and a love story are somewhat perfunctorily dragged into the action . In the " foreword " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel as my medium because the tale , though true , seemed too romantic for sober history The reader will easily distinguish which is fact and which is fiction if he remembers this : that all that is best in the book is fact . " The strongest part is the account of Barreto 's expedition ; here the author seems to forget all about his love story , and his narrative is spirited and effective . doner she became . Americanism could never be more than a graceful sentiment with her . One might derive her vivacity or her religious sense from the American blood ; but these , like her literary tastes , are more properly of French origin , certainly developed under French influences . so that where she is most un-English , she is almost equally un-American . Even her knack at advertising seems to have expressed rather the thrift of the bourgeois than the push of the commercial lady . In an early letter to her publisher , T. Fisher Unwin , she encloses a draft for an advertisement , and adds : " Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other thousandth ? Stevenson and Barrie and Hall Caine and all those much praised people are advertised that way ; and if it impresses the public , why not do it ? I have no nice scruples about timidity in these matters . I write books  --  not for Art 's sake ? but because I want them to be read . They are read , and I do not see why . I should make a secret of it . " Very likely , if Mrs. Craigie had written for bread she would have been more squeamish about self-advertising  --  such is the paradox of authorship . Squeamish she never was about anything . She was known and esteemed by those two survivors of a stronger time , Meredith and Hardy . For the rest her intimacies had to do with minor though more or less respectable figures ? Edmund Gosse and Clement Shorter , and , more particularly , George Moore . With the last-named expositor of " realism " she not only had a correspondence of some length , but a collaboration in " Journey 's End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , and undoubtedly whetted Mrs. Craigie 's appetite for such success . The conjunction was not without its meaning . George Moore has never been a caterer to the " Jenne fille " , and Mrs. Craigie , as wife and divorc  --  e , had passed fairly beyond that category . Precocity had always been her portion ; and it is impossible to ignore the fact that her nature held a strain of morbidness , whether physical or " psychological . " She was born a decade too early to find acknowledged place among the ranks of the now popular " neurasthenic , " but she had her affiliations with the Marie BashkirtseffMary McLane sisterhood . Her self-consciousness and self-confidence approached morbidity . She firmly believed herself to stand among the hierarchy of literary art in her own generation , and she unhesitatingly predicted that her work would have its hearing from posterity . This form of heightened self-regard is not always a sign of genius : it very often accompanies the possession of little or no ability of any sort . But , other things being equal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novels , plays , special articles , newspaper correspondence , reviews , lectures , all belonged to her output ; and for the last fifteen of her thirty-seven years - there was not an instant 's slackening in its flow . Mrs. Craigie had the real passion for excellence . Large as her product was , it is that of a careful and often painful workman . But it is not perfect , and the workman should have been able to perceive its limitations and to welcome honest criticism . This Mrs. Craigie could never do . Consequently she hated critics as a class for their unreasonable habit of exercising their reason . Her letters are full of what professes to be contempt and is really a wincing regard for the judgments of the professional commentator . " The critics do not trouble me in the least , " she cries . " They never did . I work for the public  --  not a little coterie . The Times man is , at all events , a student and a well-read critic . " Which means that the Tames man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by failing to praise her  --  unreservedly . They are therefore to be sweepingly denounced as " illiterate and vulgar . " Three of these critics of the London of 1899 were , we believe , Mr. Shaw , Mr. Archer , and Mr. Walk-ley . The truth of the matter is frankly hit off in a letter to Mrs. Craigie , written not long before her death , by Mr. Moberly Bell of the Times . The Tames reviewer , after giving high praise to " The Flute of Pan , " had unluckily added ? " but she can do and has done even better work than this " She at once writes a long letter of remonstrance to her friend B611 , who retorts : " There is one thing , and only one thing , that the Omnipotent has absolutely failed to create : He has made good women , bad women , clever women , silly women , selfish women , and heroines of self-sacrifice , but he has never yet made a woman who could stand ? I will not say adverse criticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise of any of her literary efforts . " It is not a happy life which is here recorded . Nor is it an altogether engaging personality which these numerous letters reflect . Mrs. Craigie 's father , who contributes a biographical sketch marked by good sense and good taste , admits that " some people disliked her violently at first sight . " Her nature was strongly outlined and colored . " No one could overlook her or be indifferent to her ; she either instantly attracted or strongly repelled . " Her work also is of this quality . Its virtue is mental rather than emotional : it is faceted with a hard brilliance , and its ray falls coldly upon the green and tender shoots which , in spite of crabbed seasons , are always budding forth on the gnarled stock of human nature . Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria . By Morris Jastrow , jr. , Ph.D . Professor of Semitic Languages in the University of Pennsylvania . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $2 25 net . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American . Committee for Lectures on the History of Religion , and the eighth volume published by the committee , Professor Jackson 's lectures on the " Religion of Persia , " delivered in 1907-08 , not being included in the publications Professor Jastrow is so well known as an authority on Babylonian-Assyrian religion as to guarantee the scientific value of any contribution which he makes on that subject . The present volume is less formally scientific and more popularly readable than his " Hand Book on the Religion of Babylonia and Assyria , " published in 1898 Like the German translation of that work , by the author himself , now in process of publication , this shows considerable advance on the earlier publication in general knowledge of the subject , due to discoveries made in the intervening period , both in the field and in the interpretation of documents already in hand . The most valuable chapter is that on Divination , especially divination by the liver . Here Dr. Jastrow speaks as a master The theory underlying liver divination was this : The liver is the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soul . A god identified himself with the offering made to him . The soul of the god must , therefore , express itself in the liver of the animal offered . Being altogether materialistic in their conception of the life principle or soul , the Babylonians expected to find that expression in certain outward phenomena in the liver  --  peculiarities of form and appearance ? lesions , abnormalities , or markings of any description With mathematical exactitude , they built up a pseudo-science of the interpretation of these forms and markings , partly by using principles of interpretation familiar in sympathetic magic , the right side suggesting right or favorable omens , the left the opposite , a long hepatic duct , indicating length of life or reign , and the like , partly a series of observations , . based on events on the principle of post hoc , propter Professor Jastrow devotes his first chapter , entitled Culture and Religion , to a general survey of the development of civilization in Babylonia and Assyria . With regard to the Sumerian question and the Amorite theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Haldvy , he yet does not think that this scholar has disproved the existence of a Sumerian language or of a Sumerian people ; but , on the other hand , he does not believe that the Sumerians were necessarily older than the Babylonian Semites , or that they were the originators of the BabyIonian civilization . The two peopleS developed side by side , according to his view , the Sumerians predominant in southern Babylonia , the Semites in the north , and it was the interrelation of the two which produced the remarkable civilization of Babylonia . ( We do not think this quite explains all the phenomena of script and religion . Attention should also be called to the evidences of other occupations and civilizations revealed by excavation .. ) Similarly , while not accepting Clay 's view of the Western Amorite origin of Semitic-Babylonian civilization . rather than the reverse , Professor Jastrow admits that " in accounting for the later and for some of the earlier aspects of the Sumero-Akkadian civilization this factor of Amurru must be taken into account " ( p. 26 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , ali:eady noted , that " the earliest permanent settlements of Semites in the Euphrates valley appear to be in the northern portion " ( p. 27 ) , suggesting an immediate connection with Syria rather than with Arabia . Assyrian civilization , as distinguished from Babylonian , he believes to have been largely influenced by the Hittites . In the matter of the new Astral-Mythological theory , represented especially by Winkler and Jeremias , Jastrow , with all courtesy , declines to compromise . The astral mythologists , be it said , are the men who would trace not only the myths and legends of the earlier chapters of Genesis to Babylonian-Assyrian sources , but also virtually all Hebrew traditions , including the legends of the patriarchs , and much if not most of Hebrew history . In the accounts of some of the greatest historical personages in the Old and New Testaments , among others David and Jesus , they find " reflections of an astral mythology and an astral theology which were developed in the priestly schools of the Euphrates valley " ( p. 413 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Professor Jastrow seems to us to overlook the tribal and local nature of some of the Babylonian and Assyrian gods , all of whom he reduces to manifestations of the sun , moon , stars , and meteorological phenomena . This - connection does , in fact , lie in some of the names , like Shamash , sun ; 112 , moon , etc , and doubtless , as organized into a Pantheon , the Babylonian gods became largely , if not entirely , expressions of heavenly phenomena ; but originally not a few of them were , we believe , merely tribal gods , without special astral or meteorological significance . Dr. Jastrow , it may be added , has carried this treatment of the Babylonian gods over into the Old Testament field . He continually refers to Yahaweh ( by the way , he writes this consistently Jahweh , a vicious transference of a German transliteration which does not represent to the English reader the true sound of the letters ) as a storm god . This , we submit , - is not correct . Yahaweh was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god . Various traits and attributes are ascribed to him , among others , meteorological traits and attributes ; but he is not confined to those attributes , and is in no sense a personification of those traits , nor did he ever become so ; in which the Hebrew religious development differs very much from the Babylonian . The book is well and abundantly illustrated , a novelty in the volumes of this series . Dr. Jastrow has provided also , evidently with much labor , chronological lists , a study of which , as it seems to us , can only serve to convince the reader of the uncertainty of all things Babylonian . To begin with , Dr. Jastrow belongs to the very late school , so that all dates are placed at their lowest possible term . Down to 753 B. c. he prefixes a circa to every Babylonian date . Before the time of Hammurabi , " c. 1958-1916 , " he indicates an uncertainty not only as to dates , but even as to the order of the names on his lists , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from circa 30-50 B. 0 . to circa 2200 B. c. , which he enumerates , the position in sequence of seventeen is marked as conjectural . We doubt whether it is worth while to burden the student of comparative religion with a discussion of Babylonian dates , so Long as the present uncertainty regarding them prevails , least of all in a popular work like this .

It would be hard to-imagine two books on the same subject , in similar compass , and written from essentially the same point of view , more unlike in their treatment tnan these two new volumes on Martin Luther . Professor McGiffert 's book is the work of a practiced hand . It was written originally for the Popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses itself , and this original form is essentially reproduced in the handsome volume before us . It is furnished with numerous and appropriate illustrations very beautifully done , and adding really material interest to the text . The narrative flows easily from beginning to end , as if the author had thought it all out long beforehand and were simply telling his story out of abundant material completely in hand . There is not a reference to authorities , not even the slightest vestige of a bibliography . We are left wholly in the dark as to the author 's special studies for this work , and are free to read it with the quiet assurance that he has studied widely and thoroughly , and made up his picture of the man and his accomplishment from more than a mere monographic research into this and that detail . Dr. Smith 's work , on the other hand , impresses one at once , as it was doubtless intended to do , with the extent and seriousness of the writer 's special preparation . His introduction to the world of scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared as his thesis for the doctorate in 1907 , and his time since then has been largely spent in these more extended Luther studies . There is a fine spirit of youthful enthusiasm , visible throughout . The effect of a long German training shows itself in a method which continually reveals the processes of the author 's own researches . There is frequent reference to the sources of his narrative , though it is seldom that the page is overburdened with footnotes . There is an appendix of fifty pages in which , following the order of the chapters , are given a very elaborate bibliography and a brief selection of letters . Precisely why this book should have been called a " Life and Letters " is not clear . One might fairly have expected from such a title an examination of Luther 's extended correspondence , but nothing of the sort appears . The only fitness of the title seems to come from the considerable use of letters as a means of telling the story of Luther 's life . This is by no means an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one edition , and Luther 's biographers have never been slow to avail themselves of these treasures . Dr. Smith 's selections are judiciously made , and the translations are refreshingly spirited . The author has sought to reproduce the spirit of the originals , serious where the subject is weighty , and where , as in the Table-talk , burdened mind of the great men sought relief in playful good-natured badinage . Both the authors here in review have realized to its full extent the complicated nature of the man they are trying to describe . Neither of them can often be accused of falling into the vulgar error of seeking to explain or to defend him on the ground of individual utterances . They have seen clearly that there is hardly any accusation ever made against him which can not be supported by some word out of his own mouth . Equally they are aware that every kind of laudation that has been so lavishly poured out upon him can be justified in the same way. - The method of matching phrases seldom advances very materially our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more true of any one than of Luther . ' In both books we are led on to see the development of his attitude towards the great questions of his time in its manifold reactions . From the thoughtful and contemplative scholar , shy and self-distrustful , yet from the beginning profoundly impressed with a few great truths , we see him advancing to the stage of positive assertion , then of defence , and then , as his word found a wide response in the hearts of his people , we are led to feel with him the burden of an ever-increasing responsibility . That was the time of trial , and the only wonder is that his great spirit so seldom found itself betrayed into self-contradiction or even into sophistical self-deception . Comparing the treatment of several critical moments of Luther 's life by the two authors , we get the best illustration of their different methods . Dr. McGiffert is concerned more with the general effect and the ultimate outcome .

A more careful reading , however , dispels this doubt and convinces us that he has mastered the detail of controversy before venturing upon his narrative . Dr. Smith , on the other hand , gives us as full reference to the sources of opinion on the one side and the other as his space will allow . He fortifies his conclusions with interesting selections from Luther 's own words and holds the balance fairly between conflicting opinions .
