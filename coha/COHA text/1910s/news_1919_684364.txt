txt RUSSIAN TRADE . Germany 's Advantage In Furnishing Long-Time Credits . To the Editor of The New York TinteR : Professor Goldstein , in his very instructive article on American trade opportunities in Russia , which appeared in your paper last Sunday , has ablypresented the Russian side of the problem . There is , however , an American side to It which explains why American exporters have made so little headway in Russia . I became interested in this subject thirteen years ago , immediately after the proclamittion of the Russian Constitution of Oct. 30 , 1905 . A comparative study of American official statistics of exports and Russian official statistics of Imports revealed to me the fact that one-half of the American cotton consumed in Russian factories was exported from the United States to Germany and re-exported by German firms to Russia . About that time direct steamship communication had just been established between the United States and Russia by way of the Baltic and the Black Sea , and it appeared reasonable . that the elimination of the German middleman by the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers must prove advantageous to both parties . I discussed this subject with Mr. Daniel W. Roper , who was at that time in charge of cotton statistics collected by the Bureau of the Census . He became interested in this question and made unofficial inquiries among the leading cotton exporters , who fur niched him the key to the puzzle . It appeared that the leading Russian cotton manufacturers had their own purchasing agents in the United States , who shipped the cotton directly to Russia . . On the other hand , the smaller Russian manufacturers demanded long term credits , which the American exporters were unwilling to grant . Here the German broker stepped in . He bought the American cotton on ninety days ' credit and sold it to the Russian manufacturer on six months ' notes . the German banks financing the operation . It is this lack of credit facilities that accounts for the seemingly inexplicable fact that " undyed skins of opossum and kangaroo " ( No. 218 of Professor Goldstein 's diagrams ) were nearly all exported to Russia from Germany , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not a specifically Russian problem . It likewise applies to the South American trade . In order that American manufacturers may successfully compote with their European rivals in foreign markets , the American banking system must adapt itself to the requirements of foreign trade . ISAAC A. HOURWICH . . Brooklyn , Jan. 3 , 1919 . President Wilson 's Ideals . To the Editor 1,1 The New York Times : Let me thank you most heartily for presenting to the American people Mr. John P.
