THE perusal of the letters and papers of a leader of an unsuccessful cause , involving the position of a great body of people , is always an absorbing and fascinating occupation , all the more so , perhaps , because of the melancholy fact of failure , which , when nobly sustained , rarely fails to enlist our sympathy . Some such thought as this came to me during my research in the months of January and February of the present year among the private and official papers of Jefferson Davis , which are in the custody of the directors of Memorial Hall in the city of New Orleans . The investigation of this collection was undertaken with the belief that a full interpretation of the life and character of Jefferson Davis , with a view to the place that must be assigned him in history , can only be had in the unstudied and unexplored sources consisting of his own correspondence and papers , which is not possible until all such material has been brought together in one place and made accessible to careful and impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West Point it was the habit of Mr. Davis to carefully preserve his papers , and many of his letters in later life refer to these earlier collections . At the close of the Civil War , when Richmond was evacuated , the executive archives of the Confederacy were , with all of the President 's private papers , securely boxed and taken to Danville , Virginia , on the special train which left the capital of the Confederate States on the night of April 2 , 1865 . The vicissitudes and spoliations to which the papers were subjected from that time to 1877 , when they were finally collected at Beauvoir . were very great , and much was lost that can never be reclaimed . Soon after his release from Fortress Monroe Mr. Davis decided to prepare and publish a history of the Southern Confederacy , and though he was several times diverted from his purpose , with ? that end constantly in view he began to make more systematic efforts each year to locate and recover his papers , which were so necessary to the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive archives had been preserved by Colonel Burton N. Harrison , his private secretary , while a part of his private and official papers had been captured by Federal cavalry and placed in the custody of the War Department ? in Washington . Though meeting with only partial success , he continued with unremitting efforts to collect his scattered records . Colonel Harrison sent the papers he had preserved , and some of a private nature were returned to Mr. Davis from the War Department . When he went to live at Beauvoir , near the end of the seventies , he converted one of the offices , which , in accordance with the custom in the South , was built separately from the main building , into a library ; and it was here that he collected his material and prepared for the publishers his Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government . At the time of his death in 1889 this little frame building was still the repository of his books and papers and many articles of historical value . After the death of Mr. Davis , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain permanently in a frame building , decided to deposit the collection in a safe place . Her first impulse was to give them , to the State of Mississippi , for safe-keeping in the State Capitol in Jackson ; but upon investigation it was found that the official archives of the stafe were at that time very much neglected , and this fact caused her to turn her attention to New Orleans , where , several years before the death of her husband , Mr. Harry T. Howard , a public-spirited citizen of that city , had presented a beautiful little fire-proof building to the Louisiana Historical Association , an organization of Confederate veterans that had already gathered together a large and valuable collection of historical relics relating to the Civil War . This building was made the official repository for the collections of the New Orleans Confederate Camps , and it was here that Mrs. Davis finally decided to place her husband 's papers . The papers were found in the same condition in which they had been received from Mrs. Davis , tied in packets with little or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no eye for decades had perused them . As one turns the pages of the letter-book of the President of the Confederacy , a letter to William M. Brooks , president of the Alabama Convention of 1861 , is found which gives a clear insight into the policies of the Confederate government in the beginning of 1862 , and sets forth some of the criticisms directed against them in the State of Alabama . Mr. Davis 's letter to ; fudge Brooks was written in justification of his governmental , military , and appointive policies , and it is given in full . SEITERSON DAVIS TO W. M. BROOKS . Iticarworm , VA. , Mardi 131,4,1882 . Roe . W. 11 . Brooks , Marion , A a. : Mr DEAR SIR , ? If under other cirennistances I might be unwilling to hear criticism of acts , the condition of the country now too fully engrosses all my thoughts and feelings to permit such selfish impatience , and I have read yours of the 25th inst. , anxious to gather from it information , and thankful for your friendly remembrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error of my attempt to defend all of the frontier , seaboard , . and inland ; but will say in justification that if we had received the arms and munitions which we had good reason to expect , that the attempt would have been successful and the battlefields would have been on the enemy 's soil . You seem to have fallen into the not uncommon mistake of supposing that I have chosen to carry on the war upon a " purely de-fensive " system . The advantage of selecting the time and place of attack Was too apparent to have been overlooked , but the means might have been wanting . Without military stores , without the workshops to create them , without the power to import them , necessity , not choice , has compelled us to occupy strong positions and everywhere to confront the enemy without reserves . The country has supposed our armies more numerous than they were and our munitions of war more extensive than they have been . I have borne reproach in silence because to reply by an exact statement of facts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the ease is fully understood , will do justice to the men who have most suffered from hasty judgment and unjust censure . Military critics will not say to me as you do , " Your experiment is a failure , " hut , rather wonder at the disproportion between the means and the results . You inform me that " the highest and most reputable authors " say that I " have not had a cabinet council for more than four months ! ' I read your letter to a , member and ex-member of my cabinet to-day ; they were surprised at the extravagance of the falsehood , and did not believe that so much as a - week had at any time occurred without a cabinet consultation . I would like to know who the authors of such stories are . Your own estimate of me , I hope , assured you that I would not , as stated , treat the " Secretary of War " as a " mere clerk " ; and if you know Mr. Benjamin , you must realize the impossibility of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opposition here complain that I cling too closely to my cabinet , not , as in your section , that they are disregarded ; and the only contempt of the sentiments of Congress which is here alleged against me ( so far as I have heard ) is that their wish for the removal of two or more members of the cabinet has not been yielded to . Perhaps there might be added dissatisfaction on the part of a few at the promotion or appointment of military officers without consulting the members of Congress in relation to them . Against the unfounded story that I keep the generals of the army in leading-strings may be set the frequent complaint that . I do not arraign them for what is regarded their failures or misdeeds , and do not respond to the popular clamor by displacing commanders upon irresponsible statements . You cite the eases of Generals Johnston and Beauregard but you have the story notains mutat ? , and though General Johnston was offended because of his relative rank , he certainly never thought of resigning ; and General Beauregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIVATE AND OFFICIAL PAPERS OF JEFFERSON DAVIS 99 understand the Congress refused to publish , made a statement for which I asked his authority , but it is surely a slander on him to say that he ever considered himself insulted by me . The grossest ignorance of the law and the farts can alone excuse the statement as to the ill-treatment of General Price by me . His letters do not permit me to believe that he is a party to any such complaint . If , as you inform me , it is " credibly said " that I " have scarcely a friend and not a defender in Congress or in the army , " yet for the sake of our country and its cause . I must hope it is falsely so said , as otherwise our fate must be confided to a multitude of hypocrites . It would be easy to justify the appointments which have been made of brigadier-generals by stating the reasons in each case , but suffice it to say that I have endeavored to avoid bad selections by relying on military rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the ease was one of promotion . It is easy to say that men are proscribed because of their political party . Look for yourself and judge by the men filling the offices whether I have applied party tests . When everything is at stake and the united power of the South alone can save us , it is sad to know that men can deal in such paltry complaints and tax their ingenuity to slander because they are offended in not gelling office . I will not follow the example set me and ascribe to them bad motives , but deem it proper to say that the effect of such assaults , so far as they succeed in destroying the confidence of the people in the administration of their government , must be to diminish our chances of triumph over the enemy , and practically do us more harm than if twice the number of men I can suppose to be engaged in such work were to desert to the standard of Lincoln . You are , no doubt , correct in your view of the propriety of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive that when a small force is opposed to a large one , the alternative is to retreat or fortify some strong position , and , as did General Jackson at New Orleans , thus compensate for the want of numbers . But the strength of an army is not merely dependent on numbers ; another element is discipline and instruction . The first duty now is to increase our forces by raising troops for the war , and bringing out all the private arms of the country for the public defense . If we can achieve our independence , the office-seekers are welcome to the one I hold , and for which possession has brought no additional value to me than that set upon it when before going to Montgomery I announced my preference fur the commission of a general in the army . VOL . CXXIV. ? No. 73:1. - 13 Accept my thanks for the kindness which you have manifested in defending me when so closely surrounded by evil reports . Without . knowing what are the many things you have supposed me to have done , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposition was based on the statements of these " reputable authors " before noticed that was more worthy of your defense than you believed when making it . Very respectfully , your friend , JEFFF.RSON DAVIS . From a time-worn packet tied with tape of Confederate gray you take a letter which tells of the wish of an Alabama woman to give her silver plate to be coined into money for the use of the Confederate government . In reply to this letter Mr. Davis unconsciously pays the women of the Confederacy a tribute that has never been equaled during all these years of honoring her for what she was to the South at that period . That his conception of historical values was true is shown in the estimate he then placed upon her service , which is the same that history has made after the lapse of half a century . In acknowledging the patriotic offer , Mr. Davis sent the following reply : JEFFERSON DAVIS TO MRS . SARAH E. COCHRANE . EXECUTIVE OFFICE . RICHMOND , - Tune 5,1862 . Mrs. Sarah B. Cochrane , Camden , Wilcox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grateful acknowledgment of your generous offer to place your silver plate at the disposal of the government with a view of its being coined into money . As Congress has not yet provided for the establishment of a coinage , it would not be practicable to carry out the object to which you desire so liberally to contribute ; nor do I think that the time has yet come ? I trust it may never come ? when it will be necessary to make such a sacrifice as you propose . Your letter has , however , been sent to the Secretary of the Treasury to be placed on file in his department , so that should I be mistaken and the necessity arise , your proffer may be accepted as a material aid and as a moral example for others to follow . The devotion , energy , and patriotism which the daughters of the South have displayed since the commencement of our struggle for independence , as well in the fortitude with which they have parted with husbands , sons , and brothers gone forth to the battle-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministered to the wants , relieved the sufferings , and cheered the spirits of our gallant soldiers , have won for them the undying gratitude of their countrymen , and will constitute one of the brightest records in our country 's history . I remain , madam , very respectfully yours , JEFFERSON DAVIS . No part of the Memorial Hall collection is more valuable than the correspondence of Mr. Davis after the war . From about 1867 to the time of his death in 1559 he conducted an extensive correspondence with Confederate leaders . These letters relate to subjects of great historical interest . In this collection you find one from General Lee , upon the subject of Mr. Davis 's imprisonment in Fortress Monroe , which reveals the deep and tender friendship which existed between the President of the Confederacy and the commander of its armies . R. E. LEE TO JEFFERSON DAVIS . LEXINGTON , Va. , 1 June , 1967 . MY DEAR Ma . DAVIS , ? YOU can conceive better than I can express the misery which your friends have suffered from your long imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this been more painful than to me , and the impossibility of affording relief has added to my distress . Your release has lifted a load from my heart which I have not words to tell , and my daily prayer to the great Ruler of the World is that He may shield you from all future harm , guard you from all evil , and give you that peace which the world can not take away . That the rest of your days may be triumphantly happy is the sincere and earnest wish of your most obt. faithful friend and servt , R. E. LEE . TIonble . Jefferson Davis . After his release from Fortress Monroe , Mr. Davis was invited to become the guest of ex-President Franklin Pierce in the following letter directed to Mrs. Davis . It reveals the well-known friendship existing between the two men dating from the Mexican War , FRANKLIN PIERCE TO MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS . CONCORD , N. H .. May 14,1807 . MY DEAR Mss .

I infer from a remark of Gen. D. that you may all , in the first instance , proceed to Canada to see your boys . I would not influence your husband with regard to his movements , but I am strongly impressed with the conviction that his state of health , if no other consideration , should settle the question of his remaining at the North during the summer months now near at hand . My cottage at Little Boon 's Head will be ready to receive all your family by the middle of August . The latter part of that month and the whole of Sept. is usually delightful there .

FORD TO JEFFERSON DAVIS . 97 CLARK ST. , BROOKLYN , N. Y. , Apl . 14 , ' 88 . JEFFERSON DAVIS , ESQ. , ? EXt7aetS from Southern papers , purporting to give your talk with a N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is untrue that Mr. Greeley signed your bail bond at the importunity of Mrs. Davis . In the interest of accurate history , may I ask you if you are aware that she did correspond with him while you were in Fortress Monroe ? I have a number of letters from her to him , which show great . desire on her part to interest him , and secure his aid in obtaining your release . Respectfully , GORDON L. FORD . JEFFERSON DAVIS TO GORDON L. FORD . BEAuvoiR , HARRISON Co. , zoth Aug. , , 885 . Mr. Gordon L. Ford , Brooklyn , N. Y. : I have reed . your letter of the 14th inst. , referring to a recently published conversation with me in regard to the action of Mr. Greeley in becoming one of the sureties on my bail bond at Richmond , Va . To your inquiry whether I am aware that my wife wrote to Mr. Greeley asking for his aid to ebtain my release from imprisonment , I reply affirmatively . The object of your inquiry is not perceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave him in that conversation , and ou many other occasions , of having been actuated by a higher motive than friendship for me , or compliance with the appeal of my wife for his aid . In my conclusion that Mr. Greeley was moved solely by his sense of justice , I am sustained by his own affirmation , as well as by attending circumstances . When my wife was liberated from the restraint imposed upon her after any incarceration , she zealously strove by every justifiable means to secure any release from close confinement . She had well-founded fears that the cruel treatment to which she heard I was subjected would speedily terminate in my death . Being informed that Mr. Greeley had great influence over the powers which then held me imprisoned , she wrote to him letters of which you inform me you now have possession . If those letters have value , as you state , " in the interest of accurate history , " it must be as an exhibition of a wife 's ardent work for the relief of her husband ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of right against oppression , for his claim to consideration therefor rests upon his self-sacrificing devotion to justice and the laws and the Constitution of the United States . The case on which Mr. Greeley had finally to act was one of imprisonment without warrant of commitment for two years after the war had ended , and denial , by Executive mandate , of the benefit of the sacred writ of habeas corpus , the common right to know of what one is accused and to be confronted with his accusers . Then the question arose could not the writ be issued without requiring Mr. Greeley 's name on the bail bond , if so for pecuniary consideration he wished to avoid being one of the sureties ? Judge Shea of New York City . who was of my counsel and twice visited Presid't Johnson , can tell how his selfish fears caused him to insist on having the name of Mr. Greeley on the bond , and how Mr. Greeley , when informed that his name was a pre ? requisite to permitting the writ to he issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the prospect of pecuniary loss , to become one of the bondsmen for me with whom he never had even a speaking acquaintance , and in whom he could only have remembered a political opponent . if there could be any who hold that it would have been more creditable to Mr. Greeley if he had acted from personal friendship , or from sympathy , or to escape from importunity , rather than from principle dominating self-interest , material and political , to them I have no argument to offer . Yr. obt. servant , JEFFERSON DAVIS . Endorsed ; Rough draft of letter to G. L. Ford about Mr. Greeley as one of the sureties on my bail bond . On August 31 , 1861 , President Davis sent to the Congress the names of five generals in the army of the Confederate States , to take rank as follows , viz. : " Samuel Cooper , to date from 16th May , 1861 ; Albert S. Johnston , to date from 30th May , 1861 ; Robert E. Lee , to date from 14th June , 1861 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1861 ; G. T. Beauregard , to date from 21st July , 1861 . " Joseph E. Johnston was greatly dissatisfied with his rank , and became bitterly incensed against Mr. Davis . He protested to the President to the point of insubordination , and later served notice that he would disregard orders from the " headquarters of the forces . " Although he was in command of the chief army of the Confederate States , he continued to nurse his supposed grievance . This was the beginning of a misunderstanding which was never healed . The following letter of Mr. Davis to James Lyons , who had been one of the representatives from Virginia to the Confederate Congress , gives his reasons for removing General Johnston from the command of the Army of the Tennessee . JEFFERSON DAVIS TO . T.kliES LYONS . BRAUN-Onto IIARRIWN Co. , Miss. , 15th Aug. , 1.576 . MY REAR FRIEND , ? Maj. Waltha 11 has read to me your letters . and in compliance with your request I give to you my recollections in regard to the remova I of Geol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Atlanta , Ga . You arc correct in attributing to me a great reluctance to order his removal at that time . I had for some time resisted the advice of my cabinet and other friends to remove Gerd . Johnston from command . For , though I was deeply disappointed in his course from the time he commenced his retreat from Dalton , and so was compelled to admit the just foundation for the disaffection of others , I realized more fully than they did the serious objection to a change of commander in the face of an enemy threatening to attack . The Seety. of War , impatient at the failure of Gent . Johnston to inform the government of his prospects or purposes , proposed to ask him to communicate them . I assented , and he , Mr. Seddon , sent a telegram , to which was returned a vague answer ; then ' another and more positive inquiry was made , to which the answer was such as was considered indicative of a purpose not to defend Atlanta with his army , but to intrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To you who are so familiar with our condition , especially our dependence on the system of Georgia railroads for the food with which we were holding the field in Va. , it is needless to explain the magnitude of the evil to result from the continued retreat of the nrmy through Ga . Suffice it to say that I thought the injury consequent upon a change of commanders less than that of leaving Genl . Johnston longer in command . When , therefore , speaking of the event soon after it occurred , I would probably speak of it with regret , and as forced upon me . But this did not mean by the will of others as much as by the necessity of the case . To you , to whom my heart was so often laid bare during our trials , it is , l hope , needless to state that no personal feelings entered into my action , save the sorrow I felt that anything should obstruct our progress to Success in that effert on which depended so entirely my highest hopes and dearest wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat on the sea-shore of Miasi. , joins me in most affectionate remembrance to Mrs. Lyons and yourself . Ever faithfully , JEFFERSON DAVIS . Col. James Lyons . Endorsed : Jefferson Davis to lion . James Lyons , concerning removal of Cen . J. E. Johnston ; 13 Aug. , 1870 . Mr. Davis , in the course of his correspondence with Judah P. Benjaminafter the war , frequently adverted to subjects which had become controversial . The following letter from Mr. Benjamin throws new light on the military operations of General Joseph E. Johnston . J. P. RENJA.MIN TO JEFFERSON DAVIS . LOPIDON , 15117 February , 1879 , Mr PEAR FRIEND , ? I received this week yours of 20th ulto. , inclosing copy of a letter to me from Major Walthall dated on the 14th August last . I am mortified that Major Walthall should have been so long under the impression that I conli be discourteous enough to leave such a letter unanswered . The truth is I never received it , and it must have been lost in a package of about a dozen letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long vacation . I left London mi. the 9th August and did not return till the end of October , and during ray absence one of the weekly packages forwarded to me by my clerk miscarried , and I have never been able to trace it . I can only conjecture that Major Walthall 's letter was in the missing package , for it is the first time since my residence in England that a letter has failed to reach me . Reverting to the subject of your letter , I have a very lively recollection of the circumstances attending the removal of Genl . Johnston from the command of the Army of Tennessee , but unfortunately I have not a like recollection of the interview you mention at which the Cabinet was present when he commanded the Army of Tennessee ( Army of the Potomac ) . It has entirely faded from my memory. * So far as regards the Army of the Potomac , my only recollection is that our confidence in the generalship of Genl . Johnston was rudely shaken when we became convinced that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been built in his immediate front and crossed by a large body of the enemy before he had become aware of the existence of the bridge ; all this within a few miles of Richmond , where every foot of the country ought to have been perfectly familiar to him , and where his scouts ought . to have given him almost hourly reports of any movement of the enemy . With respect , however , to the removal of Genl . Johnston from the command of the Army of Tennessee . my memory is actively alive , because 1 was most anxious for his removal at a much earlier date . We had drained every resource of the Confederacy to furnish Genera l Johnston with the largest *Error to army referred to , it was while he commanded in Va . Note by Mr. Davis . army that we ever succeeded in gathering together . Every other position was denuded to furnish him with troops and munitions of war . He was in possession of the passes of a range of mountains affording admirable positions for offensive as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and force a passage . His army contained large numbers of the inhabitants of the country who had gathered round him in defense of their homes . Every possible motive apparently urged him to fight . Yet day after day , and week after week , his telegrams reached us announcing the abandonment of his positions one after the other without any serious attempt at defense , and as he fell back his force was diminished by the desertion of the men who found that their homes were being abandoned to the enemy . The telegrams from Mr. Seddon were urgent , and finally amounted to a direct order to risk a battle at all hazards , anything being preferable to the fatal course lie was pursuing , and still he retreated and finally debouched on the plains , pursued by the triumphant enemy who had driven him , practically without resistance on his part , through the whole mountainous country down to Atlanta . Before he had reached the plains I became satisfied that he would never deliver corn hat . I was most anxious and urgent that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still hesitation until his purpose was made to continue the retreat of his army and to abandon Atlanta to the defense of the militia ; there was an end of all doubt and the cabinet was unanimous ( at least I remember no dissentient ) in urging a change of commander . I must guard myself against misconstruction . No one has a higher estimate of Gen. Johnston 's personal gallantry than myself , but from a close observation of his career I became persuaded that his nervous dread of losing a battle would prevent at all times his ability to cope with an enemy of nearly equal strength , and that opportunities would thus constantly be lost which under other commanders would open a plain path to victory . I have thus given you , my dear friend , the recollections which you ask for . So far as the use of my name is concerned , I freely confess that it is not agreeable to mix in any way in controversies of the past which for me are buried forever . If at any time your character or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be indeed an arrant coward to permit this feeling to interfere with my prompt advance to your side to repel the calumny . But in any other case I long only for repose . I seek rest and quiet after the exhausting labors of 68 years of a somewhat turbulent or rather adventurous life . Pray give my best respects to Major Walt-hall and explain my seeming discourtesy . Ever yours fitith'y , J. P. BENJAMIN . Hon. Jeff . Davis , Beauvoir P. O. , Miami . Recognition of the Confederate States by the nations of Europe was the great aim . of the diplomatic agents which it sent abroad . The following letter from George M. Henry . a secret agent of the Confederacy , to President Davis has an important bearing on the attitude of several European nations regarding recognition . GEO . M. RETRY TO JEFFERSON DAVIS . CORNE1 OVLIts , = , CRAGS STRRETS , To His Ene4leney Jefferson Davis , President of the Confederate States : DEAR Sin. ? At this trying juncture in the affairs of the Confederacy I can not refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the journals of this morning . Having had a greater opportunity than any one else at present within the limits of these States of watching the fluctuations of the public mind in Europe for nearly four years , I have no hesitation in saying that the ad-vices thus furnished , regarding France and Mexico and the United States , I believe to he perfectly true . The Emperor Napoleon 's movement in reference to Mexico was very - unpopular in Paris until the French arms achieved success . His people have now become impatient at the delay , on the part of the ' United States , in the recognition of the New Empire . May he not then desire to join forces with the South ? A pro-slavery man himself , the " peculiar institution " of these States has not stood in the way of his acknowledging their independence ; but , there is no denying that among many of the masses in France there is a strong abolition feeling . A further question then arises : may he not be induced to humor that feeling by insisting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journals of the Confederacy , unwisely in my belief , have intimated that such a bargain could be made ? We have a , good friend in Austria in consequence of the opposition of the Southern members of the Federal Congress to the recognition of the independence of Hungary , so strongly urged by the Senators and Representatives from ? the Northern States . Austria , then , being interested in the Mexican question , has no doubt pressed France , as much as she could , to act in behalf of this Confederacy . England will probably look on for a while longer . She owes France a grudge for the position that power took last year in reference to the Danish question . But she may eventually be drawn into the conflict . A very erroneous notion prevails in the public mind here in regard to the course of England toward this Confederacy . The Slavery question has not for one moment or in any degree retarded her recognition of the independence of these States . Abolitionism in England is as dead as Unionism in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ceased to be representative men . Earl Russell was " shelved " from the Commons into the Lords , in consequence of his unpopularity ; and neither Mr. Cobden nor Mr. Bright will be returned to Parliament at the ensuing elections . England has been twice on the eve of recognizing the independence of the Confederacy . Once , at the time Mr. Gregory made his motion , or rather when he gave notice that he intended to move for that object ? March 4 , I8fl1 . The notice was given , if I remember aright , through some correspondence with Mr. Miles , of South Carolina , explanatory of the right of secession . The late General Campbell , then United States Consul at London , told me that a member of the British cabinet ? I think it was Milner Gibson ? stated to him that the English Government would be obliged to receive tninister , y from the Southern States , under the existing treaties . The first Commissioners , however , who arrived in Europe , while Mr. Gregory 's motion was pending , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which gave ( then ) Lord John Russell an opportunity of treating these Sovereign States as if they were revolted provinces of a mother-country . Those Commissioners desired to form new treaties ; they should have been content with those already in existence . They completely ignored the historical fact that the United States Government had never been formally acknowledged by any power upon earth . They , too , put forward the revolutionary words ? " the consent of the governed " ? employed in the Declaration of Independence . It was unreasonable to expect that under that revolutionary right England would at once enter into new treaty engagements . England had again determined to recognize the independence of the South in the autumn of 180 , ? just after the defeat of McClellan and the return to Europe of the Orleans Princes . These Orleans Princes hold intimate relations with the Queen and aristocracy of Britain , and they expressed their opinion that the South could not be subjugated . Manchester , however , on that occasion stepped in , and remonstrated against any interference in American affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determination on the part of the British Ministry not to move in the matter until called upon to do so by the people of Lancashire ? the parties most directly interested in the commerce with the South . While the aristocratic classes govern England , they are ruled by the manufacturing , commercial , and financial classes . Next to Lancashire , Mincing Lane , and Lombard Street , the Queen is our most formidable enemy in England , and the only person who has influence over her is her oldest daughter , the Crown Princess of Prussia . The Royal family of Prussia are in our favor . The Confederacy has always had justice Recorded it when it has appeared before the law courts of England , and that , too , from both judges and juries . Mr. Mason arrived too late in England to repair the error of his predecessors , who had made but little headway among the governing classes of the kingdom . Mr. Mason often expresses great regret at the surrender of the Commissioners and their Secretaries improperly taken by the Sam Jacinto from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfied the national vanity of England that her people were disposed to receive more complacently than they otherwise would have done the subsequent insults and demands of the Northern Government . I have the honer of inclosing to you a pamphlet containing some views on a question that seems to have been neglected by all the political economists . With great respect , very truly yours , CEO . M. HENRY .
