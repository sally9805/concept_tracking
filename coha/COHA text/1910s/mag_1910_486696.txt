That the Democrats at the Capitol should be talking of Harmon and Wilson as the ticket for 1912 is merely a matter of course . While other material is available in the country , these two men are marked out plainly at the head of the list . It is a fortunate accident that their prominence in virtue of their record chimes in with those geographical and political considerations which usually figure as determining factors in the choice . Indeed , this latter is true in a quite exceptional degree ; for not only does Wilson represent the East and Harmon the Middle West , but there are two other elements of very great pertinence . In the first place , Wilson , although he has made his career north of Mason and Dixon 's line , is Southern by birth and breeding , and distinctively a Southerner in type . And secondly ; both these men have carried by heavy majorities States which had long been regarded as hopelessly Republican . The really interesting question is whether it should be thought of as Harmon and Wilson or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments of the next eighteen months will have a great deal to say . The meeting of the Governors at Frankfort , whatever merits it may have embodied , has been sadly disappointing to those who hope to see these annual conferences develop into an institution directly efficient in the conduct of government . Stimulating and beneficial to the participants it may have been , in the same . way as are those annual gatherings of scientists and scholars which have become a part of the established order in the world of learning ; but of a more immediate advancement of the large objects cherished by the originators and advocates of the idea there was little indication . The Governors themselves recognize this , as is shown in the suggestion that the next meeting should be held at some out-of-the-way place , where there would be no opportunity for social distractions . A body that has no definite task to the fulfilment of which it is committed needs every possible safeguard against the temptation to take the path of least resistance ; and evidently the conference of Governors , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is no exception to this rule . John R. McLean 's announcement that he is a candidate for the Ohio Senatorship completes the list of men who should not be elected . If Sheehan were to be the most visible fruit of the Democratic victory in New York , James Smith in New Jersey , and McLean in Ohio , the betting on chances in 1912 would at once show odds in favor of the Republicans . Till now , the two men most prominently talked of in Ohio are Mr. Hanley , chairman of the Democratic State Committee , and Mr. Pomerene , just elected Lieutenant-Governor . To the former it is objected that , froth his record and associations , he would be no improvement even on Senator Dick . As for Mr. Pomerene , no one pretends that he has shown statesmanship of high rank , but he is comparatively young , is an able debater , an earnest student of public affairs , and a man of views above machine politics . He would at least have brains to put against McLean 's barrel ; - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ohio Democrats ought not to hesitate . No less than $344,000 spent by the racing interests to influence legislation in New York State within three years ? $188,000 in 1908 alone  --  is the discovery of the Bruce Investigating Committee . One lobbyist , now resident in London , received $40,290 for his services at one session of the Legislature . Of course , this was for purely legitimate work , such as seeing legislators , influencing agricultural fair associations , farmers ' clubs , etc . Then there was Maurice Minton , who received $5,000 from Mr. Belmont for his share in the influencing of public opinion ; this is the same gentleman who last summer got up those mysterious Gaynor clubs that were so bent on elevating the Mayor to the Governorship , but which the Mayor disavowed . A writer for the press earned $7,000 and more in a remarkably short time . Now , if he believes these were all legitimate expenses , Mr. Belmont is easy prey for men who wish to get rich quick . If he really thinks that $188,000 could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a more confiding nature than most people give him credit for . Acting under the advice of the Attorney-General , Secretary Meyer will not permit work to be begun on the battleship New York without getting express authority from Congress to incur the additional expense , above the $6,000,000 authorized in the present appropriation , which he finds will be necessary . This additional expense , of about $1,300,000 , the Secretary ascribes to the operation of the eight-hour law . The case is interesting , therefore , not only as involving sound business methods in respect of observing the limitations set by the Congressional appropriation , but also as sharply calling the attention of the country to the question of what the eight-hour law costs . Whether one approves that law or not , it is right that the public should know what it means from the standpoint of the publie.treasury . The attribution of the whole difference of nearly 25 per cent . to this law would seem , on its face , to be excessive ; but that something like this amount of added expense is caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures has become so familiar a phenomenon  --  the world over  --  that people are apt to regard it as a matter of course . It is , therefore , quite worth while to note that a glance at any table giving the expense of the British navy and extending back half a century discovers that this habit of continual increase is of quite recent origin . A table stating the cost of the British navy- at ten-year intervals , beginning with 1857-8 , shows it to have remained almost stationary for thirty years , whereas it has more than trebled in the past twenty-three years . The expenditure for the navy in 1857-8 was ? 10,590,000 ; in 1867-8 , 1877-8 , and 1887-8 it was ? 11,169,000 , ? 10,785,000 , and ? 12,225,000 , respectively ; but ten years later it had reached the figure of ? 20,850,000 , and in another decade it had come up to ? 31,141,000 . This was in 1907-8 ; the following year yielded only a slight increase , but the figure for 1909-10 was ? 35,807,000 , and in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1911 , is ? 40,601 , - 000 ! In round numbers , then , the people of the United Kingdom are called upon to spend $200,000,000 for their navy , compared with $60,000,000 only twenty-three years ago ; whereas for thirty years preceding that time the naval expenditures showed hardly any increase at all . The annual report of the Adjutant-General of the army records an encouraging decrease in desertions during 1909-1910 , the percentage being 3.66 , as against 4.97 per cent . in 1908-1909 , and the high-water mark of 7.43 per cent , in 1905-06 . The heaviest desertions were from the field artillery , coast artillery , and the minor detachments , such as the recruiting forces and recruits en route to stations . Gen. Ainsworth believes that the decrease in desertions is " undoubtedly due to the continuance of systematic and vigorous efforts . . . to apprehend and punish deserters . " But just when the army has felicitated itself upon this and the fact that thirty-five companies reported no desertions whatever , Gen. Ainsworth records the chilling news that 2,999 soldiers purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last preceding annual period , and only 1,123 in the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1908 . As the average enlisted strength of the army was about 69,500 , or say 70,000 , it is apparent that one soldier in every twenty-four was so dissatisfied with the conditions of service as to be willing to make heavy financial sacrifices to escape from it . Adding the deserters , 3,464 , it thus appears that no less than 6,463 soldiers left the service in twelve months , with or without permission , prior to the expiration of their enlistment , or at the rate of 538 , or about two-thirds of a regiment , a month . When those also are reckoned who died , were discharged for other causes than purchase , and left because of expiration of enlistment each year , we have a total loss of 23,688 , or one-third of the entire army . No less than 11,911 soldiers declined to reenlist . Plainly , therefore , there is much yet to be done before the service can be declared to be as attractive to Ainerican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortlandt Nicoll deserves the thanks of the community for having seriously grappled with the cab problem in this city , and worked out a plan for radically improving existing conditions . Cheap and easily accessible cab service is one of the great requirements of comfort in a metropolis like New York , and yet we have been decades behind the cities of Europe in providing it . The present situation , to be sure , is incomparably better than what used to prevail years ago , but it is still far from what it ought to be . In former days , twenty or thirty years ago , the want of well-paved streets was an undeniable obstacle to the introduction of cab service on the large scale that prevails in European cities , and at prices somewhat like those there established ; though , of course , this was far from sufficient excuse for the absurd system , or want of system , which placed the people of New York at th ? mercy of irresponsible cabmen for one of the primary conveniences of.city life . Now , however . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic regulations make it perfectly practicable for New York to be supplied with this convenience as satisfactorily as London or Berlin , and we trust Mr. Nicoll will keep at his undertaking with the determination that its importance warrants . It is a long time since so interesting a phase of the question of woman 's place in the world of intellect has come up as that presented by the proposition to elect Mme. Curie a member of the Acad- ? nale des Sciences . Nothing really analogous to this case has yet arisen in the course of the advancement of women that has been So remarkable a part of the history of the past generation ; there is something more dramatic about the situation presented when the most distinguished group of scientific men in the world debates the admission of a woman into its charmed circle than in the gradual extension of the field involved in the opening of the doors of university after university , in country after country , to women students . As for the merits of the case , and its probable outcome , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of time when Mme. Curie 's admission will be effected ; assuming , as no doubt it may be assumed , that the opposition turns only on the question of sex . Incidentally , it may be remarked that to the logical mind there will be little to choose between her admission and her non-admission , as an argument against the views of those who maintain that experience has shown women 's incapacity for the highest forms of scientific production . If she is admitted , there will be one woman , out of the handful that devote their lives to scientific research , distinguished by one of the highest of scientific honors ; it she is kept out , it will be one more proof of the difference between the encouragement held out to women and that held out to men for sustained devotion to strenuous intellectual labors . We learn from a contemporary , with deep regret , of a sad development among magazine editors . It seems that that first step which costs has been taken in the direction of a magazine Trust . A community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their defence , and we must admit that it is not yet quite clear whether there is to be at first a geographical division of the country into separate spheres of influence , or whether it is the world of subjects that is to be parcelled out by these lords of magazine creation . But we warn all these earnest souls that cooperation leads readily to more sinister things , as their moving stories of industrial Trusts ought long since to have shown them . Meetings to prevent duplication of muck-raking effort and wasteful competition are all too likely to tend to questions of rate-making , to " gentlemen 's agreements , " and so to combinations in restraint of the author 's trade , and the exclusion of others from the muck-raking field ; that is , a limitation of output . With the situation thus in hand , we fear that these editors will then yield to the temptation to charge all that the traffic will bear , with scant attention to the crying needs of the public and a consequent rise in the cost of living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they all began at lunches presided over by a Lincoln Steffens of industry -- -yet see where they have ended . What if three magazines are now simultaneously muck-raking Mr. Morgan ? Competition remains the life of magazine trade as of all others , and any one who would stifle it ought himself to be muck-raked . As a result of the resolve of the Indiana State Bill Posters ' Association to encourage cleaner advertising , the Muncie branch of the organization has decided to refuse to handle lithographs not deemed proper by its censor . The advertising of burlesque theatrical performances is Said to be the special object of attack , but whiskey advertisements also are to be discouraged . More significant is the promise to give up altogether the use of boards that are situated in such places as to make them objectionable . To fight against viciousness is comparatively easy , and , in this respect , the action of these bill posters seems belated , They must foresee a public sentiment that would render their voluntary action no longer possible . But that they should actually give heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of aggressive ugliness , can not fail to strike many of their profession , we fear , as absurdly overscrupulous . Is not the " objectionable " place inherently the best place for commercial display ? But this apparently voluntary move by the Muncie bill posters almost makes us hope . If Dr. Cook has not discovered the Pole , he has at least found a novel , and no doubt in many ways pleasant , method of making money . It is true that few persons would be willing to go even as near to the North Pole as Anoratok , and lie perdu in the ice-fields for eighteen months , more or less , for the sake of the money that might be made by the exploitation of a false claim to the discovery of the Pole ; but when it comes to a disappearance in Europe , with the enjoyment of all the comforts of civilization , that is another matter . We can think of few more agreeable methods of earning a living . The next thing in order , we presume , is a disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a series of articles showing that he was insane when he wrote his confession , but perfectly sane when he came back from the Pole . As the English pollings proceed , the hopes of the Conservatives dwindle . The chances of the Liberals have certainly been improved by the fact that the Labor party is not running so many candidates at this election , so that the number of three-cornered contests. which cost the Liberals several seats at the previous election , will not be so large as before . In general , the Liberal-Labor alliance seems to be in good working order . Taking everything into consideration , it appears probable that Mr. Asquith will come back with a coalition force practically undiminished . This could not be called a great Liberal victory , but it could be called a Conservative defeat . In so far as the latter follows shifty tactics on the part of Mr. Balfour and his party , and above all marks the failure of the ridiculous cry about " American dollars , " it must be accepted with a good - deal of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stampeded by insincere clamors . No really taking phrase has been produced by Mr. Balfour in his electioneering , but he essayed a great stroke by coming out for it referendum before a protective tariff should be enacted . At first this was hailed as the cleverest strategy conceivable , but later a reaction set in so that Mr. Balfour himself began to hedge , when he found that what was to inspirit his party was really dividing and discouraging it . No less than Bonar Law , who had left a safe seat at Dulwich to contest one in Manchester for the Conservatives , and who is pronounced for protective duties , at once declared that he would not eat his words , no matter what Mr. Balfour said ; and there was , besides , the awkward obstacle of the letter by Joseph Chamberlain asserting the tariff to be one of the " two issues " presented to the electors , and affirming that " now is our opportunity to reconsider our fiscal system " ? that is , to abandon free trade The beginnings of party government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of the National Assembly , even in its present limited form . Palace parties there have been and still are , but party government in any broad sense is of necessity a new development . ' she Assembly itself was not chosen on a popular basis , and the representatives of the people who are in it consist of those members who were appointed by the various provincial assemblies , which , in Iturn , are not , to any great extent , popularly elected . Nevertheless , these members have taken seriously their task of representing the people , and a line of division has appeared between the nominees of the various government boards and councils in Peking , and the members from the provinces . So marked was this divergence that Prince Pu Lun , the president of the Assembly , asked and obtained five days ' leave of absence from the troubled scene . Interestingly enough , the line of demarcation between Government and Opposition in this newest of Parliaments is the same as that which , under such names as those of Court Party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament of them all . Further testimony , if any were needed , to the perversity of the Oriental mind is furnished by Bishop Brent 's parting admission that the Filipinos not only do not like us , but are quite frank to say so . True , this unaccountable antipathy appears to be confined to the upper classes  --  the lower thus far have displayed a strange indifference to the mere nationality of their masters  --  but whatever its extent , its violence , which has steadily increased since the first days of the American occupation , shows no signs of abating . How sharper than a serpent 's tooth ! Yet we do not recall that Dr Fell , in the epigram , felt obliged to give up his preceptorial duties simply because for some undefinable reason he was not liked . Bishop Brent , indeed , had the satisfaction of finding most with whom he talked during his six months ' visit among us quite ready to agree with him that the withdrawal of the United States from the islands would work great harm to the Filipinos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real benefits as the United States has conferred upon them  --  and we count Bishop Brent himself as one  --  should go stubbornly unappreciated , along with benefits not so real , because of - this childish self-assertiveness on the part of our wards . Their sophomoric vaporings about the " despot 's heel , " " independence , " and other outworn phrases , however , should not cause us to grow weary in well doing . It is true that in the entrancing game of " white man 's burden " it rather spoils the fun when the smallest boy gets tired and refuses any longer to play " burden . "
