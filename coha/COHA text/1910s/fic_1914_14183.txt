SCENE : The kitchen of a farmhouse on the borderline between the Northern and Southern states . It is ten o'clock in the evening , September , 1863 . The back wall is broken at stage left by the projection at right angles of a partially enclosed staircase ; the four steps leading to the landing cut into the room . Underneath the enclosed part of the stairway , a cubby-hole ; in front of it a small table which partially hides the door . To the left of the table a kitchen chair . A door , leading to the yard , is the centre of the unbroken wall , back . To the right of the door , a cupboard ; to the left , a small cooking-stove . Two windows in the right wall . Between them a bench on which a pail and a tin dipper stand . Above the bench a towel hanging on a nail , and above the towel a double-barrelled shot-gun suspended on two pegs . Well downstage left , a closed door leading to a second room . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs to the right and left of it . A lighted candle on this table . The moon shines into the room through the windows , but at no time is the kitchen brightly lighted . The characters appear as ' silhouetes except when they stand near the candle or the lantern , and then the lights throw huge shadows on the roughly plastered walls . When the door , back , is opened one sees a bit of the farmyard , desolate even in the moonlight . ( As the curtain rises , Thaddeus Trask , a man of sixty odd years , short and thick-set , slow in speech and action , yet in perfect health , sits at the left of the centre table . He is pressing tobacco into his corncob pipe . He lights it with the candle . After a moment , Mary Trask , a tired , emaciated woman , whose years equal her husband 's , enters from the yard carrying a heavy pail of water and a lighted lantern . She puts the pail on the bench and hangs the lantern above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't got wood ' nough fer breakfast , Thad. p. 3 THADDEUS I 'm too tired t ' go out now . Wait ' til mornin ' . Pause . Mary lays the fire in the stove . THADDEUS Did I tell yuh that old man Reed saw three Southern troopers pass his house this mornin ' ? MARY takes coffee-pot from stove , crosses to bench , fills pot with waterI wish them soldiers would git out o ' the neighborhood . Whenever I see ' em passin ' , I have t ' steady myself ' gainst somethin ' or I 'd fall . I could n't hardly breathe yesterday when them Southerners came after fodder . I 'd died if they 'd spoke t ' me . THADDEUS Yuh need n't be afraid o ' Northern soldiers . MARY carries coffee-pot to stoveI hate ' em all ,  --  Union or Southern . I ca n't make head or tail t ' what all this fightin 's ' bout . An ' I do n't care who wins , so long as they git through , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . THADDEUS Yuh ca n't hardly blame ' em if they 're hungry , ken yuh ? MARY It ai n't right that they should steal from us poor folk . Lifts a huge gunny sack of potatoes from the table , and begins setting the table for breakfast , getting knives , forks , spoons , plates , cups and saucers ,  --  two of each , from the cupboard . We have hard ' nough times t ' make things meet now . I ai n't set down once today ' cept fer meals . An ' when I think o ' the work I got t ' do t'morrow , I ought t ' been in bed hours ago . p. 4 THADDEUS I 'd help if I could , but it ai n't my fault if the Lord seed fit t ' lay me up so I 'm always ailin ' . Rises lazily . Yuh better try an ' take things easy t'morrow . MARY It 's well enough t ' say , but them apples is got t ' be picked an ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep at night it 'd be all right , but with them soldiers ' bout , I ca n't . THADDEUS crosses right ; fondly handles his gunJolly , wish I 'd see a flock o ' birds . MARY nervouslyI 'd rather go without than hear yuh fire . I wish yuh did n't keep it loaded . THADDEUS Yuh know I ai n't got time t ' stop an ' load when I see the birds . They do n't wait fer yuh . Hangs gun on wall , drops into his chair ; dejectedly . Them pigs has got t ' be butchered . MARY Wait ' til I git a chance t ' go t ' sister 's . I ca n't stand it t ' hear ' em squeal . THADDEUS pulling off his boots : grunting meanwhileBest go soon then , ' cause they 's fat as they 'll ever be , an ' there ai n't no use in wastin ' feed on ' em . Pause ; risesAi n't yuh most ready fer bed ? p. 5 MARY Go on up . Thaddeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , and climbs the stairs . Mary speaks when he reaches the landing . MARY An ' Thad , try not t ' snore t'night . THADDEUS Poke me if I do . Disappears . Mary fills the kettle with water and puts it on the stove ; closes the door , back ; takes the lantern from the wall and tries twice before she succeeds in blowing it out . Puts the lantern on the table before the cubby-hole . Slowly drags herself up the stairs , pausing a moment on the top step for brcath before she disappears . There is a silence . Then the door , back , is opened a trifle and a man 's hand is seen . Cautiously the door is opened wide and a young Northern Private stands silhouetted on the threshold . He wears a dirty uniform , and a bloody bandage is tied about his head . He is wounded , sick , and exhausted . He stands at the door a moment , listening intently ; then hastily moves to the centre table looking for food . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on the table , he hurries to the cupboard . Suddenly the galloping of horses is heard in the distance . The Northerner starts . Then rushes to the window nearer the audience . For a moment the sound ceases , then it begins again , growing gradually louder and louder . The Northerner hurries into the room at the left . Horses and voices are heard in the yard , and almost immediately heavy , thundering knocks sound on the door , back . The men at the door grow impatient and push the door open . A large , powerfully built Southern Sergeant , and a smaller , younger Trooper of the same army enter . Thaddeus appears on the stairs , carrying a candle. p. 6 SERGEANT to Thaddeus ; not unkindlySorry , my friend , but you were so darn slow ' bout openin' ' the door that we had to walk in . Has there been a Northern soldier round here today ? THADDEUS timidly I ai n't seed one . Comes down the stairs . SERGEANT Have you been here all day ? THADDEUS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your family down . THADDEUS My wife 's all there is . Goes to foot of stairs , and calls loudly and excitedlyMary ! Mary ! Come down . Right off ! SERGEANT You better not lie to me or it 'll go tough with you . THADDEUS I swear I ai n't seed no one . Mary comes downstairs slowly . She is all atremble . THADDEUS Say , Mary , you was here  --  SERGEANT Keep still , man . I 'll do the talkin ' . To MaryYou were here at the house all day ? Mary is very frightened and embarrassed , but after a moment manages to nod her head slowly. p. 7 SERGEANT You did n't take a trip down to the store ? Mary shakes her head slowly . SERGEANT Have n't you got a tongue ? MARY with difficultyY-e-s . SERGEANT Then use it . The Northern soldier who came here a while ago was pretty badly wounded , was n't he ? MARY I  --  I  --  no one 's been here . SERGEANT Come , come , woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . SERGEANT He had a bad cut in his forehead , and you felt sorry for him , and gave him a bite to eat . MARY haltinglyNo one 's been near the house t'day . SERGEANT trying a different toneWe 're not going to hurt him , woman . He 's a friend of ours . We want to find him , and put him in a hospital , do n't we , Dick ? Turning to his companion . DICK He 's sick and needs to go to bed for a while . MARY He ai n't here . SERGEANT What do you want to lie for ? p. 8 MARY quickly I ai n't lyin ' . I ai n't seed no soldier . She stands rooted to the spot where she stopped when she came downstairs . Her eyes are still fixed on the Sergeant . SERGEANT I reckon you know what 'll happen to you if you are hidin ' the spy . THADDEUS There ai n't no one here . We both been here all day , an ' there could n't no one come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round here anyway ? SERGEANT We 'll search the place , Dick . MARY quicklyYuh ai n't got no  --  SERGEANT sharplyWhat 's that , woman ? MARY There ai n't no one here , an ' yer keepin ' us from our sleep . SERGEANT Your sleep ? This is an affair of life and death . Get us a lantern . Thaddeus moves to the small table and lights the lantern with the candle which he holds in his hand . He gives the lantern to the Sergeant . SERGEANT noticing the door to the cubby-holeHa ! Tryin ' to hide the door , are you , by puttin ' a table in front of it ? You ca n't fool me . To ThaddeusPull the table away and let 's see what 's behind the door . p. 9 THADDEUS It 's a cubby-hole an ' ai n't been opened in years . SERGEANT sternly and emphaticallyI said to open the door . Thaddeus sets the candle on the larger table , moves the smaller table to the right , and opens the door to the cubby-hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his belt and peers into the cubby-hole . SERGEANT returning his revolver to his beltWe 're goin ' to tear this place to pieces ' til we find him . You might just as well hand him over now . MARY There ai n't no one here . SERGEANT All right . Now we 'll see . Dick , you stand guard at the door . Dick goes to the door , back , and stands gazing out into the night ,  --  his back to the audience . SERGEANT to ThaddeusCome along , man . I 'll have to look at the upstairs . To Mary . You sit down in that chair . Points to chair at right of centre table , and feels for a sufficiently strong threat . Do n't you stir or I 'll  --  I 'll set fire to your house . To Thaddeus . Go on ahead . Thaddeus and the Sergeant go upstairs . Mary sinks lifelessly into the chair . She is the picture of fear . She sits facing left . Suddenly she leans forward . She opens her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth as though she would scream , but makes no sound . The Northerner has opened the door . He enters slowly and cautiously , his gun pointed at Mary . ( Dick can not see him because of the jog in the wall . ) Mary only stares in bewilderment at the Northerner , as he , with eyes fixed appealingly on her , opens the door to the cubby-hole and crawls inside. p. 10 DICK Woman ! MARY almost with a cry , thinking that Dick has seen the NorthernerYes . DICK Have you got an apple handy ? I 'm starved . Mary rises and moves to the cupboard . The Sergeant and Thaddeus come downstairs . The Sergeant , seeing that Mary is not where he left her , looks about rapidly and discovers her at the cupboard . SERGEANT Here , what did I tell you I 'd do if you moved from that chair ? MARY terrifiedOh , I did n't  --  I only  --  he wanted  --  DICK It 's all right , Sergeant . I asked her to get me an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick takes the lantern from the Sergeant and goes out , back . SERGEANT to ThaddeusCome in here with me . The Sergeant picks up the candle . He and Thaddeus move toward the door , left . As though in a stupor , Mary starts to follow . SERGEANT Sit down ! Mary drops into the chair at the right of the table . The Sergeant and Thaddeus go into the room , left . They can be heard moving furniture about . Mary sees a pin on the floor . She stoops , picks it up , and fastens it in her belt . The Sergeant and Thaddeus return. p. 11 SERGEANT If I find him now after all the trouble you 've given me , you know what 'll happen . There 's likely to be two dead men and a woman , instead of only the Yankee . DICK bounding into the roomSergeant ! SERGEANT What is it ? Dick hurries to the Sergeant and says something to him in a low voice . SERGEANT satisfaction showing on his faceNow , my good people , how did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a horse in the barn with a saddle on his back . I swear he 's been ridden lately . THADDEUS amazedThere is ? SERGEANT You know it . To MaryCome , woman , who drove that horse here ? MARY silent for a moment , her eyes on the floorI do n't know . I did n't hear nothin ' . THADDEUS moving toward the doorLet me go an ' see . SERGEANT pushing Thaddeus backNo , you do n't . You two have done enough to justify the harshest measures . Show us the man 's hiding place . p. 12 THADDEUS If there 's anybody here , he 's come in the night without our knowin ' it . I tell yuh I did n't see anybody , an ' she did n't , an  --  SERGEANT has been watching MaryWhere is he ? His tone makes Thaddeus jump . There is a pause , during which Mary seems trying to compose herself . Then slowly she lifts her eyes and looks at the Sergeant . MARY There ai n't nobody in the house ' cept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbuildings ? DICK Yes . There 's not a trace of him except the horse . SERGEANT wiping the perspiration from his face ; speaks with apparent deliberation at first , but becomes very emphaticHe did n't have much of a start of us , and I think he was wounded . A farmer down the road said he heard hoof-beats . The man the other side of you heard nothin ' , and the horse is in your barn . Slowly draws his revolver and points it at Thaddeus . There are ways of making people confess . THADDEUS covering his face with his handsFor God 's sake , do n't . I know that horse looks bad , but , as I live , I ai n't heard a sound , or seen anybody . I 'd give the man up in a minute if he was here . p. 13 SERGEANT lowering his gunYes , I guess you would . You would n't want me to hand you and your wife over to our army to be shot down like dogs . Mary shivers . SERGEANT swings round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's hid . MARY breaking out in irritating , rasping voice I 'm sure I wish I did . I 'd tell yuh quick an ' git yuh out o'here . ' Tai n't no fun fer me t ' have yuh prowlin ' all over my house , trackin ' it up with yer dirty boots . Yuh ai n't got no right t ' torment me like this . Lord knows how I 'll git my day 's work done , if I ca n't have my sleep out . SERGEANT has been gazing at her in astonishment ; lowers his gunGood God ! Nothing but her own petty existence . In different voice to Mary . I 'll have to ask you to get us some breakfast . We 're famished . With relief but showing some anger , Mary turns to the stove . She lights the fire and puts more coffee in the pot . SERGEANT Come , Dick , we better give our poor horses some water . They 're all tired out . In lower voice . The man is n't here . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yard . To Thaddeus . Get us a pail to give the horses some water in . Sees the pails on the bench . Picks one of them up and moves toward the door. p. 14 MARY That ai n't the horses ' pail . SERGEANT to ThaddeusCome along . You can help . MARY louderThat 's the drinkin ' water pail . SERGEANT That 's all right . The Sergeant , Thaddeus , and Dick ,  --  carrying the lantern , go out back . Mary needs more wood for the fire , so she follows in a moment . When she has disappeared , the Northerner drags himself from the cubby-hole . Mary returns with an armful of wood . MARY sees the Northerner . Shows no sympathy for him in this speech nor during the entire sceneYuh git back ! Them soldiers 'll see yuh . NORTHERNER Some water . Quick . Falls into chair at left of table . It was so hot in there . MARY gives him water in the dipperDo n't yuh faint here ! If them soldiers git yuh , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git back in that cubby-hole . Turns quickly to the stove . The Northerner drinks the water . Puts the dipper on the table . Then , summoning all his strength , rises and crosses to Mary . He touches her on the sleeve . Mary is so startled that she jumps and utters a faint cry. p. 15 NORTHERNER Be still or they 'll hear you . How are you going to get me out of here ? MARY Yuh git out ! Why did yuh come here , a bringin ' me all this extra work , an ' maybe death ? NORTHERNER I could n't go any farther . My horse and I were ready to drop . Wo n't you help me ? MARY No , I wo n't . I do n't know who yuh are or nothin ' ' bout yuh , ' cept that them men want t ' ketch yuh . In a changed tone of curiosity . Did yuh steal somethin ' from ' em ? NORTHERNER Do n't you understand ? Those men belong to the Confederacy , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pulling a bit of crumpled paper from his breast . They want this paper . If they get it before tomorrow morning it will mean the greatest disaster that 's ever come to the Union army . MARY with frank curiosityWas it yuh rode by yesterday ? NORTHERNER Do n't you see what you can do ? Get me out of here and away from those men , and you 'll have done more than any soldier could do for the country ,  --  for your country . MARY I ai n't got no country . Me an ' Thad 's only got this farm . Thad 's ailin ' , an ' I do most the work , an '  --  p. 16 NORTHERNER The lives of thirty thousand men hang by a thread . I must save them . And you must help me ! MARY I do n't know nothin ' ' bout yuh , an ' I do n't know what yer talkin ' ' bout . NORTHERNER Only help me get away . MARY angrilyNo one ever helped me or Thad . I lift no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place is beyond me ,  --  sneakin ' in our house , spoilin ' our well-earned sleep . If them soldiers ketch yuh , they 'll kill me an ' Thad . Maybe you did n't know that . NORTHERNER What 's your life and your husband 's compared to thirty thousand ? I have n't any money or I 'd give it to you . MARY I do n't want yer money . NORTHERNER What do you want ? MARY I want yuh t ' git out . I do n't care what happens t ' yuh . Only git out o ' here . NORTHERNER I ca n't with the Southerners in the yard . They 'd shoot me like a dog . Besides , I 've got to have my horse . MARY with naive curiosityWhat kind o ' lookin ' horse is it ? NORTHERNER dropping into the chair at left of centre table in disgust and despairOh , God ! If I 'd only turned in at the other farm . I might have found people with red blood . Pulls out his gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh goi n't ' do with that gun ? NORTHERNER Do n't be afraid . It 's not load  --  MARY I 'd call ' em if I was n't  --  NORTHERNER leaping to the wall , left , and bracing himself against itGo call them in . Save your poor skin and your husband 's if you can . Call them in . You ca n't save yourself . Laughs hysterically . You ca n't save your miserable skin . ' Cause if they get me , and do n't shoot you , I will . MARY leaning against the left side of the table for support ; in agonyOh ! NORTHERNER You see ? You 've got to help me whether you want to or not . MARY feeling absolutely caughtI ai n't done nothin ' . I do n't see why yuh an ' them others come here a threatenin ' t ' shoot me . I do n't want nothin ' . I do n't want t ' do nothin ' . I jest want yuh all t ' git out o ' here an ' leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I do n't know what t ' do . Yuh got me in a corner where I ca n't move . Passes her hand back along the table . Touches the dipper accidentally , and it falls to the floor . Screams at the sound. p. 18 NORTHERNER leaping toward herNow you 've done it . They 'll be here in a minute . You ca n't give me up . They 'll shoot you if you do . They 'll shoot . Hurries up the stairs and disappears . Mary stands beside the table , trembling terribly . The Sergeant , Dick , and Thaddeus come running in . SERGEANT What did you yell for ? Mary does not answer . SERGEANT seizing her by the armAnswer ! MARY I knocked the dipper off the table . It scared me . SERGEANT dropping wearily into chair at left of centre tableWell , do n't drop our breakfast . Put it on the table . We 're ready . MARY stands looking at the SergeantIt ai n't finished . SERGEANT worn out by his day 's work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to cook a dozen meals . What did you do all the time we were in the yard ? MARY I did n't do nothin ' . SERGEANT You good-for-nothin '  --  . Get a move on and give us something fit to eat . Do n't try to get rid of any left-overs on us . If you do , you 'll suffer for it . Mary stands looking at him. p. 19 SERGEANT Do n't you know anything , you brainless farm-drudge ? Hurry , I said . Mary picks up the dipper and turns to the stove . Thaddeus sits in the chair at left of smaller table . DICK What a night . My stomach 's as hollow as these people 's heads . Takes towel which hangs above the bench , and wipes the barrel of his gun with it . MARY That 's one of my best towels . DICK Ca n't help it . SERGEANT ' Tend to the breakfast . That 's enough for you to do at one time . Dick puts his gun on the smaller table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to DickI do n't see how he gave us the slip . DICK He knew we were after him , drove his horse in here , and went on afoot . Clever scheme , I must admit . THADDEUS endeavoring to get them into conversationHave yuh rid far t'night , Misters ? DICK shortlyFar enough . THADDEUS Twenty miles or so ? DICK Perhaps . p. 20 THADDEUS How long yuh been chasin ' the critter ? SERGEANT Oh , shut up ! Do n't you see we do n't want to talk to you ? Take hold and hurry , woman . My patience 's at an end . Mary puts a loaf of bread , some fried eggs , and a coffee-pot on the table . MARY There ! I hope yer satisfied . Dick and the Sergeant pull their chairs up and begin to eat . SERGEANT Is this all we get ? Come , it wo n't do you any good to be stingy . MARY It 's all I got . SERGEANT It is n't a mouthful for a chickadee ! Give us some butter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm ? God , the way you lie . MARY I  --  SERGEANT Shut up ! DICK Have you got any cider ? SERGEANT Do n't ask . She and the man probably drank themselves stupid on it . Throws fork on floor . I never struck such a place in my life . Get me another fork . How do you expect me to eat with that bent thing ? Mary stoops with difficulty and picks up the fork . Gets another from the cupboard and gives it to the Sergeant. p. 21 SERGEANT Now give me some salt . Do n't you know that folks eat it on eggs ? Mary crosses to the cupboard ; mistakes the pepper for the salt and puts it on the table . SERGEANT sprinkles pepper on his foodI said salt , woman ! Spelling . S-a-l-t . Salt ! Salt ! Mary gets the salt and gives it to the Sergeant . Almost ready to drop , she drags herself to the window nearer the back and leans against it , watching the Southerners like a hunted animal . Thaddeus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on devouring the food . The former pours the coffee . Puts his cup to his lips , takes one swallow ; then , jumping to his feet and upsetting his chair as he does so , he hurls his cup to the floor . SERGEANT bellowing and pointing to the fluid trickling on the floorHave you tried to poison us , you God damn hag ? Mary screams and the faces of the men turn white . It is the cry of an animal goaded beyond endurance . MARY screechingBreak my cup ? Call my coffee poison ? Call me a hag , will yuh ? I 'll learn yuh ! I 'm a woman , but yer drivin ' me crazy . She has snatched the gun from the wall and pointed it at the Sergeant . Fires . The Sergeant falls to the floor . Mary keeps on screeching . Dick rushes for his gun. p. 22 THADDEUS Mary ! Mary ! MARY aiming at Dick and firingI ai n't a hag . I 'm a woman , but yer killin ' me . Dick falls just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands over his ears . The Northerner stands on the stairs . Mary continues to pull the trigger of the empty gun . The Northerner is motionless for a moment ; then he goes to Thaddeus and shakes him . NORTHERNER Go get my horse . Quick ! Thaddeus hurries out . The Northerner turns to Mary . She gazes at him but does not understand a word he says . NORTHERNER with great fervorI 'm ashamed of what I said . The whole country will hear of this , and you . He takes her hand and presses it to his lips ; then turns and hurries out of the house . Mary still holds the gun in her hand . She pushes a strand of grey hair back from her face , and begins to pick up the fragments of the broken cup . MARY in dead , flat tone I 'll have t ' drink out the tin cup now . The hoof-beats of the Northerner 's horse are heard.                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
