txt The final hearing on the Owen-Glass Currency bill before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency began this afternoon with a large array of critics of the measure in attendance . This criticism directed attention ostensibly to various paragraphs in the bill that the bankers wanted changed , and these paragraphs were numerous . But from a political point of view the hearing was chiefly interesting in the public evidence it gave of the - wide divisions in the committee itself . No three members of the committee seemed agreed as to a monetary policy , though precisely that number of Democrats showed hostility to the bill , and all the Republicans appeared united in their opposition . The committee had invited the attendance of the Legislative Committee of the American Bankers ' Association and all other persons who had expressed a. wish to be heard . The bankers ' committee received precedence . and James B. Forgan of Chicago and Sol Wexler of New Orleans were the first speakers . The bankers had divided the topics among themselves , so that the discussion of each would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him was not completed when the committee rose late in the afternoon . He will resume the stand when the committee sits to-morrow morning . What the Bankers Proposed . While the whole bill was not traversed at to-day 's session , it appeared that the objections of the bankers have narrowed down to comparatively few points . Mr. Forgan and Mr. Wexler left no doubt that the bankers had come to the conclusion that Government control was inevitable , and that they were now prepared to embrace it . Both declared strongly - for Government control . and their plea for supervision by the bankers was limited to a demand for minority representation on the central Federal board . They were almost equally insistent that the twelve regional reserves give place to a single central reserve , with branches in all important cities . Compulsory membership in the system for national banks must be abandoned , they said , as well as the authority vested in the central board to make one regional reserve bank rediscount the paper of another . They also suggested that the capital stock assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's capitalizazlion to per cent. , and that only 5 per crt.t be paid in . AU these proposals seemed to find favor with some member of the committee  --  usually on the Democratic side , as the Republicans left most of the talking to- the Democrats , apparently content with the division of opinion that showed among the majority . Senator O'Gorman of New York . the ranking Democrat , expressed sympathy for Sir . Forgan 's suggestion favoring a single central organization . Senator Reed of Missouri indicated that all he wanted at present was an amendment of the Aldrich-Vreeland act , and Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska , another Democrat , showed general opposition . Dissatisfaction in Committee . The hearing of bankers was prefaced by an outbreak of the dissatisfaction which prevails among the members of the committee themselves on the question of taking up currency lelisla.tion at the present session of Congress . Senator Bristow protested against hearings while the Tariff bill is pending . I can not be here and in the Senate at the same time . " he said , " and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are under consideration . " In a milder tone Senator Hitchcock supported the Senator from Kansas . suggesting that Senator Owen should have consulted the members of the committee before making arrangements for the hearings . " The hearings should have been postponed until the tariff was out of the way , " said he . " and the meeting should not have been called without the consent of the members of the committee . " Senator Reed agreed with Mr. Hitchcock that the Chairman should not have taken the full responsibility 9f calling the meeting , but insisted that the question was a practical one and that as time would be saved by having the hearings now the witnesses should be heard . The members of the committee anpointed by the bankers ' conference in Chicago . who appeared before the ' lenate committee to-day were Jamie B. Forgan , . President of the First National Rank of Chicago ; George M. Reynolds , President of the Continental and Commercial National Dank of Chicago : Festus J. Wade . President of the Mercantile Trust Company of St. Louis : Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans ; B. J. Hill . Vice President of the Norwalk National Bank of Norwalk , Conn. ; Joseph Chapman , Vice President of the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis : Robert F. Maddox . Vice President of the American National Bank of Atlanta , and Fred E. Farnsworth . General Secretary of the American Bankers Association , Secretary to the committee . Forgo= on Federal Reserves . The bankers were presented by Mr. Fore.an , each giving the views of the conference on some one phase of the proposed legislation . Mr. Forgan himself formulated the bankers ' objections to the Federal reserve scheme . The bankers , he said , although they appeared primarily as bankers , were in tench with three ? great classes of the people of the country  --  the stockholders of the banks , the savings bank depositcrs , and the business men . merchants . arid farmers , representing the borrowing class . " These three classes represent a large part of the population of the country , " he said . " and we are mutually interested in the success of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank was the best plan , and that the number of reserve banks should net exceed five at most . " It is best , in handling gold reserves , to collect them in one reservoir for the benefit of all the banks , " lie said . " No regional bank will be able to strengthen its reserves of gold or cash without depleting the reserves of other regional oanks . " The capital provided by the bill would not be adequate at the outset . Mr. Forgan continued , because the State banks would be slow to subscribe until time had proven the value of the proposed system . He suggested that for the 1 welre reserve banks capital would be needed in the following amounts : New York . ** Chicago . $ : ! 0.0110,0Hi ; St. Louis . el : 1.000,00e : San Francisco , rin.nort.no0 ; New Orleans . R10.000.000 : Philadelphia . Sto.oixo ei ; Boston , otet.f , OO and five others at $-Vslien ( 10 each , making a total capital of $1270m.eu4 ) ? // BANKERS FIND CLASH OVER CURRENCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided if every bank subscribed in the proportion provided by the bill . Senator Pomerene of Ohio questioned Mr. Forgan closely to find out exactly what he thought would be the practical difference between one central reserve with many branches and twelve regional reserves under a single controlling board . Advantages of a Single Reserve . " The single reserve , " said Mr. Forgan , " would have a great a.dvanta.ae in the disposal of the common reserve fund . There would be a great facility in shifting reserves as needed from one section of the country to another , without a change in the ownership , as this ' bill requires , from one regional reserve bank to another . Under a single reserve such as we propose reserves could be shifted from section to section and rest always on the same gold basis . Otherwise the percentage of gold behind the paper money would vary in every regional reserve bank , and that would encourage competition between the various sections . " " But , " said Mr. Pomerene , " the plan of the bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rediscount the paper of another and to fix interest . Is n't that really just a single , central control ? " " There is this difference , " interrupted Senator O'Gorman of New York , the ranking Democratic member . - As the bill has it , there are twelve separate organizations , and , tl6ugh under the control ofepe board , the officers of the separate organizations would have spa . cial interests in their separate localities ; and while they would have to submit to a central board they would do ' so under protest , feeling , perhaps , aggrieved . On the other hand , a single reserve could make the necessary transfers of funds without consulting with particular localities . " " That is an excellent statement , " said Mr. Forgan , " and I wish I had the Senator 's accuracy of speech . " " Can you tell the committee , " asked Mr Pomerene , " a single advantage in the proposition for twelve regional reserves ? " I do n't Imow of any , " replied Mr. Forgan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minnesota , the ranking Republican of the committee , suggested that the twelve regional reserves would tend to encourage friction between the sections . Rob Peter to Pay Paul . " That is true , " said Mr. Forgan . " As an illustration , the central board might require a reserve bank in Minnesota to rediscount ' the paper of New Orleans . Minnesota . banks , then , in order to raise the money , might be compelled to force their customers to sell their wheat so as to enable the farmers in Louisiana to hold their cotton . " In response to a question from Senator O'Gorman , Mr. Forgan said emphatically that the bankers woul rather have a central organization , width the perfect centralized control that it implied , even with the Government dominating the system . To Senator Crawford of South Dakota , a Republican member of the committee , Mr. Forgan said he was sorry to say that he did not believe enough banks would subscribe to the capital stock of the proposed system , as the bill then stood , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the assumption that the compulsory membership of national banks was waived . Senator Crawford voiced an objection from the smaller banks by saying that in his State , where Capitalization ranged from $25,000 to $100,004 , there would be little commercial paper susceptible of rediscount . He asked Mr. Forgan if he did not think that banks of this type should be exempt from certain features of the bill . " I will say , " replied Mr. Forgan , " that the . banks to which you refer get the least benefit under the bill . They , get practically no benefit . " " Do you think it fair , " asked Mr. Crawford , " to 11 , ke the little banks subscribe a stock which the larger banks will use ? " " I think not , " said Mr. Forgan . A ? A Board of Bankers . Senator Weeks of Massachusets , one of the most experienced hankers on the committte and one of the most active of the Republican members , asked Mr. Forgan whether , in view of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves , it would not be a fair compromise to have the controlling board named by the President from a list of forty or fifty men proposed by the banks . The suggestion seemed to take Mr. Forgan by surprise , although he said it seemed to him a good solution of a difficult problem . Mr. Weeks said that he did not wish to embarrass him by insisting upon a direct reply , but that , as he really wished a definite answer , he would ask Mr. Forgan to think over the question for a day or two and let him know his decision . " What reason , " asked Senator Pomerene , who alone of the committeemen Joined Chairman Owen in an active defense of the bill , " is there for the banks suggesting names of Directors that would not apply to a similar proposal for the railroads to name members of the interstate Commerce Commission ? " " The railroads , " replied Mr. Forgan quickly , " do not surrender their initiative in their own business as we are called upon to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are expected to do . We think it a good principle that the owner should control his property . " " But the railroads own the railroad property , " said Senator Pomerene . Senator O'Gorman again showed his opposition to the bill . " You might say , " he suggested , " that the Government gets no part of the earnings of the railways , as it does un der the operation of the currency bill . " " But , " defended Senator Reed . " the Government does n't supply railroads with money for their business , as it will in the case of this banking system . " Inside Information . Senator Shafroth of Colorado , seemed to fear that a banker , if admitted to membership in the controlling board , would use his foreknowledge of a change in the rate of discount to the profit of his own bank , Mr. Forgan thought this knowledge would not help a banker . Sol Wexler , of New Orleans , who then ' tcok the stand , admitted that this knowledge would be very useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates had no idea that a banker would retain his banking connection while serving as a member of the controlling board . " That is no reason , " he went on , " why an experienced banker should not be on the board . Banking is a profession . It is not a business ? in which any man can engage by renting a place and setting up a counter . " Mr. Wexler stoutly denied the suggestion of committee members that the controlling directors of great European banks were not experienced bankers . " These officers , " he said , " were recruited from members of acceptance houses and from private banking establishments of a type unknown in the . United States . " In this proposed system , " went on Mr. Wexler , " you have to deal with 25,000 banks , 17,000 of which are State corporations beyond the reach of any compulsory membership provision . There must be general co-operation if the system is to succeed . To get this co-operation there must be distinct advantages In the system , or at least no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each bank from 20 Der cent . to 10 per cent . We believe this amendment would greatly Increase the number of banks willing to enter the system . We agree with the framers of the bill that the additional 10 per cent . would probably never be called for , but this additional liability the banks must recognize , and it simply frightens them . In the South and West the 20 per cent . assessment is considered a great hardship , and , while it is contended that this void in their assets can be filled by borrowing from the regional resrve bank , no bank is as willing to borrow for its banking operations as it is to lend its own assets . Capital Stock of $130,000,000 . " I do n't believe , unless most of the amendments we propose are adopted , that State banks will join the system or that national banks can be prevented from surrendering their national charters . If the bill is made satisfactory by the adoption of most of the amendments we propose , I believe 20 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State banks will join the associations . This proportion of . banks , at the 10 per cent . capitalization suggested by us , would mean a capital stock for the regional reserve banks of *130,000,000 . Our suggestion as to the smaller assessments will add to , rather than subtract from , the aggregate of regional reserves . And the more banks that participate the greater the cohesion and strength of the System for good . " Mr. Wexler strongly opposed the aqthority given to the Board of Directors in Washington to ' remove from the directorates of regional reserve batiks Directors chosen from among the local business men . Such authority , he said , tended to intimidate the Directors and obscure their judgment of credits . In any event , he said , the Central Board would have no means of passing upon the vote of such a Director and therefore would be unqualified to remove him . In the same way Mr. Wexler objected to the agent of the Federal Reserve Board acting as aliairmari of the Directors of a regional reserve bank . The agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bank 's business necessary in laying before the board matters on which the board must pass . Senator Hitchcock , a Democrat from Nebraska , whose opposition to the bill has been unconcealed , suggested that the public , as well as the banks , might be allowed to subscribe to the capital stock of the regional reserve banks . But Mr. Wexler thought that private individuals next would want the rediscount privilege and that the whole system would become too intricate . Such a provision , he said , would tend to put the entire banking business of the country in one hand . Predicts Insubordination . Mr. Wexler drew a striking picture of what would happen if the Federal re.serve board tried to compel one regional reserve bank against its will to rediscount the paper of another regional bank . The first bank , he said , would simply refuse to obey the order . It would declare that its money belonged to its stockholders and depositors . In that case , he said , the Federal board would hesitate to shut down the disobedient bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one particular Chairman Owen , who had been trying all along to induce the bankers to admit that ' a controlling board appointed by the President would be competent to perform its duties , wrung an important admission from Mr. Wexler . He referred to Mr. Wexler 's fear that the central board , acting through regional reserve banks , would do serious injudtice to various sections - of the country . ge then asked Mr. Wexler why he did not fear that such a board , controlling the ' centralized system advocated by tW bankers , would do equal harm , espgclally as there would then be no regional organizations to protest their action . " But we assume that the central ' board would know its , business well enouglianot to injure any section , " replied Mr. Wexler . " : Was It a part - ot ; Tour , ? origami criticism , " laughed Mr. Owen , " that the board would consist of such competent men ? " Later on , however , Mr. Wexler did draw a real , distinction between the functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital stock , and a board directing twelve separate organizations , each with a capitalization of its own . He said that in the centralized system there would be no dispute as to the ownership of the money shifted about to meet the needs of commerce , and that the board 's power would simply be the negative one of refusing to make a loan when conditions seemed to warrant such action . In the regional reserve system , however , he said , the central board would be authorized to compel one regional bank ' to part with its own property . New Aldrich-Vreeland Act . Mr. Wexler failed to respond favorably to Senator Reed 's suggestion that an extension of the Aldrich-Vreeland act so that the Treasury could make advances on proper security direct to the banks would be a satisfactory solution of the situation . The Government had no machinery for passing on security presented by the banks , he said , and should not attempt to engage in the banking business . " We are not afraid of Government control , " said Mr. Wexler ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government guarantees . In time of war , when the Government would need to borrow hundreds of millions , it would never do for it to have to stand behind the notes of the banks . If the Government and the banks are kept separate , in time of war the banks would support the Government . But If they are tied up together , in time of stress they would go to ruin together . " Mr. Wexler denied that the larger banks , in proposing their amendments to the Administration bill , had left the smaller banks out of consideration . They , too , he said , would profit by the bill , if amended . He pointed out that a bank carrying $100,000 of paper would have at least $5,000 of commercial paper ready for rediscounting : and that sort of security would be steadily repeated throughout the year . Besides , the added security from the new system would reflect benefit upon the smaller banks , he said .                  @ @ @
