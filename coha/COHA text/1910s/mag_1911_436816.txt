MY mother ought to have been happy in her engagement . Everybody congratulated her on securing such a scholar , her parents loaded her with presents , and her friends envied her . It is true that the bridegroom 's family consisted entirely of poor relations ; there was not one solid householder among them . From the worldly point of view , my mother made a mesalliance . But as one of my aunts put it , when my mother objected to the association with the undesirable cousins , she could take out the cow and set fire to the barn ; meaning that she could rejoice in her husband and disregard his family . My mother 's trousseau was all that a mother-in-law could wish . The best tailor in Polotzk was engaged to make the cloaks and gowns , and his shop was filled to bursting with ample lengths of velvet and satin and silk . The wedding gown alone cost every kopeck of fifty rubles , as the tailor 's wife reported all over Polotzk . The lingerie was of the best , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Featherbeds , linen , household goods of every sort ? everything was provided in abundance . My mother crocheted many yards of lace to trim the best sheets , and fine silk coverlets adorned the plump beds . Many a marriageable maiden who came to view the trousseau went home to prink and blush and watch for the marriage-broker . The wedding was memorable for gayety and splendor . The guests included some of the finest people in Polotzk ; for while my grandfather was not quite at the top of the social scale , he had business connections with those who were , and they all turned out for the wedding of his only daughter , the men in silk frockcoats , the women in all their jewelry . The bridegroom 's aunts and cousins came in full force . Wedding messengers had been sent to every person who could possibly claim relationship with the groom . My mother 's parents were too generous to slight the lowliest . Instead of burning the barn , they did all they could to garnish it ; one or two of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowns paid for by my rich grandfather . The rest came decked out in borrowed finery , or in undisguised shabbiness . Nobody thought of staying away . After the feasting and dancing , which lasted a whole week , the wedding presents were locked up ; the bride , with her hair discreetly covered , returned to her father 's store ; and the groom , with his new praying shawl , repaired to the synagogue . This was all according to the marriage bargain , which implied that my father was to study and pray and fill the house with the spirit of piety , in return for board and lodging and the devotion of his wife and her entire family . All the parties concerned had entered into this bargain in good faith , so far as they knew their own minds . But the eighteen-year-old bridegroom , before many months had passed , began to realize that he felt no such hunger for the word of the Law as he was supposed to feel . He felt , rather , a hunger for life that all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze his own thoughts to any purpose ; he was not experienced enough to understand where his thoughts were leading him . He only knew that he felt no call to pray and fast , that the Torah did not inspire him , and his days were blank . The life he was expected to lead grew distasteful to him , and yet he knew no other way to live . He became lax in his attendance at synagogue services , incurring the reproach of the family . It began to be rumored among the studious that Raphael the Russian 's son-in-law was not devoting himself to the sacred books with any degree of enthusiasm . It was well known that he had a good mind , but evidently the spirit was lacking . My grandparents went from surprise to indignation , from exhortation they passed to recrimination . Before my parents had been married half a year , my grandfather 's house was divided against itself , and my mother was torn between the two factions . For while she sympathized with her parents , and felt personally cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was her duty to take her husband 's part , even against her parents , in their own house . My mother was one of those women who always obey the highest law they know , even though it leads them to their doom . How did it happen that my father , who from his early boyhood had been pointed out as a scholar in embryo , failed to live up to the expectations of his world ? It happened as it happened that his hair curled over his high fore head . He was made that way . If people were disappointed , it was because they had based their expectations on a misconception of his character . For my father had never had any aspirations for extreme piety . Piety was imputed to him by his mother , by his rebbe , by his neighbors , when they saw that he rendered the sacred word more intelligently than his fellow-students . It was not his fault that his people confused scholarship with religious ardor . Having a good mind , he was glad to exercise it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to make rapid progress in that . If he had ever been offered a choice between a religious and a secular education , his friends would have found out early that he was not born to be a ray . But as he had no mental opening except through the rabbinical school , he went on from year to year winning new distinction in Hebrew scholarship ; with the result that witnesses with preconceived ideas began to see the halo of piety playing around his head , and a well-to-do family was misled into making a match with him for the sake of the heavenly glory that he was to attain . When it became evident that the son-in-law u as not going to develop into a ray , my grandfather notified him that he would have to assume the support of his own family without delay . My father thereupon entered on a series of experiments with paying occupations , for none of which he was qualified , and in none of which he succeeded permanently . My mother was with my father , as equal partner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wayside inn , but had to give it up because the life was too rough for my mother , who expected her first baby . Returning to Polotzk , they went to storekeeping , but failed in this also , because my father was inexperienced , and my mother , now with the baby to nurse , was not able to give her best attention to business . Over two years passed in this experiment , and in the interval the second child was born , increasing my parents ' need of a home and a reliable income . It was then decided that my father should seek elsewhere for a living . For several years he traveled and labored , with varying fortunes , in the east and south of Russia , until news reached him of the death of my grandfather , which left my mother heir to a good business . My father thereupon returned to Polotzk , and became a storekeeper once more . As my mother had been trained to her business from childhood , while my father had had only a little irregular experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful as her fat her before her . The people continued to call her Chane Chaye Raphael 's , and under that name she was greatly respected in the business world . Her eldest brother was now a merchant of importance , and my mother 's establishment was gradually enlarged ; so that , altogether , our family had a solid position in Polotzk , and there were plenty to envy us . We were hardly rich , even as Polotzk counted riches in those days . I suppose we were considered well-to-do . We moved into a larger house , where there was room for out-of-town customers to stay over night , and stabling for their horses . We lived as well as any people of our class , and perhaps better , because my father had brought home with him from his travels a taste for a more genial life than Polotzk usually asked for . My mother kept a cook and a nursemaid , and a dvornik or outdoor man , to take care of the horses , the cow , and the woodpile . All the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousins and aunts were alwaysabout , and on holidays friends of all degrees gathered in numbers . And coming and going in the wing set apart for business-guests were merchants , traders , country peddlers , peasants , soldiers , and minor government officials . It was a full house at all times , and especially so during fairs , and at the season of the military draft , when recruits by the hundred came in from the outlying districts , Polotzk being the county-seat . In the family wing there was also enough going on . There were four of us children , besides father and mother and the parasitic cousins . Fetchke was the eldest ; I was the second ; the third was my only brother , named Joseph , for my father 's father ; and the fourth was Edle Dvereh , named for my mother 's mother . I suppose I ought to explain my own name also , expecially because I am going to emerge as the heroine by and by . Be it therefore known that I was named Maryashe , for a bygone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Maryashe ' was too dignified . It was always Mashinke , or else Mashke , by way of diminutive . A variety of nicknames , mostly suggested by my physical peculiarities , were bestowed on me from time to time by my fond or foolish relatives . My Uncle Berl , for example , ' gave me the name of Zukrochene Flum , which I am not going to translate , because it is uncomplimentary . My sister Fetchke was always the good little girl , and when our troubles began she was an important member of the family . What sort of little girl I was will be written by and by . Joseph was the best Jewish boy that ever was born , but he hated to go to heder , so he had to be whipped , of course . Edle Dvereh was just a baby , and her principal characteristic was single-mindedness . If she had teething to attend to she thought of nothing else day or night , and communicated with the family on no other subject . If it was whooping cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had them thick . It was the normal thing in Polotzk , where the mothers worked as well as the fathers , for the children to be left in the hands of nursemaids and grandmothers . We were much of the time under our Grandma Rachel 's care . Grandma meant to be very strict with us , and accordingly she was prompt to discipline us ; but we discovered early in our acquaintance with her that the child who got a spanking was sure to get a hot cookie , or the jam-pot to lick , so we did not stand in great awe of her punishments . Even if it came to a spanking it was only a farce . Grandma generally interposed a pillow between the palm of her hand and the area of moral stimulation . The real disciplinarian in our family was my father . Was he present or absent , it was fear of his displeasure that kept us in the straight and narrow path . In the minds of us children he was as much represented , when away from home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait which stood on a parlor table , in a gorgeous frame adorned with little shells . Almost everybody 's father had a strap , but our father 's strap was more formidable than the ordinary . It was , for one thing , more painful to encounter personally , because it was not a simple strap , but a bunch of fine long strips , clinging as rubber . My father called it noodles , ' and while his facetiousness was lost on us children , the superior sting of his instrument was entirely effective . My father , in his leisure , found means of instructing us other than by the strap . He took us walking and driving , answered our questions , and taught us many little things that our playmates were not taught . From distant parts of the country he had imported little tricks of speech and conduct , which we learned readily enough , for we were always a teachable lot . Our pretty manners were very much admired , so that we became used to being held up as models to children less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , at the end of a meal , we kissed the hands of father and mother and thanked them for food . Envious mothers of rowdy children used to sneer : ' Those grandchildren of Raphael the Russian are quite the aristocrats . ' And yet , off the stage , we had our little tempests , especially I. I really and truly can not remember a timewhen Fetchke was naughty , but I was oftener in trouble than out of it . I need not go into details . I only need to recall how often , on going to bed , I used to lie silently rehearsing the day 's misdeeds , my sister refraining from talk out of sympathy . As I always came to the conclusion that I wanted to reform , I emerged from my reflections with this solemn formula , Fetchke ? let us be good . ' And my generosity in including my sister in my plans for salvation was equaled by her magnanimity in assuming part of my degradation . She always replied , in aspiration as eager as mine , Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday afternoons my parents came home early , to wash and dress and remove from their persons every sign of labor . The great keys of the store were put away out of sight ; the money-bag was hidden in the featherbeds . My father put on his best coat and silk skull-cap ; my mother replaced the cotton kerchief by the well-brushed wig . We children bustled around our parents , asking favors in the name of the Sabbath : Mamma , let Fetchke and me wear our new shoes , in honor of Sabbath ' ; or ' Papa , will you take us tomorrow across the bridge ? You said you would , on Sabbath . ' And while we adorned ourselves in our best , my grandmother superintended the sealing of the oven , the maids washed the sweat from their faces , and the dvornik scraped his feet at the door . My father and brother went to the synagogue , while we women and girls assembled in the living-room for candle prayer . The table gleamed with spotless linen and china . At my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crocheted doily ; and beside it stood the wine flask and the kiddush cup of gold or silver . At the opposite end of the table was a long row of brass candlesticks , polished to perfection , with the heavy silver candlesticks in a shorter row in front . For my mother and grandmother were very pious , and each used a number of candles ; while Fetchke and I and the maids had one apiece . After candle prayer the women generally read in some book of devotion , while we children amused ourselves in the quietest manner , till the men returned from synagogue . ' Good Sabbath ! ' my father called , as he entered ; and ' Good Sabbath ? good Sabbath ! ' we wished him in return . If he brought ith him a Sabbath guest from the synagogue , the stranger was welcomed and invited in , and placed in the seat of honor , next to my father . We all stood around the table while kiddush , or the blessing over the wine , was said ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a stern look , and began again from the beginning . But asj soon as he had cut the consecrated loaf , and distributed the slices , we were at liberty to talk and ask questions ; unless a guest was present , when we maintained a polite silence . On Sabbath morning almost everybody went to synagogue , and those who did not , read their prayers and de- votions at home . Dinner , at midday , was a pleasant and leisurely meal in our house . Between courses my father led us in singing our favorite songs , sometimes Hebrew , sometimes Yiddish , sometimes Russian , or some of the peculiar songs without words for which the religious enthusiasts of that time were famous . In the afternoon we went visiting , or else we took long walks out of town , where the fields sprouted and the orchards waited to bloom . If we stayed at home , we were not . without company . Neighbors dropped in for a glass of tea . Uncles and cousins came , and perhaps my brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . And wherever we spent the day , the talk was pleasant , the faces were cheerful , the joy of Sabbath pervaded everything . I suppose no little girls with whom we played had a more comfortable sense of being well off than Fetchke and I. ' Raphael the Russian 's grandchildren , ' people called us , as if referring to the quarterings in our shield . It was very pleasant to wear fine clothes , to have kopecks to spend at the fruit-stalls , to be pointed at admiringly . Some of the little girls we went with were richer than we ; but after all , one 's mother can only wear one pair of earrings at a time , and our mother had beautiful gold ones that hung down on her neck . As we grew older , my parents gave us more than physical comfort and social standing to rejoice in . They gave us , or set out to give us , education , which was less common than gold earrings in Polotzk . For the ideal of a modern education was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his travels in distant parts . His travels , indeed , had been the making of my father . He had gone away from Polotzk , in the first place , as a man unfit for the life he led , out of harmony with his surroundings , at odds with his neighbors . Never heartily devoted to the religious ideals of the Hebrew scholar , he was more and more a dissenter as he matured , but he hardly knew what to embrace in place of the ideas he rejected . The rigid scheme of orthodox Jewish life in the Pale offered no opening to any other mode of life . But in the large cities in the east and south he discovered a new world , and found himself at home in it . The Jews among whom he lived in those parts were faithful to the essence of the religion , but they allowed themselves more latitude in practice and observance than people in Polotzk . Instead of bribing government officials to relax the law of compulsory education for boys , these people pushed in numbers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were given books in Odessa and Kherson , as the rock to build their lives on , and not as an ornament for idleness . My father 's mind was ready for the reception of such ideas , and he was inspired by the new view of the world which they afforded him . When he returned to Polotzk he knew what had been wrong with his life before , and he proceeded to remedy it . He resolved to live , so far as the conditions of existence in Polotzk permitted , the life of a modern man . And he saw no better place to begin than with the education of the children . Outwardly he must conform to the ways of his neighbors , just as he must pay tribute to the policeman on the beat ; for social ostracism could ruin his business as easily as police persecution . His children , if he started them right , would not have to bow to the yoke as low as he ; his children 's children might even be free men . And education was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebbe , in the orthodox way , but we were taught to translate as well as read Hebrew , and we had a secular teacher besides . We were both very diligent pupils , and my father took great satisfaction in our progress and built great plans for our higher education . My brother , who was five years old when he entered heder , hated to be shut up all day over a printed page that meant nothing at all to him . He cried and protested , but my father was determined that he should not grow up ignorant , so he used the strap freely to hasten the truant 's steps to school . The heder was the only beginning allowable for a boy in Polotzk , and to heder Joseph must go . So the poor boy 's life was made a nightmare , and the horror was not lifted until he was ten years old , when he went to a modern school where intelligible things were taught , and it proved that it was not the book he hated , but the blindness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's return from far Russia , ' we led a wholesome life of comfort , content , and faith in to-morrow . Everything prospered , and we children grew in the sun . My mother was one with my father in all his plans for us . Although she had spent her young years in the pursuit of the ruble , it was more to her that our teacher praised us than that she had made a good bargain with a tea merchant . Fetchke and Joseph and I , and Edle Dvereh , when she grew up , had some prospects even in Polotzk , with our parents ' hearts set on the highest things . But we were destined to seek our fortunes in a world which even my father did not dream of , when he settled down to business in Polotzk . Just when he felt himself safe and strong , a long series of troubles set in to harass us , and in a few years ' time we were reduced to a state of helpless poverty , in which there was no room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously ill , and spent large sums on cures that did not cure him . While he was still an invalid , my mother also became ill , and kept her bed for the better part of two years . When she got up , it was only to lapse again . Some of us children also fell ill , so that at one period the house was a hospital . And while my parents were incapacitated , the business was ruined through bad management , until a day came when there was not enough money in the cash-drawer to pay the doctor 's bills . For some years after they got to their feet , my parents struggled to regain their place in the business world , but failed to do so . My father had another period of experimenting with this or that business , like his earlier experience . But everything went wrong , till at last he made a great resolve to begin life all over again . And the way to do that was to start on a new soil . My father determined to emigrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what my people were , how I began life , and why I was brought to a new home . Up to this point I have borrowed the recollections of my parents , to piece out my own fragmentary reminiscences . But from now on I propose to be my own pilot across the seas of memory ; and if I lose myself in the mists of uncertainty , or run aground on the reefs of speculation , I still hope to make port at last , and I shall look for welcoming faces on the shore . For the ship I sail in is history , and facts will kindle my beacon fires . My father and mother could tell me so much that I have forgotten , or that I never was aware of ; but I want to reconstruct my childhood from those broken recollections only , which , re- curring to me in after years , filled me with the pain and wonder of remembrance . I want to string together those glimpses of my earliest days that dangle in my mind , like little lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an elusive little figure that is myself , and yet so much a stranger to me , that I often ask , Can this be I ? I have not much faith in the reality of my first recollection , which dates from the time I was four years old , but I can never go back over the past without bringing up at last at this sombre little scene , as at a door beyond which I can not pass . I see , then , an empty , darkened room . In the middle , on the floor , lies a long shape , covered with some black stuff . There are candles at the head of the shape . Dim figures are seated low , against the walls , swaying to and fro . There is no sound in the room , except a moan or a sigh from the shadowy figures . But a child is walking softly round and round the shape on the floor , in quiet curiosity . The shape is the body of my grandfather laid out for burial . The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode of our childhood , if not revisited in later years , is apt to loom in our imagination as a vast edifice with immense chambers in which our little self seems lost . Somehow , I have failed of this illusion . My grandfather 's house , where I was born , stands , in my memory , a low , one-story wooden building , whose chimneys touch the sky at the same level as do its neighbors ' chimneys . Such as it was , the house stood even with the sidewalk , but the yard was screened from the street by a board fence , outside which I am sure that there was a bench . Of the interior of the house I remember only one room , and not so much the room as the window , which had a blue sash-curtain , and beyond the curtain a view of a narrow , walled garden , where deep red dahlias grew . The garden belonged to the house adjoining my grandfather 's , where lived the Gentile girl who was kind to me . Behind my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember as a mountain . Perhaps it was only a hump in the ground . This eminence , of whatever stature , was a part of the Vall , a longer and higher ridge , on the top of which was a promenade , and which was said to be the burying ground of Napoleonic soldiers . This historic rumor meant very little to me , for I had no idea what Napoleon was . It was not my way to accept unchallenged every superstition that came to my ears . Among the wild flowers that grew on the grassy slopes of the Vail , there was a small daisy , popularly called blind flower , ' because it was supposed to cause blindness in rash children who picked it . I was rash , if I was awake ; and I picked blind flowers ' behind the house , handfuls of them , and enjoyed my eyesight unimpaired . If my faith in nursery lore was shaken by this experience , I kept my discovery to myself , and did not undertake to enlighten my playmates . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ours was a secretive atmosphere , where knowledge was for the few , and wisdom was sometimes a capital offense ? It was not far from the limits of Polotzk to the fields and woods . My father was fond of taking us children for a long walk on a Sabbath afternoon . I have little pictures in my mind of places where we went , though I doubt if they could be found from my descriptions . I try in vain to conjure up a panoramic view of the neighborhood . Even if I stood on the apex of the Vail , and saw the level country spread in all directions , my inexperienced eyes failed to give me the picture of the whole . I saw the houses in the streets below , all going to market . The highroads wandered out into the country , and disappeared in the sunny distance , where the edge of the earth and the edge of the sky fitted together , like a jewel-box with the lid ajar . In these things I saw what a child always sees : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite way out of town was by the bridge across the Polota . I recall more than one excursion in that direction . Sometimes we made a large party , annexing a few cousins and aunts for the day . At this moment I feel a movement of affection for these relations who shared our country adventures . I had forgotten what virtue there was in our family ; I do like people who can walk . The Dvina River swallows the Polota many times a day , yet the lesser stream flooded the universe on one occasion . On the hither bank of the Polota , as you go from Polotzk , I should plant a flowering bush , a lilac or a rose , in memory of the life that bloomed in me one day that I was there . Leisurely we had strolled out of the peaceful town . It was early spring , and the sky and the earth were two warm palms in which all live things nestled . Little green leaves trembled on the trees , and the green , green grass sparkled . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and life flowed in and out of us fully , freely , as the river flowed and parted about the bridge piles . A market garden lay on the opposite slope , yellow-green with first growth . In the long black furrows yet unsown a peasant pushed his plough . I watched him go up and down , leaving a new black line on the bank for every turn . Suddenly he began to sing , a rude ploughman 's song . Only the melody reached me , but the meaning sprang up in my heart to fit it ? a song of the earth and the hopes of the earth . I sat a long time listening , looking , tense with attention . I felt myself discovering things . Something in me gasped for life , and lay still . I was but a little body , and Life Universal had suddenly burst upon me . For a moment I had my little hand on the Great Pulse , but my fingers slipped , empty . For the space of a wild heartbeat I knew , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly senses for life . But the sky had stretched for me , the earth had expanded ; a greater life had dawned in me . We are not born all at once , but by bits . The body first , and the spirit later ; and the birth and growth of the spirit , in those who are attentive to their own inner life , are slow and exceedingly painful . Our mothers are racked with the pains of our physical birth ; we ourselves suffer the longer pains of our spiritual growth . Our souls are scarred with the struggles of successive births , and the process is recorded also by the wrinkles in our brains , by the lines in our faces . Look at me , and you will see that I have been born many times . And my first self-birth happened , as I have told , that spring day of my early springs . Therefore would I plant a rose on the green bank of the Poiota , there to bloom in token of eternal life . Eternal , divine life . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting here , chattering of my infantile adventures , if I did not know that I was speaking for thousands ? Would you be sitting there , attending to my chatter , while the world 's work waits , if you did not know that I spoke also for you ? I might say you ' or he ' instead of I. ' Or I might be silent , while you spoke for me and the rest , but for the acci. dent that I was born with a pen in my hand , and you without . We love to read the lives of the great , yet what a broken history of mankind they give , unless supplemented by the lives of the humble ! But while the great can speak for themselves , or by the tongues of their admirers , the humble are apt to live inarticulate and die unheard . It is well that now and then one is born among the simple with a taste for self-revelation . The man or woman thus endowed must speak , will speak , though there are only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind to carry the tale . It is pleasant to recall how we went bathing in the Polota . On Friday afternoons in summer , when the week 's work was done , and the houses of the good housewives stood shining with cleanliness , ready for the Sabbath , parties of women and girls went chattering and laughing down to the river bank . There was a particular spot which belonged to the women . I do not know where the men bathed , but our part of the river was just above Bonderoff 's grist-mill . I can see the green bank sloping to the water , and the still water sliding down to the sudden swirl and spray of the mill-race . The woods on the bank screened the bathers . Bathing costumes were simply absent , which caused the mermaids no embarrassment , for they were accustomed to see each other naked in the public hot baths . They had little fear of intrusion , for the spot was sacred to them . They splashed about and laughed and played tricks , with streaming hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls play as they did in the water . It was a pretty picture , but the bathers would have been shocked beyond your understanding if you had suggested that naked women might be put into a picture . If it happened , as it did at least once for me to remember , that their privacy was outraged , the bathers were thrown into a panic as if their very lives were threatened . Screaming they huddled together , low in the water , some hiding their eyes in their hands , with the instinct of the ostrich . Some ran for their clothes on the bank , and stood shrinking behind some inadequate rag . The more spirited of the naiads threw pebbles at the cowardly intruders , who , safe behind the leafy cover that was meant to shield modesty , threw jeers and mockery in return . But the Gentile boys ran away soon , or ran away punished . A chemise and a petticoat turned a frightened woman into an Amazon in such circumstances ; and woe to the impudent wretch who lingered after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close range were his portion , and curses pursued him in retreat . Among the liveliest of my memories are those of eating and drinking ; and I would sooner give up some of my delightful remembered walks , green trees , cool skies , and all , than to lose my images of suppers eaten on Sabbath evenings at the end of those walks . I recall the feel and flavor of the cheesecake my grandmother used to make . Should you attempt to imitate it , from my analysis , you would fail . You have nothing in your kitchen cupboard to give the pastry its notable flavor . It takes history to make such a cake . First you must eat it as a ravenous child , in memorable twilights , before the lighting of the week-day lamp . Then you must have yourself removed from the house of your feast , across the oceans , to a land where your cherished pastry is unknown even by name ; and where daylight and twilight , work-day and f ? te-day , for years rush by you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must abstain from the inimitable morsel for a period of years ? I think fifteen is the magic number ? and then sud denly , one day , rub the . Aladdin 's lamp of memory , and have the renowned tidbit whisked upon your platter , garnished with a hundred sweet herbs of past association . My winters , while I was a very little girl , were passed in comparative confinement . On account of my delicate health , my grandmother and aunts deemed it wise to keep me indoors ; or if I went out , I was so heavily coated and mittened and shawled that the frost scarcely got a chance at the tip of my nose . I never skated or coasted or built snow-houses . If I had any experience of snowballs , it was with those thrown at me by the Gentile boys . The way I dodge a snowball to this day makes me certain that I learned the act in my fearful childhood days , when I learned so many cowardly tricks of bending to a blow . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when I found I was not afraid to stand up and catch a flying baseball , but the fear of the snowball I have not conquered . When I turn a corner in snowball days , the boys with bulging pockets see a head held high and a step unquickened , but I know whether I shrink inwardly ; and this private mortification I set down against old Polotzk , in my long score of grievances and shames . Fear is a devil hard to cast out . At certain ? I mean uncertain ? intervals , we were bundled up and marched to the public baths . This was so great an undertaking , consuming half a day or so , and involving , in winter , such risk of catching cold , that it is no wonder the ceremony was not practiced oftener . The public baths were situated on the river bank . I always stopped a while outside , to visit the poor patient horse in the treadmill by means of which the water was pumped into the baths . But we had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hurried me inside . We undress in a room leading directly from the entry , and furnished only with benches around the walls . There is no screen or other protection against the draughts rushing in every time the door is opened . When we enter the bathing-room we are met by a babel of sounds ? shrill voices of women , hoarse voices of attendants , wailing and yelping of children , and rushing of water . At the same time we are smitten by the heat of the room , and nearly suffocated by clouds of steam . We find an empty bench , and surround ourselves with a semicircle of wooden pails , collected from all over the room . Sometimes two women seeking pails lay hold of the same pail at the same moment , and a wrangle ensues , in the course of which each disputant reminds the other of all her failings , nicknames , and undesirable connections , living , dead , and unborn ; until an attendant interferes , with more muscle than argument , punctuating the sentence of justice with newly-coined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , where the bathers fill their pails at the faucets , is a field of endless battle , especially on a crowded day . The peaceable women who are seated within earshot stop their violent scrubbing , to the relief of unwilling children , while they attend to the liveliest of the quarrels . I like to watch the poll , that place of torture and heroic endurance . It is a series of steps rising to the ceiling , affording a gradually mounting temperature . The bather who wants to enjoy a violent sweating rests full length for a few minutes on each step , while an attendant administers several hearty strokes with a stinging besom . Sometimes a woman climbs too far , and is brought down in a faint . On the poll , also , the cupping is done . The back of // the patient , with the cups in even rows , looks to me like a muffin pan . Of course I never go on the poll : I am not robust enough . My spankings I take at home . Cleansed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing-room , to shiver , as we dress , in the cold draughts from the entry door ; and then muffled up to the eyes , we plunge into the refreshing outer air , and hurry home , looking like so many big bundles running away with smaller bundles . If we meet acquaintances on the way we are greeted with zu refueh ' ( to your good health ) . If the first man we meet is a Gentile , the women who have been to the mikweh ( ritual bath ) have to return and repeat the ceremony of purification . To prevent such a calamity , the kerchief is worn hooded over the eyes , so as to exclude unholy sights . At home we are indulged with extra pieces of cake for tea , and otherwise treated like heroes returned from victory . We narrate anecdotes of our expedition , and my mother complains that my little brother is getting too old to be taken to the women 's bath . He will go hereafter with the men . The winter days drew themselves out too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking what should happen next . No dolls , no books , no games , and at times no companions . My grandmother taught me knitting , but I never got to the heel of my stocking , because if I discovered a dropped stitch I insisted on unraveling all my work till I picked it up ; and grandmother , instead of encouraging me in my love for perfection , lost patience and took away my knitting-needles . I still maintain that she was in the wrong , but I have forgiven her , since I have worn many pairs of stockings with dropped stitches , and been grateful for them . And speaking of such everyday things reminds me of my friends , among whom also I find an impressive number with a stitch dropped somewhere in the pattern of their souls . I love these friends so dearly that I begin to think I am at last shedding my intolerance ; for I remember the day when I could not love less than perfection . I and my imperfect friends together aspire to cast our blemishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was plenty of quiet occupation . I liked to sit with the women at the long bare table , picking feathers for new featherbeds . It was pleasant to poke my hand into the soft-heaped mass and set it all in motion . I pretended that I could pick out the feathers of particular hens , formerly my pets . I reflected that they had fed me with eggs and broth , and now were going to make my bed so soft ; while I had done nothing for them but throw them a handful of oats now and then , or chase them about , or spoil their nests . I was not ashamed of my part ; I knew that if I were a hen I should do as a hen does . I just liked to think about things in my idle way . Itke , the housemaid , was always the one to break in upon my reflections . She was sure to have a fit of sneezing just when the heap on the table was highest , sending clouds of feathers into the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished by our picking the feathers from each other 's hair . And I remember my playmates . There was always a crowd of us girls . We were a mixed set , ? rich little girls , well-to-do little girls , and poor little girls , ? but not because we were so democratic . Rather it came about , if my sister and I are considered the centre of the ring , because we had suffered the several grades of fortune . In our best days no little girls had to stoop to us ; in our humbler days we were not so proud that we had to condescend to our chance neighbors . The granddaughters of Raphael the Russian , in retaining their breeding and manners , retained a few of their more exalted friends , and became a link between them and those whom they later adopted through force of propinquity . We were human little girls , so our amusements mimicked the life about us . We played house , we played soldiers , we played Gentiles , we celebrated weddings and funerals . We copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Froebel kindergarten and learned to impersonate butterflies and stones . Our elders would have laughed at us for such nonsense . I remember once standing on the river bank with a little boy , when a quantity of lumber was floating down on its way to the distant saw-mill . A log and a board crowded each other near where we stood . The board slipped by first , but presently it swerved , and swung partly around . Then it righted itself with the stream and kept straight on , the lazy log following behind . Said Zalmen to me , interpreting , ' The board looks back and says , " Log , log , you will not go with me ? Then I will go on by myself . " ' That boy was called simple , on account of such speeches as this . I wonder in what language he is writing poetry now . I was very fond of playing Gentiles . I am afraid I liked everything that was a little risky . I particularly enjoyed being the corpse in a Gentile funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playmates , in borrowed shawls and long calicoes , with their hair loose and with candlesticks in their hands , marched around me , singing unearthly melodies , and groaning till they scared themselves . As I lay there , covered over with a black cloth , I felt as dead as dead could be ; and my playmates were the unholy priests in gorgeous robes of velvet and silk and gold . Their candlesticks were the crosiers of the Christian funeral processions , and their chantings were hideous incantations to the arch enemy , the Christian god of horrible images . As I imagined the bareheaded crowds making way for my funeral to pass , my flesh crept , not because I was about to be buried , but because the people crossed themselves . But our procession stopped outside the church , because we did not dare to carry even our make-believe across that unholy threshold . Besides , none of us had ever been inside ? God forbid ! ? so we did not know what did happen next . ' When I arose from my funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost and hateful . I do n't think we girls liked each other much after playing funeral . Anyway , we never played any more on the same day ; for if we did , we soon quarreled . Such was the hold which our hereditary terrors and hatreds had upon our childish minds , that if we only mocked a Christian procession in our play , we suffered a mutual revulsion of feeling , as if we had led each other into sin . We gathered oftener at our house than anywhere else . On Sabbath days we refrained , of course , from soldiering and the like , but we had just as good a time , going off to promenade , two and two , in our very best dresses , whispering secrets and telling stories . We had a few stories in the circle ? I do not know how they came to us ? and these were told over and over . Gutke , the accepted leader of our set , knew the best story of all . She told the tale of Aladdin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her story , and nobody else ever attempted it , though I , for one , soon had it by heart . Gutke 's version of the famous tale was unlike any I have since read , but it was essen- tially the story of Aladdin , so that I was able to identify it later when I found it in a book . Names , incidents , and ' local color ' were slightly Hebraized , but the supernatural wonders of treasure-caves , jeweled gardens , genii , princesses , and all , were not in the least marred or diminished . Gutke would spin the story out for a long afternoon , and we all listened entranced , even at the hundredth rehearsal . We had a few other fairy stories , ? I later identified them with the stories of Grimm or of Andersen , ? but for the most part the tales we were told were sombre and unimaginative ; tales our nurses used to tell to frighten us into good behavior . Although I always joined the crowd when any fun was on foot , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister was fond of housework , but I ? I was fond of idleness . While Fetchke pottered in the kitchen beside the maid or trotted all about the house after my grandmother , I wasted time in some window-corner , or studied the habits of the cow and the chickens in the yard . I always found something to do that was of no use to anybody . Idle child though I was , the day was not long enough sometimes for my idleness . More than once in the pleasant summer I stole out of bed when even the cow was still drowsing , and went barefoot through the dripping grass and stood at the gate , awaiting the morning . I found a sense of adventure in being conscious when all other people were asleep . There was not much of a prospect from the gateway , but at that early hour everything looked new and large to me , even the little houses that yesterday had been so familiar . The houses , when creatures went in and out of them , were merely conventional objects ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some stood up straight , and some leaned , and some looked as if they saw me . And then over the dewy gardens rose the sun , and the light spread and grew over everything , till it shone on my bare feet . And in my heart grew a great wonder , and I was ready to cry , my world was so strange and sweet about me . In those moments I could have loved somebody dearly ? somebody who cared to get up secretly , and stand and see the sun come up . Was there not somebody who got up before the sun ? Was there not Mishka the shepherd ? Aye , that was an early riser , but I knew he was no sun-worshiper . Before the chickens stirred , before the lazy maid let the cow out of the barn , I heard his rousing horn , its distant notes harmonious with the morning . Barn-doors creaked in response to Mishka 's call , and soft-eyed cattle went willingly out to meet him , and stood in groups in the empty square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove was all assembled , and he tramped out of town behind them , in a cloud of dust . The survival in III Russia of medieval injustice to Jews was responsible for the narrowness of educational standards in the Polotzk of my time . Jewish scholarship was confined to a knowledge of the Hebrew language and literature ; and even these limited stores of learning were not equally divided between men and women . In the medieval position of the women of Polotzk education really had no place . A girl was ' finished ' when she could read her prayers in Hebrew , following the meaning by the aid of the Yiddish translation especially prepared for women . If she could sign her name in Russian , do a little figuring , and write a letter in Yiddish to the parents of her betrothed , she was called wohl gelehrent ? well educated . Fortunately for me , my parents ' ideals soared beyond all this . My mother , who had not stirred out of Polotzk , readily adopted the notion of a liberal education imported by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father in all his plans for us girls . Fetchke and I were to learn to translate as well as pronounce Hebrew , the same as our brother . We were to study Russian , and German , and arithmetic . We were to go to the best pension and receive a thorough secular education . My father 's ambition , after several years ' sojourn in enlightened circles , reached even beyond the pension ; but that was flying further than Polotzk could follow him with the naked eye . I do not remember our first teacher . When our second teacher came we were already advanced to continuous reading . Reb ' Lebe was no great scholar . Great scholars would not waste their learning on mere girls . Reb ' Lebe knew enough to teach girls Hebrew . Tall and lean was the rebbe , with a lean , pointed face , and a thin , pointed beard . The beard became pointed from much stroking and pulling downwards . The hands of Reb ' Lebe were large , and his beard was not half a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nails , I am afraid , were not very clean . The coat of Reb ' Lebe was rusty , and so was his skull cap . Remember , Reb ' Lebe was only a girls ' teacher , and nobody would pay much for teaching girls . But lean and rusty as he was , the rebbe 's pupils regarded him with entire respect , and followed his pointer with earnest eyes across the limp page of the alphabet , or the thumbed page of the prayer-book . When we left off reading by rote and Reb ' Lebe began to reveal the mysteries to us , I was so eager to know all that was in my book that the lesson was always too short . I continued reading by the hour , after the rebbe was gone , though I understood about one word in ten . My favorite Hebrew reading was the Psalms . Verse after verse I chanted to the monotonous tune taught by Reb ' Lebe , rocking to the rhythm of the chant , just like the rebbe . And so ran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I sat by the low window , the world erased from my consciousness . When we began to study the Pentateuch I had the great advantage of a complete translation in Yiddish . I faithfully studied the portion assigned in Hebrew , but I need no longer wait for the next lesson to know how the story ends . I could read while daylight lasted , if I chose , in the Yiddish . Well I remember that Pentateuch , a mid-. tiling thick octavo volume , in a crumbly sort of leather cover ; and how the book opened of itself at certain places , where there were pictures ... It was inevitable , as we came to Genesis , that I should ask questions . Rebbe , translating : ' In the beginning God created the earth . ' Pupil , repeating : ' In the beginning ? Rebbe , when was the beginning ? ' Rebbe , losing the place in amazement : " S gehert a kasse ? Ever hear such a question ? ? The beginning was ? the beginning ? the beginning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go on . ' Pupil , resuming : ' In the beginning God made the earth . ? Rebbe , what did He make it out of ? ' Rebbe , dropping his pointer in astonishment : ' What did ? ? What sort of a girl is this , that asks questions ? Go on , go on ! ' The lesson continues to the end . The book is closed , the pointer put away . The rebbe exchanges his skull cap for his street cap , is about to go . Pupil , timidly , but determinedly , detaining him : ' Reb ' Lebe , who made God ? ' The rebbe stares at the pupil in amazement mixed with anxiety . His emotion is beyond speech . He turns and leaves the room . In his perturbation he even forgets to kiss the mezuzah ' on the door-post . The pupil feels reproved and yet somehow in the right . Who did make God ? But if the rebbe will not tell ? will not tell ? Or perhaps he does not know ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , shining from their curls to their shoes . One little girl has rosy cheeks , the other has staring eyes . Rosy-Cheeks carries a carpet-bag . Big-Eyes carries a new slate . Hand in hand they go into the summer morning , so happy and pretty a pair that it is no wonder people look after them , from window and door , and that other little girls , not dressed in their best , and carrying no carpetbags , stand in the street gaping after them . Let the folks stare ; no harm can come to the little sisters . Did not grandmother tie pepper and salt into the corners of their pockets , to ward off the evil eye ? The little maids see nothing but the road ahead , so eager are they upon their errand . Carpetbag and slate proclaim that errand : Rosy-Cheeks and Big-Eyes are going to school . I have no words to describe the pride with which my sister and I crossed the threshold of Isaiah the Scribe . Hitherto we had been to heder , to a rebbe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular teacher . There was all the difference in the world between the 1 A piece of parchment inscribed with a passage of Scripture , rolled in a case and tacked to the door-post . The pious touch or kiss this when leaving or entering a house . ? THE AUTHOR . two . The one taught you Hebrew only , which every girl learned ; the other could teach Yiddish and Russian and , some said , even German ; and how to write a letter , and how to do sums without a counting-frame , just on a piece of paper ; accomplishments which were extremely rare among girls in Polotzk . But nothing was too high for the grandchildren of Raphael the Russian ; they had ' good heads , ' everybody knew . So we were sent to Reb ' Isaiah . My first school , where I was so proud to be received , was a hovel on the edge of a swamp . The schoolroom was gray , within and without . The door was so low that Reb ' Isaiah had to stoop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bare , but the low ceiling was decorated with bundles of goose-quills stuck in under the rafters . A rough table stood in the middle of the room , with a long bench on either side . That was the schoolroom complete . In my eyes , on that first morning , it shone with a wonderful light , a strange glory that penetrated every corner , and made the stained logs fair as tinted marble ; and the windows were not too small to afford me a view of a large new world . Room was made for the new pupils on the bench , beside the teacher . We found our ink-wells , which were simply hollows scooped out in the thick tabletop . Reb ' Isaiah made us very serviceable pens by tying the pen-points securely to little twigs ; though some of the pupils used quills . The teacher also ruled our paper for us , into little squares , like a surveyor 's note-book . Then he set us a copy , and we copied , one letter in each square , all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle-sized girls , and the pretty big girls , copied letters in little squares , just so . There were so few of us , that Reb ' Isaiah could see everybody 's page , by just leaning over . And if some of our cramped fingers were clumsy , and did not form the loops and curves accurately , all he had to do was to stretch out his hand and rap with his ruler on our respective knuckles . It was all very cosy , with the ink-wells that could not be upset , and the pens that grew in the woods , or strutted in the dooryard , and the teacher in the closest touch with his pupils , as I have just told . And as he labored with us , and the hours drew themselves out , he was comforted by the smell of his dinner cooking in some little hole adjoining the schoolroom , and by the sound of his good Leah or Rachel or Deborah ( I do n't remember her name ) keeping order among his little ones . She kept very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you could hear the scratching of the laborious pens , accompanied by the croaking of the frogs in the swamp . Alas ! there were not many lessons for Fetchke and me . Long before we had exhausted Reb ' Isaiah 's learning , we had to give up our teacher , because the family fortunes began to decline , and luxuries , such as schooling , had to be cut off . My father 's plans fell to the ground the intellectual limits of Polotzk were trampled down by the monster poverty , who showed his evil visage just as my sister and I were fairly started on a broader path . Think of a little girl who wanted to know all things , but had no teacher who could answer questions , and no book save the Bible and her mother 's prayer-books . What could such a child do but try and find out for herself what all her oracles refused to divulge ? Grown-up people said a great many things that were false . All grandmothers were pious , and yet they said that ' blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They talked a great deal about right and wrong , about being holy , about God . How could a young . philosopher be sure that they were not mistaken ? The most inquisitive little girl in Polotzk was driven to put to the test all things for which a test could be devised , until at last she hit upon an impious plan to put God Himself to the proof ! One Sabbath afternoon , when all the house was taking its after-dinner nap , she went out into the yard , and stopped at the gate . She took out her pocket handkerchief . She looked at it . Yes , that would do for the experiment . She put it back into her pocket . She did not have to rehearse mentally the sacred admonition not to labor on the Sabbath day . She knew it as she knew that she was alive . She knew that to carry anything in her pocket when she passed the boundary of her home was to break this Sabbath law . And with her handkerchief in her pocket the audacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her heart beating so that it pained . Nothing happened . She walked quite across the street . The Sabbath peace still lay on everything . She felt again of the burden in her pocket . Yes , she certainly was committing a sin . With an access of impious boldness , the sinner:walked ? she ran as far as the corner , and stood still , fearfully expectant . What form would the punishment take ? She stood breathing painfully for an eternity . How still everything was ? how close and still the air ! Would it be a storm ? would a sudden bolt strike her ? She stood and waited . She could not bring her hand to her pocket again , but she felt that it bulged monstrously . She stood with no thought of moving again . Where were the thunders of Jehovah ? No sacred word of all her long prayers came to her tongue ? not even ' Hear , 0 Israel . ' She felt that she was in direct communication with God ? awful thought ! ? and He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age passed in blank expectancy . Nothing happened ! Where was the wrath of God ? Where was God ? When she went back into the house , she gazed with a new curiosity at her mother , at her grandmother , dozing in their chairs . They looked different . When they awoke and stretched themselves and adjusted wig and cap , they looked very strange . As she went to get her grandmother her Bible , and dropped it accidentally , she kissed it by way of atonement , just as a proper child should . The child who questioned sacred authorities and dared to challenge God Himself was famous for her devotion to the Psalms , and for faithful observance of all rites and ceremonies prescribed for the pious . Was this child , then , a fraud ? To return to the honest first person , I was something of a fraud , in the puzzling matters of prescribed religion . The days when I believed everything I was told did not run much beyond my teething time . I soon began to question if fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently I had to question God . And in those days my religion depended on my mood . I could believe anything I wanted to believe . I was certain , in all my moods , that there was a God who had made the world , in some fashion unexplained , and who knew about me and my doings ; for there was the world all about me , and somebody must have made it . And it was inconceivable that a being powerful enough to do such work could be aware of my actions at all times , and yet continue to me invisible . The question remained , what did He think of my conduct ? Was He 610 THE HOUSE really angry when I broke the Sabbath , or pleased when I fasted on the Day of Atonement ? My belief as to these matters wavered . When I swung the sacrifice around my head on Atonement Eve , repeating , ' Be thou my sacrifice , ' I certainly believed that I was bargaining with the Almighty for pardon , and that He was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , and I enjoyed all of my chicken that I could eat , I believed as certainly that God could not be party to such a foolish transaction , in which He got nothing but words , while I got both the feast and the pardon . The sacrifice of money , to be spent for the poor , seemed to me a more reliable insurance against damnation . The well-to-do pious offered up both living sacrifice and money for the poor box , but it was a sign of poverty to offer money only . Even a lean rooster , to be killed , roasted , and garnished for the devotee 's own table at the breaking of the fast , seemed to be considered a more respectable sacrifice than a groschen to increase the charity fund . All this was so illogical that it unsettled my faith in minor points of doctrine , and on these points I was quite happy to believe to-day one thing , to-morrow another . As unwaveringly as I believed that we Jews had a God who was powerful and wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotent , cruel , and foolish . I understood that the god of the Gentiles was no better than a toy , to be dressed up in gaudy stuffs and carried in processions . I saw it often enough , and turned away in contempt . While the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ? my God ? enjoined on me honesty and kindness , the god of Vanka , the Gentile boy , bade him beat me and spit on me whenever he caught me alone . And what a foolish god was that who taught the stupid Gentiles that we drank the blood of a OF BONDAGE murdered child at our Passover feast ! Why , I , who was only a child , knew better . And so I hated and feared and avoided the great white church in the square , and hated every sign and symbol of that monstrous god who was kept there , and hated my own person when , in our play of a Christian funeral , I imagined my body to be the corpse , over which was carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handkerchief I discovered , by accident , that I was not the only doubter in Polotzk . One Friday night I lay wakeful in my little bed , staring from the dark into the lighted room adjoining mine . I saw the Sabbath candles sputter and go out , one by one , ? it was late , ? but the lamp hanging from the ceiling still burned high . Everybody had gone to bed . The lamp would go out before morning , if there was little oil ; or else it would burn till Natasha , the Gentile chore-woman , came in the morning to put it out , and remove the candlesticks from the table , and unseal the oven , and do the dozen little tasks which no Jew could perform on the Sabbath . The simple prohibition against labor on the Sabbath day had been construed by zealous commentators to mean much more . One must not even touch any instrument of labor or commerce , as an axe or a coin . It was forbidden to light a fire , or to touch anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a cold candlestick or a burned match . Therefore the lamp at which I was staring must burn till the Gentile woman came to put it out . The light did not annoy me in the least ; I was not thinking about it . But apparently it troubled somebody else . I saw my father come from his room , which also adjoined the living-room . What was he going to do ? What was this he was doing ? Could I believe my THE HOUSE eves ? My father touched the lighted lamp ! yes , he shook it , as if to see how much oil there was left ! I was petrified in my place . I could neither move nor make a sound . It seemed to me he must feel my eyes bulging at him out of the dark . But he did not know that I was looking ; he thought everybody was asleep . He turned down the light a very little , and waited . I did not take my eyes from him . He lowered the flame a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest degrees he turned the light down . I understood . In case any one were awake , it would appear as if the lamp were going out of itself . I was the only one who lay so as to be able to see him , and I had gone to bed so early that he could not suppose I was awake . The light annoyed him , he wanted to put it out , but he would not risk having it known . I heard my father find his bed in the dark before I dared to draw a full breath . The thing he had done was a monstrous sin . If his mother had seen him do it , it would have broken her heart ? his mother who fasted half the days of the year , when he was a boy , to save his teacher 's fee ; his mother who walked almost barefoot in the cruel snow , to carry him on her shoulders to school when she had no shoes for him ; his mother who made it her pious pride to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of the great God , from the hand of a poor struggling woman . If my mother had seen it , it would have grieved her no less ? my mother who was given to him , with her youth and good name and her dowry , in exchange for his learning and piety ; my mother who was taken from her play to bear him children and feed them and keep them , while he sat on the benches of the scholars and repaid her labors with the fame of his learning . I did not put it to myself // just so , but I understood that learning and piety were the things most valued in our family , that my father was a scholar , and that piety was the fruit of sacred learning . And yet my father had deliberately violated the Sabbath . His act was not to be compared with my carrying the handkerchief . The sins were of the same kind , but the sinners and their motives were different . I was a child , a girl at that , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man full grown , passing for one of God 's elect , and accepting the reverence of the world as due tribute to his scholarly merits . I had by no means satisfied myself , by my secret experiment , that it was not sinful to carry on the Sabbath day . If God did not punish me on the spot , perhaps it was because of my youth , ? I knew I could not be accounted fully responsible , ? or perhaps it was because of my motive . I puzzled long over my father 's strange conduct , and came to the conclusion that , as he was too learned to have any doubts on the question , and too good to do wrong knowingly , he did not account it a sin to put out a lamp on Sabbath night . Then why his secrecy ? That was easily explained . Had I not myself instinctively adopted secret methods in my little investigations ? Let my father publish his heretical opinions , and he and his family would have no place in Polotzk . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not think as other people did , it was best not to let it be suspected , even by your own family . The discovery of my father 's position on the Sabbath question served to shake me further in my faith . I wish I had somebody to blame for my weakness in morals also . I recall with sorrow how I stole a piece of sugar . It was long ago ? almost as long ago as anything that I remember . We were still living 612 THE HOUSE in my grandfather 's house when this dreadful thing happened , and I was only four or five years old when we moved from there . Before my mother figured this out for me I scarcely had the courage to confess my sin . And it was thus : In a corner of a front room , by a window , stood a high chest of drawers . On top of the chest stood a tin box , decorated with figures of queer people with queer flat parasols ; a Chinese tea-box , in a word . The box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I knew what was in that gorgeous box , and I coveted it . I was very little ? I never could reach anything . There stood a chair suggestively near the chest . I pushed the chair a little and mounted it . By standing on tiptoe I could now reach the box . I opened it and took out an irregular lump of sparkling sugar . I stood on the chair admiring it . I stood too long . My grandmother came in ? or was it Itke , the housemaid ? ? and found me with the stolen morsel . I saw that I was fairly caught . How could I hope to escape my captor , when I was obliged to turn on my stomach in order to descend safely , thus presenting my jailer with the most tempting opportunity for immediate chastisement ? I took in the situation before my grandmother had found her voice for horror . Did I rub my eyes with my knuckles and whimper ? I wish I could report that I was thus quickly struck with a sense of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my impending doom , and I promptly seized on a measure of compensation . While my captor ? I really think it was a grandmother ? rehearsed her entire vocabulary of reproach , from a distance sufficient to enable her to hurl her voice at me with the best effect , I stuffed the lump of sugar into my mouth and munched it as fast as I could . And I had eaten it all , and had OF BONDAGE licked my sticky lips , before the avenging rod came down . I remember no similar lapses from righteousness , but I sinned in lesser ways more times than there are years in my life . I sinned , and more than once I escaped punishment by some trick or sly speech . I do not mean that I lied outright , though that also I did , sometimes ; but I would twist my naughty speech , if forced to repeat it , in such an artful manner , or give such a ludicrous explanation of my naughty act , that justice was overcome by laughter , and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisins instead of a knotted strap . If by such successes I was encouraged to cultivate my natural slyness and duplicity , I throw the blame on my unwise preceptors , and am glad to be rid of the burden for once . I have said that I used to lie . I recall no particular occasion when a lie was the cause of my disgrace ; but I know that it was always my habit , when I had some trifling adventure to report , to garnish it up with so much detail and circumstance that nobody who had witnessed my small affair could have recognized it as the same , had I not insisted on my version with such fervid conviction . The truth is that everything that happened to me really loomed great and shone splendid in my eyes , and I could not , except by conscious effort , reduce my experiences to their actual shapes and colors . If I saw a pair of geese leading about a lazy goose-girl , it seemed to me there was a lively flock of them in charge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frown on his face , I thought that a cloud of wrath overspread his countenance ; and I ran home to relate , panting , how narrowly I had escaped his fury . I will not pretend that I was absolutely unconscious of my exaggerations ; but if you insist , I will say that things as I reported them might have been so , and would have been more interesting had they been so . The noble reader who never told a lie , or never confessed one , will be shocked at these revelations of my childish depravity . What proof has he , he will cry , that I am not lying on every page of this chronicle , if , by my own confession , my childhood was spent in a maze of lies and dreams ? I shall say to the saint , when I am challenged , that the proof of my conversion to veracity is engraven in his own soul . Do you not remember , you spotless one , how you used to steal and lie and cheat and rob ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was your remote ancestor who lived by plunder , and was honored for the blood upon his hairy hands . By and by he discovered that cunning was more effective than violence , and less troublesome . Still later he became convinced that the greatest cunning was virtue , and made him a moral code , and subdued the world . Then , when you came along , stumbling through the wilderness of cast-off errors , your wise ancestor gave you a thrust that landed you in the clearing of modernity , at the same time bellowing into your ear , ' Now be good ! It pays ! ' This is the whole history of your saintliness . But all people do not take up life at the same point of human development . Some are backward at birth , and have to make up , in the brief space of their individual history , the stages they missed on their way out of the black past . With me , for example , it actually comes to this : that I have to recapitulate in my own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I seem to learn nothing except by the prick of life on my own skin . I am saved from living in ignorance and dying in darkness only by the sensitiveness of my skin . Some men learn through borrowed experience . Shut them up in a glass tower , with an unobstructed view of the world , and they will go through every adventure of life by proxy , and be able to furnish you with a complete philosophy of life , so true that you may safely bring up your children by it . But I am not of that godlike organization . I am a thinking animal . Things are as important to me as ideas . I imbibe wisdom through every pore of my body . There are times , indeed , when the doctor in his study is less intelligible to me than a cricket far off in the field . The earth was my mother , the earth is my teacher . I am a dutiful pupil : I listen ever with my ear close to her lips . It seems to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , more or less directly , through one of the corporal senses . As long as I have my body , I need not despair of salvation .
