PRECEDED by the imperial herald Caspar Sturm and accompanied by his colleague Nicholas Amsdorf , an Augustinian brother , John Petzensteiner , and one of his students , a young Pomeranian nobleman , Peter Swaben , Luther left Wittenberg on April 2 , 1521 , riding in state with his companions in a covered wagon . The city magistrates provided the conveyance and the university added funds for the journey . Condemned heretic though he was , town after town showed him distinguished honor as he passed through . The papal legate Aleander re ported that his entire journey was nothing less than a triumphal procession . At Leipsic the city council sent him a gift of wine . At Erfurt , where his old friend Crotus was rector of the university , he as met outside the walls by an imposing v deputation , and was greeted with an ora tion by the rector and a poem by Eoban Hesse , the most celebrated poet of the day . Early in his journey he was unpleas antly surprised to learn of the imperial mandate requiring the sequestration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trembled at the news , for it showed that the emperor was against him and he could hope for little from his own appearance at the diet . But his resolution to proceed remained unshaken . According to his friend Myconius , when warned that he would be burned to ashes by the cardinals and bishops at Worms , and reminded of the fate that befell Hus at Constance , he replied , " Even if they kindled a fire as high as heaven from Wittenberg to Worms , I would appear in the name of the Lord , in obedience to the imperial summons , and would walk into behemoth 's mouth , between his great teeth , and confess Christ . " Though Myconius is not a very trustworthy reporter , the words have a genuine ring . From Frankfort , where he stopped over night , Luther wrote Spalatin , who was already at Worms with the elector : We are coming , my Spalatin , although Satan has tried to stop me with more than one sickness . The whole way from Eisenach here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before experienced . Charles 's mandate I know has been published to frighten me . But Christ lives , and we will enter Worms in spite of all the gates of hell and powers of the air . I send a copy of the imperial letter . I have thought it well to write no more letters until I arrive and see what is to be done , that Satan may not be puffed up , whom I am minded rather to terrify and despise . Arrange a lodging for me therefore . Farewell . A year later , in a letter to the elector he remarked : " The devil saw clearly the mood I was in when I went to Worms . Had I known as many devils would set upon me as there were tiles on the roofs , I should have sprung into the midst of them with joy . " Long afterward , in talking about his journey , he repeated the same words , and added : " For I was undismayed and feared nothing , so foolish can God make a man ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | He reached his journeys end about ten o'clock on the morning of Tuesday , the sixteenth of April . His coming was announced by a trumpeter , and though it was the hour of the midday meal , the whole town poured out to see him . Aleander sent one of his attendants to witness the great heretic 's arrival , and afterward wrote the papal vice-chancellor : " About a hundred horsemen , presumably Sickingen 's , accompanied him to the city gate . Sitting in a wagon with three companions , he entered the city , surrounded by some eight riders , and took up his lodging in the neighborhood of his Saxon prince When he alighted , a priest threw his arms about him , touched his garments three times , and went away exulting , as if he had handled a relic of the greatest of saints . I suspect it will soon be said he works miracles . This Luther , as he stepped from the wagon , looked about with his demoniac eves and said , God will be with me . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ten or twelve of whom he dined , and after dinner everybody ran in to see him . " In spite of the pressure he was under , he took the time the next morning to visit a sick nobleman who had expressed the desire to see him . After offering him spiritual consolation , he heard him confess , and administered the sacrament . It was a thoroughly characteristic act , for he was never too busy to heed such calls . Always to the end of his days he remained a de- voted and self-sacrificing pastor and spiritual guide . At four in the afternoon he appeared before the diet , sitting at the time in the bishop 's palace , where the Emperor Charles and his brother Ferdinand were staying . The hall was filled with a large and distinguished company of princes , noblemen , high ecclesiastics , representatives of the various states and free cities of Germany , and ambassadors of foreign powers , ineluding two from England . It was an impressive occasion , fraught with consequence not only for Luther himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case of the condemned monk was only one of many items of business to engage the attention of the diet , and doubtless most of the members were far more interested in other matters of local or national concern . Few realized the seriousness of the situation , and fewer still appreciated the world-wide significance of the monk 's appearance before the German emperor and estates . But all were curious to see and hear the man who had made such a stir , and it is not surprising that the hall was crowded , as well as the streets outside . Aleander was scandalized to see the Wittenberg monk enter the hall with a smiling face and let his eyes rove over the assembled company instead of exhibiting the humility and fear appropriate to one in his situation . The humanist Peutinger , a delegate from the city of Augsburg , where he had entertained Luther at the time of his appearance before Cajetan , happened to be standing near and was greeted cheerily with the words , " What , you here , too , Herr Doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worms , and reported to the Augsburg authorities that he found him always in excellent spirits . As soon as he had reached his place , Luther was peremptorily required to say whether he acknowledged as his own a pile of some twenty books collected by the diligence of Aleander and arranged upon a table before him , and whether he would retract the whole or any part of their contents . He wondered , as he later remarked , where so many of his writings had been picked up ; but when their titles had been read , he promptly acknowledged them as his own , adding that he had written many others besides . In reply to the second question , he asked for time to consider the matter , since faith and salvation and the divine word were involved , and to answer without premeditation might work injury to the word and endanger his own soul . The papal legates and imperial counselors were surprised and annoyed , but after some hesitation he was granted a delay of twenty-four hours .  | Much speculation has been indulged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many extant reports of the occasion from the pen of the Frankfort representative , Furstenberg , Luther is said to have spoken in a low voice , as if he were frightened and confused . This has led to the common assumption that he was overawed by the august assembly and too much upset to take a firm stand such as might ordinarily have been expected of him . It would perhaps not be surprising if he were . For the first time face to face with the leading princes of the empire and the greatest sovereign of the world , almost any man might be pardoned if he were dazzled by the spectacle and disconcerted by the hostility shown in the abrupt demand for a retraction . But the evidence is insufficient to support the conclusion . No one else , so far as we are aware , shared Furstenberg 's opinion that Luther was frightened , though many who have left reports of the occasion had a much better opportunity than he to observe the monk 's attitude . We must not be misled by the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth standing alone against the world . If he had been standing alone , the emperor and diet would never have wasted their time with him . He was no mere individual , on trial for his life , but the champion of a great and growing party , of political , as well as religious , importance . Nor was he a simple-minded , inexperienced monk , thrust suddenly into the lime-light of publicity , but a seasoned warrior , long aware of the national significance of the battle he was engaged in . At Worms he had a host of influential supporters , and was surrounded by sage counselors . It is impossible to suppose he entered the hall ignorant of what he had to expect and without a carefully arranged plan of procedure . Apparently the plan did not altogether please Luther himself , for he later complained that under the influence of his friends he was milder at Worms than he would have liked to be . Doubtless his supporters were greatly divided as to the best way to meet the situation , and many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushing of the whole movement might be prevented . Very likely he was induced to ask for delay until there was time for further discussion , in the light of the impression made by his first appearance . During the following night we are told he was in constant consultation with his friends , so that he got no sleep at all . And when he appeared before the diet the next day , firm as his final answer was , it was phrased very carefully , and in such a way as to give as little offense as possible . Speaking in a louder voice than at his first appearance , so as to be heard by everybody in the hall , he apologized for any lack of respect he might have shown the members of the diet the previous day , through ignorance of the forms and customs of the great world , and then gave his answer to the crucial question at con- siderable length , first in German and afterward in Latin . His writings he divided into three groups . Some of them , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evangelical that even his enemies confessed them harmless and worthy to be read by Christian people . Others attacked the pope , and these he could not retract without giving support and encouragement to his abominable tyrannies . Still others were directed against individuals who opposed his gospel and defended the papacy . In these he confessed he had often been more violent than was seemly , for he did not claim to be a saint ; but if he withdrew them , impiety under his protection would prevail more widely than ever . At the same time , repeating the words of Christ , " If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil , " he professed himself ready to submit and recant provided he were proved wrong . If his teachings were out of harmono with the Bible , he would be the first to throw his books into the fire . When reproved for not speaking to the point , and asked to give a categorical answer without horns , whether he would recant or not , he replied : Since , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give one with neither horns nor teeth to this effect . Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by clear reason -- for 1 believe neither pope nor counsels alone , since it is certain they have often erred and contradicted themselves , ? having been conquered by the Scriptures referred to and my conscience taken captive by the word of God , I can not and will not revoke anything , for it is neither safe nor right to act against one 's conscience . God help me . Amen . A discussion ensued touching the authority of councils , when the emperor , as it was already growing late , interrupted the colloquy and abruptly closed the session . Arrived at his lodgings , Luther threw up his hands , according to the report of an eve-witness , and cried with joy , " I am through , I am through ! " The strain must have been tremendous even for him , and his relief that it was all over and he had held his ground without flinching was proportionately great . A few days later , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following characteristic comment upon the whole affair : " In my opinion the emperor ought to have gathered a number of doctors and conquered the monk by argument . Instead of that , I was simply asked , Are the books yours ? ' Yes . ' Will you recant them ? ' No . ' Then begone . ' Oh , we blind Germans , how childishly we act and how contemptible we are to allow the Romans to make such fools of us ! " The impression made by Luther upon the members of the diet was very diverse . According to Aleander 's report , written at the close of the first day , many even of those friendly to him , after seeing him , thought him crazy or possessed , while others considered him a pious man , full of the Holy Spirit . Later the legate wrote  | that his coming had had excellent results . The emperor saw in him only a dissolute and demented man , and exclaimed disdainfully , " He will never make a heretic of me . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation he had hitherto enjoyed . On the contrary , according to another eye-witness , Luther conducted himself so bravely , Christianly , and honorably that the Romanists would have been very thankful if he had not come . The Elector Frederick was delighted with him , and said privately to Spalatin , " The father , Dr. Martin , spoke well before the emperor and all the princes and estates of the realm in Latin and German . He is much too bold for me . " In pursuance of the . agreement reached before he was summoned , the emperor wished to have sentence at once passed upon the refractory heretic ; but some of the influential members of the diet thought it possible , in view of his promise to retract if he were convinced of his errors , that he might yield to instruction or persuasion . At any rate , to condemn him without making an effort to show him wrong , it was felt , would lead the populace to think him unfairly treated . There were those , too , who hoped his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses . As at previous diets , impatience with the exactions of the Curia found frequent expression at Worms , and even so good a Catholic as Duke George of Saxony presented a long list of grievances . A committee appointed to consider the matter drew up a document containing a hundred and two gravamina against the papacy and clergy , and , though never acted upon by the diet , it showed clearly enough the temper of many of the members . With Luther 's doctrinal innovations few of them were in sympathy . They had little enough idea of what they were , but they feared their unsettling effects and were sure they ought not to be tolerated . Hus and the Bohemian uprising were constantly before their minds , and the dread of similar trouble in Germany acted continually as a check . With Luther himself the situation was reversed . He was willing to yield in the matter of ecclesiastical abuses , and keep silent for the sake of the peace of the church , but he would not dissemble his doctrinal beliefs . He had LXXXII-44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bad life , but of his false teaching . The word of God , he insisted , must not be bound , and preach it he would as he understood it , whatever the consequences might be . With such convictions it was quite impossible for him to enter into the sort of compromise many of the princes wished . Matters in their opinion of minor concern he considered of fundamental importance , and they ultimately discovered , to their great disgust , that he was quite intractable . So long as there was hope that he could be controlled and made use of , they were anxious to protect him , but when it became evident that he would go his own independent way and bring about changes they did not like , they dropped him altogether . But , in the meantime , the emperor having finally consented , in spite of Aleander 's protests , to grant a brief delay , negotiations with Luther were carried on under the lead of the Archbishop of Treves , a liberal and fair-minded prelate and a personal friend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must have proved more trying to Luther than his appearance before the diet . Every form of persuasion was brought to bear upon him . His patriotism , his loyalty to the emperor , and his love for the church were appealed to . Theological argument was tried and Biblical scholarship invoked , but all to no purpose . At one time it was believed he was about to yield , and the archbishop was much encouraged ; but the belief was due to a misunderstanding , and it was soon discovered that nothing could be done . From the pen of John Cochlmus , a Frankfort theologian , later one of Luther 's principal opponents and author of the first unfriendly biography of the Reformer , we have a long and interesting account of a protracted discussion he had with Luther and his friends . Visiting them in their lodgings , he attempted single-handed to meet the whole company in debate , and he was obliged to submit to considerable banter and to suffer some hard knocks from those present . The interview was enlivened by a tilt between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him contemptuously as " Little Brother , " and asked him disdainfully if he thought there were no wise men except in Wittenberg , Luther ,  | who happened to enter the room at the mo ment , quieted the threatened disturbanc with the jocose remark , " My brother think he is wiser than all of us , especially when he has been drinking hard . " The word brought a laugh and restored the coin pany 's good humor . At another point Cochlius asked Lu ther whether he had received a revelation and after some hesitation the Reforme replied in the affirmative , to the no smal scandal of the Frankfort theologian , who accused him of contradicting himself and asserting at one moment what he denied at another . As a matter of fact , the ques tion was not an easy one to answer . Lu ther firmly believed his gospel came from God , and yet he naturally hesitated to claim supernatural illumination , and as rule was careful not to do so . But all hi conduct was that of a man believing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two disputants finally separated in a friendly spirit , but Coch leus assured Luther of his intention to write against him , and the latter promised to answer him to the best of his ability . After a week of futile effort on the par of the Archbishop of Treves and other called in to assist him , the Reformer begged to be allowed to depart , and on Friday , the twenty-sixth of April , left Worms with an imperial safe-conduct good for twenty days . He was ordered not to preach on the way home , but refused to be bound by the prohibition . After his departure , Aleander was in trusted by the emperor with the task o preparing an edict of condemnation . Tha the papal legate should be called upon to do this was an interesting indication o Charles 's attitude . He was a devout Catho lic , and though in political matters h might deal with the pope as with any othe civil ruler , when legal effect was to b given the papal condemnation , he recognized the pope 's representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The resul was not a brief and summary state docu ment , but an elaborate account of Luther ' errors and of the means employed to bring him to reason . Particular stress was laid upon ' his alleged anarchical principles and his incitement of the masses to uproar bloodshed , and war . Evidently the nee was felt , as in the bull Exurge Domine of justifying the action before the people o Germany , whose devotion to Luther had been the chief obstacle in the way of his condemnation . The edict put Luther unconditionally under the ban of the empire , and thenceforth to the end of his life he remained an outlaw . He was to be seized wherever found and sent to the emperor , or held in safe-keeping until his fate was decided upon . All his books were ordered burned , and to publish , sell , buy , or read any of his writings was strictly forbidden . To support or follow him was to involve oneself in his guilt , and to befriend or hold communication with him openly or secretly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the emperor on the eighth of NIay and received his signature on the twenty-sixth of the month . It was not submitted to the diet , but it had the assent of the leading princes still on the ground , the Elector of Saxony having left Worms some time before , and in view of the earlier decision to condemn Luther if he did not recant , its proclamation was entirely in order . Aleander was overjoyed at the outcome of the difficult and complicated affair . He had spent many anxious months over it , and when it was finally brought to a successful completion , his exultation knew no bounds . He even broke into poetry in the despatch announcing the final decision , and his satisfaction with the emperor was expressed in glowing terms . " I can not refrain , " he exclaimed , " from adding a few words about this most glorious emperor , whom I have always spoken of in my despatches as the best man in the world . As appears more clearly day by day , he is superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daily can be seen in his acts a judgment more than human . " Though Charles had purposely postponed the adoption of the edict and had often acted as if opposed to the wishes of the pope , Aleander declared it was simply in order to secure the assent of the princes to other matters of the utmost importance . The delay , he thought , had really proved of great benefit , and the effect of the edict was far better than if it had been published at the opening of the diet . THus Luther 's appearance at Worms , to which he had looked forward as a splen- did opportunity to proclaim his gospel before the princes and lords of Germany and from which , in his faith in the power of the spoken word , he had expected great things , apparently resulted in a complete victory for his enemies and in the destruc tion of the cause he had at heart . Con demned both by church and state , it seemed as if the end had come both for him and for his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to flee the country and make his way to some land like Bohemia where neither emperor nor pope held sway , and whence he might easily con tinue his agitation and scatter his writing over Germany . This Aleander and many others actually feared he would do ; but the Elector Frederick , true to his policy o supporting his professor without too openly incurring blame for his heresies , formed other plans for him . According to Spala tin , while Frederick was fond of Luther and would have been very sorry to see any harm befall him , he was at this time some what faint-hearted and unwilling to incu the anger of the emperor . He therefor conceived the idea of concealing his con demned professor for a time , and secured his assent before he left Worms , though Luther would much have preferred to re main in the open . Writing from Frankfort on the morn ing of Sunday , the twenty-eighth of April to his friend Lucas Cranach , Luther re marked , " I am allowing myself to be shu up and hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffere death at the hands of the tyrants , espe cially the raging Duke George of Saxony I must not despise the advice of good peo ple until the hour comes . " The same evening , after arriving a Friedberg , he wrote , at Spalatin 's request a long letter in Latin to the emperor an in German to the electors , princes , an estates of the realm , explaining and defend ing his course . As he had so often done he asserted again his readiness to yield i he were convicted out of the Scriptures and expressed in warmest terms his lov for the Fatherland and his conviction tha he was acting for its good . This convic tion , indeed , did much to sustain him dur ing all the troubles of these years . " was born for my Germans , " he once ex claimed , " and them I serve . " He was received by one after another o the towns through which he passed as warmly as on his way to Worms . At Hersfeld he was welcomed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who insisted on his preaching in the convent , although Luther warned him it might cost him his position . He also preached at Eisenach , where the parish priest , fearing possible consequences to himself , went through the formality of filing a protest before a notary , privately excusing himself to Luther for doing so . After being hospitably treated in the little city where he had spent the happiest years of his boyhood , he left , on the third of May , to visit his relatives in the near-by village of Mohra , his father 's birthplace , where many of his kindred still lived . The next afternoon he started on again , taking a road through the forest in the direction of Waltershausen and Gotha . Shortly before dark , not far from the castle of Altenstein , the travelers were suddenly set upon by a company of armed horsemen . Most of Luther 's companions , including the imperial herald , had already been got rid of on one or another pretext , and only Amsdorf and Brother Petzensteiner were with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way on foot to Waltershausen . Amsdorf , who had been forewarned of what was to happen , was permitted to return with the driver to Eisenach . Luther himself was taken back through the forest by devious paths to the Wartburg , one of the strongholds of the Elector Frederick , where he arrived late at night , half dead from fatigue . The large and imposing castle , already more than four hundred years old and crowded with historical memories and legendary tales , stood upon the wooded heights just outside the walls of Eisenach , commanding the town itself and the beautiful Thuringian country for many miles round . There , in honorable captivity , Luther made his home for nearly a year , while the great movement which owed so much to him went on without him . His disappearance was the signal for a tremendous outcry in all parts of Germany . In the absence of accurate information , rumors flew thick and fast . Many believed he was held in confinement by his enemies . Some thought he had been carried off by Sickingen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales were told  | of the finding of his body in this or that spot . When the news reached Albrecht Darer , who was traveling at the time in the Netherlands , he made a long entry in his diary expressing in impassioned terms his devotion to Luther and his sorrow at his death . " 0 God , is Luther dead , who will henceforth proclaim the gospel so clearly to us ? 0 God , what might he not still have written for us in ten or twenty years ! " Luther himself reports that a Romanist wrote to the Archbishop of Mayence , " We are rid of Luther , as we wished to be ; but the people are so stirred up that I suspect we shall scarcely escape with our lives unless with lighted candles we seek him everywhere and bring him back . " Aleander , as well as many others , guessed the truth , but neither he nor any one else knew where the condemned monk was hidden . Even the elector remained in ignorance of his whereabouts , that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beof him . His identity was carefully concealed . He allowed his hair and beard to grow , put on the costume of a knight , wore a gold chain , carried a sword , and engaged occasionally in the sports and occupations of a young nobleman . He went by the name of Junker Jorg , and was generally supposed to be a knight living in temporary retirement . He had some difficulty in maintaining the character he had assumed , and in his rides and walks the attendant who always accompanied him frequently had much ado to keep him from betraying himself by his interest in books , so foreign to one of his supposed class , and by his tendency to enter into theological discussion with those he happened to meet . His letters to his friends dated from " the region of the birds , " from " the desert , " or from " the Island of Patmos , " show how lonely he was and how eager for news of the progress of events in Wittenberg and elsewhere . To be set aside as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , was a sore trial . He wrote to Melanchthon , begging to know what he thought of his retirement , and expressing the fear that it might be supposed he had fled from the conflict in cowardice . To his friend Agricola he wrote : " I am an extraordinary captive , sitting here willing and unwilling at the same time . Willing , because the Lord wills thus ; unwilling , because I should prefer to stand publicly for the word , but not yet am I worthy . " At first he was very impatient , but gradually , amazing as it  | seems in one like him , he grew accustomed to his enforced confinement , and even felt relief at being once more by himself and apart from the strife and turmoil he had endured for three years . " What i going on in the world I care nothing for , " he wrote Spalatin . " Here I sit in quiet . " The largeness and generosity of his na ture were strikingly shown in his complete freedom from petty jealousy and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trace of annoyance because the movement he had started was going on as prosperously under the lead of others . On the contrary , he was continually rejoicing to find himself unnecessary to it , and when his friends lamented his absence and longed for his return , he kept assuring them with unmistakable sincerity that the cause was better off without him . " I rejoice so greatly in your fullness , " he wrote Amsdorf , " that I bear my absence most tranquilly . For I see it is not you who need me , but I who need you . " To Spalatin he wrote , " I am pleased with the news from Wittenberg , and give thanks to Christ who has raised up others in my place so that I see they now have no need of me , though Philipp gives way too much to his affections and bears the cross more impatiently than becomes a disciple , still less such a master . " And to Melanchthon himself : You are already full , you reign without me , nor do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you have of my labors . You seem to invent difficulties , for your affairs go better in my absence than when I am present . Although I should most gladly be with you , since you have all you need , I should not be reluctant to go to Erfurt or Cologne or wherever else the Lord might think good to open a door for me to preach . How great is the harvest everywhere , and there are no laborers ! But you are all laborers . We ought not to think of ourselves but of our brethren scattered everywhere , lest perchance we live for ourselves , that is , for the devil , and not for Christ . Nevertheless , he began now to suffer a return of the mental depression of his earlier days . For some years he had apparently been almost free from it ; but be ing again by himself and without absorbing activities , he . was once more plagued by what he called the assaults of Satan . His own references to the devil 's nightly visitations were richly embellished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends has grown up about the chambers he occupied in the lonely castle . Creaking shutters , gnawing rats , howling winds , the thousand and one noises which hammer at the ears of the sleepless and make night hideous when the nerves are all awry , were interpreted as demoniacal attacks , and were met by Scriptural quotation or muttered prayer . Poor health , due to his unaccustomed mode of living , had something to do with his troubles ; loneliness and loss of the engrossing occupations and responsibilities of recent years even more . He was plagued not only with physical manifestations of the enmity of the evil one , but also with excruciating doubts and fears . What if he were all wrong and were deceiving and leading to perdition the multitudes who were looking to him for leadership ? " Are you alone wise , and has all the world gone wrong until you came to set it right ? " was a taunt that caused him many an agonized hour . Struggle as he might , anxiety would overwhelm him at times , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief he found sometimes in prayer , sometimes in out-of-door excursions , in the course of which he now and then visited the surrounding towns and mingled unrecognized with the crowds in market-place and inn . On one occasion he even took part in a two-days ' hunt . His description of it in a letter to Spalatin is beautifully characteristic : Last week I followed the chase for two days that I might taste that bitter-sweet pleasure of heroes . We caught two hares and three poor little partridges ? a worthy occupation indeed for men of leisure . Even there among the nets and dogs I reflected upon theology , and great as was the pleasure of the scene , I was made sorrowful and wretched by the thoughts it suggested . For what else did it signify than the devil ; who pursues these innocent little beasts with his snares and impious dogs of teachers , the bishops and theologians ? Only too sensible I was of this sad picture of simple and believing souls . A still more dreadful symbol followed . When by my exertions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in my sleeve I had withdrawn to one side , the dogs found the poor beast and bit it through my coat , breaking its leg and strangling it . Thus the pope and Satan rage that they may destroy even saved souls regardless of my efforts . I have had enough of such hunting . It is sweeter , in my opinion , to slay with darts and arrows bears , wolves , wild boars , foxes , and impious teachers such as these . But I comfort myself with the thought that it is a symbol of salvation when hares and harmless beasts are caught by a man rather than by bears , wolves , rapacious hawks , and similar bishops and theologians . For in the latter case they are devoured , as it were , for hell , in the former for heaven . I have written you this pleasantry that you may know that you hunters at court will also be the hunted in paradise whom Christ , the best of hunters , shall scarcely with the greatest effort seize and save . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are sported with . Relief from his mental distress Luther found still oftener in work . Though he was continually complaining of his indo lence and lack of occupation , he really did an enormous amount of study and writing . " Here I sit with nothing to do , like a free man among prisoners , " he wrote Amsdorf ; but for an idle man he accomplished ex traordinary things . Though his place of concealment was kept a secret from the world at large , he did not hesitate to pub lish freely on all sorts of questions , and it was not long before enemies and friends alike knew the Reformer was still alive and in touch with all that was going on . One of the most interesting incidents of his stay at the Wartburg was his tilt with Archbishop Albert of Ia ence . Made bold by Luther 's disappearance from the scene , the archbishop ventured to open a new sale of indulgences at Halle , where he had gathered an extraordinary collection of relics , beside which the treasures of the castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this new traffic he hoped to replenish his exhausted exchequer and also to build a university at Halle to rival the one at Wittenberg . When the matter came to Luther 's knowledge , he sat down in the first flush of indignation to write a severe tract " Against the Idol at Halle , " informing Spalatin of what he was doing . The elector promptly protested and ordered Luther to leave the Archbishop of lblayence alone . The one thing Frederick did not want was to have his professor get embroiled again with so prominent a prince of the realm . He was secretly defying the emperor and diet in protecting Luther , but he hoped the excitement would soon quiet down and the whole affair be forgotten . If the condemned monk were again to break the peace in such a fashion , Frederick 's policy would be altogether shattered , and his position , he felt , would become intolerable . His command , communicated through Spalatin , drew from Luther the following fiery protest : A more displeasing letter I have scarcely ever read than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off answering it , but even determined not to reply at all . In the first place , I will not endure what you say , that the prince will not permit Mayence to be written against or the public peace disturbed . Rather I will lose you and the prince himself and every creature . For if I have withstood his creator the pope , why should I yield to his creature ? Beautifully indeed you say that the public peace must not be disturbed while you suffer the eternal peace of God to be broken by the impious and sacrilegious acts of that son of perdition . Not so , Spalatin ! Not so , Prince ! For the sake of Christ 's sheep , this most terrible wolf must be resisted with all one 's powers , as an example to others . Therefore I send the little hook against him , finished before your letter came . I have not been moved by what you write to make any alterations , although I have submitted it to the pen of Philipp that he may change it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book to Philipp , or dissuade him from publishing it . It is settled that you will not be listened to : A few weeks later he took matters into his own hands and wrote Archbishop Albert one of his characteristic letters , threatening to pillory him before all the world if he did not at once put an end to his new indulgence campaign . Your Electoral Grace perhaps thinks that , now I am off the scene , you are safe from me and the monk is smothered by his Imperial Majesty . That may be as it is , but  | your Electoral Grace shall know that I will do what Christian love demands , regardless of the gates of hell , to say nothing of the unlearned , popes , cardinals , and bishops . It is so well known that indulgences are mere knavery and deception , and Christ alone ought to be preached to the people , that your Electoral Grace can not excuse yourself on the ground of ignorance . Therefore your Electoral Grace is hereby informed in writing , if the idol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sake of divine doctrine and Christian salvation , to attack your Electoral Grace openly as well as the pope , to denounce the undertaking merrily , to lay at the door of the Bishop of Mayence all the old enormities of Tetzel , and to show the whole world the difference between a bishop and a wolf . I have no pleasure in your Electoral Grace 's shame and humiliation , but if a stop is not put to the profaning and desecrating of God 's truth , I and all Christians are in duty bound to maintain His honor , although the whole world , to say nothing of a poor man , a cardinal , be thereby disgraced . I shall not keep still , and even if I do not succeed , I hope you bishops will no longer sing your little song with joy . You have not yet got rid of all those whom ' Christ has awakened against your idolatrous tyranny . Within a fortnight I shall expect your Electoral Grace 's favorable reply , for at the expiration of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be issued if a public answer is not received . The wholesome respect in which Lu ther 's pen was held is shown by the corn plete submission of the frightened ecclesi astic . At the end of three weeks he wrote the irate monk an apologetic letter full o expressions of personal humility , assuring him that the traffic had been already stopped and that he would do nothing un becoming a pious clergyman and Christian prince . The archbishop 's prompt submis sion made the publication of the trac against him unnecessary , and it never saw the light . FAR and away the most important frui of Luther 's stay at the Wartburg was hi translation of the New Testament , begun at lelanchthon 's solicitation in Decem ber , and completed in less than thre months . After a careful revision it wa hurried through the press , and in September appeared in its first edition in a large folio volume embellished with many woodcuts . It was soon followed by a translation of successive books of the Old Testament , until , in 1534 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not stop , but went on revising and improving until his death , and no fewer than ten editions of the complete work were published during his lifetime . He was not the first to put the Scriptures into the German language . Vernacular translations were very common and had a wide circulation among the people . During the previous half-century , eighteen German editions of the whole Bible had been published , and some of Luther 's own acquaintances were engaged in the task of translating before he began . Writing to his friend Lang , who had recently issued a German version of the Gospel of Matthew , he urged him to go on with the work , and expressed the wish that every town might have its own translator , that the Bible might be the better understood by the people . That he had many predecessors diminishes in no degree the importance of Luther 's work . Though his was not the first German Bible , it soon won its way to general favor and crowded all others out of use . The contrast with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin Vulgate , the official Bible of the Catholic Church , and smacked largely of their source . Written in a curious Latinized German , most of them were unattractive and sometimes almost unintelligible . Luther translated his New Testament direct from the Greek , and his Old Testament from the Hebrew . Besides getting nearer to the original , he was thus able to avoid the deleterious influence of the Latin , and produce a translation genuinely German in style and spirit . His qualifications for the work were many . Though he was not one of the great philologists of the day , he had an excellent knowledge of both Hebrew and Greek , and a very unusual faculty , quite out of proportion to his grammatical attainments , for getting at the meaning of an author and divining the sense of obscure and difficult passages . He could also call upon : VIelanchthon and other eminent lin- guists in Wittenberg for assistance when needed . His long and intimate acquaintance with the Bible likewise stood him in good stead . Ever since his Erfurt days he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with its spirit and contents . His profound religious experience gave him a sympathy with it he could have gained in no other way . He found his own innermost feelings expressed in it , and his translation of many a passage was as truly the free and spontaneous expression of his own heart as the reproduction of the words of another . He doubtless had this in mind when he wrote : " Translating is not everybody 's gift . It demands a genuinely pious , true , industrious , reverent , Christian , learned , experienced , and practised heart . Therefore I hold that no false Christian or sectary can translate correctly , as appears , for instance , in the Worms edition of the prophets . Great labor was employed in its preparation , and my German was closely imitated ; but the translators were Jews , with little loyalty to Christ , and so their art and industry were vain . " His intimate contact in the confessional with the religious emotions , aspirations , and weaknesses of his fellows had also thrown light upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men . He had a profound knowledge of human nature , as his letters , sermons , and tracts abundantly show , and it enabled him to understand as few have understood the most widely and variously human of all the world 's books . Most important of all was his extraordinary command of the German language . It is not often a writer of the first rank gives himself to the translation of another 's work . Such a writer Luther was , and his version remains one of the great classics of the world . He had a command of idiomatic , racy , colloquial German seldom equaled and never surpassed , and he undertook to make the Bible really a German book . In a tract on the subject of translating , defending his work against the strictures of his enemies , he remarked , " I have tried to talk German , not Latin and Greek " ; and again , " You must not get your German from the Latin , as these asses do , but you must get it from the mother in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common man in the market-place . " The difficulties of the task he indicated in the words , " In translating I have always made the effort to write pure and clear German ; and it has often happened that we have sought a fortnight or even three and four weeks for a single word , and then sometimes not found it . " And in a letter to his friend Link : " How great and laborious a task it is to force Hebrew writers to talk German ! How they strive against it and rebel at being compelled to forsake their native manner and follow the rough German style ! It is just as if a nightingale were made to give up its own sweet melody and imitate the song of the cuckoo , though disliking it extremely . " He did not try to transport his readers back into Bible days , but to bring the Bible down to their own day . It was not a scholar 's book he aimed to produce , done so literally that it might be retranslated into the original languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its readers might forget it was written in a foreign tongue , in a distant land , and in an age long past . He therefore allowed himself many liberties with the text , often substituting the name of a more for a less familiar object , and adding words freely where needed to bring out the sense or to make the scene vivid and real . The result of his efforts was a Bible translation which , after the lapse of four centuries , still stands unapproached in its vital and compelling power . The German employed by him was not his own creation , but it owed him much . The dialects of the day were many and various , so that people living only a few score miles apart , as he once remarked , could scarcely understand each other . But a common diplomatic language had already developed , and become the medium of official communication between all the principalities of the land . This he made the basis of his written German . " I use no special dialect of my own , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I may be understood by all alike . I use the speech of the Saxon chancery , which is followed by all the princes and kings of Germany . " Formal , stilted , and clumsy enough it was as employed in the state documents of the day , but Luther greatly modified and  | enriched it , making it more flexible and colloquial , and enlarging its vocabulary from the language of the people , spoken and written . He had a wide knowledge of current literature , devotional and otherwise , and an enormous fund of popular saws and proverbs , and his style , as a rule , was not only simple and clear , but wonderfully vivid and picturesque . It was no exaggeration when a contemporary declared , " Dr. Martin is a real German Cicero . He has not only taught us the true religion , but has reformed the German tongue , and there is no writer on earth who equals him in it . " His writings did much to promote the spread of the German he used and to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only agent in promoting this development , but he did more than any other single man , and above all books his German Bible contributed most . But even more than the oneness of language promoted by it was the unity of sentiment to which it contributed . Divided the land was still , and torn for many a day with conflicts more bitter than it had ever known , but the Luther Bible went on generation by generation nourishing similar ideals and serving as few other agencies to unify the spirit of the Germanspeaking race . Thus the Reformer 's enforced retirement bore rich fruit . Set aside from his active work as leader of the Reformation , he employed the quiet weeks of winter  | solitude in the lonely castle in a stupen- else , would alone have won for him the dous task , which , had he done nothing lasting gratitude of his native land .  |
