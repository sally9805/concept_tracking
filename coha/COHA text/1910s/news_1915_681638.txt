txt A sudden shift in the situation of the Ship Purchase bill in the Senate this evening changed materially the status of that Administration measure . So far as it provides that the Government shall go into the permanent business of owning and operating merchant vessels , the bill appears to be dead . It is generally agreed taht it can not be passed in its present form in view of the desertion of the measure today by Senators NOV= ris and Kenyon . Efforts are being made tonight to effect a compromise by which the measure , if enacted , win provide that ships bought by the Government shall be operated only for the emergency period covered by the European war , and then Shall be turned over to the navy for use as auxiliaries or sold . Any compromise must also provide , it seems to be clear , that no interned merchant vessels of countries now at war shall be bought by the United States Government . At the conclusion of the struggle in Europe , according to present plans , the Government would retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most perilous situation yet arising from the prolonged filibuster against it . Convinced at last that the filibuster could be continued until March 4 , blocking all other legislation and making an extra session necessary . Senator Norris of Nebraska and Senator Kenyon of Iowa , radical Republicans favoring the bill . late this afternoon refused to support further the existing tactics of the Administration Senators . Mr. O'Gorman of New York , One of the leaders of the Democratic opposition to the bill , moved to adjourn , and at 6:11 P , M. Ills motion , by a vote of 48 to 40 was adopted , Messrs . Norris and Kenyon voting with the opposition . The Senate had been in session 55 hours and 11 minutes , the longest continuous session in its history . In 1893 the repeal of the silver purchase clause of the Sherman law kept the Senate in continuous session for 38 hours and 43 minutes , a record for that period , and one that was not surpassed Until now . News of the impending defection of Mr. Norris and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already was at work on another plan to save the bill when the Senate adjourned . Senators had hardly left the Chamber before the Secretary to the President , Mr. Tumulty , was hurrying to the Capitol- and he was soon in conference with the Administration 's supporters , discussing with them plans already taken up with leaders of the House . Hope for the ultimate passage of the bill had been directed to the House , where it was pianned to take some compromise form of the Ship Purchase bill , substitute it for the Weeks bill providing for the use of naval vessels in commerce , which was passed last session by the Senate . and send it to the Senate , where a motion would be made to concur in the lieuse amendment . Bolters Willing to Dicker . Senators said it depended on the form in which the compromise was made whether the plan would be successful or not . When the Senate adjourned this afternoon there was much talk in all factions that : he Ship Purchase bill , in the form pending before the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the seven dissenting Democratic Senators are unwilling to push their opposition to the President 's plans too far . These Senators said this afternocn that a sill amended so as to forbid absolutely the purchase of belligerent ships and to provide for the lapsing of the proposed statute within a fixed period after the close of the war probably would command their support . Amendments of this character , of course , would alienate permanently the support of Mr. Norris and Mr. Kenyon , who have insisted from the first on a measure that would be a lasting step in the direction of Governmental ownership of a public utility . But if as many as five of'the recalcitrant Democrats were won over , Mr. Norris and Mr. Kenyon could he ignored . And the strength of this plan would be increased by the apparent willingness of the regular Republicans to refrain from filibustering and let the new compromise come to a vote . This would make it still possible to avoid the extra session . These amendments are little different from those demanded in vain by the seven Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forces in the Senate went in the other direction . making concessions to the radical Republicans . The compromise now proposed by the Seven Democrats , with the tacit consent , if not the approval , of the regular Republicans , drops only one important amendment from the demands that the Democratic caucus rejected . That is the demand for a provision in the bill forbidding the Governmentowned corporation from operating the acquired ships directly . Instead , this conservative element wanted the Government simply to purchase or construct ships , and then lease them to private persons for operation under strict supervision . Even so conservative a Republican as Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts has a bill providing for tire construction and leasing of vessels to cost 530,000.000 , and he is willing to let a vote come on a bill in which leasing is permitted rather than required . Fletcher Not Optimistic . Mr. Fletcher of Florida , who is in charge of the bill in the Senate , seemed tonight to have no definite views on the compromise proposed by the seven Democrats . He took the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in order to make a new legislative day in which a vote would be in order on the motion to discharge the Committee on Commerce from further consideration of the Gore substitute embodying the Norris demands . But he admitted that the hostile motion of Mr. Clarke of Arkansas to recommit the bill probably would Prevail tomorrow with out the addition of instructions to the committee to bring the bill back promptly with specified amendments . If that course should be foliowed , and nothing else seems likely , the bill would be in the hands of a hostile committee . which would make little attempt at reconciling differences and again reporting the measure to the Senate . A motion would then be made to take up an appropriation bill  --  probably by Mr. Bankhead of Alabama , a dissenting Democrat , to take up the Post Office Appropriation bill . And this motion would prevail , as Messrs . Norris and Kenyon would support it . There was a hush of expectancy in the Senate Chamber this afternoon when Mr. Norris took the floor . He explained that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended , but that the filibuster against it was obstructing other matters that he regarded as more important . Both sides had filibustered in turn , he said . whenever they found themselves in a minority , and both sides were equally to blame . " This can not go on forever . " said Mr. Norris , after referring to a rule he would propose providing for cloture . " Things have come to such a pass here now that on every bill that is presented there must be a test of physical strength , the old trial by battle . This is a relic of barbarism . We often boast that this is the greatest deliberative body in the world , and we have no cloture and unlimited debate . But unlimited debate under present conditions is the most inhuman and cruel cloture in the world . It is a cloture against everything except debate . It kills time and it kills the members of this body as well . " No one longer doubts the ability of the Republicans to carry their filibuster to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fail in the present session , and in the extra session there would simply be a repetition of what we have now . There is nothing to gain and much to lose by continuing this sitting . If the filibuster goes on we shall reach the 4th of March With nothing done . The great supply bills will fail and the extra session would be devoted to them . Measures Waiting Consideration . " Important measures have passed the House and are now waiting for the consideration of the Senate . The Committee on Privileges and Elections has Ordered a favorable report on a resolution of inquiry into campaign expenditures in certain States . I consider that resolution of more importance to the country than this pending legislation , as it would tell the country of enormous amounts expended to purchase seats in this body . " The House has passed a Convict Labor bill , which will be dead on March 4 unless the Senate takes action in the meantime . There is also the bill to regulate securities of State corporations . That measure is demanded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been before the Senate for months without serious consideration . That bill may die anyhow , as I understand the President has changed his mind and decided not to early out that part of his platform . But all these measures are made impossible b V a continued filibuster . " Mr. O'dorman thereupon moved adjournment . Every Senator voted except Mr. Tillman of South Carolina , who was absent because of ill health , and Mr. Weeks of Massachusetts , who was paired with him . Whether the Ship Purchase bill is dropped outright or passed by a compromise that would provoke no further . delay , it is doubtful if the appropriation bills can all be passed before March 4 . Tf the River and Harbor bill is taken up , there will be heavy opposition to it . ' amounting almost to a filibuster . But the other supply measures might pass . Mr. Warren of Wyoming , for many years Republican Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations , said that there now remained the shortest time on record to pass the appropriation bills . The previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills were further advanced than now . President Active for Compromise . It was in full realization of the perilous situation of the Ship bill that President Wilson set te work today to save it . All day there was a procession of prominent House Democrats in and out of the White House  --  not the executive offices , where the President usually transacts business , but the big mansion where the President lives . All had been sent for to discuss the situation . The callers included nearly all the Chairmen of important committees of the House . Among them were Representative Underwood , floor leader and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means ; Mr. Kitchen , who is to succeed Mr. Underwood in the next Congress as Chairman and leader ; Chairman Flood of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Adamson of Interstate and Foreign Commerce Alexander of Merchant Marine and Fisheries , who introduced the Ship Purchase bill as an Administration measure in the House ; Padgett of the Naval Affairs , and Henry of the powerful Committee on Rules , who would be the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the passage of the Ship bill . To these House leaders the President said plainly that if the Ship bill were not passed at the present session of Congress  --  which will end by constitutional limitation three weeks from tomorrow ? he would call the new Congress . in extra session for the express purpose of giving consideration to the measure . Some of the leaders . notably Mr. Flood , said that for political and other reasons they did not want an extra session . The main object of these White House conferences was to devise a programme that would bring about the enactment of some form of Government ship purchase . The first suggestion in the direction of a compromise was along the lines of the proposal outlined in THE New Yoatc Timm ; this morning that the House pass the Ship bill as an amendment to the Weeks bill . and send it to the Senate with a request for a conference , the conferees to report in favor of abandoning the Weeks measure and accepting-the Ship Purchase measure in its stead . The argument behind this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ship Purchase bill by the House might induce certain Republicans and some of the recalcitrant Democratic Senators to vote for the recommendation of the conferees . But it was realized that this plan could not be carried out easily . There would be opposition in the Senate and probably another filibuster . Some of the Democratic leaders showed dissatisfaction with this plan . One was Speaker Clark , who maintained  --  privately and not for publication  --  that it would not be dignified to attempt to do by indirection what could not be accomplished by fair argument . In view of the opposition developed , the President and the House leaders gave consideration to , the suggestion for a compromise that would bring to the support of the Ship Purchase plan some of the Senators who were opposed to direct Government operation of merchant vessels , and arrangements are now in the making to draft a measure that it is thought will satisfy the opposing elements . Representatives Underwood and Kitchen told President Wilson that any measure for permanent Government ownership of merchant vessels would not pass the House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate bill should be materially amended . Mr. Underwood and Mr. Kitchen were inclined to believe that the House would assent to a measure that provided that ships purchased should be turned over to the navy at the conclusion of the European struggle for use as auxiliaries ' if suitable , and that ships not suitable should be sold . They said also that it would be necessary to amend the Senate bill so as to provide that no interned merchant vessels should be bought . It appears to be assured tonight that a compromise of the character outlined will be Proposed tomorrow . Before Dawn in the Senate . In the early hours of this morning Mr. Sherman of Illinois was the Senator who held the floor to keep the filibuster going . He took the floor at I A. M. and held it until 9:10 , when he yielded it to Senator Townsend , another Republicaenn a Senator tor Sherman discussed what he termed the evils of Government ownership as Senator after Senator disappeared to his home or to some committee room for a little rest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had collected on the floor during the prolonged session . Senator Lea of Tennessee presided . and Senator Lee of Maryland constituted the entire majority side of the Chamber . Senator Smoot and Senator Smith of Michigan were the only Republicans present for hours in addition to Senator Sherman . With their eyes badly swollen from the strain of the extraordinary work the regular force of official reporters were compelled to give way , and new stenographic reporters , for the first time in years , took their places on the floor . The parliamentary struggle for advantage that took place about midnight was marked by a verbal clash between Senators Stone and Penrose , as a result of which Senator Penrose was taken to his hotel with a temperature of more than 100 degrees . It was 9 o'clock this morning before the weary night watchers on the floor were relieved . Senators who had slept in committee rooms were to be seen making down the corridors for the barber shop , and later , one by one , they took their places on the floor . Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he made his early morning appearance . " It is yesterday , " responded Senator Lea , who had spent the night in the presiding officer 's chair , " It will soon be next week , " volunteered Senator Robinson , who at that time had succeeded Senator Lee of Maryland as the sole Democrat on the floor . A Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . " Rumor . " In his speech Senator Townsend aroused the Democrats with an assertion that Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , New York bankers , were interested in the passage of the Ship Purchase bill . " Upon what information does the Senator assert that Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. are interested in this bill or that they are exerting influence to have the bill passed ? " demanded Senator Lewis , Democrat . " I know that a common rumor is In circulation to that effect , " retorted Senator Townsend . " I do know that a member of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. is a member of the Federal Reserve Board . I know that a brother of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it will require large sums of money fo the Government to carry out this project . I think I know that the Government is going to rely upon its favorite bank , and Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. has increased its deposits , as deposits of banks not so friendly to the Administration have decreased proportionately . " Does not the Senator know , " demanded Senator Martine , " that Paul M. Warburg resigned from Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. when he went to the Federal Reserve Board and proclaimed his action publicly ? " Senator Bristow sugggested that Mr. Warburg had transferred his interests in Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. to a member of his family . " If it is true , " said Senator Bristow , " that Mr. Warburg 's interests in Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. have been turned over to a member of his family , and if his brother is a supervising head of a great trans-Atlantic steamship line which now has twenty-four ships interned in American ports , and if Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. handle the securities of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this bill passes the United States will be urged to buy those ships ? " " To my mind , " replied Senator Townsend , " it is at least a suspicious circumstance , which the Government of the United States should not become involved in . " When Senator Townsend concluded , Senator Gallinger moved to lay aside the ship bill and take up the Water Power bill . That proposal , however , was tabled , 49 to 89 . Senators Bankhead , Hardwick , and Vardaman , of the Democrat insurgents , joined the Democratic side on the vote . Senator La Follette , Republican , voted with the Republicans to take up the Water Power b Cummins Suspects Ship Trust . Senator spoke for the Republicans about two hours and was followed by Senator Cummins . The latter declared that he had no doubt of the right of the United States to buy interned ships ; but he asserted that as foreign nations did not concur , the spectacle of the seizure and condemnation of those ships in foreign prize courts was certain to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , a great opportunity would be presented for the development of international law , but the present was no time to attempt to modify it . Senator Cummins said he favored the purchase or construction of ships to the amount of $30,000,000 or more , but not as a matter of commerce . He spoke in favor of his bill for naval auxiliaries to be used for commerce in emergencies . Mr. Cummins attacked certain legal aspects of the pending Ship bill . He predicted that if any minority stock of the proposed corporation were put on the market , as the bill permitted , it would bought up by the shipping trust . In that case , he said , merely by the exercise of minority rights the trust would be able to prevent the bill 's doing anything to relieve the situation for which the bill was advocated .
