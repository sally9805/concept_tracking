The living-room of Bernice 's house in the country . You feel yourself in the house of a woman you would like to know , a woman of sure and beautiful instincts , who lives simply . At the spectator 's right , stairs go up from the living room ; back of this  --  right , rear , a door ; to the front of the stairs is a narrowed passage as of a hall leading to the kitchen . On the other side of the room , is a tea-table before the fireplace , and before it is a low rounded chair , as if awaiting the one who will come to serve tea . Toward the rear of this left wall is a door . This door is closed . From the back of the room French windows lead directly out of doors . On each side of this door is a window thus opening almost the entire wall to the October woods . There are comfortable seats under the windows , books about . It is late afternoon and the sun glows through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen sitting at a long table at the side of the stairway , playing solitaire . At the back of the cards , open books are propped against the wall , and papers on which he has been writing . ABBIE , a middle-aged servant , is attending to the open fire . MR . ALLEN Holding up a card he is about to place . Ten minutes since the train whistled . They 'll be here in five minutes now . p. 3 ABBIE Yes , sir . MR . ALLEN It will be hard for Craig to come in this house , Abbie . ABBIE Oh , yes . MR . ALLEN Bernice made this house . Looking around . Everything is Bernice . A pause . Change something , Abbie ! With growing excitement . Put something in a different place . He takes a pillow from the seat under the window , holds it irresolutely a moment , puts it on the floor at the side of the fireplace . On the other side he moves a high vase-from the window . Then helplessly . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernice out of this room . The tea-table ! Come , Abbie , quick ! We will take this out of the room . Together , ABBIE reluctant , they move it to the passage-way leading out from the living-room . The FATHER comes back and sees the chair , now without its table . He goes as if to move it , but can not do this ; looks old and broken as he faces the closed door . I wish they 'd left Bernice upstairs , Abbie , in her own room . Now there  --  so near the living-room  --  right off the living-room . Hastily goes back to his cards , but in an instant he brushes them together and pulls the open book toward him , and papers ; but he only rests his hand on the book . There 'll be only Craig and his sister on this train , Abbie. p. 4 ABBIE That 's all I know of . MR . ALLEN But Margaret Pierce will be here soon . As soon as she can get here , Margaret will come . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , sir ? MR . ALLEN I think so . That train from the West got to the Junction at three . I have a feeling Margaret wo n't wait for the five o'clock train to get here . She 'll get a car . ABBIE goes to the door and looks out . It would save a little time , and  --  she does n't know that Bernice  --  Yes , Margaret will get here the quickest way . She always came to Bernice when Bernice needed her . ABBIE She does n't need anyone now . MR . ALLEN No . But yes  --  in a way , she does . She needs some one to be here to do what she ca n't go on doing . Margaret will see that  --  when she knows . Margaret sees everything . ABBIE Frightened now . You think so , sir ? MR . ALLEN Oh , yes , she does . Bernice knew that . " Margaret sees things , " I 've heard Bernice say . ABBIE turns from him . Now MRS . Kirby , Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll be a help to you , Abbie , in  --  arranging things . But see things ? No . How different people are . They 're all different , Abbie . I do n't think Bernice cared much for Laura  --  though she did n't mind her . She 'd just laugh about Laura  --  about her being so sure of everything . It was nice , Abbie , the way Bernice would just laugh about things . She had no malice . p. 5 ABBIE Strangely intense . No . She did n't have , did she ? MR . ALLEN Oh , no , Abbie . Malice was n't in her . It was just that a good many things  --  well , the things that are important to most people were n't so important to Bernice . It was another set of things were important . People called her detached . But  --  I do n't know . Maybe they 're detached , Abbie . Maybe it 's Laura Kirby , the sensible woman , who 's detached ,  --  Bernice would have laughed at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know what I mean , Abbie ? ABBIE I think I do  --  knowing her . MR . ALLEN To you  --  did she seem detached ? ABBIE Tenderly thinking it out . She was loving , and thoughtful , and gay . But always a little of what she is now  --  Faces the closed dooroff by herself . With that intensity the present moment does not account for . You ca n't expect to understand a person who is " off by herself . " Now can you ? MR . ALLEN I understood Bernice . Except , there were things  --  outside what I understood . ABBIE Eagerly . That 's it . And we should take what we had , should n't we , and not try to reach into  --  to where we did n't go . p. 6 MR . ALLEN I suppose that 's true , Abbie . Buries his face . I wish my little girl had n't died . What am I going to do , Abbie ? How can I stay here ? And how can I go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have gone before my daughter . Anything else makes confusion . There 's not going to be anybody to laugh at me now , Abbie . I 'll miss the way Bernice laughed at me , a laugh that took me in and  --  yes , took me in . She laughed at my spending the whole time of the war studying Sanscrit . Well , why should n't I ? What can the old do about war ? I had my vision of life . If that had been followed there 'd have been no war . But in a world that wo n't have visions  --  why not study Sanscrit while such a world is being made over  --  into another such world . Listening . You hear some one , Abbie ? ABBIE After listening . It did n't turn in . MR . ALLEN And you , Abbie . With wonder . Why you were with us when Bernice was born . ABBIE Yes , I was  --  in the room the night she was born . The night she died I thought of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long ago , Abbie ? ABBIE Thirty-five years ago . p. 7 MR . ALLEN Was Bernice thirty-five years old ? She was , Abbie  --  my little girl ? Well , life moves by  --  and we hardly know it 's moving . Why , Abbie , your whole life has been lived around Bernice . ABBIE nods . It will be now as if things had  --  fallen apart . And it was the main thing in your life  --  doing things for her . ABBIE With excitement . Yes , it was the main thing in my life  --  doing what she wanted . I could n't do anything else now , could I ? MR . ALLEN A little surprised at her agitation , but not thinking about it . Why , no . Now some one is coming , Abbie . You hear them coming ? ABBIE I think so . She goes to the door . Yes . ABBIE opens the door and LAURA and CRAIG come in . CRAIG holds back as if to enter this house is something he can scarcely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAURA To the FATHER , taking his hand . This is so hard for you , Mr. Allen . I can not tell you  --  Turning to ABBIEAbbie . MR . ALLEN Going to CRAIG , who is still at the door . Well , Craig . The FATHER holds out his hand , CRAIG takes it . Well , I do n't know what we 're going to do without her . p. 8 LAURA Coming to the rescue with the practical . And where are you going to put us , Abbie ? ABBIE I have the rooms ready upstairs . NORRIS As if he can not do this . Upstairs ? ABBIE In a low voice . She is down here , sir . She indicates the closed door . Then takes LAURA 'S bag and they start upstairs . CRAIG does not move . LAURA On the stairway . Are n't you coming up , Craig , to get clean and rest a little ? NORRIS In a minute or two . He sits down  --  on the edge of a chair near the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been sick long , had she ? MR . ALLEN No , it was very sudden . You know she had had trouble occasionally in the past year ; Dr. Willis had said she might have to go to the hospital . At first this seemed like that  --  so Abbie and I were n't really alarmed . Of course we sent for Willis , but he was in Boston . Young Stuart had the grip . So there was no doctor here  --  till afterwards . NORRIS And  --  how long was Bernice sick ? He speaks with difficulty . p. 9 MR . ALLEN She spoke of feeling badly on Tuesday . She was lying down most of that day . Wednesday  --  she did n't get up at all Wednesday . And she died late Wednesday night . Emotion breaking through . Abbie and I were here all alone ! NORRIS Did she say  --  Did she leave  --  Well , we can talk of that later . MR . ALLEN Changing to something not so hard to speak of . You landed last week ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do . A glance at the FATHER . Of course , if I had had any idea  --  MR . ALLEN Of course . NORRIS But Bernice wrote me she was fine . MR . ALLEN She seemed so . She was well and  --  seemed very happy here this fall . You know how she loves to tramp the woods in the fall . She was counting on your coming home . She had done over your room upstairs . And hers too . They both look so nice and fresh . And she was just starting to do some things to Margaret 's room . Margaret was coming next month for a rest . She 's been working very hard . NORRIS Are you expecting Margaret now ? MR . ALLEN Yes . Wednesday evening Bernice seemed to want Margaret to come . She thought maybe Margaret could get away now , and that it would do her good too . She had been worrying about her  --  thinking she was working too hard . Margaret 's been in Chicago , you know , working on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is doing . Bernice seemed to want to see her . I wonder if Bernice herself felt it wasmore than we knew . Anyway , she wanted us to sendfor Margaret . p. 10 NORRIS But you did n't send for me until  --  until it was over . MR . ALLEN No . You see we did n't know  --  Abbie and I didn'thave any idea  --  I spoke of sending for you when we sent the telegram for Margaret , but Bernice said you 'd be here soon anyway , and she did n't want to hurry youaway from New York . As if not understanding it himself , and trying to find an explanation . I suppose you were doing something that she knew about , and did n't want to interrupt . CRAIG half looks at him . NORRIS And Margaret answered that she was coming ? MR . ALLEN Yes , we heard from her Thursday morning that she had started . She could get here today . We did n't know where to reach her telling her it was too late now for  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe it ! Think of what you and I are talking about ! Bernice out of life . She was so  --  of it . Did n't you feel that , Craig  --  about Bernice ? NORRIS Yes . She seemed so  --  secured . It never seemed anything could  --  destroy Bernice . MR . ALLEN When I think she wo n't come down those stairs again ! NORRIS I ca n't  --  think of things that way now . p. 11 MR . ALLEN No . No , of course not . He does not know what to say , so gathers together his cards , then books . I 'll just  --  I was just going in my room . Pause . I 've been getting on fine with my Sanscrit , Craig . NORRIS That 's good . MR . ALLEN And now the war is over , and some of the people who fussed around about it influenced it as little as I , and I  --  have my Sanscrit . You know , Bernice used to laugh at me , Craig . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovingly . Seems to me I 'll miss that most of all . He goes into his room  --  through the door to the rear of the stairway . Alone in the room , CRAIG tries to look around . He can not . He has taken a step toward the closed door when he hears ABBIE 'S step on the stairs . NORRIS Impetuously going to her , his hands out . Abbie , you were good to her . Takes her hands , holds them tight . Then changing . Why did n't you telegraph me when she was taken sick ? Violently . Do you think there was anything in New York I would n't have left ? Bernice knew that if she needed me  --  She never seemed to need me . I never felt she  --  could n't get along without me . Taking a few stumbling steps toward the room where Bernice is . Oh , I wish I could have a talk with her . p. 12 ABBIE Mr. Norris ! Her tone halts him . There 's something I must tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Yes  --  perhaps . Before you go in there I must tell you  --  They are arrested by the sound of a stopping car ; neither moves ; in a moment MARGARET PIERCE hurries in . PIERCE After looking at them . She 's worse ? Growing more and more alarmed by them . Where is she ? Starts towards the stairs . ABBIE No  --  there . Pointing . NORRIS Stepping between MARGARET and the closed door . She 's dead , Margaret . PIERCE Dead ? Oh  --  no . Not Bernice . Waits imploringly . But that could n't be . NORRIS I know . I know what you mean , Margaret . It seems MARGARET is about to fall ; CRAIG brings a chair ; without taking a step she sinks to it , facing the closed door . ABBIE turns and goes out , toward the kitchen . p. 13 PIERCE A slight quick turn of her head to him . I do n't believe it ! NORRIS It 's true , Margaret . PIERCE Like blood from her heart . But Bernice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . PIERCE After much has gone on in her . And I was n't here ! NORRIS No . Nor I. PIERCE A moment later , just having taken this in . Why were n't you here ? NORRIS I did n't know she was sick . PIERCE Your boat got in a week ago . NORRIS Yes . I was detained in New York . PIERCE Detained by May Fredericks ? NORRIS Margaret ! Bernice would n't want you to talk that way to me  --  now . PIERCE No . NORRIS Why , she knew it . Bernice knew I was staying out on Long Island with them while I was attending to some things about my work . I had a beautiful letter from Bernice . She was perfectly all right  --  about everything . And I was anxious now to get home to her . I was getting ready to start the very day I got the telegram that  --  that it was like this . You mean  --  you think I did n't make Bernice happy , Margaret ? p. 14 PIERCE Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unhappy . NORRIS That 's a cruel thing to say , Margaret . Bernice would n't say that to me . PIERCE Who is all the while looking straight ahead at the closed door . No . NORRIS She understood me . PIERCE And was indulgent . NORRIS After a pause . Margaret , did you ever feel you did n't really get to Bernice ? PIERCE Get to her ? So far as I had power . She never held me back . Life broke through her  --  a life deeper than anything that could happen to her . NORRIS Yes , that 's it . Something you could n't destroy . A life in her deeper than anything that could be done to her . That  --  that makes a difference , Margaret . I never had Bernice . PIERCE Oh , was n't it wonderful to you that beneath what you " had " was a life too full , too rich to be had ? I should think that would flow over your life and give it beauty . NORRIS I suppose a man 's feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  completely moves  --  yes , could destroy  --  not that he would , but has the power to reshape the  --  p. 15 PIERCE Craig ! " Reshape " Bernice ! In anguish . Oh , I came to see her . Not to sit here talking to you . NORRIS I loved her , Margaret . I valued her  --  even though her life was n't made by my life . And she loved me . You think she did n't ? PIERCE No , Craig , I do n't think she did n't . I know she did . I was thinking of those things in her  --  even greater than loving . Those things in her even loving never  --  caught . NORRIS Yes . I know , Margaret . PIERCE I want to see Bernice ! Crying she goes blindly toward the closed door , and to Bernice . A second time left alone in the room , CRAIG now looks at those various things with which he and Bernice have lived . When he can no longer do this he goes to the passage way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment 's wait ABBIE comes slowly in . When Miss Margaret came , you were about to tell me something . My wife  --  left a message for me ? ABBIE Yes . No  --  I do n't know . Wildly . She killed herself ! p. 16 NORRIS Falling back . What  --  are  --  you  --  saying ? ABBIE She  --  did it herself . Took her life . Now I 've told you ! You know now ! NORRIS Roughly taking hold of her . What 's this you 're saying ? What 's this lie you 're trying to  --  Letting go of her  --  in horror , imploringly . Abbie ! Tell me it is n't true . ABBIE It 's true . I 'm telling you . It 's true . She  --  did n't want to live any longer  --  so she took something  --  ended her life . That 's all . That 's all I can tell you . Nobody knows . Not her father  --  nobody . I thought I ought to tell you . Now I 've told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I  --  She breaks from him and rushes out . CRAIG does not move . MARGARET comes from Bernice , without looking at CRAIG , opens the door to go outside . NORRIS Scarcely able to call to her . Margaret . PIERCE Not turning . I 'll be back soon . NORRIS Wildly . You ca n't go away leaving me alone with this ! I tell you I ca n't stand it . You 're going to the woods to think of Bernice ! Well I 'll tell you one thing . You never knew Bernice . You thought she did n't love me . You think I did n't matter . But Bernice killed herself because she loved me so ! p. 17 PIERCE What  --  are  --  you  --  saying ? NORRIS Abbie just told me . No one knows . Not her father  --  only Abbie . PIERCE It is not true . NORRIS Yes . Abbie was with her . Oh , Margaret , she loved me like that . PIERCE And you killed her ! NORRIS No  --  Oh , do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it in . I knew Bernice . She was life . She came from the whole of life . You are asking me to believe that because of  --  some little thing in her own life  --  NORRIS But it was n't a little thing . That 's what we did n't know . I was everything to Bernice . More than all that life we felt  --  Some one is heard above . I think Laura 's coming down . Laura must n't know . I had to have you know . Nobody else . Not Laura . LAURA On the stairs . Oh , Margaret , you have come ? PIERCE I was just going out . As LAURA comes nearer . I 'm going to take a walk ! She goes out . p. 18 LAURA Looking after her . Take a walk . She always does some strange thing . CRAIG has sunk to a chair , his back to LAURA . Why should she rush away like this , as if it were so much harder for her to stay in this house than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with his hands . Has she been trying to make you feel badly , Craig ? She goes up to him and puts a hand on his bent shoulder . Do n't let her do that . It is n't true . It is n't as if Bernice were  --  like most women . There was something  --  aloof in Bernice . You saw it in her eyes ; even in her smile . Oh , I thought she was wonderful , too . Only , it is n't as if Bernice  --  NORRIS If you think she did n't love me , you 're wrong ! LAURA Oh  --  Craig ! Love you , of course . Only  --  things that might have hurt another woman  --  NORRIS How do we know who 's hurt ? Who is n't ? Who loves  --  who does n't love ? Do n't talk , Laura . She stands there beside him ; the FATHER , coming in , at first sees only LAURA . MR . ALLEN I must have dropped the ten of diamonds . Seeing CRAIG . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My little girl . She loved life so . Always . From the time she was a baby she did rejoice so in the world . He stands looking at the closed door . ABBIE comes in ; looks at CRAIG , hesitates , then slowly crosses the room and takes the traveling-bag he brought in when he came ; another look at his bowed head , then , herself bowed , starts up the stairs @x As in Act One , save that it is evening now ; the reading lamp is lighted , and candles . LAURA is sitting before the fire knitting . ABBIE is standing at the foot of the stairs , as if LAURA had called to her as she came down . LAURA But he took the tray , did he , Abbie ? ABBIE He let me leave it . LAURA And how did he seem ? ABBIE I did n't see his face . And he did n't say anything . LAURA He was n't like that until Margaret Pierce came . How long was Mrs. Norris sick , Abbie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in . Been out looking at the stars , Margaret ? Are n't they bright up here in the hills ? PIERCE I  --  I did n't see them . She looks at ABBIE , who is looking at her . ABBIE turns away from MARGARET 'S look . LAURA I was asking you  --  how long was Mrs. Norris sick , Abbie ? ABBIE Two days . LAURA And just what did the doctor say was the matter ? p. 21 ABBIE The doctor was n't here . She steals a glance at MARGARET , who is all the while looking at her . LAURA I know . But afterwards  --  what was his opinion ? ABBIE Attacks like she had had before  --  only worse . Ul-cers in the stomach , he thought it was . LAURA It 's a great pity you could n't get a doctor . That 's the worst of living way up here by one 's self . Mrs. Norris had seemed well , had n't she ? ABBIE Yes , except once in a while ; the doctor had said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIERCE To LAURA . Too bad Craig was n't here . LAURA Yes . He was detained in New York . PIERCE Yes . I know . LAURA Abbie , I wish you would go up and ask Mr. Norris if he would like some more coffee and  --  see how he seems . To MARGARET , resentfully . I do n't understand why Craig should be quite like this . ABBIE does not move until LAURA looks at her in surprise , then she turns to go . No ; I 'll go myself , Abbie . I want to see how he is . She goes up , and ABBIE comes back . Without looking at MARGARET she is turning toward the kitchen . p. 22 PIERCE Abbie ! Reluctantly ABBIE comes back , at first not looking up . Then she raises her eyes . Yes , he told me . ABBIE does not speak or move . Had she seemed unhappy , Abbie ? ABBIE No . No , I had n't noticed anything . PIERCE Abbie ! Do n't shut me out like this ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBIE I know . I know she did . But there 's nothing for me to tell you , Miss Margaret , and it 's hard for me to talk about . I loved her too . I lived with her her whole life long . First the baby I took care of and played with  --  then all the changing with the different years  --  then this  --  A move of her hands towards the closed door . PIERCE Yes  --  then this . Gently . That 's it , Abbie . " This "  --  takes away from all that . Abbie , do you understand it ? If you do , wo n't you help me ? ABBIE I do n't understand it . PIERCE It 's something so  --  outside all the rest . That 's why I ca n't accept it . Something in me just wo n't take it in  --  because it is n't right . I knew her . I know I knew her ! And this  --  Why then I did n't know her . Ca n't you help me ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PIERCE But if you would tell me things you know  --  little things  --  even though they meant nothing to you they might mean something to me . Abbie ! Because you loved her do n't you want what she was to go on living in our hearts ? ABBIE Oh , I do ! I do ! But she 'll go on living in my heart without my understanding what she did . PIERCE But differently . I 'll tell you what I mean . Everything about her has always been  --  herself . That was one of the rare things about her . And herself  --  oh , it 's something you do n't want to lose ! It 's been the beauty in my life . In my busy practical life , Bernice  --  what she was  --  like a breath that blew over my life and  --  made it something . ABBIE I know  --  just what you mean , Miss Margaret . PIERCE It 's inconceivable that she should  --  cut off her own life . In her lived all the life that was behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt it in herself  --  or her eyes could n't have been like that . Could they ? Could they , Abbie ? ABBIE It  --  would n't seem so . PIERCE She would n't destroy so much . Why she never destroyed anything  --  a flower  --  a caterpillar . Do n't you see what I mean , Abbie ? This denies so much . And then is it true that all this time she was n't happy ? Why she seemed happy  --  as trees grow . Did Mr. Norris make her unhappy ? Oh , do n't think you should n't talk about it . Do n't act as if I should n't ask . It 's too big for those little scruples . Abbie ! I ca n't let Bernice 's life go out in darkness . So tell me  --  just what happened  --  each little thing . MAR- GARET has taken hold of ABBIE ; ABBIE has turned away . When did you first know she had  --  taken something ? Just what did she say to you about it ? I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . A step is heard above . p. 24 ABBIE As if saved . Mrs. Kirby 's coming down now . PIERCE I want to talk to you , Abbie , after the others have gone to bed . LAURA comes down , ABBIE passes her at the foot of the stairs , and goes through to the kitchen . LAURA Margaret , what is to be gained in making people feel worse than they need ? Craig upstairs  --  he 's so broken  --  strange . And even Abbie as she passed me now . You seem to do this to them . And why ? PIERCE I do n't do it to them . I 'm not very happy myself . LAURA Of course not . None of us can be that . But I believe we should try to bear things with courage . PIERCE That comes easily from the person who 's bearing little ! LAURA You think it means nothing to me that my brother has lost his wife ? PIERCE Your brother has lost his wife ! That 's all you see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wild  --  so resentful , Margaret . Death should soften us . She takes her old place before the fire . PIERCE Well I can tell you this does n't soften me ! p. 25 LAURA I see that you feel hard toward Craig . But Bernice did n't . You think he should have come right home . But you must be just enough to admit he did n't have any idea Bernice was going to be taken suddenly sick . He had been out of the country for three months , naturally there were things connected with his writing to see about . PIERCE Connected with his writing ! Laura ! Do n't lie about life with death in the next room . If you want to talk at a time like this , have the decency to be honest ! Try to see the truth about living . Craig stayed in New York with May Fredericks  --  and he does n't pretend anything else . Stayed there with May Fredericks , continuing an affair that has been going on for the past year . And before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , all right . That may be all right . I 'm not condemning Craig for his affairs . I 'm condemning you for the front you 're trying to put up ! LAURA I certainly am not trying to put up any front . It 's merely that there seems nothing to be gained in speaking of certain things . If Craig was  --  really unfaithful , I do condemn him for that . I have n't your liberal ideas . Slight pause , she takes up her knitting . It 's unfortunate Bernice had n't the power to hold Craig . PIERCE Had n't the power to hold Craig ! p. 26 LAURA She did n't want to  --  I suppose your scoffing means . Well , she should have wanted to . It 's what a wife should want to do . PIERCE Oh , Laura , Bernice will never say one more word for herself ! In there . Alone . Still . She will not do one new thing to  --  to throw a light back on other things . That 's death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . I can not talk to you about what Bernice " should have been . " What she was came true and deep from  --  Throwing out her hands as if giving up saying it . Taking it up again . It 's true there was something in her Craig did not control . Something he could n't mess up . There was something in her he might have drawn from and become bigger than he was . But he 's vain . He has to be bowling some one over all the time  --  to show that he has power . LAURA I do n't agree with you that Craig is especially vain . He 's a man . He does want to affect  --  yes , dominate the woman he loves . And if Bernice did n't give him that feeling of  --  PIERCE Supremacy . LAURA There 's no use trying to talk with you of personal things . Certainly I do n't want to quarrel tonight . That would not be the thing . In a new tone . How is your work going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but trying to get some one out of prison , I suppose ? p. 27 PIERCE Yes ; I am trying to get out of prison all those people who are imprisoned for ideas . LAURA I see . PIERCE I doubt if you see , Laura . LAURA Well I do n't say I sympathize . But I see . PIERCE No ; for if you did see , you would have to sympathize . If you did see , you would be ashamed ; you would have to  --  hang your head for this thing of locking any man up because of what his mind sees . If thinking is not to become  --  whatever thinking may become !  --  then why are we here at all ? She stops and thinks of it . Why does Bernice  --  her death  --  make that so simple tonight ? Because she was herself . She had the gift for being herself . And she wanted each one to have the chance to be himself . Anything else hurt her  --  as it hurt her to see a dog tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think Bernice was a very good wife for a writer . PIERCE She would have been a wonderful wife for a real writer . LAURA Oh , I know she did n't value Craig 's work . And that 's another thing . And I suppose you do n't value it either . She looks at MARGARET , who does not speak . Fortunately there are many thousands of people in this country who do value it . And I suppose you think what I do of little value too . I suppose you scoff at those things we do to put cripples back in life . p. 28 PIERCE No , Laura , I do n't scoff at anything that can be done for cripples . Since men have been crippled , cripples must be helped . I only say  --  Do n't cripple minds  --  strong free minds that might go  --  we know not where ! Might go into places where the light of a mind has never been . Rising . Think of it ! Think of that chance of making life even greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for life  --  any reverence  --  you have to leave the mind free . I do not scoff at you , but you are not a serious person . You have no faith  --  no hope  --  no self-respect ! LAURA Rising . You tell me I have no self-respect ! You who have not cared what people thought of you  --  who have not had the sense of fitness -- the taste  --  hold the place you were born to  --  you tell me , against whom no word was ever spoken , that I have no self-respect ? PIERCE You have a blameless reputation , Laura . You have no self-respect . If you had any respect for your own mind you could not be willing to limit the mind of any other . If you had any respect for your own spiritual life you could not be willing to push your self into the spiritual life of another . Roughly . No ! You could not . As one seeing far . I see it as I never saw it . Oh I wish I could talk to Bernice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw them . p. 29 LAURA Gathering up the things she had been working with . I will go before I am insulted further . PIERCE There 's nothing insulting in trying to find the truth . Impulsively reaching out her hands to LAURA , as she is indignantly going . Oh , Laura , we die so soon ! We live so in the dark . We never become what we might be . I should think we could help each other more . LAURA After being a moment held . It would have to be done more sympathetically . PIERCE I did n't mean to be unsympathetic . Watching LAURA go up the stairs . I suppose that 's the trouble with me . She stands a moment thinking of this . Then there is something she wants to say . She knows then that she is alone  --  and in this room . Slowly she turns and faces the closed door . Stands so , quite still , realizing . Suddenly turns to the stairway , goes up a few steps . Craig ! Listens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Craig ! LAURA From above . Please do n't disturb Craig , Margaret . MARGARET hesitates , turns to go down . A door opens above . p. 30 NORRIS Did some one call me ? PIERCE I did , Craig . I 'm down here alone  --  lonely . NORRIS As if glad to do so . I 'll come down . After coming . I wanted to come down . I thought Laura was down here . I ca n't pretend  --  not tonight . PIERCE No . I ca n't . I wanted so to talk to Bernice , and when I could n't I  --  called to you . NORRIS I was glad to hear my name . It 's too much alone . He and MARGARET stand there hesitatingly , as if they are not able to do it  --  settle down in this room and talk . CRAIG takes out his cigarette case . In the subdued voice of one whose feeling is somewhere else . You want a cigarette , Margaret ? PIERCE No . I do n't believe so . NORRIS Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernice must have some of the  --  He opens a chest on the mantel , takes from it a beautiful little box . PIERCE As she sees the box . Oh  --  Turning away . Thank you , Craig , but  --  NORRIS Of course . Holds the box for a moment , then slowly replaces it . He looks around the room . Then , helplessly . I do n't know what I 'm going to do . He sits down before the fire . MARGARET also sits . The door at the other side of the room opens and the FATHER comes in from his room . p. 31 MR . ALLEN I was going to bed now . I thought I 'd go in here first . Slowly goes in where Bernice is . A little while CRAIG and MARGARET sit there silent . NORRIS And I do n't know what he 's going to do . Poor old man . Bernice was certainly good to him  --  keeping him happy in that life he made for himself away from life . It 's queer about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he ? Made a fight in his youth , and stopped there . He 's one of the wrecks of the Darwinian theory . Spent himself fighting for it , and  --  let it go at that . Running his hand through his hair . Oh , well , I suppose we 're all wrecks of something . With a nervous laugh . What are you a wreck of , Margaret ? You 're a wreck of free speech . Impatiently . I 'm talking like a fool . I 'm nervous . I 'll be glad when he goes to bed . Looking upstairs . I guess Laura 's gone to bed . After looking into the fire . Well , Bernice is n't leaving any children to  --  be without her . I suppose now it 's just as well we lost our boy before we ever had him . But she would have made a wonderful mother , would n't she , Margaret ? PIERCE Oh , yes ! NORRIS You ever wish you had children , Margaret ? p. 32 PIERCE Yes . NORRIS Roughly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , I do n't just know , Craig . Life  --  seems to get filled up so quickly . NORRIS Yes . And before we know it , it 's all over  --  or as good as over . Funny  --  how your mind jumps around . Just then I thought of my mother . How she used to say : " Now eat your bread , Craig . " His voice breaks , he buries his face in his hands . MARGARET reaches over and puts a hand on his shoulder . The door opens and the FATHER comes out . He stands looking at them . MR . ALLEN Gently . Yes . Of course . I 'm glad you 're here Margaret . But my little girl looks very peaceful , Craig . Pause . She had a happy life . CRAIG moves , turning a little away . MARGARET makes a move as if to shield him , but does not do this . MR . ALLEN Yes ; she had a happy life . Did n't she , Margaret ? PIERCE I always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . In her own way . A calm way , but very full of her own kind of happiness . After reflection . Bernice was good to me . I suppose she might have liked me to have done more things , but  --  she wanted me to do what  --  came naturally to me . I suppose that 's why we always felt so  --  comfortable with her . She was never trying to make us some  --  outside thing . Well  --  you know , Margaret , I can see her now as a baby . She was such a nice baby . She used to  --  reach out her hands . Doing this himself . Well , I suppose they all do . I 'm going to bed . After starting . I 'm glad you 're here with Craig , Margaret . Bernice would like this . You two who know all about her  --  well , no , nobody knew all about Bernice  --  but you two who were closest to her , here now as  --  close as you can be . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-night . NORRIS After the father has closed his door . With violence . " Reached out her hands ! " And what did she get ? Roughly grasping MARGARET 'S wrists . I killed Bernice . There 's no use in your saying I did n't . I did . Only  --  Letting go of herdo n't flay me tonight , Margaret . I could n't stand it tonight . With another abrupt change . Am I a fool ? Why did I never know Bernice loved me like this ? In anguish . Why would n't I know it ? Pause . We do n't know anything about each other . Do we , Margaret ? Nothing . We never  --  get anywhere . Shivering . I 'm cold . I wonder if there 's anything to drink in the house . There must be something . He goes out into the kitchen ; after a moment there is the sound of running water ; he comes in with a bottle of whiskey , a pitcher of water . I do n't see the glasses . Things seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting she will go and get them ; she does not ; he goes out again . From the kitchen . Margaret , have you any idea where the glasses are ? PIERCE No , Craig . I do n't know . After hearing him moving things around . Is n't Abbie somewhere there ? p. 34 NORRIS No ; she is n't here . She seems to have gone outdoors . She 's left the door open too . No wonder it was cold . Calling at an outer door . Abbie ! Sound of the door closing . Again the sound of dishes being moved . Well , I do n't know where they can have put  --  PIERCE Covering her face . Do n't look for things . More quietly . Bring anything , Craig , there must be something there . NORRIS Coming in with cups . Things have been moved around . I stumbled over things that did n't used to be there . You 'll have a little , Margaret ? It  --  we need something . PIERCE I do n't  --  oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , NORRIS Abruptly shoving his cup away . Margaret , I loved Bernice . I suppose you do n't believe that ! And I thought Bernice knew I loved her , in spite of  --  other things . What do you think it is is the matter with me , Margaret , that I  --  Saying it as if rawmiss things . You can tell me . I 'd be glad to feel some one knew . Only  --  do n't leave me alone while you 're telling me ! p. 35 PIERCE I 'm afraid I have nothing to tell you , Craig . I thought I knew Bernice . And now  --  I did know Bernice ! Gropingly . I feel something we do n't get to . NORRIS And Bernice ca n't help us . PIERCE I think she would expect us to  --  find our way . She could always find her way . She had not meant to leave us here . Bernice was so kind . NORRIS She was kind . PIERCE Such a sensitive kindness . The kindness that divined feeling and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thing she would not do . NORRIS Slowly , as if feeling his way . Margaret , I wish I could tell you about me and Bernice . I loved her . She loved me . But there was something in her that had almost nothing to do with our love . PIERCE Yes . NORRIS Well , that is n't right , Margaret . You want to feel that you have the woman you love . Yes  --  completely . Yes , every bit of her ! PIERCE So you turned to women whom you could have . NORRIS Yes . PIERCE But you " had " all of them simply because there was less to have . You want no baffling sense of something beyond you . He looks at her reproachfully . You wanted me to help you find the truth . I do n't believe you can stand truth , Craig . p. 36 NORRIS It 's hard tonight . PIERCE Intensely . But perhaps it is tonight or not at all . It 's a strange thing this has done . A light trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light tries to do this . Craig , why do you write the things you do ? NORRIS Oh , Margaret , is this any time to talk of work ? PIERCE It seems to be . Tonight it 's all part of the same thing . Laura and I were talking of work  --  quarreling about it : you were talking of Bernice 's father . The light  --  just goes there . That poor sad old man  --  why did n't he go on ? You said he was a wreck of the Darwinian theory . Then me  --  a wreck of free speech . NORRIS Oh I did n't mean you were , Margaret . PIERCE But I might be . I can see that . We give ourselves in fighting for a thing that seems important and in that fight we get out of the flow of life . We had meant it to deepen the flow  --  but we get caught . I know people like that . People who get at home in their fight  --  and stay there  --  and are left there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many nights Bernice and I have sat in this room and talked of things ! And I had thought  --  With sudden angry passion . If you had been good to her , she would be in this room now . After a look at him . I 'm sorry . But can I help feeling it ? p. 37 NORRIS I did n't know . PIERCE No ; you did n't know . We do n't know . When you think what a writer might do for life  --  for we do n't know . You write so well , Craig , but  --  what of it ? What is it is the matter with you  --  with all you American writers  --  ' most all of you . A well-put-up light  --  but it does n't penetrate anything . It never makes the fog part . Just shows itself off  --  a well-put-up light . Growing angry . It would be better if we did n't have you at all ! Ca n't you see that it would ? Lights which  --  only light themselves keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After thinking . Craig , as you write these things are there never times when you sit there dumb and know that you are glib and empty ? NORRIS Did you ever try to write , Margaret ? PIERCE No . NORRIS I suppose you think it 's very simple to be real . I suppose you think we could do it  --  if we just wanted to do it . Try it . You try . PIERCE So you do this just to cover the fact that you ca n't do anything ? Your skill  --  a mask for your lack of power ? NORRIS I should think you 'd want to be good to me tonight , Margaret . p. 38 PIERCE Be good to you ! Keep you from seeing . That 's the way we 're good to each other . There 's only one thing I could do for you tonight , Craig . You do n't want that . So  --  Moves as if to rise . NORRIS No , do n't go away . My brain wo n't keep still either . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , why do you think it is I  --  miss things  --  never get anywhere ? PIERCE I do n't know . And it 's true of all of us . Of me too . I do things that to me seem important , and yet I just do them  --  I do n't get to the thing I 'm doing them for  --  to life itself . I do n't simply and profoundly get to life . Bernice did . NORRIS Yes . Bernice did . PIERCE And yet you had to  --  shy away from Bernice . Into a smaller world that could be all your world . No , Craig , you have n't power . It 's true . And for one hour in our lives let 's try to  --  Those love affairs of yours  --  they 're like your false writing  --  to keep yourself from knowing you have n't power . Did you ever see a child try to do a thing  --  fail  --  then turn to something he could do and make a great show of doing that ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudely . Well , why have n't I power ? If you are going to be any good to me  --  tell me that . p. 39 PIERCE Shaking her head . I ca n't tell you that . I have n't any light that  --  goes there . But is n't it true ? Is n't your life this long attempt to appear effective  --  to persuade yourself that you are something ? What a way to spend the little time there is for living . NORRIS I fancy it 's the way most lives are spent . PIERCE That only makes it infinitely sadder . NORRIS As if he can stay in this no longer . As to writing , Margaret , the things that interest you would n't interest most people . PIERCE " Would n't interest most people ! " Oh , Craig , do n't slide away from that one honest moment . Say you have n't got it . Do n't say they would n't want it . Why , if now  --  in this our day  --  our troubled day of many shadows  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted places  --  would n't want it ? I wish some one could try them ! No , Craig , they all have their times of suspecting their lives are going by in a fog . They 're pitifully anxious for a little light . Why  --  they continue to look to writers . You know , Craig , what living makes of us  --  it 's a rim  --  a bounded circle  --  and yet we know  --  have our times of suspecting  --  that if we could break through that . Seeing . O-h . It 's like living in the mountains  --  those high vast places of Colorado  --  in a little house with shaded windows . You 'd suspect what was there ! A little sunshine through the cracks  --  mountain smells  --  and at times the house would shake  --  and you 'd wonder  --  and be fretted in your little room . And if some day you could put up the shade and  --  see where you were . Life would never be so small a thing again . Bernice could do that . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . That was what  --  PIERCE Hurt your vanity ? NORRIS I do n't know . I 'm trying to be honest . I honestly do n't know . PIERCE No . We do n't know . That 's why  --  oh , Craig , it would be so wonderful to be a writer  --  something that gets a little farther than others can get  --  gets at least the edge of the shadow . After her own moment on the edge of the shadow . If you ever felt the shock of reality , and got that back in you  --  you would n't be thinking of whom it would " interest " ! But , Craig  --  this . A movement toward the closed room . Does n't this give you that shock of reality ? NORRIS What of you ? Does n't it give it to you ? You 're speaking as if this had n't happened ! You leave it out  --  what Bernice did because of me . You 're talking of my having no power . What of this ? Had I no power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know I used it terribly  --  plenty of years for my heart to break over that . But can you say I did n't have it ? PIERCE I do leave it out . It is n't right there should be anything in Bernice not Bernice . And she had a great rightness  --  rightness without effort  --  that rare , rare thing . p. 41 NORRIS You say it is n't right  --  and so you leave it out ? And then you talk about the shock of reality . PIERCE I do n't say it is n't fact . I say it is n't  --  in the rightness . NORRIS " In the rightness ! " Is that for you to say ? Is rightness what you think ? What you can see ? No . You did n't know Bernice . You did n't know she loved me  --  that way . And I did n't know . But she did ! How could I have had that  --  and not known ? But I did have it ! I did have it ! You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Bernice did n't want  --  the whole of life . She wanted me . He goes to the door , bows against it , all sorrow and need . I want to talk to her  --  not you . I want her now  --  knowing . He opens that door and goes in to Bernice . MARGARET stands motionless , searching , and as if something is coming to her from the rightness . When she speaks it is a denial from that inner affirmation . PIERCE No ! I say  --  No ! Feeling some one behind her , swiftly turning she sees ABBIE outside , looking through the not quite drawn curtains of the door . She goes to the door and draws ABBIE in . Yes , I am here  --  and I say no . She has hold of her , drawing her in as she says it . You understand  --  I say no . I do n't believe it . What you told me  --  I do n't believe it . p. 42 ABBIE At first it is horror  --  then strange relief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Well , I 'm glad you know . PIERCE Very slowly , knowing now it is fact she has come to . Glad I know what ? ABBIE That it is n't true . That she did n't do it . PIERCE Did n't do it ? Did not take her own life ? ABBIE No . Of course she did n't . PIERCE Still very slowly , as if much more is coming than she can take in . Then why  --  did you say she did ? ABBIE Because she said I must . Oh  --  look at me ! Look at me ! But you knew her . You know the strength of her . If she 'd told you the way she told me  --  you 'd have done it too . You would ! PIERCE Saying each word by itself . I can not understandone word you 're saying . Something is wrong with you . Changing , and roughly taking hold of ABBIE . Tell me . Quick , the truth . ABBIE Wednesday night , about eight o'clock , about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why , Abbie , I believe I 'm going to die . " I said no , but she said , " I think so . " I said we 'd send for Mr. Norris . She said no , and not to frighten her father . I  --  I did n't think she was going to die . All the time I was trying to get the doctor . There were two hours when she was  --  quiet . Quiet  --  not like any quiet I ever knew . Thinking . You could see thinking in her eyes  --  stronger than sickness . Then , after ten , she called me to her . She took my hands . She said , " Abbie , you 've lived with me all my life . " " Yes , " I said . " You love me . " " Oh , yes , " I said . " Will you do something for me ? " " You know I will , " I told her . " Abbie , " she said , looking right at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I die , I want you to tell my husband I killed myself . " MARGARET falls back . Yes , I did that too . Then I thought it was her mind . But I looked at her , and oh , her mind was there ! It was terrible  --  how it was all there . She said  --  and then she The sobs she has been holding back almost keep ABBIE from saying this  --  held out her hands to me  --  " Oh , Abbie , do this last thing for me ! After all there has been , I have a right to do it . If my life is going  --  let me have this much from it ! " And as still I could n't  --  could n't  --  the tears ran down her face and she said , " I want to rest before pain comes again . Promise me so I can rest . " And I promised . And you would have too ! p. 43 PIERCE You do n't know what you 're telling me ! You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  aftershe can do nothing ? Holding out her hands . Abbie ! Tell me it is n't true ! ABBIE It 's true . PIERCE You are telling me her life was hate ? Stops , half turns to the room where CRAIG is with Bernice . You are telling me she covered hate with  --  with the beauty that was like nothing else ? Abbie ! You are telling me that as Bernice left life she held out her hands and asked you to take this back for her ? ABBIE There are things we ca n't understand . There 's no use trying . She turns to go . PIERCE You ca n't leave me like this ! ABBIE More gently . You should n't have tried to know . But  --  if you have got to know things  --  you have got to take them . CRAIG comes out ; ABBIE goes . NORRIS Go in there , Margaret . There 's something wonderful there . PIERCE Turned from him , her face buried in her hands . Oh no  --  no  --  no . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in there . Her other words are lost in wild sobbing . He stands regarding her in wonder , but not losing what he himself has found. @x The same as in Acts One and Two ; it is early afternoon of the next day ; the door leading out-doors is a little open ; when the curtain is drawn CRAIG is seen outside , just passing the window , as one who is walking back and forth in thinking . In the room are LAURA and the FATHER  --  the FATHER sitting at the table by the stairs  --  LAURA , standing , watches CRAIG pass the door ; she has in her hand a paper on which are some memoranda . After watching CRAIG she sighs , looks at her notes , sits down . LAURA I 'm sorry to be troubling you , Mr. Allen . Certainly you should not be asked to discuss these matters about  --  arrangements . But really , you and I seem the only people who are capable of going on with things . I must say , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trying to  --  keep away from one . I think that 's a little unnecessary . Of course I know what grief does , and I 'm sure I have every consideration for that , but really  --  I 'm sorry Craig keeps his own sister out . When I 'm here to help him . And Abbie  --  why she seems to have lost her head . Just when it 's so important that she look after things . And as to Margaret Pierce  --  she certainly is worse than useless . I do n't see what she came for if she did n't want to be helpful . p. 46 MR . ALLEN Margaret and Bernice were very dear friends , Laura . LAURA Is that any reason for not being helpful in Bernice 's household at a time like this ? Really I do like control . After looking at her notes . Then the minister will come here at three , Mr. Allen . Why that will be little more than an hour ! Think of things having been neglected like this ! As CRAIG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Craig ! He steps to the door . The minister , Mr. Howe , will come here , Craig , at three . NORRIS What for ? LAURA Craig ! What for ? NORRIS I do n't see why he comes here . Why Bernice scarcely knew him . To her father . Did Bernice know him ? MR . ALLEN Well , I do n't know whether she knew him , but  --  LAURA It is not a personal matter , Craig . NORRIS I think it is . Very personal . LAURA You mean to say you are not going to have any service ? NORRIS I have n't thought anything about it . Oh , Laura ! How can I think of such things now ? p. 47 LAURA Well , I will think of them for you , dear . NORRIS Do n't bring him here . He can go  --  STOPSthere , if he wants to . Where  --  we have to go . Not here . In her own house . The very last thing . MR . ALLEN I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do I care if it seems strange ? Bernice seemed strange too . But she was n't strange . She was wonderful . Putting out his hand impatiently . Oh , no , Laura . There 's so much else to think of  --  now . He steps out of the door and stands there , his back to the room . MR . ALLEN In a low voice . I wonder  --  could we go somewhere else ? Into my room , perhaps . I 'm afraid we are keeping Craig out of here . And I think he wants to be here  --  near Bernice . We will be undisturbed in my room . He gets up and goes to the door of his room , LAURA turns to follow . Outside CRAIG passes from sight . LAURA I think it 's too bad things have to be made so  --  complicated . MR . ALLEN After opening the door . Oh , Margaret is in here . p. 48 PIERCE From the other room . I was just going out . I just came in here to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think about it being your room . MR . ALLEN Why that was quite all right , Margaret . I 'm only sorry to disturb you . PIERCE No . That does n't matter . I  --  was n't doing anything . LAURA There is a great deal to do . She follows the FATHER into his room . MARGARET walks across the room , walks back , stands still , head bent , hands pressing her temples . ABBIE comes part way down the stairs , sees MARGARET , stands still as if not to be heard , turns to go back upstairs . PIERCE Hearing her , looking up . Abbie ! ABBIE comes slowly down . Where is he , Mr. Norris ? Where is he ? ABBIE I do n't know . He was here a little while ago . Perhaps he went out . Indicating the open door . PIERCE I have to tell him ! ABBIE After an incredulous moment . Tell him what you made me tell you ? p. 49 PIERCE Of course I have to tell him ! You think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him  --  they were not just . ABBIE And you 'd rather be " just " than leave it as she wanted it ? PIERCE Oh , but Abbie  --  what she wanted  --  Holds up her hand as if to shut something from her eyes . No . You ca n't put that on anyone . I could n't live  --  feeling I had left on him what should n't be there . ABBIE But you would n't tell him now ? PIERCE I must tell him now . Or I wo n't tell him . And I must go away . I ca n't stay . I ca n't stay here . ABBIE But what will they think  --  your leaving ? You mean  --  before we 've taken her away ? PIERCE Oh , I do n't know . How can I  --  plan it out ? I 'm going as soon as I can tell him . All night  --  all day  --  I 've been trying to tell him  --  and when I get near him  --  I run away . Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what you were n't to know ? But if you have some way of knowing what you are n't told  --  you think you have the right to do your thing with that ? Undo what she did ? What I did ? Do you know what it took out of me to do this ? There 's nothing left of me. p. 50 PIERCE With a laugh . Right on the verge of being not herself . No . You 're a wreck . Another wreck . It 's your Darwinian theory . Your free speech . ABBIE Oh , I was afraid of you . I did n't want you to come . I knew you 'd  --  get to things . ABBIE goes to the door and looks out . PIERCE He is out there ? ABBIE Yes . MARGARET tries to go ; moves just a little . And you 'd go to him and  --  what for ? PIERCE Because I ca n't live  --  leaving that on him  --  having him think  --  when I know he did n't . I ca n't leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to block her going . And when you take that from him  --  what do you give to him ? They stare at one another ; MARGARET falls back . PIERCE Do n't ask me to see so many things , Abbie . I can only see this thing . I 've grown afraid of seeing . ABBIE After looking at her , seeing something of her suffering . Miss Margaret , why did you do what you did last night ? How did you know ? p. 51 PIERCE I do n't know . ABBIE But you knew . PIERCE No . I did n't know . I did n't know . It did n't come from me . It came  --  from the rightness . A laugh . ABBIE If you could get that without being told  --  why do n't you get more without being told ? MARGARET gives her a startled look . For you will never be told . PIERCE You know more ? ABBIE No . My knowing stops with what you got from me last night . But I knew her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what you are n't told , you could  --  see into this . See . PIERCE I 've lost my seeing . It was through her I saw . It was through Bernice I could see . And now it 's dark . Slowly turning toward the closed room . Oh , how still death is . The two women are as if caught into this stillness . ABBIE Looking from the door . He turned this way . Swiftly turning back to MARGARET . But you could n't tell him . PIERCE No , I ca n't . Yes , I must ! I tell you there 's something in me ca n't stand it to see any one go down under a thing he should n't have to bear . Why that feeling has made my life ! Do you think I 've wanted to do the kind of work I do ? Do n't you think I 'd like to be doing  --  happier things ? But there 's something in my blood drives me to  --  what 's right . p. 52 ABBIE And something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went against it  --  went against my whole life  --  so she could rest . I did it because I loved her . But you did n't love her . PIERCE Oh  --  Abbie ! ABBIE Not as you love  --  what 's right . If you loved her , do n't you want to protect her  --  now that she lies dead in there ? Her voice breaking . Oh , Miss Margaret , it was right at the very end of her life . Maybe when we 're going to die things we 've borne all our lives are things we ca n't bear any longer . Just  --  do n't count that last hour . PIERCE After a moment of being swayed by this . Yet you counted it , Abbie . You did what she said  --  because of the strength of her . You told me last night  --  her mind was there . Terrible the way it was right there . She had n't left her life . ABBIE Well , and if she had n't left her life ! If all those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to feel  --  what she did n't feel . She did it well , did n't she ?  --  and almost to the last . Sha n't we hide it now ? For her ? You and me , who loved her  --  is n't she safe  --  with us ? Going nearer MARGARET . Perhaps if you would go in there now  --  p. 53 PIERCE Oh no  --  no . ABBIE In a last deeply emotional appeal . Miss Margaret , did n't she do a good deal for you ? PIERCE Do a good deal for me ? Yes . Yes ! ABBIE Yes . She did for me . I  --  I 'm something more on account of her . Are n't you ? PIERCE Yes . ABBIE Yes , I think you are too . I can see myself as I 'd have been if my life had n't been lived round her . Thinks , shakes her head . It would be left you  --  what feels and knows it feels . And you said it was through Bernice you could see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ! On account of what we are that we would n't have been  --  lets put it out of our minds ! One ugly thing in a whole beautiful life ! Let it go ! And let all the rest live ! They can see CRAIG outside . Oh  --  do this for her . Make yourself do it . Let that be what 's dead  --  and let all the rest live ! You were her friend not his . CRAIG turns to the house , but when about to come in , turns away , covering his face . PIERCE Taking hold of ABBIE . You see ? He thinks she loved him and he killed her . He might do what he thinks she did ! p. 54 ABBIE Falling back . O-h . CRAIG comes in , stands by the door ; MARGARET has drawn ABBIE over near the stairway . He sees them , but gives no heed to them , immersed in what he is living through . While he stands there MARGARET does not move . He turns toward the room where Bernice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  his back is to her ; ABBIE moves to step between CRAIG and MARGARET ; MARGARET puts her aside . But when CRAIG comes to the closed door , and stands there an instant before it , not opening it , MARGARET too stops , as if she can not come nearer him . It is only after he has opened the door and closed it behind him that she goes to it . She puts out her hands , but she does not even touch the door and when she can not do this she covers her face and , head bent , stands there before the closed door . LAURA and the FATHER come out from the room where they have been . As they enter ABBIE slowly goes out , toward the kitchen . LAURA After looking at MARGARET , who has not moved . We are going in an hour , MARGARET . PIERCE Going ? LAURA Taking Bernice to the cemetery . PIERCE Oh . Are we ? After a look which shows her disapproval LAURA goes out , following ABBIE. p. 55 MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret . PIERCE No . MARGARET sits in the window seat , by which she has been standing . As if she is just realizing what they have said . You say  --  we are taking Bernice away from here  --  in an hour ? MR . ALLEN Yes . Think of it , Margaret . I just ca n't  --  take it in . PIERCE No . MR . ALLEN There is something I want to tell you , Margaret . MARGARET gives him a quick look , then turns away , as if afraid . I 've been wanting to tell you  --  but it 's hard to talk of such things . But before we  --  take Bernice away , before you  --  see her the last time  --  I want you to know . That night  --  the night Bernice died  --  at the very last , Abbie was afraid then  --  and had called to me . Abbie and I were in there and  --  Abbie went out , about the telephone call we had in for the doctor . I was all alone in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one last word , Margaret . Your name . PIERCE She called to me ? MR . ALLEN No , I would n't say she called to you . Just said your name . The way we say things to ourselves  --  say them without knowing we were going to say them . She did n't really say it . She breathed it . It seemed to come from her whole life . p. 56 PIERCE O-h . Then it was n't as if she had left me ? It was n't as if anything was in between  --  MR . ALLEN Why no , Margaret . What an idea . Why I do n't think you ever were as close to Bernice as when she said your name and died . MARGARET 'S head goes down ; she is crying . CRAIG comes out , carefully closing the door behind him . Partly crosses the room , looks uncertainly at the outer door as if to go outside again . MR . ALLEN Sit down , Craig . CRAIG does this . Let 's not try to keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing  --  in our  --  our different ways . A pause . MARGARET raises her head ; she is turned a little away from the other two . I was so glad when you came , Margaret . I do n't want Bernice to slip away from us . In an hour we  --  take her away from here  --  out of this house she loved . I do n't want her to slip away from us . She loved you so , Margaret . Did n't she , Craig ? NORRIS Yes . She did love Margaret . MR . ALLEN Oh , yes . " Margaret sees things , " she 'd say . Wistfully . She had great beauty  --  did n't she , Margaret ? PIERCE I always thought so . p. 57 MR . ALLEN Oh , yes . I was thinking last night  --  malice was not in Bernice . I never knew her to do a  --  really unfriendly thing to any one . Again in that wistful way . You know , Margaret , I had thought you would say things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to  --  to keep my little girl for us all . I suppose I 'm a foolish old man but I seem to want them said . Pause . MARGARET seems to try to speak , but does not . I think it was gentle of Bernice to be amused by things she  --  perhaps could n't admire in us she loved . Me . I suppose she might have liked a father who amounted to more  --  but she always seemed to take pleasure in me . Affectionate amusement . Did n't you feel that in Bernice , Craig ? NORRIS Yes  --  that was one thing . A surface for other things . He speaks out of pain , but out of pain which wants , if it can , to speak . But only a surface . With passion . All of Bernice went into her love for me . Those big impersonal things  --  they were not apart . All of Bernice  --  loved me . His voice breaks , he goes to the door , starts out . Suddenly steps back  --  with a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret ? PIERCE I can see  --  what you mean , Craig . p. 58 MR . ALLEN Why of course Bernice loved you . I know that . CRAIG goes outside . Looking after him . I hope I did n't send Craig away . You and he would rather not talk . Perhaps that is better . I seem to want to  --  gather up things that will keep Bernice . It 's so easy for the dead to slip from us . But I must n't bother you . PIERCE Oh , you are n't ! I  --  I 'm sorry I 'm not  --  doing more . I 'm pulled down . MR . ALLEN I know , Margaret . I can see that . Another time you and I will talk of Bernice . I did n't mean she did n't love Craig . Of course not . Only HesitatinglyI did feel that much as went into her loving  --  there was more than went into her loving . PIERCE Yes . MR . ALLEN I think it was n't that she  --  wanted it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  very witsful in Bernice . MARGARET looks at him , nods . In this calm now  --  I feel the wistfulness there was in her other calm . PIERCE Yes . MR . ALLEN As if she wanted to give us more . Oh  --  she gave more than any one else could have given . But not all she was . And she would like to have given us  --  all she was . She wanted to give  --  what could n't be given . Pause . You know what I mean , Margaret ? p. 59 PIERCE Yes , I do know . MR . ALLEN And so  --  wistfulness . I see it now . After thinking . I think Bernice feared she was not a very good wife for Craig . MARGARET gives him a startled look . Little things she 'd say . I do n't know  --  perhaps I 'm wrong . After a move of MARGARET 'S . You were going to say something , Margaret . PIERCE No . I was just thinking of what you said . MR . ALLEN Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault it was . I do n't know that it was anyone 's fault . Just the way things were . He  --  I say it in all kindness , he just did n't  --  have it in him . Slowly . As I have n't had certain things in me . ABBIE comes in . ABBIE People are coming . The Aldrichs  --  other neighbors . MR . ALLEN Oh  --  they are coming ? With pain . Already ? Oh . They are to wait in the south room  --  till a little later . I 'll speak to them . They go out ; MARGARET has a moment alone . Then CRAIG comes in from outside . NORRIS People are beginning to come . I suppose they 'll come in here soon . I  --  I do n't want them to . LAURA enters with boxes of flowers.Oh  --  Laura , please . Bernice loved flowers . p. 60 LAURA Well  --  Craig . NORRIS Would you take them around the other way ? Or keep them till later  --  or something . I do n't want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want things to be different . Not now  --  in the last hour . It 's still Bernice 's house . After watching her a moment . Margaret , I 'm afraid I should n't have told you . It 's doing too much to you . Surely  --  no matter what you feel about me  --  this  --  what I told you  --  is n't going to keep you away from Bernice ? PIERCE No , Craig . What you told me  --  is n't going to do that . NORRIS I should n't have told you . But there are things  --  too much to be alone with . And yet  --  we are alone with them . He is seated , looking out toward the woods . Very slowly  --  with deep feeling . It is a different world . Life will never be  --  that old thing again . PIERCE Rising . Craig ! He looks at her . Craig , I must tell you  --  She does not go on . NORRIS After waiting an instant , looks away . I know . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't say things . p. 61 PIERCE But I must say them . I have to tell you  --  life need not be a different thing . NORRIS Need not ? You think I want that old thing back ? Pretending . Fumbling . Always trying to seem something  --  to feel myself something . No . That 's a strange thing for you to say , Margaret  --  that I can go back to my make-believe , now that I 've got to life . This  --  As if he can not speak of itthis  --  even more than it makes me want to die it makes me want to  --  Oh , Margaret , if I could have Bernice now  --  knowing . And yet  --  I never had her until now . This  --  has given Bernice to me . PIERCE As if his words are a light she is almost afraid to use . This  --  has given Bernice to you ? NORRIS I was thinking  --  walking out there I was thinking , if I knew only  --  what I knew when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have got past that failure . PIERCE Failure , Craig ? NORRIS Of never having had her . That she had lived and loved me  --  loved me , you see  --  lived and loved me and died without my ever having had her . What would there have been to go on living for ? Why should such a person go on living ? Now  --  of course it is another world . This comes crashing through my make-believe  --  and Bernice 's world get to me . Do n't you see , Margaret ? p. 62 PIERCE Perhaps  --  I do . She looks at the closed door ; looks back to him . Waits . O-h . Waits again , and it grows in her . Perhaps I do . Turns and very slowly goes to the closed door , opens it , goes in . At the other side of the room ABBIE comes in with a floral piece . NORRIS No , ABBIE . I just told my sister  --  I do n't want this room to be different . Looking around . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sees the pillow crowded in at the side of the fireplace . Restores it to its place in the window . ABBIE And this was here . She returns the vase to its place . NORRIS Of course it was . But it is n't right yet . After considering . Why  --  the tea table ! ABBIE turns toward the kitchen . What did you put it out there for ? I remember now  --  I stumbled against it last night . They bring it in . Why , yes , Abbie , the tea table was always here  --  before the fire . ABBIE And  --  She hesitates , but CRAIG follows her eyes to the chair . p. 63 NORRIS Yes . He too hesitates ; then gives the chair its old place before the table , as if awaiting the one who will come and pour tea . A moment they stand looking at it . Then CRAIG looks around the room . And what is it is still wrong , Abbie ? ABBIE In the fall there were always branches in that vase . Indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and yellow branches from outside . NORRIS Yes . He goes out . With feeling which she can not quite control ABBIE does a few little things at the tea-table , relating one thing to another until it is as it used to be . MARGARET comes out from the room where she has been with Bernice , leaving the door wide open behind her . With the quiet of profound wonder ; in a feeling that creates the great stillness , she goes to ABBIE . PIERCE Oh  --  Abbie . Yes  --  I know now . I want you to know . Only  --  there are things not for words . Feeling  --  not for words . As a throbbing thing that flies and sings  --  not for the hand . She starts to close her hand , uncloses it . But , Abbie  --  there is nothing to hide . There is no shameful thing . What you saw in her eyes as she brooded over life in leaving it  --  what made you afraid  --  was her seeing  --  her seeing into the shadowed places of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift to the spirit . A gift sent back through the dark . Preposterous . Profound . Oh  --  love her Abbie ! She 's worth more love than we have power to give ! CRAIG has come back with some branches from the trees ; he stands outside the door a moment , taking out a few he does not want . MARGARET hears him and turns . Then turns back . Power . Oh , how strange . CRAIG comes in , and MARGARET and ABBIE watch him as he puts the bright leaves in the vase . The FATHER comes in. p. 64 MR . ALLEN The man who is in charge says we will have to be ready now to  --  Seeing what has been done to the room . Oh , you have given the room back to Bernice ! PIERCE Given everything back to Bernice . Bernice . Insight . The tenderness of insight . And the courage . To the FATHER , and suddenly with tears in her voice . She was wistful . And held out her hands Doing thiswith gifts she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved you Craig . NORRIS I know that , Margaret . I know now how much . PIERCE Low . And more than that . Her voice electric . Oh , in all the world  --  since first life moved  --  has there been any beauty like the beauty of perceiving love ? No . Not for words . She closes her hand , uncloses it in a slight gesture of freeing what she would not harm .
