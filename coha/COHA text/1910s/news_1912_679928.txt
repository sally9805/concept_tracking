txt " I do n't want to go free and I do n't want to go to the Poor House . I simply want to go to Clinton Prison for five years , and by then I may be dead , " said Charles Bartlett , SS years old , before Judge Edward Swann in General Sessions yesterday after he had pleaded guilty of attempted forgery in the second degree . Bartlett entered the store of W. &; J. Sloane , dealers in carpets , at 804 Broadway , on Jan. 27 and ordered two expensive rugs , giving in payment a check for $2,123 , signed by W. B. Bennett and drawn ' on a Pittsburgh bank . He then went directly to Police Headquarters and gave himself up . When arraigned in court yesterday the aged prisoner said he was ready to plead guilty of forgery , but Judge Swann would not allow him to do so , and then Franklin Grier , the prisoner 's counsel , said he would plead guilty to attempted forgery in the second degree for his client . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five years ' , as he figures that he will die in that length of time , " said the lawyer . " He says all his friends are there . " " Yes , that is right , " interrupted the aged " I do want to go there ; it will take me out of temptation and protect society . " " A very remarkable case , " commented Judge Swann ; " tell me about yourself . " " Well , about forty-two years ago I was swindled out of all that I had-428,000  --  and have devoted the rest of my life to swindling swindlers to advertise them . I did not try to swindle the Sloanes ; I simply wanted to get back into prison . " At this point the Grand Jury filed in and Judge Swann said : " Gentlemen , here is a very remarkable case . This old man has pleaded guilty to a crime , and wants to go back to Clinton Prison , and I do n't want him to go to prison . What shall I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that they were of the opinion that the prisoner should be sent where he desired to go . " Do you wish to say anything more ? " asked Judge Swann , again turning to the old man . " Yes , -I was born in Wayne . County , Penn. , and my brothers were all lawyers , and my own son , who died at the age of 60 , was a respected man . I invested all my money in a New Jersey land deal and was swindled out of it . I had earned this money in the publishing business , and then I decilled to swindle other people myself . " Judge Swann handed the old ' man a slip of paper and told him to read it aloud , and holding the paper far from him , and without the aid of glasses , the prisoner read this : " The criminal record of Charles Bartlett , aged 88 : 1870 , Brooklyn , grand larceny , the penitentiary ; 1872 , Sing Sing , 5 years , grand larceny ; 1880 , Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State prison . 7 years , forgery ; 1902 , Boston , forgery , 8 years ; 1908 , New York , forgery , 3 years , Clinton Prison . " ' Yes , that is my record . A church has offered to give me a home , but I do n't want it , for I am not good enough , and it would reflect on the church . I do n't want to go to the poorhouse , because there you have to have a Nell-filled illed pocketbook to net along . I wo n't say that I have been o good , for I was in my day . " I was a canvasser , and one rainy day in the Winter I vas in my little room in the Bowery with but thirty-six cents to my name . I went outside and , saw two men eating frozen apples which they had picked from a garbage can , and I thought to myself : ' I must commit suicide or come to that . ' " I am an immortalist and believe in the soul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide and that decided me . I knew how the Sloanes did business , and made up my mind to ' forge a big check , so as to be sure of arrest . I wanted to go to Clinton Prison again , and still Gant to go there . I am an old man . I want free use of the prison library , so that I can read and study and think . Please send me there . " " All right , I will do so , " said Judge Swann , " but if at any time you desire to come out , write to me and I will communicate with the Governor and ' obtain your release . " " Do n't worry about that , your Honor . All the friends I have left in this world are in Clinton Prison , and I will never change my mind . " The old criminal thereupon was sentenced to serve five years , and gave a sigh of apparent relief as he shuffled out of sight . AUTO HITS WOMAN , GOES ON .
