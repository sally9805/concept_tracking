Dickens looms large in the holiday lists , owing , no doubt , to the approaching centenary . As elaborate an edition of any of his novels as we can recall for the general public is Dutton 's " Pickwick " ( $7 50 net ) , in two volumes of nearly full quarto size , in natural linen and gold , and with 123 illustrations by Cecil Aldin , of which twenLy-four are colored plates .

THE MAKER OF ITALY . The Life and Times of Cavour . By William Roscoe Thayer . With illustrations and maps . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. $7.50 net . ' This is the most important work upon the making of modern Italy which has been published in English , and the most complete critical study of Cavour which has appeared in any langtage . Italian Risorgimento history , 1815-1870 , - divides itself into two periods which overlap each , , wother . The first , of which lVfaz-zini was the prophet and ' Garibaldi the hero , is an uninterrupted story of con- spiracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this has hitherto proved the most attractive to the historian . The second , period is that of social and economic reforms , of education in parlia ? mentary government , and of keen participation in the struggles of European diplomacy and in the wars of the great Powers , the period in which the solid foundations of the Kingdom of Italy were laboriously laid and in which the education of Italians in the duties of citizenship in a free country was begun . This work of national regeneration was initiated by Piedmont and was extended through her , not by conquest but by consent , to all the other parts of Italy ; and its success was due in an extraordinary degree to the genius and labors of one man , Count Camillo Benso di Cavour . Italy owes more to him than America owes to Washington or Germany to Bismarck , and his biography , which Mr. Thayer has now given with a master 's hand , of necessity embraces the complete history of the early years of this constructive period . The student who would understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic forces through which , with steadily increasing vigor , it contributes to the world 's progress  --  and Italy 's power for good is far from being justly recognized in America  --  must first decipher the history of these vital years of her formation . Twenty years ago Mr. Thayer published two volumes on the earlier period of Italian history , 1815-1849 , under the title , " The Dawn of Italian Independence , " and since then he has been continuously engaged in the preparation of the present work upon the years 18501861 . There are no traces of haste in the work ; on the contrary , it is not too much to say that it is characterized throughout by a maturity of judgment which among writers on the Risorgi ? mento in English is to be found only in the works of Contessa Martinengo Cesaresco No Italian since Chiala has studied Cavour 's own writings in twenty-five and more volumes with equal appreciation and thoroughness . Mr. Thayer is completely saturated with Cavour 's thought ; Cavour 's ideals are his ideals ; Cavour 's methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at times , in the light of published evidence to which the great statesman in his own day had no access , Mr. Thayer is more Cavourian than Cavour himself . He has vividly reproduced the Italian spirit of the time with its clash of systems , its rapidly maturing ideals of constitutional liberty and independence , its conflict of parties , and its readiness for heroic sacrifice . He has followed with particular minuteness the intricacies of European diplomacy in which Cavour was the master mind from 1858 to 1861 ; the Italian question was a European question , Italy was the storm centre of the period , and Mr. Thayer 's analysis of the motives and vagaries of French and English as well as Italian diplomacy is so keen and thorough that his volumes must serve as a permanent source for studies not only of Italian foreign relations , but of the international relations of the great Powers from the interview at Plombibres to the death of Cavour . Cavour , born in 1810 , was forty years of age before he attained a position of prominence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life were clearly developed in youth and early manhood . These chapters of the biography are based principally upon Cavour 's letters and diary given in Domenico Berti 's volumes , but they exhibit a psychological insight into Cavour 's moral fibre of which Berti was altogether incapable . When but twenty-three years of age , Cavour defined in his correspondence , as Mr. Thayer states , the theory of right political method : That method which , he was destined to prove , may , in the hands of a master , be far more effective than revolution It is the method of the highest Opportunism  --  not the Opportunism of Louis Philippe , bent only on keeping his throne , nor even of Bismarck , making unnatural alliances with political opponents for the sake of passing an unessential measure ; but the Opportunism of a statesman whose acts all tend to the desired goal , although like the wise pilot he may lay his course to port or starboard , to catch a favoring wind or to ride out a gale Opportunism has come to mean drifting , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having dedicated his life to certain principles , he would seize every means , use every tool , gain now an inch and now an ell , in endeavoring to make those principles prevail . To justify this method we must appraise the ideals by the goal arrived at ; they may lead to mere Jesuitry. or , as employed by a Lincoln or a Cavour , to the crowning achievements of statesmanship . From the summer of 1835 down to 1848 , Cavour was chiefly occupied with the management of family estates at Leri , Grinzane , and Santena . His methods in agriculture and in his private commercial undertakings marked him for leadership in whatever sphere he might move . His bent , even in these earlier years was for public life , but fortune thwarted him : Denied the career of his preference he accepted the next best , accepted it manfully , without sullenness or whimpering , and threw himself into it with his whole energy . And his reward was not merely to amass wealth ; it was to gain from practical experience knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must precede any wise leadership in the impending revolution ; for this was to be , as he foresaw , in its essence a social revolution . In this last sentence , Mr. Thayer has touched the key-note of Italian Risorgimento history . Conspiracy , political revelution , and the red-shirt played a vital part in the liberation of the peninsula-from despotic government , and constantly urged the Italian people forward towards unity ; but great constructive statesmanship , capable of forcing on the most far-reaching social and economical reforms , was indispensable , if a stable nation was to be created out of chaos . Cavour entered the Piedmontese Parliament in 1848 , and two years later , he became Minister of Agriculture and Commerce . From that time for elevens years , he was the commanding figure in Piedmont and in Italy , and , during the last years of this period he triumphed in the international arena as the master diplomat of Europe . He is well characterized in this biography as " the most practical finance minister of modern times , " - and his herculean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Subalpine Parliament in the efficient use of its functions are accurately and strikingly portrayed . One of the most vital reforms was in the relations between Church and State . In the tremendous combat over ecclesiastical privilege and encroachment which ensued between the liberal forces in Parliament and reactionaries backed by the uncompromising power of the Papacy , which did not hesitate to use spiritual , as well as temporal weapons in the struggle to preserve its temporal " rights " ? here , particularly , the courage , firmness , and wise moderation of Cavour determined the issue and brought victory to the cause of liberty and progress . In the account of this struggle in its various phases , Mr. Thayei , with a Lutheran fervor and pungency of phrase , allows no quarter to the Papacy . The extreme anti-Clericals  --  priest-eaters , as they are termed in Italy  --  will find much to delight them in these chapters , but ether readers will perhaps wish that Mr. Thayer had taken a calmer tone In view of the violence of his attacks against the hierarchy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledging his indebtedness in the preparation of his work to a number - of distinguished gentlemen whose names he gives , and to " certain clericals and eminent Jesuits . " Had he divulged the names of these latter , he might have waked some morning to read In the official Osservatore Romano that their reverend heads had been smitten with the Vatican 's major excommunication . Cavour 's first great move in the sphere of international politics was made in 1855 , when he managed to effect a treaty of alliance for little Piedmont with France and England and sent about 18 , - 000 Piedmontese troops to fight by the side of the French and English in the Crimea . It was an audacious step , requiring great sacrifices of men and treasure and offering but a vague hope of reward : But posterity looks back to it as one of the most brilliant strokes of statecraft in the nineteenth century . . . . It opened the door of possibility , and that opening warranted the cost and the risk . Cavour knew that , however the Crimean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crushed Liberalism since 1815 . Then - reorganization would follow , and it would be fatal for Piedmont , both on her own behalf and as the champion of the oppressed peninsula , not to take part in the new ordering . Convinced that progress depended upon the extension of liberty , and that liberty 's hope dwelt in England and in France , Cavour believed that Piedmont must be identified with the Western Powers , for they could not decently ignore the precedent of such a partnership . Mr. Thayer 's account of the Congress of Paris is one of the strongest chapters of his work . As he points out , the confidence which Cavour won in Italy as champion of the Italian cause of liberty and nationality " would of itself have warranted the Crimean venture . " Furthermore , the sympathy of Napoleon III , which was shortly to prove the determining factor in Italy 's future , also resulted from it . Cavour 's biographer evinces little admiration for the French Emperor : This bastard Napoleon , who so imposed on his contemporaries by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the main chance , he could sanction the most brutal crimes ( witness the massacres of the coup d'etat ) , and then , with amazing inconsistency , he would risk immoderately for what seemed to the world the caprice of a visionary . The truth is that he was a doctrinaire of the less common sort , being intermittently importuned by his principles , as periodic drunkards are by their craving for drink . At the interview of Plombieres , in 1858 , Cavour persuaded Napoleon III to join Piedmont when occasion should present itself to oust Austria from the Italian peninsula . Cavour 's struggle during the first months of 1869 , to provoke Austria into declaring war , is one of the most thrilling pages of diplomatic history , and full justice is done it in these volumes . An account of the Franco-Italian campaign against Austria in the plains of Lombardy follows , and then Mr. Thayer enters the diplomatic labyrinth which extends over the period of the annexation of Central Italy , the expedition of the Thousand , the invasion of the Papal Marches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at his best , as Cavour was at his best , in the intricacies of diplomatic conflict . He never forgets that Italy is but a part of Europe and that the solution of the Italian question in its different phases depended in great part on the shifting and readjustment of European influences . He keeps in mind at every step the changing interests and sympathies of the great Powers , giving the best account that has been written of Cavour 's three years of victorious struggle with the chancelleries of Europe . Garibaldi and the Party of Action were never able to understand the European situation ; they believed that twenty-five millions of Italians , differing though they did in the various states in temperament , civic education , and traditions , shackled though they were by Austria in the north , by the Papacy in the centre , and by the Bourbon dynasty allied to Russia in the south , could nevertheless defy the Governments and armies of Europe . Garibaldi and Mazzini created as many difficulties for Cavour as did the foreign diplomats , but the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary forces , managed always skilfully to turn their energy and enthusiasm to the benefit of the national cause . Mr. Thayer judges Mazzini and Garibaldi in their relations with Cavour severely , but in the main justly . Garibaldi always acted as if he were above the law  --  no Garibaldi has ever been known to pay taxes in Italy  --  and since his death his noble and heroic figure has generally remained above the laws of historical criticism . His name has become symbolical of Italian glory and patriotism , and no biographer of Garibaldi has succeeded in resisting the fascination of his character and in describing with impartiality his human frailties and errors . But Mr. Thayer in the present work , with frankness and sincerity , has subjected him to the common canons of criticism , and in so doing has performed a notable service to Italian historical studies . The last paragraph of the writer 's conclusion is a strong but not exaggerated statement of Cavonr 's claim8 to immortality : It is because Cavour , by the rare blending of reason and disciplined emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom recorded in modern times , that his name will be cherished by generations yet unborn and by races yet uncivilized Whoever fights for liberty anywhere , fights for the uplifting of mankind everywhere . .

The volume contains three tales . The first and longest relates the adventures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital , where the heroine succeeds in unearthing as stupendous a mystery of crime and mischance as often encumbers a detective story . The adventure , to tell the truth , is a bit too complicated and the humor a little overlaid . The two shorter tales , which carry the three maiden ladies into regions of bewildering romance and audacity , are as provocative of laughter as anything we have read for many a day . The last adventure , particularly , is a little gem of extravagant drollery . Cap'n Warren 's Wards . By Joseph C. Lincoln . New York : D. Appleton &; Co . Of the first novel published by a character in this story it is said " there was something in its humanity , its simplicity , its clearly marked characters , which made a hit . " These same features , already familiar in Mr. Lincoln 's work , mark this , his latest story . And although it is with regret and misgiving that the reader sees ' the old Cape Cod captain depart for New York and stay-there through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very definite business he has in hand , and he is not the mere rustic in town which has been darkly expected . Receiving word while on his native cranberry bog that he has been appointed guardian to the two children of a long-estranged brother , lately deceased in New York , he is naturally greatly mystified . To investigate the matter he goes to New York and there finds a financial tangle , and a haughty niece and nephew , surrounded by such self-seeking friends as plenteously abound in the cities of fiction But Cap'n Elisha , aided by honest lawyers and cheered by descendants of mariners from Maine , is more than equal to the emergencies that confront him . His genial heart and his shrewd head are a combination against which guile and worldliness and greed fight in vain . A Thanksgiving dinner on Cape Cod ends the story  --  without ending the diners , let us humbly hope . It is the captain 's deep-water flavor and salty sayings and amphibious shrewdness that give the book its quality . The Jugglers .

In the Paris of the siege and the Commune black shadow falls , sparing , however , brave Diane and the man she loves , but leaving the pang that attaches to beholding heroic sacrifice made by the unheroic . Miss Seawell has imparted a French crispness alike to comedy and tragedy in this tale . Her compression is the more masterly , inasmuch as the characters are by no means drawn from standard types . They might have been analyzed and accounted for , which would have spoiled them . From aristocrat juggler to bourgeois priest , they range  --  from sturdily honest music hall singer to the rascal in whom a share of Econventionahty is forgivable . TWO BOOKS ON NAPOLEON . Blucher and the Uprising of Prussia Against Napoleon , 1806-1815 . ( Heroes of the Nations . ) By Ernest F. Henderson , Ph.D . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $1.35 . With Napoleon at Waterloo and Other Unpitbltshed Documents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. $3.75 net . It is nearly a century since Waterloo was fought and won , but the war of the military critic and the historian still goes on . Mr. Henderson seeks , as he says in his preface , " to establish Bliicher in his rightful position as the peer of Wellington in all that concerns the overthrow of Napoleon . . . Without his brave endurance at Ligny , ri spite of the non-arrival of the promised reinforcements , Wellington would have been overwhelmed at Quatre Bras and there would have been no Waterloo . " On the other hand , E. B. Low , in one of the papers edited by Mr. Mac-Bride , takes as his text Emperor William 's address to the recruits in Hanover informing them that their ancestors had , with the assistance of Bhicher and the Prussian army , " saved the British under Wellington from destruction . " Mr. Low then points out that the Hanoverian troops under Col. Hake lied in a panic from the position on the field of Waterloo to which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel was promptly and properly cashiered by court-martial and the men were distributed among the other cavalry regiments He also declares that had Wellington not made a stand where he did in front of Waterloo , but retired further toward Brussels , " as he was entitled to do on discovering that the Prussians had failed to fulfil their engagement by joining him at the first attack , the whole army of Bhicher must have been destroyed " and suffered " a fate compared with which the ddbacle of Sedan would have faded into insignificance " ( p 201 ) . The truth lies , as usual , between these two extreme views . Neither of the volumes can be regarded as a big gun in the controversy Neither makes any great contribution of important new material , and neither is provided with the careful and convincing citation of authorities which is absolutely essential for any satisfactory determination of the thousand - and one disputed questions in regard to the details of Quatre Bras , Ligny , and Waterloo . Mr. Henderson 's lack of documentation is due to the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can not , therefore , be made a re , proach to him . His pages show , however , by his carefully guarded statements , that he has conscientiously consulted the best authorities . He does not pretend-to any original criticism or technical military knowledge . He has depended chiefly on certain good German biographies of Blucher . In the vexed questions of the Waterloo campaign , ha has adopted generally the Prussian views of von Lettow-Vorbeck ( " Napo : leons Untergang , " 1904 ) . He mentions also his indebtedness to the writings of other high officers in the Austrian or Prussian armies , in comparison with which " purely literary works like those of Houssaye , for instance , who is an academician and not a military man , seem very puny . " This is dismissing the brilliant Frenchman a bit too cavalier- , ly . Mr. Henderson passes rather lightly over Bhicher 's defeat at Ligny , and , in trying to excuse his hero by blaming Wellington for giving Bhicher hopes of assistance which were not realized , we think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from such occasional partiality toward his hero at the expense of the reputation of others , he has written a good biography . It is clear , simple , and very readable . It is adequately provided with sketch maps for the military events , and is well illustrated by an unusual number of rather rare pictures . The first quarter of the book gives a spirited survey of the first seventy-one years of Bliicher 's life as soldier , farmer , and gambler . The remaining three-quarters deals with the three momentous years from the Prus ' Sian rising in 1813 to the triumphal entry into Paris in 1815 Such an allotment of space to the last part of his life may seem ill-proportioned . It is , nevertheless , correct . Blischer 's importance in history , and his right to stand among its heroes , rests on his energetic leadership of the Prussian troops during these three years , when he had already passed his allotted three-score years and ten . Mr. MacBride 's volume is a collection of miscellanies . Their general purport is the glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots Greys in general . There are interesting extracts from - hitherto unpublished journals by two Gordon Highlanders , Nicol and Robertson . They were valiant soldiers whose simple journals cover a campaign with Abercrombie and Moore in Egypt , the terrible retreat through Spain and the disembarkation at Corunna , and the famous charge at Waterloo which broke up D'Erlon 's closely packed battalions . Nicol 's journal also covers his adventures as a prisoner in Spain and France from 1809 to 1811 . The editor has added , translations of the diaries of . Tardin Aine , Napoleon 's equerry at Waterloo , and of another alleged eye-witness spoken of as one of Napoleon 's aides-de-camp ; the latter is hostile to Napoleon and is , we believe , of very dubious authenticity . The most picturesque chapter is the naive account of Waterloo by the last survivor of the Scots Greys who took part in the battle , Sergeant-Major Dickson , exactly as he related it in 1855 , after several glasses of toddy , in the coffee-room of a Fife-shire inn . His description is singularly fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before . It is printed by the editor with the same solemn seriousness with which it was doubtless related by Dickson in 1855 . But if it were subjected to a rigid analysis , according to the canons of historical criticism and with our present knowledge of the battle , many of the gallant major 's best points , we suspect , would have to be rejected as the unconscious exaggeration of a good narrator , or as the incorporation of things not actually seen by himself during the battle , but only heard of from others afterwards . Nothing grows in repetition and retrospect so much as an old soldier 's story of the great fight of his youth . Mr. Mac-Bride bas also included two papers by the late E Bruce Low ; one describes in detail the heroic defence of Hougoumont by the Coldstream Guards , under Sir James MacDonell ; the other , from which a quotation has been made above , defends Wellington and his troops against the excessive claims of the Prussians to the honor of the victory at " Belle Alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterloo . The Rise of the Novel of Maaneis . By Charlotte E. Morgan . The Columbia University Press . New York : Lemcke &; Buechner. $1.50 net . It is possible to question the value of a thoroughgoing " scientific " examination of the evolution of the novel , but , the value once admitted , the humblest forms of fiction , if they have ever had real vitality , become significant . From this point of view , Miss Morgan makes a mistake in declaring that " the popular fiction , generally speaking , had no literary merit ; and , as it had no other aim than immediate success , it rarely possessed more than ephemeral interest , so that on the whole it may be regarded as a negligible factor . " If it had " ephemeral interest , " if it achieved " immediate success , " it is not " negligible . " Miss Moigan 's contempt for chap books , contemporary stories of crime , travel , and adventure , ignoble flying pamphlets , and miscellaneous journalistic riffraff makes her narrative weak in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are similarly offended by the use of the word " negligible " where " neglected " seems to be the proper term . Atter noting the numerous editions of Sidney 's " Arcadia " in the seventeenth century and admitting that references to it are " legion , " Miss Morgan ventures to assert that " so far as our own fiction is concerned , the influence of the ' Arcadia , ' although it remained a popular book for so long , due sic in part , perhaps , to the prestige of Sidney 's name , is a negligible factor . " This kind of negation is , in the first place , in the highest degrce perilous . There is no possibility of proving the truth of such an assertion . On the contrary , every investigation of the matter is almost certain to produce evidence tending to refute it . When an important work like the " Arcadia " is widely read over a long period of years , there is an overwhelming presumption that it will be widely influential . Already , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor ; and we have no doubt that , when the problem is carefully worked out , Professor Raleigh will be sustained in his declaration that its " influence reached down to the second birth of the novel in England " ? to the " Pamela " of Richardson . Miss Morgan rightly regards her contribution as rather a preliminary survey than an exhaustive description of the area chosen . She attempts merely a " succinct account of the more important types of prose narrative between 1600 and 1740 " without any profound researches into their origins or a very consecutive tracing of their evolution  --  an undertaking , indeed , that requires the skill of a man who can drive a dozen protean and unruly horses abreast with a dozen as unruly foals careering about his chariot wheels . We suppose that it is due to a difficulty in driving that the " Gargantua " of Rabelais ( died 1553 ) appears ( p. 44 ) among the comic romances " more or less closely modelled " upon the " Don Quixote " of Cervantes ( born 1547 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duchess of Newcastle ( 1624 ? - 1674 ) are treated in the chapter on the novel from 1700 to 1740 . In her conclusion , Miss Morgan distinguishes three main divisions in the movement of fiction through her period : the division from 1600 to 1660 is characterized by romance largely adapted from foreign sources with no English originals of literary significance ; the second division from 1660 to the close of the century , by the vogue of realistic stories developed from French and Spanish novelle ; the third division , in which Defoe and Swift appear , by a more decided bent toward sentimentalism , didacticism , domesticity , and realism , due to a complex of moral , political , social , and economic causes . - Miss Morgan 's work will be useful to students of fiction not only for what it accomplishes but also for its revelation of the necessity of further researches . With this purpose in view , she has wisei : devoted about one-half the volume , or nearly 130- pages , to bibliography and index . The bibliography includes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Special Reference ; 3 , Sources of Bibliographical Information ; 4 , A list of Prose Narratives first printed in English between 1600 and 1740 ; 5 , A list of the most important Reprints ; 6 , A list of Collections ; 7 , An alphabetical list of the More Important English Writers between 1600 and 1740 . The bibliography is by no means complete , and the bibliographical references in the text are not infrequently misleading , because they are given without any warning of their incompleteness ; for example , the Dictionary of National Biography and the catalogue of the British Museum list many other editions of Greene 's pamphlets than those listed on page 18 . The index , furthermore , though fairly extensive , omits innumerable names and titles which occur in the text . In spite of its shortcomings , the bibliographical apparatus doubtless constitutes the most valuable half of the volume , and these easily corrigible defects should receive attention if a new edition is issued .

High Mountain Climbing in Peru and Bolivia , including the Conquest of Huascardn , with some Observations on the Country and People Below . By Annie S. Peck , M. A. With numerous Illustrations . New York : Dodd , Mead &; Co. $3.50 net . So far as any book professes a scientific aim , it should pass the test of fix-ing the reader 's attention upon the subject rather than the author This the volume of Mr. Sheldon does , but we imagine that few readers of Miss Peck 's pages will be as deeply interested in the work of her mercurial and aneroid barometers , hypsometers , sphygmographs , psychrometers , and clinical thermometers ( which had the habit of getting left behind or out of order at critical moments ) as in the personal fortunes of the author , and especially her trials and tribulations in dealing with stupid , insubordinate , and faint-hearted assistants of the sterner sex . Mr. Sheldon 's purpose in the Yukon region was primarily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he picked up by the way a great deal of information on other forms of animal life and on the configuration of the region . A portion of the volUrne covers a trip up the MacMillan River in company with the well-known hunter and naturalist , F. C Selous , who has himself included an account of this trip in his " Recent Hunting Trips in British North America . " The two men had different alms , however , and the duplication is not sufficient to injure Mr. Sheldon 's narrative . One will certainly not blame him for repeating in substance the sketch which Mr. Selous gave of Mrs Hosfall , the half-Indian wife of an English trapper who is bringing up a family of bright , healthy , and well-trained children amid direst privations . Mr. Sheldon concludes from his studier , on the field that the habits of all wila sheep on this continent north of the range of the Ovis Canadensis of the Rocky Mountains are substantially identical , the slight variations being due to local , topographic , and food conditions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ovis Stonei brought from the Stikine River region does not constitute a distinctive characteristic . The diverging horns are found to a greater or less extent wherever sheep exist , and later specimens from the Stikine region furnished the more common narrow type . Mr. Sheldon is also skeptical as to the sufficiency of the basis on which some have sought to make a three-fold classification by differences in skull characters The differences seem to him too slight , on present evidence , for separation into anything more than very weakly marked sub-species . The sheep do not seem to roam very widely , and a destructive enemy will exterminate those of a given range , rather than drive them to another . The disappearance of flocks near mining camps and lines of travel , where hunting has been common , does not , therefore , mean any material increase in numbers elsewhere . Mr Sheldon points out at some length what he takes to be serious difficulties in the theory of protective or concealing coloration . In another volume , he expects to enter into a more detailed study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimated , Miss Peck 's volume makes its appeal rather as a story of personal adventure than as a contribution to scientific knowledge . It would not be fair to her , however , not to mention her complaint that the scientist who accompanied her in her attempt to ascend Mt . Sorata , in 1903 , never furnished her with a transcript of such observations as he made , up to the point where the project was abandoned . As the gentleman in question Is no longer among the living ( she does not once name him in her book and we shall be equally reticent here ) it does not seem worth while to take up the question how far she succeeds in throwing the burden of the failure upon him . Readers are rather weary of the bickerings of ex plorers at preent . Her main achieve -- ment was the ascent , in 1908 , of the north peak of Mt . Huascaran , in the Peruvian Andes , which has a height of slightly less than 22,000 feet , as determined later by triangulation . Thus ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culminated in the conquest of a mountain at least 1,500 feet higher than Mt . McKinley , and 2,500 feet higher than any man residing in the United States had climbed " While Miss Peck stopped near the goal in an unsuccessful attempt to make an observation with the hypsometer , one of the Swiss guides slipped away and preceded her to the summit , a wholly inexcusable breach of professional etiquette and ordinary - good manners . The narrative closes with an intimation that she has not yet lost her ambition to find the apex of the hemisphere and possibly surpass the highest record yet achieved The Greek Commonwealth , : Politics and Economics in Fifth Century Athens . By Alfred E. Zimmern . New York : Henry Frowde. $2.90 net . Mr Zimmern has written one of those lucid ; unpedantic , yet thoroughly learned books for which clasSlcal philology must thank French initiative and example , and which English readers associate gratefully with the name of Gilbert Murray . The number of French names in the index of modern writers is noticeable , although Eduard Meyer and Willamowitz-Mollendorff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cavaignac , and Glotz are the leading authorities , and the logical coherence and formal charm of the book show where the author has been to school . The mood of the hour is to extend relations in every direction , and thus to come to a better understanding of exceptional nations , such as , for example , the Jews or the Greeks , by elucidating that which they have in common with other men , and Mr Zimmern 's book is an excellent essay in the gratification of this mood . It does not pretend to make any fresh contribution to the mass of facts , nor even to offer any great number of novel combinations . It is therefore free from parti pins and is the fruit not only of knowledge , but of good sense and discretion . Where one side of a disputed question is adopted in the text , material for forming an independent opinion is offered in the ample and entertaining notes It does not follow that all scholars will be entirely satisfied with all the author 's judgments , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . The study opens , - as books on Greece are apt to open , with a description of the geography , the soil , and the climate of the country , and these chapters are so freshly written that they are among the best in the book . The second division , entitled Politics , summarizes the present state of information and belief in regard to the origins of Greek institutions with their psychological corollaries , and ends with a translation of the " Funeral Oration . " The reconstruction of fifth-century Politics benefits by the author 's determination to keep Plato and Aristotle out of it . As he judiciously remarks . " It is as unsafe to rely upon them for the facts of the fifth and preceding centuries as it would be to rely upon Carlyle and Ruskin for the facts and spirit of English life before the Great Reform bill and the Industrial Revolution . " The third and longest division deals with Economics , and contains a number of interesting essays on the peculiar civilization and culture of the Greek state , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which every man consoles himself for the ugliness of his city by establishing his idea of beauty in his own house . Two of the most important chapters deal with slavery and should be useful in dispelling the vulgar error which views Athenian society as an economic aristocracy similar to that of our Southern States before the war . This error was , of course , exploded ' long ago by a German , but who except the scholars is the wiser ? Mr. Zimmern closes his book with an outline of the Peloponnesian war somewhat remarkable in that it'follows Thucydides 's statement of the cases belli , in defiance of Mr. Cornford and Mr. Grundy who have been insisting that Thucydides knew nothing about it .

New York : The Macmillan Co. $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to designate great movements or periods of history ' are Misleading , and it is rare that they are altogether satisfactory . Yet the substitutes which historians have sometimes ventured to offer for them are Most often even more unsatisfactory . " Renaissance , " for example , may not be exact , but at least it means something , and is therefore much better than " Close of the Middle Ages , " which means nothing . And one may suspect that any attempt to replace " American Revolution " , with some other name , such , for instance , as " War of Independence " , - or " American Civil War , " will prove to be a failure also . It has often been pointed out that the American Revolution was not revolutionary at all , but the reverse , ? an attempt to conserve essential principles of Englishliberty . This is of course good Whig doctrine ; and , judging from the title of Mr. Belcher 's book , one might fuppose him to be a good Whig , intent merely upon affirming for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England to thwart the despotic designs of George III and his Tory friends . But nothing , as it happens , could be farther from the truth . Mr. Belcher , a sound Tory himself , is grateful to George III for breaking the power of the Whig aristocracy , and has no end of clever sarcasms at the expense of men like Burke and Pitt , Hancock and Adams , whom American school books treat with so much respect . And so , while Mr. Belcher doubtless uses - the term " Civil War " partly in order to emphasize the opposition between Patriots and Loyalists , one suspects that his title is after all only one of the many sprightly sentences which he delights to turn for the laudable purpose of shocking complacent American prejudice The American Revolution is one of those events which look large only when seen from some distance . Viewed in perspective its importance is seen to lie mainly in the great things that came out of it : it has the distinction of being the initial event in a series of events which within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially , it prepared the way for the most momentous experiment in democracy which the world has seen . So regarded , perhaps we may still call it a revolution . But in itself , one must confess , it does appear rather petty . It produced comparatively few heroic figures or great actions . Certainly it is not difficult to find in it much flimsy argument and fustian rhetoric , much base intrigue , much sordid motive , and cruel reprisal . Now , in dealing with the causes and general significance of the Revolution  --  something above half of the present instalment is devoted to the events before 1775 ? it is mainly upon these superficial aspects of the movement that Mr. Belcher fixes ; the rioting and the smuggling , the tar and feathers , the wanton destruction of property , the possession of ? slaves by men who themselves so ardently desired liberty , furnish occasion for much wit , and sarcasm , and apt Latin quotation . The American grievances , he thinks , were slight enough  --  the pretexts used by smugglers and intriguers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always excepting Washington , of whom Mr. Belcher has a very high opinion , are reduced to very small scale , indeed . Like S. G. Fisher , Mr. Belcher destroys without remorse all our idols , and , being a clever and well read man , possessed of strong prejudices , held in reasonable restraint by a sense of humor and the desire to be fair , a man to whom expression comes easily , and onewho writes without fear and without too much research  --  why , he has produced a sprightly and entertaining if somewhat rambling and unorganized account of the preliminaries of the American Revolution . Perhaps the central enigma for the historian of the Revolution to resolve is this how , out of conditions that always seemed hopeless , success came at last . Now , our grievance against Mr. Belcher is not that he has dandled , so irreverently , all the cheap shoddy of our heroic age before our eyes , but rather that he has done so little to show how results ' of world-wide importance could have come from so much provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was much smuggling ; and that is well known already ; but it is better to know ? Mr. Beer 's books would have helped Mr. Belcher here  --  why smuggling was so persistent and general a practice that it had ceased to be regarded as an offence . Every one knows , presumably , that the stamp tax was light ; but the stamp tax is of less importance for an understanding of the Revolution than the Sugar Act and the Currency Act , neither of which , we believe , is mentioned by Mr. Belcher " When the hurly-burly was over , " we are told , " the little hypocrisies of Whig opportunism entirely vanished . " But this is to miss the very important point that the conservative leaderS worked throughout to prevent the radicals from dominating the movement : to maintain their privileges from British oppression on the one hand , - and from the encroachments of the propertyless classes in the colonies on the other , was the principal dilemma of the " Whig opportunists . " If Mr. Belcher had understood this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Loyalists with so bitter a hatred ; the Loyalists were hated not so much because they sided with England as because they first helped to get the colonies into a mess and then left them in the lurch . Until 1776 Peter van Schaack and John Jay worked side by side on the same committees in re- ' sistance to British measures . But Van Schaack , although convinced that the British measures were unconstitutional , was not willing at the last moment to resort to force to maintain colonial rights . Jay naturally regarded him as a traitor to his own principles , and thought that by his action he made it peculiarly difficult for Jay and his party to check the radical movement . It is not probable , but it is possible , that if the Loyalist leaders had never resisted British measures , or having resisted them had stuck to it , the war might have been prevented . It is certain that in that case there would have been less riding on rails . Perhaps we have said too much about the introductory part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably expect two more volumes covering the period from 1778 to 1783 , it will be when completed primarily a history of the war itself . About one-half of the part now published is devoted to a description of the two military services and to an account of the military events from the campaign on Long Island to the Battle of Saratoga . Here Mr. Belcher is more at home , and his work becomes far more consecutive and better ordered . He desires to defend the British army against the charge of being the " scum of the earth , " and he is reasonably successful in doing so . The chapters in which he shows from what classes the army was recruited , how it was organized and maintained , and those in which he explains the incredible failure of Howe to take advantage of his opportunities , are the best in the book . The explanation of Howe 's actions follows the usual lines , although certain traits in his character and the personal animus of Germaine 's conduct are emphasized more than is usual . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howe might have ended the war almost any time from 1776 to 1778 . This conclusion is made too absolute perhaps by discrediting the effectiveness of the colonial resistance . Even Washington  --  so great as a man  --  is not credited with exceptional ability as a general . The main point , however , is now well established , and certainly it is a point of cardinal importance in any attempt to explain the success of the American Revolution .
