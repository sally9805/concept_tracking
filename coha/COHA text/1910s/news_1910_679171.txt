txt After pleading guilty to committing grand larceny in the first degree in obtaining loans of large sums of money from both the Mercantile Nirtional Bank at 195 Broadway and the Liberty National Bank at 139 Broadway , for which he did not put anY security beyond mere time notes , Adolph Rothbarth , a middle-aged German hop merchant with a small office at 2G , Whitehall Street , was locked up in the Tombs yesterday afternoon in default of 2 ' 0,000 bail . It is his own wish that he receive the extreme penalty of the law , which is ten years in State prison , and it is not likely that he will make any effort to obtain bail . As a result of his operations the Mercantile National Bank , according to Assistant District Attorney Manley , stands to lose about $58,000 and the Liberty National about $70,000 . Officials of the former institution said last night that Rothbarth did not owe them more than $34.000 .

Rothbarth paid off all his indebtedness : there , and even has a balance in his ' favor . Rothbarth in several ways is one of the most interesting swindlers ' the District Attorney 's office has had dealings with in a long time . He not only made a clean breast of his offense , but seemed anxious that he be severely punished . Owing to this peculiar attitude the prison officials fear that he may commit suicide , and an extra watch was placed on him . Rash speculation in Wall Street , the prisoner said , was the cause of his downfall . It'was his ambition to ? acquire millions , and he was " long " on a number of stocks when in 1907 the big slump struck the market . The resultant panic that Fall wiped out every cent he had . Even after this drawback , however , he did not have any difficulty in borrowing large , sums of money . His method of getting it was simplicity itself , but not more slinple than the way he was caught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks a false statement of his assets and liabilities . The foreign firm he represented . which is composed of his three brothers , had good ratings and seemed to the bank officials to be thoroughly reliable . By working the three banks against each other Rothbarth was able to draw all the money he wanted . Having established an account at one bank , he obtained credit on notes , many of which were not even signed by the firm he represented , but by himself , as , having power of attorney . Then he would discount these notes and place them with equal ease to his credit at another bank . When he made two different false statements regarding his income , however , and these were compared , almost by mere chance , they were so glaringly at variance that an investigation immediately followed . Rothbarth 's arrest came yesterday afternoon after Assistant District Attorney . aianley had descended upon his office and carried away his bows and accounts . He made a complete confession when confronted with the evidence against him and said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in his disgrace . His confession and the statements of the bank officials with whom he did business pieced out the full history of himself and his manipulations , and the case looked so dark against-him that James W. Osborne , after a consultation with him , could not make up his mind whether to represent him or not . By Rothbarth 's own admission he succeeded in deceiving his brothers as easily as he did the hank officials . There are four Rothbarth brothers , Justus .

Adolph , the youngest of the four brothers , is a bachelor , 57 years old , and has fine apartments at the Sherman Square HoteL He began speculating In Wall Street in 1905 and was more or less successful during that year and the next . His business , too , was in a prosperous condition . In 1907 , however , he was ( - aught in the market with stocks includ -- ing Union Pacific and lost S.3 much money that he went to the Liberty Natienal aria  --  Mercantile National Banks and negotiated loans on notes . He get $1041,000 credit from the Liberty National Bank , giving four times notes of 2=25,000 each . These he discounted and opened an account at the Mercantile NaAtonal Bank . instead of collateral for the loans lie showed the bank officials a statement of his assets and liabilities . On this statement he obtained $100,06 : : from the Mercantile National Bank between August , 1908. and March , 1909 , according to Assistant District Attorney Ma.nle : - . His statement showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that his cash on hand and stock amounted to $14,000 more . As a matter of fact , there was less than $20 , - 000 due aim , he had no cash , and his stock was practically worthless . His liabilities he gave as only $1,000 , while he was indebted to the Liberty National Bank for $1.70.000 . Rothbarth from time to time , as the . notes fell due at one bank , renewed them by borrowing from another . During this time he also got loans of $110,000 on false statements from the National Park Bank . These loans , however , were all taken up subsequently when they fell due with money borrowed from his three brothers in Europe . - Hard pressed for money , Rothbarth early tills month again applied to the National Park Bank for a loan of $125 , - ( 100 . He submitted another statement showing his assets and liabilities . a ne officials of the bank , knowing that Rothbarth had borrowed money from the Mercantile National Bank , called on President Willis G , Nash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many discrepancies were found . The National Park Bank then refused the loan , and President Nash consulted the law firm of Sullivan &; Cromwell : William N. Cromwell is a Director of the bank , and H. H. Boyesen of the firm was asked -- -to make an Investigation . With Mr. Nash and two detectives Mra.Boyesen went to Rothbarth 's office on day and asked for an explanation . He Confessed All . Rothbarth admitted that the statements did not agree , and he begged for time in which " to straighten matters out . When this was refused he practically admitted that the statements were false , . and President Nash consulted District Attorney Whitman . Two . county detectives were sent to watch Rothbarth all Tuesday night at his rooms at the Sherman Square Hotel . Yesterday morning he was taken to Assistant District Attorney Manley 's office , where he made a full confession . Mr. Manly took all his office books ' and accounts and these bore out his confession . In order to get a case of an actual loan on an original and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $10,040 , made in September , 1908 . A complaint was drawn up , charging grand larceny in the first degree , and Rothbarth was taken before Magistrate Herbert in the Tombs Court in the afternoon . Emil Klein , cashier of the Mercantile National Bank , appeared as complainant . Rothbarth pleaded guilty and waived examination , and the Magistrate held him for the Grand Jury . District Attorney Whitman was in court and asked that ' bail be fixed at $20,000 . He said that the amounts involved footed up to more than $100,000 , and the Magistrate was amazed at the lOw bail demanded . If you had not asked for this amount I would ' have made it much larger , " said the Magistrate . IF Zetthbarth took the proceedings coolly . The Liberty National Bank will be the heaviest loser , but President Frederick B. Schenck* said ne felt sure he would be able to recover the $70,000 owing to it through the prisoner 's brothers , who , he said , were reputable and responsible business num . Expect to Recover Loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Rothbarth &; Co. for several years , " said President ? Schenck . " The firm does a large business abroad . The loans given to Adolph Rothbarth in bchalf of his firm cover a period of about three years . During that time they were of various amounts , and on last January , they were all paid up . " Later Rothbarth began to renew his borrowing , and on a statement made by him on Aug. 31 , which made it appear that the firm 's Credit aggregated $1,200 , - 000 , the loans were made . This statement was signed by . Adolph Rothbarth , representing his firm . Naturally we considered the firm sufficiently responsible to give it the desired loans , which amount ed to about $75 ; 000 . Sometime later , when Rothbarth obtained loans from another bank , we learned that his statement to us was fradulent . We have not taken steps to presecute him because we do n't think it is necessary . in view cf the action . already . taken by : taeAtercantile Nationat , Bankri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these loans from the firm . The firm was established many years ago , and its business , which was in supplying hops and brewery supplies to brewery concerns , was considered very prosperous . Of course we had no idea that Rothbarth was using the money for speculating . " President Schenck was formerly President of the Mercantile National Bank . At the time A.ugustus Heinze obtained control of the latter concern Mr. Schenck resigned and was at once elected President of the Liberty National . Mr. Boyesen was sure that Rothbarth did not owe the Mercantile National more than $34,000 . Originally it was more , he said , ' but they had realized on some collateral put up by Rothbarth , and this brought their net deficit down to between $32,000 and $34,000 . The ? lop merchant had also a $12,000 balance in the bank when arrested , Mr. Boyesen asserted . Thought Loans Were Safe . " The Mercantile National Bank officials knew Rothbarth 's firm to be an old established one doing a large business abroad and with good ratings , " said Mr. Boyesen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly when he had had a previous account with the bank and maintained a good-sized balance in all the banks he dealt with . " We are sure the firm will make good our loss . but it is our duty to punish Rothbarth as a persistent offender against society . He lost heavily in the panic of 1007 when he was playing the market very strong , we learned lately . j. do n't know how much he lost but it was considerable . He speculated entirely on margins , I understand . " He had a good scheme , but like all criminals he overlooked an important ' defect in it . He forgot to keep a copy of his false statements for his own ref-1 erence so that he could make them tally with each other . When we confronted him in his office yesterday and accused him of fraud , he said he might have been careless , but after a time he admated falsifying his records not only to deceive the banks but his own brothers : " Mr. Boyesen said Rothbarth 's brothers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manley , said othCr.

" I am glad it is all over , " he told Mr. Manley . " I have not slept for weeks , and now I am ready to take my punishment . It ca n't come too quickly or too severely to suit me . I hope the Judge will give me the limit . Thank heaven I am a bachelor , so a wife and children can not suffer . I am afraid this is going to ruin my brothers as well as myself . I hope I will be completely forgotten henceforth . " Tiles- The officials of the National Park Bank were , congratulating themselves after it was over because of their escape . On Aug. 11 , according to the District Attorney , Rothbarth paid the bank back $30 , - 000 , and $100,000 on Aug. 25 . This left a small amount coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
