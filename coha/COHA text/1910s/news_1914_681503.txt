txt The coolest and most conservative minds in Italy ? manifest increasing anxiety as to the effect on the future of the nation of continued neutrality in the present war . There is no doubt that the declaration of neutrality was a very substantial aid to the Allies at the outbreak of the war . It permitted the French Government to strip its Alpine frontier of troops and to mass its full force in the north and east to resist the Germanic invasion , and it is a reasonable inference that , without this reinforcement , Paris might have been besieged and the Allies , not the ** have been foiled in the long and bloody battle of the Meuse . And , of course , the appearance of the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean would have changed the naval situation materially . Even more important than these material advantages accruing to the Allies was the moral effect of the action of Italy in proclaiming to the world that the war made by the Germanic Empires was one of clear and inexcusable aggression . It was on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , as it had been violated openly by two of its members . In the face of this concrete evidence the plea of Germany and Austria that they took arms in sel defense became absurd . The verdict of Italy helped to turn the feeling of the civilized world against the pretensions of Germany . It undoubtedly was expected by the leaders in the Italian Government that the extremely valuable services of Italy to the Allies would be considered when the final settlement came , and that Italy would be regarded , if not as a partner , at least as a party in interest , entitled to a voice and to recognition . The points in the future of that country to which its Government and its people attach the most importance are ( 1 ) the assurance of peaceful development of the colonial enterprise in Tripoli and Cyrenaica : ( 2 ) the recovery from Austria of the Trentino and the provinces about the Port of Trieste , which strategically , politically , and commercially are of great value ; - ( 3 ) the extension of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had the war come to a prompt conclusion , or bad there been a distinct advantage won by the Allies in the operations of the first three months , these claims would have been very strong and their recognition would have been cordial . But there are signs that the Allies feel that Italy has not done enough for them to make her position indisputable . The tone of the British press and even of the French press has perceptibly changed , and though it is still friendly it is also a little admonitory . This has been more marked since the entry of Turkey upon the war . Italy is reminded that this is a serious menace to her interests in the Balkans and in Tripoli , which can best be met by a coalition with the Allies . Turkey will be helpless if the Germanic Empires are defeated , and Italy 's claims can best be protected by joining in that defeat . The southeastern situation is unquestionably very complicated and full of difficulty . The tendency is to force Italy to take a decisive part , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may become inevitable
