txt THE QUEBEC RESISTERS . Are They Unmoved by the Good Friday Massacre ? The behavior of the French-Canadians fills one with shame and indignation . Thuy will not fight for Great Britain that gave them their liberties and the protection of her laws , and whose rule they prefer even to that of France . They will not fight for France , th- ? ir mother country for whom , until now , the world supposed they still had some affection , since they preserved her language and traditions . Theywill not fight for Justice and humanity , since apparently these words mean nothing to them . It has been hinted that the Roman Catholic Church in Canada is responsible for this selfish and cowardly . attitude of the French-Canadians ; but such a thing is inconceivable . When has the Catholic Church ever ceased to denounce iniquity ? Have we not all read that here , in the United States . Cardinal Gibbons has told the Catholics that it was their sacred duty to fight in defense of right and justice ? Are we to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converts among the Canadian priesthood ? If not , what , then , is wrong with the French-Canadians ? Do they read , unmoved and indifferent , that their French brothers and sisters , brothers and sisters by blood and in Christ , are being slaughtered while kneeling in prayer in the house of God on Good Friday ? Awake , French-Canadians ! Join in the holy crusade against the common foe ! What more magnificent example of loyalty and courage would you have than that given you by the men of your own land , the British-Canadians ? And if that is not enough to rouse you from your apathy , remember at least the French from whom you spring and who , God knows , have not deserved the stigma you are inflicting upon their name . Noblesse oblige ! Man , the Individual , counts for nothing today . The only thing that does count at this hour Is mankind , humanity . R. L. S.
