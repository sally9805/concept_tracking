txt The mystery of the lust voucher at the State Department is still a mystery . Secretary Knox appeared before the House Committee on Expenditures in the State Department this afternoon and gave the committee the voucher and all the accompanying papers , including a letter by former Secretary Root to Consul General Michael at Calcutta , and the reply of the latter explaining as far as he could wnat became of the $1,000 excess payment on the voucher which Albert Rosenthal signed for the portrait of former Secretary Day . " The papers speak for themselves , " said Mr. Knox . " I knew no more than they , tell of the transaction . " Mr. Knox said that the voucher was found lying on the floor near the waste basket in Mr. Morrison 's rocm a week ago last Monday and was brought to him the next morning by Mr. Carr , tile chief of the Consular Division , For several weeks I there has been , by the Secretary 's directicns , a searching investigation going on in the department to find the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that some one in the department had them all the time and finally threw them on the floor in Morrison 's room at the close of the day , whenj an escape could be made and no suspicions aroused . Everybody in the department who could ' have had any knowledge of the paper had I I been interrogated , Mr. Knox said , and no more information had been obtained than had been previously given to the commit ' ' tee . Mr. Michael had been cabled for information end had replied that he had given Mr. Root when he was Secretary a full statement of all be knew of the matter . Former Chief Clerk Denby , when ca bled to for light on the subject , had replied that he knew nothing about the matter . Mr. Hamlin asked him what his theory of the matter was , but when Mr. Knox said he did not like to state it , Mr. Hamlin did not press him for an answer . Mr. Hamlin said afterward that his own theory was that some one had kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had forgotten all about it until the present inquiry , and then was afraid to come forward with the papers for fear he would lose his place . Mr. Knox assured the committee that the department was as anxious as the committee could be to clear the matter up , and if it was found who had retained I the voucher some one would be called to I task . Mr. Knox was at first inclined to believe that the committee held him responsible for the matter , and when Mr. Hamlin was pressing a question closely , Mr. Knox with some heat exclaimed : " What do you suspect , Mr. Hamlin ? That somebody is committing perjury before this committee ? " Mr. Hamlin said he bad no such thought , and declared that the committee only wanted the facts . The voucher , which was handed around to the members of the committee , was partly in typewriting and was without date . Below the receipt , which was for the sum of 86n0 , was a note in the handwriting of Rosenthal , saying that $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame for the portrait . This bill or voucher read : Received on the 18th day of January , 1901 , the sum of seven hundred and ninety dollars ( MO ) for a portrait of Judge Day , late Secretary of State , for the Department of State . ALBERT ROSENTHAL . This does not Include the frame , for which Mr. Fischer received directly from . the department M. It . With the receipt was a voucher in the usual form of the State Department , with a line in typewriting stating that cash had been paid Rosenthal to the amount ' of $2,410 , and below this line , in the handwriting of a clerk , a note stated that it was for a portrait of Secretary Day . Tills voucher bore the 0 . K. of Secretary John Hay . Mr. Root 's letter to W. H. Michael , the former chief clerk and now Consul General at Calcutta , read : " As this amount is greatly in excess of the sum paid by the department for other similar portraits , and as it also seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive for his work , the department would be forced to / the conclusion that the voucher signed by Rosenthal was actually made out to cover a number of emergency payments I of which the portrait was only one , were it not that the voucher for the whole sum was signed by Rosenthal alone . " I was directed by Secretary Hay , " wrote Mr. Michael in reply , " to write to Judge Day and ascertain whether the portrait was entirely satisfactory to him and the price agreed on . In reply to my letter Judge ' Day said the portrait was satisfactory to him , and stated the price to be paid . This letter I handed to Secretary Hay He took a memorandum out of his portfolio , and after looking at it directed me to make out a voucher for a certain amount , I do not now recall the amount , to pay for the portrait and to hand him the balance , which he desired to apply on other emergency accounts . " He did not say what the accounts were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way to Mr. Rockhill in connection with Chinese affairs . The amount of the voucher , whatever it was . was delivered to me by some one in the Bureau of Accounts , according to my recollection . The price of the portrait was taken out of the envelope containing the money in the presence of Secretary Hay , who retained the balance . " Explaining that if Rosenthal signed a voucher instead of a. receipt it was through error , Mr. Michael continued : " Whatever was done in the premises was done by direction of Secretary Hay , as nothing could have been done otherwise ; and if there is anything in the transaction open to criticism it is the error of sending to the artist a voucher which was not intended for his signature ' at all , and which he should not have signed . " Mr. Hamlin took the view that when Mr. Rosenthal appeared before the committee two weeks ago he had stated that I he had received the $850 in a check and that the voucher or bill now brought for-ward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the check I and see what date it bore and for what amount it was drawn . Mr. Hamlin said that a matter so important as the payment of $850 to him ought to be clearly remembered by Mr. Rosenthal . John Sangston , the messenger who found the voucher , denied that any one had given him the envelope and asked him to throw it on the floor . Secretary Knox explained , apparsetly to the satisfaction of the committee , the Payment of $1,000 to Frederick Hale , son of former Senator Eugene Hale of Maine , for services in connection with Canadian boundary negotiations . Mr. Knox produced the sections of the treaty in 1908 which authorized negotiations with Canada to establish the line through 3. ' assamaquoddy Bay . Mr. Hale was employed ' for this work , performed his duties to , the satisfaction of Secretary Root , and Secretary Knox approved his bill of $5.000 a few weeks after coming into control of the State Department .

" When he failed to reach an agreement With Great Britain , the matter automatically went to arbitration . Congress then appropriated $15 ; 000 for ' that work , but Mr. Bryce and I sat , n my office one , day and settled the matter , not regarding it of enough value to go to the expense of arbitration .
