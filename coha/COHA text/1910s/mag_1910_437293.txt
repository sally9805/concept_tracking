I HAVE been asked many shrewd questions in my day . A seemingly eternal one is : ' Why do n't you write about Art I only wish I could ? if I could do so like Sir Joshua Reynolds or Sir Frederick Leighton or a La Farge ; but I can not . The art is there , but it is not the art of writing , and that is the real truth and ought to prevent the question being asked . I could indeed swell up a little , but I could not stay swelled al ) . There is another reason ; namely , my belief that a boy will follow a band when he will not follow advice . Therefore should I write of Art , I should in- ite my friends to something more like a circus than a sermon . Yet the art would be there , and the love of it , and , I should hope , the boys also . et I envy these men ; I mean with a noble envy , a mixture of admiration and regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am like the turtle who , I dare say , would not change his own snug shell for another ( even if the other were encrusted with diamonds and decorations ) if it did not tit him . How is this : you start to write about Art and end by writing about yourself ? That is what I started out to do . Somewhat egotistical ? Yes , very . A good likeness ? Fairly good ? of one side of me . When a boy , in one of my foolish moments , I remarked to my brother that when I became a man I hoped I might have a son who would turn out to be a great artist . Why , Ell , ' said he , why do n't you try to become one yourself ? ' This gave me something to think on , and I did try . If an artist is a man who makes his living out of his art , and if the boy is father to the man , I have succeeded in carrying out part of the programme at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that has nothing whatever to do with art . With some it is business talent , with me it has been pure good luck , and it is lucky it is so . ART-PRATTLING It is all folly , this seeking to limit the function of art to any particular form . Anything , in whatever form or combination of forms , which can cause those forever separate but forever living , striving self-atoms , each with its little speck of soul and immortality , to draw near together , is its true , highest and only cause for being , and will forever be the answer to that eternal discontent of the non-creator or non-producer . Anything which breaks down the barrier of body and allows one soul to see another face to face and vibrate in unison , is legitimate art enough for me . Amen . Art education should be strictly confined to the imparting of knowledge , such as perspective ( for there is as much perspective in a face as there is in a facade ) , training the eye to see , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter the artist should be at school all his life . As for style , that should be strictly the result of a man 's striving to express his individuality , his desires , his emotions , and his thoughts . There is no more delightful profession than that of the artist ; it makes a round man , and should be a portion of every man 's training . There is nothing like it , and I think nothing better ; and , I may add , there is nothing more utterly useless than this kind of talk . It is strange what an unaccountable disinclination I feel toward prattling about Art ; strange , for it is done with such ease and so well by others . To fumble about this thought like Goldsmith ! It may come from my inability to prattle about Art , from the fact that I do not know how to prattle about it , from my never having had much practice in prattling about Art . In any case , there will be little lost but what can be well spared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing the benevolent eye averted or turned to one of menace . Old Cenino Cenini had a very crisp way of dismissing a subject . When he had told you how to make charcoal for drawing , he would end by saying , ' This is enough for you to know about charcoal . ' I say the same , only substituting Art for char. coal . By the way , there is a good deal of most excellent art in charcoal . ART ON A FULL STOMACH Had I as many dollars as there have been made definitions of what constitutes Art , I do not say I should be a multi-millionaire , but I should be well on the way to that modest but assured income I have been sighing for so long , As one definition more or less can do no harm , I also will venture to make one . Art is a beautiful body for a beautiful thought . I will also venture an assertion : that Art began on a full stomach . That cave-dweller who sketched , with a flint on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those reindeer and that hairy arctic elephant , did it when safely entrenched in his cave after a successful hunt , in a leisure moment and on a full stomach ; so that , if the origin of things has any value , the theory that artists only work from necessity goes all to pot . So the South Sea Islander decorates his paddle , and , needing no clothes , tattoos his skin with beautiful patterns , driven to it , not by fear er hunger , but by the same spirit which creates in every tribe the ruler , the soldier , the priest , and the medicine-man ; the same spirit which creates the bard and the artist . But the artist does not wait until the world is full of art-schools , but ( once his stomach full ) goes to work , decorating a paddle or canoe ; nor does the bard wait until he has gone through college , but without dictionary and ignorant of philology sings the war-songs of his nation . Having such theories , you can see why I am not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why I fuss so little about it . I suppose I am all wrong as usual , but so much good Art ens done without all this boosting that I may be pardoned if I doubt its , , neat utility . Still I have no doubt ; hater er that we shall get , in time and in our own way , just the Art which In , t expresses us , and just the Art we want and deserve . The moral is ? rued the artist . Do n't invite a few to dinner , leaving the rest to come in with the coffee , but invite them all and see what pretty reindeer they can draw , metaphorically speaking , on a full stomach . You will , of course , provide pencils and paper . There was once some pretty shrewd hiii , iness done on the Rialto ; it was a two and a pretty scene , not a fussy one like Wall Street . But I dare say Art still come even to Wall Street , when all are fed ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are full . And that is the trouble . Our men say : First let us make money enough and then we w ill attend to the house beautiful . lint t he time never comes , or when it does t hey have to get some one to attend to the house for them , and he overdoes it . I am not pitching into any one or anything except exaggeration ; I ca n't abide exaggeration . That is a mild ending , but it was not the original ending . The original ending was more like the fireworks after a mild Capri day . You finish your dinner , go out under the large arches of t he Loggia , light your cigar , and wait for the first rocket . It gets darker and darker , but finally the rocket comes suddenly and sheds a weird light over everything . So here comes the real ending , which I cut out ? you will see why . Having such theories , etc. , you can , ee why I am not anxious to become a president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor in one of those art-kindergartens . ' John , you Nov remove the medals ? but leave the cakes and ale , please , ' ? and thusit is . I have some good friend occupying every one of the positions enumerated above ; so even though I am writing in fun , can I leave in such sentiments ? Of course not ; so I cut them all out , and only put them in again as fireworks . ART AND NECESSITY While recommending for artists the desirability of a modest but assured income , I neglected a digression which would have come in very appropriately , and I now make up for that omission . When I was young it was held that poverty was essential to the artist ; that he would not work without it ; also that he was invariably poor and lived in a garret . When I followed my bent and became an artist I felt that , like St. Francis , I was espousing poverty ; and when I married , I supposed that the bride had espoused poverty in person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dying . Let any one look into the matter carefully and he will find that almost every notable artist has been very fortunately situated ; either his parents have been well-off , or if poor , his poverty has given him a freedom from the interruptions of society which has amply made up for a little temporary discomfort . Take the case of Masaccio . Picked up out of the gutter he may have been , but the good monks put him at once into the shop or bottega of one of the best Florentine masters , where , free from the trammels of dress and afternoon teas , he could work out his salvation without interruptions . The freedom of outright poverty is well illustrated in the case of two men I know . One , much against his will , urged by well-meaning friends , did his duty by society ; but the thing being against his nature , he did it badly ; so , having wasted a whole winter for fear of missing a possible purchaser , he at last broke away from the studio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-expected purchaser called , and called , as we knew , with the express intention of getting a picture . The other , disregarding all advice , clung to his liberty , and employed it to such good purpose that soon rich men took the trouble of mounting his one hundred steps to secure a specimen of his work . I advise my young friend , then , first to acquire the business habit , then get into the Paris mill . Select a master who does what he can do most easily and avoids what he can not do so well , turn the handle , and you ? the student ? will come out safe . If you have anything in you it will be developed , and no harm done ; although I did hear an honest man once say , ' I wish to God I could get rid of that smart , cocksure , Beaux-Arts style of mine . ' However , like my old aunt Eveline , I make no comment . ' ART AND BUSINESS I have always maintained and held forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the beauty , merit , advisability , morality , and great utility , of a modest but assured income . It prevents envy on the one hand , arrogance on the other , and , I am persuaded , goes as far toward establishing a person pleasantly in the next world , as it undoubtedly does in this . Of those who possess this inestimable advantage , nothing need be said ; they are simply to be envied . Let then the young artist procure a modest but assured income . This is accomplished by a careful selection of his parents , although an Indian uncle ? now rare ? has been known to do as well . If they are not successful , they are at least safe , and so nothing more need be said about them . The nest best thing is to be born with the business instinct . Such also are safe ; but to be born an artist , and in addition with the business instinct , is assured success . I would most strongly urge , in the case of those born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business college as an indispensable preliminary to their artistic career ; for although you can not make business men of them , you may make successful artists . The combination of riches , genius , and busi. ness talent is too good to be true ; it would be a trust , and spell greatness . A painter who possessed the business talent determined that while following his profession he would first make money and then paint what he pleased . He succeeded in regard to the money , and seemed pleased with regard to the painting . This painter once made this remarkable remark : Why , V. , your studio is full of things which a little work would turn into property . ' Struck by the wisdom of this simple statement , I at once determined to put it into practice , and so from time to time have finished several sketches and other things . I have them yet . At this time there lived next door to me an Italian painter , a good artist and a good man ; I know this because he confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him of this business discovery , and like a good propagandist , before I had put the advice in practice myself , urged him to finish up his sketches and pictures , and particularly to sign everything . He at once did so , and going to South America shortly after , died . At his sale , the widow had ample cause to thank me for my good advice . This about signing : I once had an exhibition and sale , mostly of little landscapes , street-scenes , etc. , painted at Monte Cologniola . It was really quite a success , and as the boy at the gapery said , ' They went off like hot cakes . ' I mention the boy , for it having been found that I had neglected to in a single picture , and purchasers insisting upon it , the boy was constantly bringing to the studio of a friend near by , batches of pictures for my signature . The boy was wild with delight ; praise , and ' going like hot cakes ' made it an exhilarating time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their immediate reward . A glamour seemed to surround me ; that others felt the glamour you may judge from the fact that ' admittance ' was charged and went to swell the already high per cent of the dealers . The young lady who received the admission money , a sweet , pretty girl , I can tell you , under the effect doubtless of the glamour , whispered to me that she wished to say something to me in private , but could not do so in the gallery . I became interested and told her that as it was near the closing hour , I would wait for her down the street . We met , and I gallantly escorted her to a retired ice-cream saloon . Nothing can be more proper than ice-cream . Then she said that she could stand it no longer to see how they were taking in the admission money , and I not getting a cent , and that she thought it her duty to let me know the state of affairs and begged me not to think badly of her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear girl ! ' ? this was not said coldly , ? ' I shall always hold you a true friend , ' ? also adding other things . Not long afterwards I received her wedding cards and a newspaper cutting ; she had married very well , and has to this day my warm wishes for her happiness . RABBIA REMESSA The Italians have a very expressive pression , rabbia remessa , anger put back or stowed away , and they consider it a very bad thing for the health , and so mostly sfogare themselves , or let their temper out pretty thoroughly , on the spot . One day when I was a very little boy , on my way to school in Schenectady , the men at Clute 's Foundry were throwing snowballs . As I turned to look at them , a snowball struck me on the mouth , and cut my lips , causing them to bleed freely . The pain , the sight of the blood , and above all , the contrast between my size and that of the great bullies , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of swearing prevented my sfogaring myself as I should have done ; and so all this rage was put back into my system , from which it has been coming out , little by little , ever since . This corning out I find a great help in painting . As perhaps there may be some one who has not heard the story of the Dutch painter , I tell it . A person calling on this painter heard a most infernal uproar in his studio : things seemed to be falling , and brass plates flying about , and words as of swearing were heard . The servant came to the door in a state of great anxiety , and told the visitor at once that the master could not be disturbed . I should think he could n't be , much more than he is , ' said the visitor , but what in heaven 's name is the matter ? ' ' He is painting a sky . ' I should not recommend this practice except in the case of skies . I have found it useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , weary and hot from his long summer day 's work up town , was wending his way to the South Ferry . His home was on Staten Island . In anticipation of the cooling breeze on the Bay , with dripping brow he stopped to refresh himself frequently , but in vain ? for it was a very hot day . His last stop brought him opposite a ready-made clothing establishment , and the idea struck him that his comparatively thick coat was responsible for his discomfort . Acting on this thought , he stepped across the street and asked the intelligent attendant if he had anything in the way of a coat more suitable to the season than the one he was wearing ? something he could put on at once and that would fit ? ' Let me see , let me see , ' said the man , ' I think I have just the thing in alpaca ' ; and after a careful survey of our friend 's figure he turned and cried with a loud voice , ' James ! bring me a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a neat package , which the purchaser said he would carry himself , for being a suburbanite he had been feeling strange going home without his usual bundle . When relating this incident he remarked to a friend that he had always wondered what he was like , but that now his doubts were set at rest . ' I know what I look like and what I am ; I am a number five ? fat . ' He had found his formula . MUD PIES I have just been looking over a book of criticisms of myself and my work , a thing I have carefully avoided doing for years . I find that I have much to be thankful for , and much that combines amusement with instruction . I find much attributed to me that I have never thought of , and much which my critics have never thought of at all . On the whole , I have been treated far better than I deserve , and so fully that there is nothing left for me to say about myself . I once defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse is truth stated in an unpleasant manner . I give an example of abuse which , while amusing , contains a lo ; of truth , only the manner leaves some . thing to be desired . I can only give a few of the good things the writer sets before the reader ; the article is quite long and sprightly . ' The exhibition is an unfortunate showing . Some dozen landscapes are so unspeakably bad that it seems in. credible they should be hung under any name ; devoid of line , color , quality , and everything that belongs to a picture . . .. He has an accurate knowledge of drawing which he does not always use this is quite true , ? and no sense of color at any time I object to that ' any time ' . Therefore his black-and-white work is his best , and his best black-and-white work is that in which his knowledge of drawing is displayed . And this is all there is to it . . .. As for the " Imagination , " the " Allegory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving after , it is well known that he and the school he has followed and the cult they have spawned , are entirely away from any ground connection , and that it is only a matter of time before work of such unbalanced character is given again its right name . . . . " Cup of Death , " simply ridiculous ? " Negro " ? white turban ? leading heavy woman in pink down to stream ? offering five-o'clock teacup to her mouth ! " Soul between Doubt and Faith " ? three heads ? centre , dark sullen woman ? right , light woman , pink wings ? left , old man , gray worsted beard . The " Lazarus " and " Sibyl " are monstrosities , ' and so forth and so on . Then he becomes real serious and says , ' But the man at his best is seen in the fine lines of the " Cup of Love , " with all its blemishes ; in the masterly drawing of " Fortune " ; in the movement in " Gathering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other effort here exhibited , and to get over one 's depth in the murky stream of the Unreal is next to Mud . ' You see he ends with a truth . I presume he meant to say , ' is next to being in the mud . ' How much nicer , with all its blemishes , ' is my way of making a living than his . ' May his food profit him ! ' I am but human , and must say that I prefer my friend Brownell 's treatment of the ' Lazarus ' to that of this mud-puddler of the Press . I can not give it all , but give his last finely sustained sentence : ' In the presence of such a representation in pigment of a living soul of such sweetness , such dignity , such tranquil pensiveness , such pathetic and moving serenity , such a visible record of mysterious yet not awful spiritual experience secretly cherished and intimately sustaining ? in the presence of such food for the mind as this , the impressionist who should suggest the shibboleth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious intelligence , nay , by any person of good breeding , to go his way and solace his sterility with the shallowness of his sensuous gospel . ' The contrast in manner is rather striking . Perhaps my art needs the eye of a friend . What of it ? There are , o many arts that for the sake of variety an art of my kind comes in rather well . It reminds me of an incident which happened to W. W. Story . He and a friend were standing behind a priest in St. Peter 's , who held in his hand one of those long shovel-shaped Spanish hats , and they waxed mighty merry- over it , making suggestions as to what various uses it could be put to . When they had exhausted the theme , the priest turned and gravely said to them in the best of English , ' Gentle-run , I am gratified that my hat has afforded you so much amusement . ' Most people only see my hat or my cap , for when I am not wearing a hat I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in trying to get at the brandied cherry which lurks in the bottom of a cocktail , it is apt to fall off . After all , the artist is only expressing his delight in something , and striving to share his joy with another ; at least I think that is what I was made for ? and not to deceive or injure some such innocent writer as he of the ' Mud puddle . ' After what he has said , the present is past praying for , but he might have left me the future . He must remember that some day he will stand in the presence of his Maker , and ? pause ? has he a Maker ? Perhaps God has forgotten what He made him for . To make mud pies ? Perhaps so . SOMETHING ABOUT SCULPTURE One might compare the flight of the eagle with that of the fly , and draw from the comparison an all , except that after a long and stately flight the alighting is apt to be confused or a little ridiculous . The fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may alight with the utmost ease . One flight is noble but monotonous ; the other , varied but frivolous . The flight I propose is neither the one nor the other . It is only intended for those who know less than I do . Were I writing to an equal it would be to show him that I am such , or , as we all differ , to point out to him the difference ; if to a superior , ' t would be to show him that he is not so awfully superior , and that in some things perhaps I am his equal , or to take him down a peg . It is a strange thing about sculpture that ordinary people can endure to read pages about Michelangelo , and yet can settle the question of his ' Moses ' in sixty seconds . Let me help them to think a little . Finding themselves in a darkened chamber lit by a single candle , let them take some object , and holding it so that the light may cross it slantingly or graze its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never dreamed of . It is thus the designer of the hull of a yacht proceeds when making his model . Now , as in sculpture those inequalities thus brought out represent underlying muscles , bones , or things of importance , the reader may imagine the task that the sculptor has before him , and realize how , like a fly , he has as yet only alighted on the skin . Thus a man in the broad light of day may appear without defects , when by the light of the domestic candle he is found full of them . Now it often happens that the beginner , modeling carefully a leg , for example , by the concentrated light of his studio window , while perfecting the forms as he goes , and slowly turning the revolving stand , finds , when he gets to the place where he began , that the forms do not fit ; this is called chasing an outline , and is only one of his many troubles . He finds he has to be omnipresent , as it were , comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sculptor has his work cut out ' for him in constantly solving difficulties of which the public has no idea . Now , coming to the entire figure , we find it has two legs , no more , no less , and that viewed from the side , these coming together , one hiding somewhat the other , we see a certain meagreness , a weak point in the figure viewed as a mass , which is precisely one of the difficulties the sculptor has to contend with . Take St. Gaudens 's Puritan , ' for example : he goes sturdily on his way , with his Bible under his arm and big stick in hand , prepared to preach or pommel , while his ample cloak floats bravely to the breezecreated by his own determined stride . A fine conception ; but viewed from the side , we see the legs together and then see how the big stick helps to strengthen the base and support the heavy masses above , and also by that time the cloak is seen edgewise , and no longer presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amply sustained by the two legs and the staff . Thus the sculptor , like the Puritan , whips the devil round the stump . We have thus far only treated of the single figure ; fancy the difficulties in making a group . As for the painters , they also have their troubles ' cut out ' for them , in spite of their glittering generalities . Take design , for instance , a subject Kenyon Cox has treated so thoroughly and so much better than I can , that I turn the reader over to him . Here I imagine my friend who is inferior to me in knowledge saying , Well , you have shown that a sculptor can not make , with all those difficulties against him , a perfect statue . ' My answer is , Who ever said he could ? MODELS AND STYLE There once came over the face of a little model in Rome , who was posing for me , an expression of such passionate yearning ( an expression as soulful as that seen in the beauty with bandaged chin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth are you thinking of ? ' I am wondering if it is eleven o'clock yet . ' Anderlini was a Florentine model of the old days . He had received the rudiments of an education , and used to boast that he had studied the humanities . ' Instead of which it was noticed that little things , such as matches and cigars , used to disappear in the studios where he worked . One night when he was posing in Galli 's Accademia , and all were working in silence , some one remarked aloud , Anderlini , they say you steal ; that you are little better than a thief ; how is this ? ' ' / , a thief ! I , steal ! ? Impossible ! ' Yes , they say little things will distil/Pear where you work . ' ' Ah , yes ; little things , perhaps . I see a cigar , ? I would not think of stealing that cigar ; I merely take it . There is a great difference between robbery and taking . I am incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , which after all is only a little momentary weakness . ' Strange how I remember the name of another Florentine model ? Brina . He MILS perfectly honest and perfectly uninteresting . There were not many models in Florence then , ? quite different from Rome , in which there were almost too many . They say that now they are not lacking in New York . It teas not always so , for I remember needing a model on one of my visits . I asked if there were any , and was always answered , ' Yes ' ; but it invariably turned out to be a certain Miss X or one other . I sent for the other , and the young lady cane , ? most frigidly respectable . When she was ready , she asked coldly : ' Will you please tell me what position I am to assume ? ' ? Good Lord ! I felt like telling her to throw a back somersault or a handspring , ? anything to break the chill . I think she could never have posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented as ' turning sadly , as she placed her hand on the knob of the door . ' One does n't want a circus , either . I do n't know what one wants , ? something human , at least . I know I did n't want the ' other . ' How the Italian models open their eyes when told of the prices paid models at home . Judging by results , they must be worthy of their hire , for in the way of illustrations I can imagine nothing better than the work now done . I once had occasion to reprove an Italian model for having listened too credulously to the fascinating pleading of a seductive admirer . You knew he was lying to you , ' I said . Yes ; but then , he lied so beautifully ! ' That was Style . The word is now Style , and it reminds me of those writers who seem to live in some secluded cloister or garden of thought , through which they saunter leisurely , in an atmosphere of over-ripe scholarship , culling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orchard , with which , together with the knurly result of their own culture , they furnish forth their table , offering a repast more ostentatious than nourishing . In fact , I think that a writer 's great acquirements often stand between him and the reader , and I seem to get nearer to nature through Shakespeare the unlearned , than through Ben Jonson the learned , and infinitely nearer both man and God in the pages of Job , than if they had been written by a graduate of Cambridge or Oxford or Yale or Harvard . These writers give one the impression that ' something very important is going on , ' even when such is not the case ; and , indeed , take all things , including themselves , so seriously that they should be prosecuted for trespassing on the domain of the quaint Goddess Fun , were it not that they are quite unconscious how funny they are . The above looks like a very long postscript , you say ; but I do n't care , ? ' ith no one nigh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not myself ; it may be funny taken either way . But what a relief to turn to the refined writer from that atmosphere of the Western story , heavily laden with slang and pregnant with revolvers and murders , where the impression is given that some one is going to be shot every five minutes . SYSTEM I am fond of system . I often try to put my life and studio in order ; but then I need some one to keep things in order , for when a fellow has so much to do , and at the same time has to act as body-servant or valet to a pretty particular old man , he has his hands full . Some men are capable of it . I know of one who cut up his canvas and paper into what he called ' my little thirty by forty , or fifty by sixty , ' ? for so he designated the pictures which were sure to follow . When he went on an outing , all he had to do was to say , ' Thirty days hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew just how many pictures and watercolors he was going to bring back . And so he ordered before leaving just so many frames and passe-partouts , and set a date for a gallery , and when he got back the sale took place without a day 's delay . He once said to me , ? and it was good advice , ' Now , if you have three pictures for sale , do n't ask a hundred dollars apiece ; that shows that you do n't think much of yourself ; but ask three hundred apiece . It is easier to sell one picture than three ; and asking three hundred dollars makes people think that there must be something in them . So you sell your one , and have two left to send to exhibitions in other cities . ' Leighton was great on system . He wants some pomegranate blossoms for a picture ( for whatever flower went into a picture by Leighton was sure to be a handsome one ) , and he hies him to Italy and makes his studies . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London in the morning , takes his bath , his breakfast , his cigar and rest , and at precisely half-past one walks into his studio and finds his model waiting by previous appointment . I should like to make an oral or writ- ten comment , but breath fails me and my brain reels . Well , V. , do you or do you not like system ? I do n't know ; I am only writing for fun , and there does seem something funny about it , ? do n't you think so ? THE FLY-SPECK I presume most of my readers bans the story of the Hebrew scholars and jot or tittle . This jot or tittle is a dot used in writing Hebrew , which modifies the sense or pronunciation of words , and is of great importance , for the Good Book warns us that we may have a hot time if we tamper with it . Now certain wise men , finding one in the Scrip . tures which changed the meaning of a sentence , thus giving a new reading , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of settling some things , ? when one whose spectacles were better than those of his confreres discovered the jot to be no other than a fly-speck . A friend , writing to me , says that something reminded him of my fly-speck story . At first I could not remember being the happy possessor of a fly-speck story , but gradually it came to me that I did once tell at the Club something which seemed to revolve on a fly-speck , and which is my story beyond a doubt , It is this : In Perugia there was a certain Count Meniconi who owned two beautiful little pictures . Wishing to sell them , and thinking that perhaps it might help him to do so , he kindly allowed me to copy them both . Were they mine , I should most certainly hold them to be the work of Rafaello when young . Of course they are like Perugino , but an owner can see beauties hidden from others . One represents a St. Christopher with the Bambino on his shoulder ; the other a most delightful young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender cross . The face of the St. John is remarkable for the great sweet ness of the expression . This ex-presstot - I labored over , and had almost given up all hope of catching it , when discovered that it was owing to none other than a fly-speck near the corner of the mouth . Imitating this casual cork of the fly , I succeeded in getting perfectly the expression . I had the pictures photographed , and sent the Count as many copies of them as he desired . Some time afterward , a gentleman called at my studio in the Via Marotta , and on glancing at his card , I saw that he also was a count , of the noble and ancient family of the Malatpstas of Rimini .

Everybody must have seen in FlorMee , tinder the Loggie of the Uffizi Gallery , the statue of that Florentine worthy , Gino Capponi .

' BEAUTIES AND DEFECTS There is an old woodcut representing an accountant seated at his desk by an open window . A sudden gust of wind is carrying away the bills through it , while all that remains in his frantic grasp are the pennies and small change . The legend underneath reads , ' Take care of the pennies , and the pounds will take care of themselves . ' This may do in finance , but in Art it admits of a doubt . ' Take care of the beauties and let the defects take care of themselves , ' sounds better , and I wish to heaven I had written it and hung it up in my studio , framed like those texts we used to see similarly treated in many homes . Had Bellini , in those charming little pictures attributed to him , stopped to correct all their manifest defects , I fear we should have been deprived of a permanent pleasure . I mean those little things in which Truth with her mirror is represented of an uncertain age and more uncertain proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite inadequate to bear with safety its charming occupant , and the great globe and the little loves . I know this opens the way for those who can not draw , to Corot 's ' hovering ' ; and for those who are incapable of feeling and expression , to Millet 's expressionless faces , in those instances where he has paid more attention to the expression of the sleeve of a knit jacket , for instance , than to the expression on the face of its wearer ; or to the clever penman , relying on the impeccable line of Aubrey Beardsley and nothing else , and so forth and so on . I know ( to change Blake 's saying slightly ) ' the lazy will turn this into laziness , ' but the intelligent will follow this advice : Go for beauties with all thy might , and the defects will take care of themselves . The love and the warmth of Burns make him dearer to us than if he had been a pale , cold , lifeless , funereal urn of perfection . THE TOSCANO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an equally worthy Friar , offered him a pinch of snuff . The Friar refused with thanks , and at the same time thanked God that he had not acquired that vice . Whereupon the Pope remarked that he had better get it , as it went so well with his others . I have always been thankful that 1 acquired the vice of smoking early in life in Cuba , thus saving much valuable time . I have given the - toscano , a great favorite in Italy , many names , ? such as ' gravel-scratcher , ' ' test of manhood , ' ' bed-rocker , ' etc. , ? for in way of smoking you can no lower go . But the best name for it is the last refuge of man . ' For I firmly believe that although woman has taken possession of the realm of the cigarette , she will never invade the kingdom of the toscano . Here man reigns supreme and may well nail his flag to the toscano . But we must distinguish carefully between the toscano and the fair Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new arrival , who seeks in vain to smoke it without previously withdrawing the little reedlike straw . The likeness between them may be best described as that between the muffin and the crumpet . I once asked an Englishman what was the difference between a muffin and a crumpet , and he said he held the crumpet to be the female of the muffin . This also just describes the relationship of the toscano and our stogie . When , on my visits home , unable to obtain my favorite , I have hailed with delight the stogie , but must confess that it was something like revisiting the pale glimpses of the moon . However , I was delighted with the native stogie as a substitute , and sought to introduce it to those of the Club , pointing out how heartrending a thing it was to throw away a good Havana ( when barely begun ) , merely to catch the train , when an inexpensive stogie would do as well . I taught my friends how to cut them in two , thus getting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in private , that humiliating look of economy might be avoided . I believe my propaganda took effect , and that these catch the trains ' are smoked to this day , in private ; but , on account of the humiliating look , only in private . The toscano is an alleged cigar , six and one-eighth inches long . Like Whistler , ' I have measured it . ' It is always cut in two by the judicious , for very good reasons : it draws better ; it gives two short smokes ; you smoke less ; and as it has been called strong , while you may waste the cigar , you save the man . Again , as the fair girls ? who ' confertionate ' it , being of a merry turn of mind , frequently mingle with the fn-grant leaf , hairpins , toothpicks , and oggetti too numerous to mention , ? so the cutting discloses forthwith this plan of having fun at your expense . Yet , as the Messagero receives specimens and publishes lists of things found in toocani , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranks after all . Now as to how the man is saved . The custom is to cut off the two hard ends ; these go to deserving models and studio-men ; to the studio-man also goes the stump , which he dries and smokes in a pipe , or sends to his old father in the country . You only smoke about an inch of each half , or two inches of the cigar . This moderation saves the man , if it does waste the cigar . I smoke about five a day ; that does the business for me , and would most certainly do the business for many a tall fellow . Him more observation : the stumps of /woo , : thrown away in the street are 1/01111 ( 0 ( 1 upon by an uncertain class , ? much as the sea-gulls pounce on the refuse thrown from a steamer ; but I hate noticed that the stump of a Ha ana is passed unnoticed by those who readily stoop to that of a toscano. . lichelangelo , when a very old man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colosseum . In my opinion , he was only loafing and waiting his op-port unity . A friend , finding him , said : ' Buon ' giorno ' ; to which the old man at once replied , ? That 's not right ; you must ask me , " Cosa fai ? " What are you doing ? ' else what becomes of my celebrated answer , " I am still studying " ? ' Should any one ask me at this moment the same question , I should answer , ' Smoking and thinking . ' Q. What are you thinking about ? A. My life . Q. And what do you make of it ? A. An unfinished sketch . After which I would throw away the mezzo toscano , well knowing that I had lots of them in reserve .
