 | DID you ever see a wigwag man on the deck of a manof-war making foolish motions with little colored flags ? Did you ever observe a brakeman or conductor flapping his arms with the antics of a cockerel , or a surveyor pawing the air and making a human semaphore of himself , or a deaf and dumb man reciting " Curfew shall not ring to-night , " or a man getting past the inside guard at a lodge meeting , or two Indians talking to each other in grunts , or see a hen tell her brood with her feet that she has found a worm , or try to understand a Frenchman by his shrugs , or an Englishman by the different inflections of " Really , " or translate the varying inflections of a German 's " So " ? If you have observed all these things and understand them you will be able easily to master the system of coaching used in major league baseball games . Baseball has no Volapuk . Each team has its different system of coaching , its different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no one man can hope to learn them all . The worst of trying to study the sign language of the game , by which the coachers from the little spaces near first and third bases give or trasmit the orders for plays , lies in the fact that the sign languages change rapidly , often being altered or entirely  |p464  changed in a day . If Arlie Latham jumps into the air and screams " Hold your base ! " it may mean " Steal second " to-day and tomorrow it may mean " Hit and run . " One never can tell what a sign means . Hughie Jennings hoists his right knee as high as his shoulder , pulls six blades of grass and Delehanty bunts . You are certain that Jennings signaled him to sacrifice , so the next day when Cobb is at bat and Jennings goes through the same motions ; you creep forward and Cobb hits the ball past you so fast you ca n't see it . If Connie flack tilts his hat over his eyes and Eddie Collins steals second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the hat , and lo , Barry plays hit and run . You hear Clark Griffith yelp " Watch his foot ! " and see two of his players start a double steal . The next time he yells " Watch his foot ! " you break your neck to cover the base , and both players stand still . Some players and most spectators give up striving to learn the sign language of the game and just play ball without trying to anticipate moves or to prepare for the style of attack . You must n't do that . Some day , right in the middle of a game , you 'll strike the key to the language and read it through clear to the ninth inning , and if you do ? well , its like golf . Get away one good drive and forever afterward you are its victim . You may not catch it again for a month , but the pleasure of watching the working of the brains that direct the movements of those athletic puppets will repay the lost time . Perhaps you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaling ; that the two men out there near first and third bases who seem to be making fools of themselves or trying to annoy the majestic man in blue serge , are the wigwag men signaling to runners or batters just what the general sitting on the bench wants them to try to do . Sometimes the general is on the lines himself , looking just as foolish as the wigwag men , or more so ; but somewhere , hidden in his meaningless or hackneyed phrases , or his wild gestures , there is a meaning . He is telling the batter not to hit the next ball , or to bunt it , or informing him that the next will be a straight fast ball , and at the same time informing the base runner that the batter intends to hit and that he must start at top speed when the pitcher starts to wind up . Did you ever watch Hugh Jennings on the coaching line near first base ( luring a hardfought game ? He doubles his fists , lifts one leg and shakes his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooping suddenly plucks at the grass , pecking at it like a hen . It looks foolish . I have heard spectators express wonder that a man of ability and nearing middle age could act so childishly . Yet hidden somewhere in the fantastic contortions and gestures of the Tigers ' leader there is a meaning , a code word or signal that tells his warriors what he expects them to do . Jennings does not hesitate to tell his system , because he changes it so frequently that attempts to read it are more likely to result in disaster than in gain . He would rather the opposition knew his system in general , and the difficulties of combating it in particular , than to have them know nothing , and keep up confusion by making continual experiments . " I change almost every day , " says Jennings . " I change every time I suspect there is danger of the meanings being read . I am a believer in as few signals as possible and of giving them when they count , and I find that a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opposing players get tired of trying to see me give a signal , and usually if I have any important order to give I can yell it at the top of my voice and no one would notice . I like to rely upon the judgment of the men themselves , provided I can find men who have judgment . But there are some who must be signaled . Suppose a batter is up with one ball and one strike called and I discover what ball is to be pitched and desire to inform the hitter . I have been yelling and kicking and playing clown . I yell L-yah ! ' but in a different tone from that I used before . The batter knows I want him to look for a signal . I may kick my foot in the air three times , meaning Let the next one go , ' or pull four blades of grass , meaning Hit the next one . ' " It is a big aid to the batter to know what is wanted and what the base runner is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players shall not even know that a signal has been-passed . If they realize that I have given a signal , even if they do not know what it is , they will guess correctly three out of four times from the situation and cross us . " Connie Mack , the most successful bench manager in baseball , signals from the bench to the coachers , sometimes to the runner or batter direct . He uses the position of his hat on his head to convey meaning to the players , and opposing players have studied for years without getting a clue to what his signals mean . Often they mistake signals , and Mack once won a game from Chicago by pull-  |p465  ing down his hat to keep the sun out of his eyes . The act was mistaken for a bunt order , the batter hit , and won the game . Mack is known in the business as one of the most successful men at seeing and interpreting the signals of his opponents . Before the , Chicago Cubs went into their disastrous series against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible Mack would have their signals . At the end of the second game they called a meeting to revise signals , changing entirely , being certain the Athletics knew almost every kind of ball that was going to be pitched . I doubt it . The Cubs argued that the Athletic batters knew what was to be pitched because they set themselves to hit every time a straight ball was pitched . The Chicago pitchers were far off form during the series , and I base my doubts chiefly on the fact that Cobb , who sat near me , repeatedly called the turn on the ball that would be pitched before it was thrown , judging from the pitcher 's motion , and the Athletics may have been doing the same thing . Hartsel , who is one of Mack 's principal lieutenants in coaching , and himself a clever man at catching signals , was on the lines during most , of the games . Kling was charged with carelessness by his own fellows in exposing his signals in several instances . Signaling runners and batters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p466  ever , is not all the duty of a coacher . They are the directors of play who must tell the runner whether to come or go back , whether to take two bases on a hit or stop at one . The rule makers have just been discussing a reform which will lessen the work of the coachers and at the same time purify and better the game . In my estimation the physical assistance of any active player by the coacher is the most unsportmanlike act in a game . The rule makers now purpose penalizing any act of that sort . Under the rules , or rather under the tacit permission of umpires , coachers have been permitted to stop runners and assist them in returning to a base by physical means , tackling them and dragging them back to safety when they threatened to run wild . That created a demand for strong men to coach at third base , men capable of hauling a runner back to the bag , when he persisted in going on . This should not be permitted . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster actor , for upon him , perhaps two or three times during each struggle , the fate of the game depends . Clark Griffith estimated that in 1910 his team lost nine games through errors of the coachers ? and if any regular player had lost that many individu ally by bad judgment he would have been expelled . Upon the coacher depends the decisions as to whether the runner shall stop or keep on . He must decide when the runner is halfway between bases and transmit the order so quickly that the runner may make the turn at full speed and without hesitating . If the coacher waits until the runner slackens speed , the opportunity and perhaps the game is lost . A runner , especially after he turns second base , seldom knows where the ball is and relies implicitly upon the signals of the coacher . The play is behind him and he can not waste time to turn his head to-see what is happening in the field . It is an odd and peculiar fact that the cleverest baseball team in America , composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid less attention to active coaching on the base lines than any other club . This was the Chicago " Cubs . " The coaching department was almost entirely neglected . Possibly the reason was the confidence in their own judgment and their continued success . Chance 's men made few blunders and the neglect was not noticeable , except to constant observers , until 1908 . Any player who happened to be idle went to the coaching lines and most of the time inexperienced  |p467  substitutes did line duty . In 1908 , during their fierce fight for the pennant , the realization of their carelessness was brought home to them and since then Chance has employed quick-thinking , clever men on the base lines , principally relying upon Beaumont and Kane . What did more to call Chance 's attention to this defect in his team work than anything else was a bit of coaching that came near turning victory into a tie in one of the most sensational games of the season of sensations . Mathewson and Brown were engaged in a wonderful pitchers ' duel before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if neither ever could score against the magnificent manipulation of the ball by the two master artists of the league . With one out Tinker , who alone of the Chicago club hits Mathewson hard , drove a terrific line hit to left center into the corner of the field . The crowd went wild . Tinker sprinted around to third . It looked as if he could walk to the plate , but suddenly Zimmerman , who was coaching at third base , leaped in front of the runner , tackled him and strove to drag him back to the bag . Tinker fought , struggled , broke away finally and raced on , beating the ball to the plate and scoring the run that gave the Cubs a 1 to o victory . And Zimmerman 's excuse was that he was blinded by the sun and thought Tinker would be caught . The time was 4 P.M. , and Tinker was batting due east . After that Chance began to develop scientific coaching and , discovering its full value , took the lead in the matter , employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the old days , the days of Tebeau , coaching was less an art of striving to assist runners than it was to " rattle " the opposing pitcher and excite the crowd , relying upon the effect of the uproar and the sudden rising tide of enthusiasm to shake or dishearten the opposition . There still remains that element in coaching , although it has been suppressed to a large degree . The veterans still rely upon the psychological effect of noisy enthusiasm , but they are discarding it more and more . When a young pitcher , inexperienced and nervous , takes the slab , the coachers at once concentrate their attention upon him ; but they no longer dare risk the verbal assaults that used to be common . The greatest advance in sportmanship in the last decade of baseball was made when the umpires were instructed to suppress coachers who addressed the opposing players with intent to disturb them , or incited the crowd to assist in  |p468  " rattling " the opposition . It still is done , but not openly or flagrantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball generals in using the crowd , but he has been wise enough to change with the game and he accomplishes the same results or nearly as great by acting . One of the joys of the game on the old White Sox park in Chicago was to see " Handsome Nick " Altrock , the comedian-pitcher , step out to coach . He usually wore a mitt and a glove ? and as a cheer master he perhaps was the most successful the game ever has known . I have seen him control the entire crowd , using his hands as the conductor of an orchestra does his baton , and at the psychological moment , with one wave of his arm , start twenty thousand men cheering wildly and cheering in unison as he waved to them . The effect upon the opposing team was disastrous in many cases and often turned the game into a rout . The cunning of coachers in striving to render the opposing pitcher unsteady is marvelous . Even the present strict rules and the efforts of the umpires to protect pitchers from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high temper or for nervousness or excitability . I know two pitchers within the last three years who have been sent back to " the bushes " by the incessant cry : " Watch his foot ! " The rules forbid a pitcher delivering the ball unless at least one foot touches the rubber , and every pitcher violates it regularly . The coachers , know ing this , nag the young pitchers by reiterated demands upon the umpire to watch his foot . A nervous young pitcher , fearing to violate the rule , often is so anxious to avoid it that he forgets the principal part of pitching . The development of real science in coaching , oddly enough , resulted largely from the suppression of the old style of coacher and the passing of the clowns . The coachers , being forbidden to scream abuse at the pitchers and opposing players , began watching their opponents more closely and began to see that frequently they discovered in advance the plans of the opposition . In one season Fielder Jones , then leader of the White Sox , learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every time they were expecting a pitch out . I believe this discovery gave the White Sox a championship and a world 's pennant . Opposing catchers complained bitterly that the Sox were bad base runners aid that they persistently ran at the wrong time and played hit and run on the wrong ball . The secret of it was that Jones , coaching at third , was tipping to runners at first and to batters that the opposing pitcher was going to pitch wide to catch the runner stealing , and the runner therefore changed plans and stood still . The " pitch out " is a device to stop base running and stop hitting and running , and if a team knows when the opposing pitcher is going to " waste a ball , " it can beat the other team regularly . John McCloskey , one of the greatest tacticians in baseball , has worked out the theory of coaching , both from the bench and from the  |p469  lines , to an exact science . Yet McCloskey has not been successful because the players lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could find men who could think and act quickly enough to obey his signals I believe beyond doubt he would be the greatest manager of all time . One great trouble in the McCloskey system is that players are not yet educated to the point where they cease independent thinking and obey orders . The worst feature of the coaching system is that the " Theirs not to reason why , theirs but to do and die " spirit is sadly lacking . After every blunder of a ball player , the reason assigned is " I thought . " Besides that , the fewer brains a player has and the less he knows of the science of the game , the more liable he is to scoff at the theorist and ridicule or ignore the wigwag system . In Louisville one day last summer a Milwaukee batter drove a ball down into the lef tfield corner of the grounds . The ball was in the shortstop 's hands when the runner reached third base , but instead of holding him there the excited coacher urged him onward and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been watching , had slid down until the back of his head was resting on the bench and his feet were six feet away on the ground , his body rigid . A cruel substitute gazing at his manager asked : " What 's that , Mac ? A signal to slide feet first ? " There was another baseball genius named Fred Schmidt , who in the frank manner of the game was dubbed " Crazy . " When he was manager of the Meridian , Mississippi , team , Schmidt gave one of the most glorious exhibitions of coaching ever seen . A major league club was playing an exhibition game there , and naturally the whole ambition of Schmidt was to beat the big leaguers and establish a reputation for Meridian . His first move was to arrange to umpire the game . Then , while managing the team and umpiring , he used his hands to signal the runners , and his eyes to signal the batters , tipping off all the pitch-out signs and the pitched ball  |p470  signals he saw . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in absolute control of the situation . He called balls and strikes in his capacity of umpire , but , preserving his dual personality , reserved the right to signal his own batters . The opponents , knowing Schmidt , were enjoying it almost as much as the crowd was , and broke into roars of laughter when one of the Meridian runners missed a sign and Schmidt , forgetting he was umpiring , turned and exclaimed angrily : " I mage oop some more signalings for you to forget . " There are in even the best of teams players who in the parlance of the pastime are known as " hog wild runners . " It is one of the freaks of the game that at times a frenzy seizes runners and they are deaf and blind to everything except to gain the next base . Probably this is due to concentration of the mind upon one object . These players run regardless of consequences , and once let the madness seize them and nothing will stop them . They will dash forward and collide with the opposing players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fight with the coachers , strike at them and try to break away and proceed when restrained . This class is certain to suffer from the order forbidding coachers to assist runners physically . The coacher must know the speed of each man and time him perfectly , and when a wild runner is on base his duty becomes heavy . I remember one day Comiskey was sitting under his stand watching a game . Isbell was on second base and a sharp hit was made to left field . It looked as if he would be thrown out thirty feet if he tried to score . He rounded third base at top speed , intent on reaching the plate , absolutely ignoring the shouts and warnings of the coacher . Suddenly his feet flew from under him ; he fell , rolled over , and crawled back to third base . Comiskey , who had bumped two or three spectators the length of the bench in his anxiety , grinned and said : " He 's been with me ten years and that is the first time he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown out . "  |p471  No coacher could stop him . He never saw them . He was going home and refused to look . In recent years managers have been training coachers , and not only that , but have been training their players to obey coachers ' signals . Each club now has a system of " must " signals for runners entirely apart from the cries and shouts and calls of warnings . A hand upraised will stop a runner instantly , a single wave of the arm will spur him homeward . This signaling system was made imperative by the fact that the infielders of a defensive team call misleading orders to runners trying to confuse them . One of the oddest plays ever seen on a ball field happened in Cincinnati when " Eagle Eye " Jake Beckley , the famous o l d first baseman , was playing with the Reds . He was on second base when the batter made a twobase hit . Beckley was sprinting around third with what should have been the winning run . The coacher was careless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a chance to throw Beckley out at the plate . The third baseman , however , was alert . As Eagle Eye turned third he shouted " Go back ! " An instant later the crowd was amazed to see Beckley turn , dash madly back to third , sprint down toward second and slide to the bag just as the runner who had hit the ball arrived there . The value of a scientific coacher was illustrated last summer in a game between the Athletics and the Chicago White Sox . Hart sel , a clever man , was coaching at third base . Collins was on second when a sharp base hit was made to center field . The ball reached the fielder so quickly that Collins was stopped at third . He was approaching the base , slowing up ready to stop . The center fielder had the ball in his hands and was poised to throw when he saw Collins stop , then he relaxed from throwing position and got ready to toss the ball back to the infield . Hartsel saw the move and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star obeyed and in two flying leaps was under way ? twenty feet toward the plate . The center fielder l e a p e d back into position and made a hurried throw , but in his haste threw wide , and Collins scored the run that gave the champions a victory over Walsh . The coacher alone deserved credit for the play , as Collins could not have started well had he turned to see the fielder hesitate and the necessary fraction of a second been lost . The coacher who can attend to the business of instructing and guiding runners and at the same time can act as cheer master is a success . The great danger is that in his effort to stir up the feelings of the crowd he will neglect the work of watching . Beyond doubt the coacher who can control and use the noise of a great crowd , and direct it upon some panicky player at the right instant , can help his team to win . Unless one has stood out there before a great crowd , and heard its  |p472  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not appreciate the effect . At first it is hardly noticeable , but as inning after inning passes and it keeps up it begins to get on the nerves , especially when things are " breaking tough " ? and then to have it swell in volume , and rise higher and higher , helps hasten disaster . I have had visiting players tell me that the incessant " Get a hit ! " " Get a hit ! " " Get a hit ! " of the crowd at the South Side park in Chicago , breaking in monotonous iteration as Altrock waved his arm , keeping time , was the severest nerve test they ever were called upon to endure . Sheer noise does not disturb a player . Frequently a single remark by a coacher or by some spectator will find its way home in the player 's mind and upset him entirely . One game that Fred Clarke won for Pittsburg by coaching was from George Waddell , the famous " Rube . " This big left hander practically was unbeatable when his entire attention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easily distracted . Tom Loftus , who at that time had Waddell , knew this and in the game against Pittsburg cautioned Rube not to speak to Clarke and not to listen to his remarks . Inning after inning Waddell whirled along in magnificent style . Clarke tried everything from cajolery to abuse but Waddell turned a deaf ear to him . Finally Clarke pretended to abandon the attempt . He walked with Waddell between innings and carelessly inquired where he was going to take his vacation after the season . " Hunting , " said Rube , interested at once . " Why do n't you come out to my ranch in Kansas and hunt , George ? " asked Clark ; " I 've got a fine pup I 'll give you to train . " Waddell 's mind became engrossed with the pup . He hunted Clarke up after that inning and began to talk dog . In vain Loftus yelled for him to come away . Waddell was having dreams of a pup and hunting . In the eighth inning , while he still was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clarke had achieved his purpose by pretending to abandon it . It is extremely hard to get players to explain their coaching systems . T h e Chicago Cubs tip off batters what to do by various tugs at their trousers legs and at their caps . Pittsburg used for part of last season a system of signals conveyed by the position of the feet of the coachers . Griffith uses spoken words that mean nothing except to those who know the code that day . The word system , however , has been found faultier than any other , because the ball players usually can tell when a signal is being given because unconsciously the coacher places stress upon the code word . The moment a player knows a signal has been given he is able to guess accurately what it is , because the stage of the game calls for certain plays .
