txt Count von Bernstorff , the , , German Ambassador , returned to Washington . tonight from New York . When shown dispatches , telling of the correspondence and accounts taken from Captain von Papen , the former Military Attach ? here , his comment was : I do n't believe It . " Further than that the Ambassador declined to be quoted for publication . He did make it plain , however , that he doubted If any documents of an incriminating nature had been taken from von Papen , but he advanced no theory of how the correspondence and accounts , described in the London dispatches , had I been connected with him . The impresalon , conveyed to " rues ' tioners by officials in German diplomatic circles , was that they thought that Captain von Papen might have been connected with the published documents by British agents . They argued that it ' was incredible that von Papen , knowing that his ship would be taken into a British port , would have carried correspondence of such a nature , if he possessed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched von Pa.pen 's personal effects he protested to Ambassador Page in London , and asserted that had the Captain carried the papers described , it would be unlikely that he would have called further attention to them by protesting to an American official . His protest at the time was forwarded to Count von Bernstorff here , who sent it to the State Department . There was no action , and it was said that the safe conduct which the allied Governments had given Captain von Papen merely guaranteed his passage home to Germany , safe from seizure as a prisoner of var , and did not affect his baggage or papers . It was stated at the Embassy tonight that the Ambassador had paid much money from time to time to Cap- , tain von Papen in the way of salary and the expenses of such work as he was expected to conduct as a military attach ? . The Embassy , it was said , had no knowledge of his private bank account or how he disbursed the money . Embassy officials spe6ifically disclaimed any knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempted destruction of a Canadian Pacific bridge at Vanceboro , Me . They pointed out-that all German officials in this country had disclaimed any connection with the man and asserted that such a payment , if made , would hardly have been by a check . They further disclaimed knowledge of the explosion referred to as having occurred in Seattle , or of Kuepferle. the Brooklyn man who several months ago was caught with an American pass.port , and while on trial as a spy committed suicide in the Tower of London . Evidence Agaixint Attaches Secret . The disclosures from London aroused the'deepest interest everywhere in official Washington . coming as the sequel to the withdrawal of von Papen and his colleague , Captain Boy-Ed , the German naval attach ? , at the request of the United States . When the recall of the two was asked . the German Foreign Office was inclined to seek a bill of particulars and Count von Bernstorff , on instruction from his foreign office , notified Secretary Lansing that Germany would he inclined to contest , if the United States based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hamburg-American Steamship Line officials in New York for conspiracy to deceive the United States in official records , connected with the clearance of ships with supplies for German commerce raideas early In the war . Secretary Lansing replied to the Ambassador that the request for the withdrawal of the officers was based solely on their military and , naval activities , which had destroyed their usefulness . in this country , and that the ' United States was disposed to stand on . its diplomatic prerogative of making known its view that the officials were personae non gratae . The evidence which . the " - State DePartMent has of the activities of the two German officers has never been disclosed . The investigations of the Department of Justice have not been made public , and - the inference in official circles has been that Lansing took this course because he was reluctant to complicate the negotiations with Germany over the submarine warfare by any move that might further inflame public opinion in Germany or this country . Alleged misuse of American passports , Captain von Papen 's connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador . and various allegations of connection in some degree in alleged plots to foment strikes in munitions plants or cripple them . were admittedly factors in the desire of the United States to have the two attacbAs withdrawn- . Administrator officials made no comment on the disclosures as cabled from London , but the State Department is known to be ic , : only interested in this new cdrrespondence . Recalls British Protest . The incident has served to revive interest in a protest , said to have been made to Secretary Lansing by British diplomatic representatives against the use of State Department channels in forwarding accounts from the German Embassy here to the - Foreign Office in Berlin . The exact form of the protest has not been disclosed . Whether the British Embassy objected to the act of this Government in extending to Count von Bernstorff the courtesy of transmitting his accounts to Berlin , or whether it was suspected the accounts were not the ordinary routine matter they purported to be is not known At the time the protest was made several weeks prior to the departure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the incident . It became known , however , that since war was declared and the ordinary means of man communication between the German diplomatic officers anti their Government became subject to British scrutiny , the State Department undertook to forward to Berlin such ordinary embasAy accounts as were intrusted to it by the Ambassador . In some manner one of these packets miscarried and found its way back to the State Department via . Berlin and London . Secretary Lansing Is said to have decided that there was nothing objectionable in the packet , and it was again started to Berlin , and presumably was delivered . In the meantime , however , the British Foreign Office reported the incident to Ambassador Spring-Ft ce , who conferred with Secretary Lansing about it . It was rumored then that the British authorities believed that some of ! the accounts would bear investigation , but apparently the explanation given at the State Department determined . the Ambassador not to press the matter .                   @ @
