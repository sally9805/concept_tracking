THE college professor as he appears in American novels and upon the American stage is so picturesque that I should like to forget the dangers of the caricature . He is presented as a mild individual , with vacant eyes , an absent mind , a long beard , and untidy clothes . This imagined professor wears loose slippers in his study , and looks through steel-rimmed glasses on a world which does not concern him . The pas ? sions touch him not , and in the presence of dollars and cents or other facts of existence he displays a touching help ? lessness which is charmingly humorous . He lives serene and untroubled among his books , dreams beautiful dreams , sees attractive but unprofitable visions , and economically and politically is supposed to rank with the women-folk , as inter ? mediate between the real men and the paupers , feeble-minded , and Indians un ? taxed . The average American knows that this slippered gentleman is a product of the genial imagination of our comedy-makers , and yet his own conception of the col @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He imagines him , if my observa ? tions are correct , as a dignified but severe individual with a trimmed beard , a cold eye , and a mysterious interest in sub ? jects of no earthly use to anybody . He believes him to be indifferent to the necessities , and unsympathetic with the pleasures , of every - day existence . Al ? though he respects his cultivation and is impressed by the extent of his knowl ? edge , in his heart of hearts he feels , though he may never have acknowledged it , that the professor is futile in active life , and therefore merely ornamental in our civilization . The truth is that the average American knows very little about the college pro ? fessor , and takes few pains to know more . My legal friend , who motors in and out from his country residence end has time for golf in the afternoon and the theater or reading every evening , talks to me enviously of the otium cum dignitate of life in the academic shades , and does not heed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have three months a year free from college duties , assumes that it is all vacation , and smiles in ? dulgently when I speak of my summer work . In discussions of affairs our com ? ments are likely to be dismissed as im ? practical ? undoubtedly they often are so  - -  before they are heard , on the principle that governed the medievals when they distrusted in advance all that a lawyer might have to say of religion . And it is clear what the financial world thinks of us , since every wildcat enterprise sends its circulars to all the names on the college catalogue ; strong evidence that it knows little about the college community , for few professors have a surplus worth stealing . After all , the animal does not differ so much from the rest of the community ; in fact , he is scarcely a different species . The modern professor is more usually a man of the world than a recluse . He knows good cigars , as well as good pic ? tures and good books . He enjoys his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tennis-player he is often above the average . His talk , if a trifle dog ? matic and inclined to stray from the cardinal American topics ? business , ath ? letics , automobiles , and anecdotes ? is rarely pedantic , and far more intelligible than the dialect of the motorist or the jargon of baseball . If he wears un ? fashionable clothes , they more often in ? dicate an unfortunate economic condition than a disregard of his neighbors , and when he holds back from social and municipal activities it is often for the same reason . If he is little skilled in commerce , at least he knows as much of the banker 's , the lawyer 's , or the manu ? facturer 's business as they do of his ; perhaps more . Prick him in his pride , his purse , his lil ; ings , or his intolerances , and he will bleed quite as if he were a financier or a politician . In short , he is human . This being true , it is curious that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . Indeed , if there is indifference , I believe that it is quite as much America 's as the pro ? fessor 's . It is not pleasant to be held at arm's-length from life . It is irritating to meet constantly with Elm assumption that intellectual interests are alien to human nature . And the professor , not wisely perhaps , but quite humanly , some ? times retaliates . The business man who patronizes , who is indifferent to , the world of thought , is too often held in contempt among ' academic coteries . I do not defend this attitude , especially when it rises to superciliousness ; nev ? ertheless , it is comprehensible . But the professor I am most familiar with seems to me to be almost pathetically interested in the details of practical life , as if anxious to justify the theories it is his business to teach . And this is what one would expect as the result of his pro ? fession . The study of biology , or medi ? eval history , or Shakespeare , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies as much as managing a factory or selling land . In short , I am driven to the conclusion that the blame for the lack of harmony be ? tween the teacher and the parents of those he must teach should fall more often without than within the colleges . Its dangers , its effects upon teaching , I shall touch upon later . I fear there is little doubt that the average American regards the professor as ornamental , and in recognizing this fact I am not so resentful as afraid ? afraid of the results . Why deny the fact ? Reason instructs us that some one must teach our children , that knowledge must be accumulated , culture presented , thoughts set germinating ; but we con ? tinue to feel , nevertheless , that our pro ? fessors are merely necessary conventions associated with the finishing - schools , called colleges , to which we send our boys for an experience which custom makes necessary , in the hope that they may learn what it is ' better for them to know , and emerge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place of the professor in this process is felt to be time-honored and eminently respect ? able . With the college songs , the college curriculum , and the college bills , he is part of the life which we are buying for our children . But we expect little more of him . If our youngsters express en ? thusiasm for his personality , his ideas , or his work , we are mildly uneasy , fear ? ing the fanatic or the crank . I am try ? ing to voice the sentiments of a typical American , which is to say a commercial , community ; not , mind you , what they say , or what they think , but what they feel . Perhaps I am unjust , but I do not think so . I myself come from a business family and a business community . The results might have been as dis ? astrous for the college professor as an equivalent attitude has proved for certain branches of the clergy . The professor has been expected tri he ornamental ; it has sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living wage he would be allowed ? nay , encouraged ? to continue in a merely ornamental capacity . Neither as scholar nor as teacher has he often succumbed to the temptation ; he has usually been unaware of it ; and this is duo solely , I think , to the absorbing interest of modern research , and still mure to his artistic conscience , for teach ? ing is an art . Nevertheless , as critics of our colleges have numerously testified , the professor has not satisfied America . Nor will he until America takes hs work more seri ? ously . The business of the professor con ? sists of teaching and research . Research will probably take care of itself . Its results are tangible ? so tangible that even a commercial generation is begin ? ning to approve them ? and its fascina ? tion is great . Furthermore , since the products of successful research can be weighed and tested with little difficulty and without undue strain upon the judg ? ment , college promotions have been most frequently made upon an estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for or against a candidate . But good teaching is elusive , subject to false testimony , slow in its effects , hard to estimate , requiring time and trouble to search out . Hence it is important that the outside world should endeavor to en ? courage the teacher , should demand much of him , and pay him in appreciation for what it gets . Hence if it thinks the teacher merely ornamental , it strikes a blow at him and itself . Even under circumstances that might dampen . enthusiasm , ardent , eager teach ? ing has certainly not slackened in our colleges . It takes more than indifference to curb an art . When I first began to teach , I found myself one of a group of youngsters , all novices and all en ? thusiasts . Some of us had consciously aimed from the beginning at the aca ? demic life ; some of us had drifted into it , lured by its opportunities or repelled by the impossibility of doing elsewhere the things that interested us . But all were united by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and college . But we had also come un ? der bad teachers . And we were resolved that if we could not see results from our work ? once we had learned it , ? if we could not keep vivid , alive , and awake in the lecture chair , we would give up the profession and go into what those who have never taught call " the active life . " I suppose that we are all a little dis ? illusioned by now . I suppose all of us are uncertain as at the beginning of how much we can teach ; that all of us are aware that the results of teaching must often be seen by the eyes of faith . But none of us have thrown up our pro ? fession and gone into the world ; none of us have wished to do so . The art of teaching is too absorbing . My friends outside the college gates say to me , " How monotonous it must be to teach the same thing over and over ! " Nonsense ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when each time it must be fitted to different minds ? They say , " How tiresome to be always shouting at unwilling ears ! " Tiresome ! The more unwilling , the more adven ? turous is the effort . And even the cul ? tural neglect in the American home , and the curious intellectual deadening which seems to occur in many American pre ? paratory schools , have not made these student minds unwilling . Occasionally sluggish , sometimes inattentive perhaps , but not consciously unwilling ; and if unconsciously so , then hostile not to the teacher , but to the new idea or the dis ? cipline of thought . I speak as one large ? ly ignorant of the battles of the market ? place and stock - exchange , which our weekly story-papers have made so ro ? mantic , and thus am subject to correc ? tion ; yet 1 dare assert that few experi ? ences in the run of daily work are more stimulating , more exciting , than teach ? ing . I do not mean that the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all but the strongest stimuli . But to the sensitive teacher the hour is charged with quick ? silver . You see the minds of the thirty-odd men below you in their faces . You feel their response when the current of interest sets strongly , and your points tell . You feel the relapse when , one after another , they begin to drift away , and must be swung back , like particles in the field of an eleetro-magnet , by some stronger charge of electricity , some more vigorous effort in yourself . It is ner ? vous work , but it is quite as interesting , I think , as a business deal or a lawsuit ; and the materials with which one works are far more agreeable ; the results ? when there are results ? of an importance infinitely more great . In short , teaching is a publin service in which enthusiasm is easy , but a ser ? vice of infinite delicacy upon which real or apparent failure always waits . How essential is it that the public should be indifferent neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How important that the work into which he throws himself should be held more than perfunctory , more than ornamental ! Now foolish to cool the eager artist at his task , when that task is , or should be , the shaping of the next generation ! Indeed , the thrust goes beyond the professor . It is the community that suf ? fers . The teacher will teach , if he is worth anything , until he is muzzled . And if he is a scholar he will devote him ? self to the most difficult research . But the breed is human . They would cer ? tainly teach better , their research might be better directed , if the public , their actual employers , were less indifferent to their work . Ask and it shall be given unto you . America asks too little of the college professor . Nor is he sufficiently rewarded . I do not wish to harp upon the ancient theme of the underpaid professor . That plaint has grown tiresome to academic as well as to unacademic ears , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a warning . The professor is not the greatest sufferer . His life is primarily a life of the mind . He is in possession of resources not so readily opened to the practical man of affairs . If he can not afford automobiles and the opera , never ? theless books , nature , and the greatest of recreations , thinking , are his by right of conquest and opportunity . If he must mix the petty irritants of bill days , mortgage dates , and Iife-insurance pay ? ments with the proper atmosphere of his work , nevertheless that work is more purely congenial , more rewarding in it ? self , more stimulating than any other , except perhaps painting , music , or lit ? erature . It is not the professor who suffers most from the limitations which the lack of a true living wage imposes upon him ; it is not even his wife . He is , it is true , most unfortunately cramped by this condition . Many and many a man has never taken the sabbatical year which his college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford it . I remember a talk of pictures , of cathedrals , of men and thoughts in European cities with an aging professor of rhetoric in a small college . Never have I known a man more sensitive to the impressions of other cultures ; not many men , to judge from his work , have been so capable of turning all experience , and especially such experience , to profit ? able ends ; but his talk was of London and Paris in the seventies ; of conditions now merely historical , of men long dead . lIe had gone abroad when graduated from college . In forty years of service he had never been able to go again . Of course , if he had not married ! But then they will marry , these professors ! And here , too , there are limitations . A col ? lege statistician has recently asserted that on the present salary basis the pro ? fessor can hope to afford , on the average , two-fifths of a child ! Again , if the pro ? fessor lives a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his economic equals , who are culturally and educa ? tionally his inferiors , nor with his educa ? tional equals , who set a financial pace he can not follow ? if he lives a life apart , he must forfeit the place in the community which every self-respecting citizen desires ; he must forfeit influence , and condemn himself to a narrow society . But he is not the chief sufferer . With all its minor hardships , his life is on the whole the most attractive that America offers . The chief sufferer , of course , is the community . The factory of knowledge is operated for it . In the long run it controls the finances , and it controls the output . if it is pleased to run the plant on a short allowance of lubricant and fuel , there should be no quarrel with results . The engines whir along ; some of them as fast as they can , some of them too slowly . And the stockholders , having paid for the installation , shut up their pockets , and are content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfectly finished product which their education turns out . Ask and it shall be given unto you . If you wish better edu ? cation , ask for it as strenuously and as intelligently as you ask for dividends ; pay reasonably for it ; and you will get it . If you desire that this inspiring profes ? sion should be either crowded with in ? competents or open only to men of in ? dependent fortunes , continue to keep down the wage of the professor while the cost of living rises and you will get just that result with all its attendant dangers . And , finally , if you wish that your colleges should be mere finishing-schools , be careful lest the enthusiasm of the professor dulls , and you get your wish . The profession of teaching and the profession of research are highly agreeable and highly stimulating . But , like the other professions , they have their full share of the weaknesses of human nature . They are equally liable to slug ? gishness , equally dependent upon the at ? titude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become less useful ; ask much of them , and you will get some part at least of that which you ask . I have written in a previous paper of the lovable , energetic , misguided under ? graduate , and of the tact , the skill , and the guiding force which are necessary if he is to be really educated . It is here that the defects of the professor most quickly show themselves . And it is here that the already discussed attitude of average America toward the professor and things intellectual , an attitude which is certainly indifferent , and perhaps just a little contemptuous , works the greatest harm . For this attitude makes teaching difficult , and it makes it difficult to get good men to teach . A really good professor should be a Cerberus ? three gentlemen at . once . He should be able to teach ; and though the desire to teach is strong and common , the power to teach , as we who try know , is slow of growth and rare in its achieve ? ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from the value of successful re ? search , good teaching , as is well known , seldom proceeds except from a mind trained in fruitful investigation , deep-stored with knowledge , and creative in science , in criticism , or in the realm of the imagination . The conflict between teaching and research , of which we hear so much , is like the conflict of science and religion . It exists only through a misunderstanding . It exists only because of the proneness of the academic author ? ities to recognize the scholarly rather than the educational manifestations of a power which all good teachers should possess . Finally , the professor should be an admirably sane , admirably broad , ad ? mirably human individual . And really such a man is not to be had by advertis ? ing in the evening paper or by correspond ? ing with an employment agency . Actually the American attitude tow ? ard the academic profession makes the task doubly difficult . Time and again American parents who have amassed money enough for their children 's chil ? dren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious distrust of the intellectual life ? or is it contempt for the mere teacher ? ? to drag away the promising son who , in tastes , in desires , and in ability , has shown himself qualified for the academic profession , in order to thrust him into business , where against his will he makes more money . We , in our cloistered simplicity , are at a loss to understand their point of view . But we understand too clearly the limitations thus thrust upon us in our search for recruits from among those to whom the road to culture has been open . As for the youth with all the qualifications but no money , he must be willing to risk financial instability , and ho must make his choice at a time when new tastes burn within him for gratification , and when the desire for marriage and a home is like a rosy beacon urging him on the path to speedy independence . All this does not help the college to find material which at the best is rare . Time and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less congenial or less hazardous pursuits . But I would not insist upon this point . Perhaps by the operation of some ob ? scure choice of the fittest , we draw if not the best at least the most worthy into the academic fold . Much more serious is the inherited attitude of the under ? graduate . I say inherited , because it is not his own , as is proved by the fact that he loses much of it as his college expe ? rience progresses . It is a belief impressed upon his subconsciousness by his earlier environment , that the things of the mind are unsympathetic , are ornaments mere ? ly , are non-essentials . When his par ? ents feel that the professor and the life of the professor and the thoughts of the professor are alien , or that a college de ? gree is like a well-cut coat , useful not in itself but only in its effect upon others , the Circumstance is not hid from him . And this prejudice against knowledge is a barrier which the teacher must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can begin to teach . The bell strikes the hour . The class assembles . Here is a group of fresh minds in fresh bodies , minds half-trained or ill-trained , unstored or ill-stored . It is the professor 's business to train them . to store them ; and he , if he has acquired any wisdom in his search for knowledge , is aware of how little he himself really knows , is still more aware of the exces ? sive difficulty of choosing from that little what can be taught , what is worth teaching to these men , at this time , in their mood . And he is still more keenly alive to the difficulties of transmission . He knows that he must tune and re-tune constantly the waves of energy which pass from his mind to the class , for otherwise those sensitive but slowly adjusting receivers will catch no message . Outside the class-room there are ever-present wars and rumors of wars over educational policies , systems , changing categories of knowledge to fit changing conditions , opinions as to what to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give the patient digitalis , " and another , Fill him with bromides . " He must follow the course of these battles , take his side , urge his own opinions , and suf ? fer or gain by them . But at the same time he knows that these are but diplo ? matic skirmishings , after all ; that the real contest is in the class-room ; that how much is taught is even more impor ? tant than what is taught . He must de ? cide upon what is worth teaching ; lie must also do that equally difficult and far more important thing , teach . Every barrier in the road , every brake upon his progress is a hindrance to American education ; and , next to his own short ? comings , the greatest of obstacles is the indifference to the means of education in careless commercial America . Our city governments are illuminating ex ? amples of the results of such an attitude . Our colleges are instances of how much can he accomplished by devotion and enthusiasm in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cur ? rent American belief that the professor is unsympathetic and often merely or ? namental is sometimes justified by the facts . Some of us are pedantic and prag ? matical . Some of us are indifferent to the course of events outside the gates , and too sure that since the heart of the world is unchanging , its brain is a con ? stant also . Many of us are selfish in our pursuit of narrow research or flattering popularity ; many are petty-minded and live upon intrigue as politicians upon graft ; many of us merely talk when we should be teaching . Most of us , indeed , have made our choice from among the teacher 's seven deadly sins : contempt , ar ? rogance , vanity , subservience , meanness , self-absorption , laziness ? of which the greatest is contempt of the world , and the least popular , laziness . But almost to a man we are loyal to our profession , and we wish not fewer hours or more distinction or more money ( except as working capital ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a demand , which is at the same time more rigorous and more intelligent , for results . Ask and it shall be given unto you ; not com ? pletely , for education as a science is still VOL . CXXVI. ? No. 755. - 98 uncertain , and as an art will always re ? main difficult ; but more abundantly than now . We are trying to intellectualize the business and scientific energy of America just as a century ago the earlier college intellectualized the theological and professional energies of the country . We are trying to teach a man how to live while being successful in business . We are trying to train men to find out what is really useful in life . Criticize , blame , oppose the process , and make your de ? mands as exacting as you will , but do not be indifferent to it . Indifference is education 's primal curse . I know a college professor who is busy completing a long life of work . In his youth he fought through the Civil War , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American scholarship . To be near him was to be charged with electricity , so that the stu ? dents who came under his influence gained a new consciousness of the value of wide and accurate knowledge . And even the hopeless Philistines , whose ideals were those of the market-place , learned to speak with respect at least of the shining ones of the intellectual life , as the awed barbarians learned to reverence the beautiful gods of Greece . When he found that his teaching ceased to vary with the varying needs of his class , he left the class-room , and untiringly began to pour out from the storehouse of his mind the accumulations of his long career , vigorous , interested , effective as when he began . If the academic profes ? sion can attract and hold and give oppor ? tunity to such men , it need not ask for condolence ; rather the professor may say like Hotspur in " Henry IV . " : " Nay , task me to my word ; approve me , lord . " But the professor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may turn lazy on her hands and snuggle down into a life which , with all its limitations , is for men of taste and culture the most delightful in the world . Tf America dampens his enthusiasm , if he is asked to be merely a cultivated and inef ? fective gentleman , it is the community and not the professor who will suffer most from such a policy ; it is the com ? community who will pay most heavily for the mistake .
