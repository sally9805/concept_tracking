Even the pushcart peddlers who lined the gutters sensed danger , and beAan to pull away their loads of cutlery and laces before the four men had spoken a word to Moshe . Moshe , dressed in his best , and with the air of one who has long commanded respect , stepped out to shake hands with the foremost of the gangmen . For answer he received , just below his heart , a long dagger up to the hilt . Two revolvers came into play simultaneously with the dagger , and in an instant Moshe 's strong arms . that had made hint a gang leader in Avenue B , were lying helpless at his side as he groveled on the pavement .

Moshe died on the street car tracks ten feet away from the point where he was first attacked . Avenue B , in the section where the gangmen settled their difficulties , was crowded as it always is with men , women , and children . With those that came pouring in from the side streets , the crowd that hemmed in the murdered man , and also his murderers , soon mounted up to 5,000 or more . The gangmen who took Moshe 's life might have escaped if they had been a little more careful in choosing the time of day in which to , act . As it was , the revolver shots announced to two squads of policemen who were changing posts that there was trouble brewing . The police squads , representing both the Union Market Station and the East Fifth Street Staton , swarmed into the congestion from both sides . Two of the gangmen were pointed out to policemen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were captured after being pursued to the roofs of East Third Street tenement houses . One of them described himself as Jack Willis , a bellboy of 641 East Eleventh Street , While- the  - -  other.l.said he was David ' Wolk , a , hair dealer of 164 Orchard Street . Both were held in the Union Market Police Station , while a crowd of 1,000 people gathered outside and exchanged opinions of the murdered man and his assailants . Some members of the crowd suggested that the slayers of Moshe ought to be rewarded instead of punished . An aged pushcart peddler forced his way into the station house to tell about the dead man . He said Moshe had collected 10 cents a week from him for years , saying he could " have him run away " from Orchard Street if he did not pay . A grocer came to report that his delivery horse disappeared one day and next day Moshe came and told him he could-get the horse back if he would pay $15 .

By one . and all he was described as a pickpocket and gangleader who preyed upon the district in which he lived . He was oversized , dressed flashily , and the only work he was known to do was to act as strong-arm man for an express drivers ' union . In his coat pocket a letter was found written in a ? woman 's handwriting with lead pencil . It was a letter in a style hardly familiar to the gang circles in which Moshe moved . The letter , which was turned over to the Detective Bureau for investigation in the belief that it may possibly point to the clue for the murder , contained this paragfaph : The attempt you made to excuse your conduct is neither straightforward nor satisfactory . It is , in fact , only exculpating yourself by admitting a fault as great as : the one of which I complain . Under these circumstances , whatever pain it may cause me , I must avow my determination never , under any conditions , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be favorable to the happiness of either . ESTHER K. ROSE . A police theory of the crime , based upon the letter found in the dead man 's pocket , was that the friends of the girl who wrote it planned and executed the murder . The letter was not ' dated and was not inclosed in an ' envelope , and no address was given by the writer . A search was made last night for Esther K. Rose , but she was not found . The fact that Jack Sullivan , who figured conspicuously in the Rosenthal murder case , was known on the east side as Jacob Reich , led many east siders to conclude that Morris Reich was related to him and so was invoiced in some nlanner in the Rosenthal case . A ' dozen men who declared they knew Morris Reich well , and had known him for years , insisted , however , that he had no connection with Jacob Reich , alias Jack Sullivan , and was not an associate of . the gunmen figuring in the Rosenthal ease .

The two men arrested were questioned by a representative of the District At , torney 's office , but they refused to tell anything about the murder or even to admit that they knew Morris Reich . The police examined a number of witnesses of the murder . ; Sarah Hirschdnbaum , who looked out upon -- the affair from her flat on the second floor of 36 Avenue B , identified Wolk. the police say , as the man who wielded the knife , while Louis Stample , a clerk in a drug store at 33 Avenue B. identified aVolk as the man who fired the revolver and used the knife as well . A revolver and a long knife were found n the gutter close to Reich 's body .

A sister of Reich , who formerly kept a poultry shop in Orchard Street , is being sought by the police . It was said by Reich 's friends that up- to two years ago he was a well-behaved east side boy . He then joined a gang known as The Little Doggie Gang . He was arrested several times for picking pockets , and for a. number of months recently he has been sleeping on Orchard Street roofs . He wore on the fingers of his left hand two . signet rings and a diamond ring . GANGSTER IS KILLED . Thomas Banaza , a Special Police= man , . Shoots Gopher Leader .

When Coroner Hellenstein was holding an inquest yesterday into the death of John Denunzio , 18 , of : 301 East 103d Street , who was Shot last Sunday night in a quarrel with gangsters at the foot of East 103d Street , Stephen Foley , 14 years old , of 2,031 Second Avenue appeared to say that he had shot Denunzio accidentally , and that Christopher Teppier , better known in Harlem as " John Regan , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the assailant to the police and arrested , was not guilty . Foley said that he always carried TepPler 's revolver for him , and that-on the night of the quarrel he had tripped when running and dropped the revolver which , as he stooped to pick it up , had gone off and shot Denunzio , in the stomach . The detectives say that the boy made this confession to shield Teppler , and that they have found a letter which proves that they arranged it together , the older youth saying that if Foley were convicted he would only get a light sentence , probably in a Catholic Protectory , on account of his age . Foley is held at the Children 's Society . '
