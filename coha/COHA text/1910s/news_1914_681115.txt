txt The Mexican foreign minister , Senor Portillo y Rojas , announced tonight that it would be impossible to agree to the demand of the United States that the flag of that country be unconditionally saluted , because that flag was not insulted , because it was not flying from the launch and because the marines were set free even before an investigation , and that the officer responsible for the arrests was himself arrested and held for trial . The foreign minister further announced that the Mexican government would agree that both flags be saluted , the American flag first and then the Mexican flag , this arrangement to be made by a protocol signed by the American charge d'affairs , Nelson O'Shaughnessy , and the Mexican foreign minister . The United States government . Senor Portillo declared , had refused permission to Charge O'Shaughnessy to sign such a protocol and demanded an unconditional salute by Mexico , which Mexico felt was incompatible with its dignity . In conclusion the foreign minister said , " Mexico has yielded as much as its dignity will permit . Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people . "
