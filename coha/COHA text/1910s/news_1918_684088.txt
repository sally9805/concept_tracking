txt The story of a dramatic change in the German plans , which gives the clue to the recent fluctuations of the battle situation , was told me yesterday afternoon by an officer on the staff of the French army holding the Marne sector . He said : " During the night of Friday , July 19 , and the , morning of Saturday the Germans recrossed the river , covered ' by a strong rearguard and heavy shellfire , and by Saturday evening the whole south bank was in allied hands . On Sunday morning we remarked that the activity of the enemy artillery had notably decreased , and for the next twentyfour hours we received nothing but a few light shells . " Our detachment , which had crossed the Marne on the heels of the enemy , announced tat the north bank was defended almost entirely by machine guns and an occasional battery of seventy-sevens , with no sign of heavier pieces . At the same time air observers reported an intense traffic in guns , supplies , and troops moving northward along the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retirement to the line of the Vesle . Sudden Reversal of Movement . " The Germans were burning untransportable stores all Sunday night , and we concluded that they intended to evacuate the salient , when suddenly , at dawn on Monday , their artillery recommenced a fire no less violent than before . Aviators now reported that traffic on the roads was moving south again , as if the current had been abruptly clammed and turned in the opposite direction . " By noon Monday even the rank and file of the prisoners seemed to know that the idea of a retreat had been abandoned and an order to resist at all costs given instead . " What had evidently happened was that some one , probably Army Commander von Boehm , or even the Crown Prince himself , had decided on Saturday to retreat , and had already begun to execute the operation , but had been overruled the next day by higher authority , doubtless through fear of disastrous moral effect on the German people . The difficulties of resistance in the congested salient are obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purely military problem be influenced by other considerations . " Already the Germane are suffering terribly as a result of the efforts required to bar the Allies ' progress and from the difficulties of transportation and the effects of our concentrated fire . As an instance of the expedients to which they are reduced , several of the divisions that crossed the Marne , and which we know lost there at least 40 per cent . of their effectives , instead of being relieved have been put in the line opposite the French and Americans between the Ourcq and the Marne . " They include some of the best troops in the German Army , the 1st Division of the Prussian Guard and the 6th Bavarians  --  facing the Americans  --  the 23d Saxons , who have a very good fighting record , and the 36th Division  --  shock troops  --  further north . Their companies are now down to forty bayonets , and no army can stand punishment like that . " ' The morale has fallen enormously in consequence . For the first time even the officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the Allies , and the soldiers declare frankly that they are utterly ' fed up . ' One hears the same story from the prisoners of the 200th Division , crack mountain trobps , whose spirit hitherto has been extraordinary , and there is no question of their sincerity . " Another proof of the enemy 's straits is that the 9th Bavarian Division has been wholly eliminated , owing to the impossibility of filling gaps . Tell of Unrest in Germany . " All of the prisoners , the Bavarians especially , speak of the unsatisfactory state of affairs at home , which they noticed when on leave . The Bavarians declare that their people are absolutely disgusted , riots are frequent and general . In fact , if we can give the boche another good knock , it looks as if he will be nearly ready to quit . That is the extent of the change wrought by this fortnight of battle which France awaited with such anxiety . " I asked the officer whether he anticipated a German attack elsewhere with intent to effect a diversion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the following points : First , Rupprecht 's reserve is still intact . He sent only some divisions to aid the German Crown Prince , and it is understood that these men have been replaced . Secondly , the murderous keeping in line of divisions that crossed the Marne , instead of replacing them from the reserves , shows the intention of using the reserves for another purpose . Thirdly , that purpose can not but be an offensive as the sole chance of retrieving the situation and saving Germany from the disastrous effects of the abandonment of the salient and the loss of control of the ParisNancy railroad . Possibly a drive might come to re lieve the pressure on the salient . He expected that , if made at all , the attack would come very soon and with the utmost fury . German Airmen Harass Mezy . That the enemy does not mean to give up the salient if he can avoid it I saw further indicated on a visit to the bridge across the Marne at Mezy two hours later . Already two heavy shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and new-made shellholes along the road northward gave additional evidence . As I walked down the road the sky echoed with the hum of a dozen airplanes , and just on entering the village a sudden patter of machine-gun bullets a few yards to the left bore . witness that they were not all friendly , and I ran to cover under the wall of a ruined house , where I found a score of American soldiers sheltering . " They do that all the time , " said one of them . " It is no use taking chances . We shall be able to go in in a minute , as soon as our.airplanies up there keep Fritz busy . It is worse at night , as he comes down low and sweeps the road . That has happened to me three times in the last two nights , and I do n't like it . " A moment later the " pop , pop " of machine guns overhead showed that the speaker had judged aright . We proceeded unhindered , watching the airplanes manoeuvring in wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I crossed the railroad bridge , a hundred yards further on , an American Sergeant suddenly caught my arm . " Look , look ! " he cried , pointing westward . " The sausage ? he 's got him ! " I followed the direction toward some French balloons that soared two miles away , over the heights across the river . Suddenly an open parachute appeared as if by magic a hundred feet below , and , floating gently down , disappeared in ' the trees . Simultaneously , a tiny red patch , like the flame of a match , glowed on the forward top balloon . A second later it was as big as a man 's hand . Then , as the gasbag buckled in the centre , it shot up , crimson , bright and smokeless , against the blue sky . A second more and the balloon had vanished in a pillar of flame , falling earthward . Five hundred feet from the ground the blaze ceased abruptly , as a candle is blown out , leaving no trace behind . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sound of his machine gun . The whole effect was absurdly unreal and theatrical . Keeping Up Fire on a Bridge . Two.hundred yards from the river a Y. M. C. A. canteen was doing a brisk trade . That the job is no sinecure was clear from the incessant explosions as the Germans maintained a desultory and mostly smallcalibre fire on the bridge . As we were coming down the road two German bombing planes proved that they at least had enough nerve for daylight work by dropping a score of projectiles , but they were kept at a great height by active French countermeasures . Their aim was poor , and no damage was done . " They do better at night , " said one of the Americans , " but their shooting is nothing to sing about . Last night thirty of ' em had a try just after my outfit crossed . It was some fireworks display , but they did n't hit a thing . " " It 's all right for you to talk like that , " put in an interpreter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to leave this dailmed place , for the worse they shoot at a bridge the likelier they are to hit us . They nearly got us last night . " The Y. M. C. A. man nodded a rueful assent . As I proceeded to the bridge , which was made of wide , solid planking , over pontoons capable of bearing camions , there came the vicious whang of a shell fragment past my ear . The long file of Americans paid no attention . . " They 've learned the game , " said the French officer accompanying me . " They do n't run useless risks , but they 're past the gun-shy ' stage . It may not seem so important , but it just makes all the difference between raw troops and veterans . " FACE STRATEGIC DILEMMA . Fighting Will Deplete German Reserve , Retreat Would Admit Disaster . Copyright , 1918 , by Tho New York Times Company . Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , July ** actual order to retreat from the Soissons-Rheima salient was issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward recalled , Thu NEW YORK TIMES correspondent learned today , but in the opinion of the best British experts it does not matter much whether the foe retires or stands his ground . If he retires he admits to all the world his defeat . If he stands , he uses up his reserves . A general retirement about July 19 would have been , there is good reason to believe , to the line either of the Avre or the Vesle , but since the order was. ? canceled it is now quite possible that the enemy may have decided to hold his present lines . Of course , if the retreat is only delayed , sufficient reasons would be the necessity of correcting the confusion inevitable among the troops crowded in the narrow salient and the need of more time to remove in orderly fashion the great accumulation of stores . In this connection it was pointed out that as the salient was intended to be the Jumping off place of a great offensive , very large quantities of supplies of all kinds must have been collected there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *. ? iew of the British experience at Ypres , experts here say that the salient can not be considered absolutely untenable by the Germans . Until Messines Ridge was captured last year the British succeeded in holding on , in spite of frequent bombardments , to a Salient five miles deep and five miles broad . The present salient is about four times as broad and deep , and the enemy can keep it probably if he wishes . On the other hand , to give it up would be an admission of defeat patent to all the world and with serious results to the Central Powers , and so , perhaps , though the hanging on produces no military results and uses up large numbers of men , they may prefer risking it to halting their much-advertised offensive . After all , it does not matter much to the Allies . They are forcing the enemy to fight in disadvantageous circumstances and are using tip his reserves . Even if he can hold the sector , he can not start an offensive from it , and that means drat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdraw a number now fighting for other purposes . Doubt New Offensive . The German plans for the rest of the front are as uncertain as ever . The best experts here think that as sixtyfive divisions have been employed in the Champagne offensive and in resisting the allied counterattack , the only fresh reserves which the Germans have left are those of Crown Prince Rupprecht , which number less than thirty divisions . A week ago it was almost certain that he would attack the British lines , but there is not nearly such certainty now . His delay is taken as proof that the German high command is unwilling to stake everything on a fresh effort on an isolated portion of the front . ? Moreover , it is known that the German strength in men is not nearly as great as it was , and they can not hope ' for much improvement for two months , so it is not surprising that they hesitate to begin an offensive which , if it failed , would be so serious for Germany and if successful would be nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the positions commanding the road to Paris from the Marne front are now in our hands .. The great strategic defect of the allied position has been removed and the threat to Paris has disappeared .
