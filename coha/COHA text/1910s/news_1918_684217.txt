txt Under adverse conditions the health authorities of American communities are now grappling with an epidemic that they do not understand very well . But they understand it well enough to know that it spreads rapidly where people are crowded together in railway trains , in theatres and places of amusement , in stores and ? factories and schools . In some cities and towns where the influenza seems to be malignant the schools and many places of amusement have been closed . Pennsylvania . taking a serious view of the hazards of the disease , because it is raging in the Shipyards and increasing ominously elsewhere , has taken drastic measures to protect the public health . The sale of liquor has been generally prohibited in Philadelphia , the courts stand adjourned , Liberty Loan meetings have been abandoned , public assemblies of all kinds have been forbidden , the theatres are not allowed to give performances , and it is recommended that the churches hold no services . In some other parts ' , of Pennsylvania the authorities have gone further , closing churches and Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New fersey the public schools have been closed . This is the case in , Omaha and other ' Western cities . In Oswego , where about 15 per cent . of the population is down with influenza , the Health Board has acted vigorously . ' We have said that the authorities are dealing with the epidemic under adverse conditions . Those conditions are that there is everywhere a lamentable lack of doctors , and that the supply of skilled nurses is so low that many patients , dangerously ill with influenza , must be left ? to the care of members of the family , who seldom know anything about the disease . The war has taken a great number of the doctors , and many capable nurses have gone to France or are employed in the military hospitals at home . New York City has thus far escaped lightly compared with Boston , which has had 100,000 cases , and with Philadelphia , where the total two days ago was 20,000 . Up to yesterday only 8,000 cases had been reported in this city of about 6,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pdrhaps many cases still unreported . It seems providential that there have been so few cases in our congested ? districts , and generally in a population that packs the transportation lines . But unless our health authorities are vigilant and practical , there may . soon be another story to tell . The precautionary and restrictive regulations adopted by . the Department of Health are at best tentative . It is a. question whether the schools should not be . temporarily closed , as in other places . As business must go on , if not as usual , it was advisable to vary ' the opening and closing hours of business estab , lishments to ' regulate : . the " rush hours " on transportation The opening time of theatres - has been changed with a similar , purpose . It is evident that'the Health Department hesitates to be strenuous , because , as Dr. COPEWD says , " this community is not skilgken with . the epidemic . " But it may be if only half measures are taken . A stitch in time save ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Dr. CoPEiAND't reasons for keeping them open are not altogether convincing . There is one thing that health authorities everywhere should do . At doctors are few and nurses scarce , families should be educated by deal and stipple bulletins ? to look after their sick until a doctor can be summoned , r a nurse , if available , can be fount for the patient . The opportunity foi young women who want to serve at Red Cross nurses need not be emphasized . Much must depend upon the good sense of individuals . They car walk instead of ride on the railroads , if they have not too ' far to go ; and they can avoid crowds and stay away from congested places of amusement . It is suggested to Director that an extra coach or two on popular trains would help , ( many ? ) f them are at present greatly overcrowded , ) and to the War Department that itt responsibility for improved sanitary conditions in the camps must not be disregarded .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
