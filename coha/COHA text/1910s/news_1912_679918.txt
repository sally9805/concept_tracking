txt The " personal excise " tax of 1 per cent on the incomes of individuals and co-partnerships in excess of $5,000 a year which was decided upon last night by the Democratio caucus as a revenue measure to make up the loss of $52,000,000 annually caused by the Free Sugar bill , which was also ratified by the caucus , was the most engrossing subject of conversation at the Capitol to-day . The bill is certain to pass the House within the next week or two by a vote not strictly partisan , and there is a good possibility that it will receive strong support in the Senate . Democratic Senators united In pralsi ing the measure , while expressions from Progressive Republicans indicated that strength would be added from their faction . If the Democrats vote solidly four Insurgent votes will enable them to pass anything through the Senate , The Senate lawyers are agreed , however , in spite of the ingenious reasoning of the House Committee , that the socalled excise tax is purely and simply an income tax such as was declared unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by a closely divided court , and the opinion is now expressed , as it was on the floor of the Senate in 1909 , when an income tax was advocated as an amendment to the Tariff bill , that the Supreme Court as now made up would reverse the last ruling and return to the interpretation which throughout the civil war enabled Congress to levy an income tax . As one of the leading lawyers of the Senate expressed it to-day , an excise tax is a tax on a privilege . A tax , therefore , " with respect to the carrying on or doing business " can not be an excise tax . because there is no privilege involved . lAn individual 's right to do business is inherent and the Supreme Court 's decis'lion s sustaining trxing.pothne tcgier corporation t a ; : i which business in a. corporate capacity , has no. rbearing upon this tax . A Plain Income Tax . The Supreme Court has held that the measure of a tax may be something other than the thing taxed . Thus the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corpora1 don above a certain exemption limit with/ out being a tax upon the profits . But in the present case the tax is called an excise tax , or a tax upon the privilege of doing business and is to be messured by the income of the individual . As there is no privilege in doing business the tax becomes a tax simply on the income itself , and that seems to be the prevailing opinion in the Senate . This gives peculiar importance to the proposed income tax amendment to the Constitution , which has already passed both houses by a two-thirds vote and which is now pending before the States for the ratification of three-fourths of the Legislatures . Five States only are now needed for affirmative action to make the amendment a part of the Constitution , as thirty-one States have ratified and only thirty-six are necessary . Under the terms of the bill , if it passes , returns of private incomes need not be made until March 1 , 1913 , for the year ending Dec. 81 , 1912 , and by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ratified the Constitutional amendment . Though the bill will have been passed , if at all , before the amendment is incorporated into the Constitution , the opinion here is that the Supreme Court will determine the constitutionality of the act at the time the litigation began and not at the time of the passage of the act . The Progressive Republicans in the Senate arc as completely on record as favoring an income tax as are their Democratic colleagues . In the tariff struggle of 1909 the Progressives fought a long time to have an income tax included in the Payne-Aldrich bill , and one of their chief causes of complaint against President Taft in those days was that through his influence a compromise was effected whereby a corporation tax and the proposed Constitutional amendment were passed instead . The talk among them today indicates that they have not changed their positions . Senators ' Views on the Bill . Senator Poindexter of Washington , Progressive Republican , said : " I am very much in favor of an Income tax . I have been favoring it for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic leaders of the Senate , who did not attempt to speak for his party , as he heal no opportunity to talk with any Senators regarding the bill , said that if the bill passed the House It would , find " sufficient support in the Senate . " " I have always been in favor of an income tax , " said Senator Overman of lluosrttitia:Drolina to-day . " I think it is a Senator Kern of Indiana , who was Democratic candidate for Vice President in the last National campaign , said that the measure was a good one . " I am and always have been in favor of an Income tax , " he said . " I also am in favor of free sugar . " Senator Martin of Virginia , Democratic leader of the Senate , unqualifiedly declared for the bill framed by his party in the House . " The measure , " he said , " Is eminently wise and ought to pass . There is no doubt in my mind as to its constitutionality . " Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Finance Committee , will lead the fight against the House measure , I outlined his position as follows : " I was not at all enthusiastic for the corporation tax provision in the Payne Tariff bill . We should not take up any sources of revenue that belong to the States . The States must get revenue from somewhere , and ? it is not right for the National Government to go into their sources of supply when the Government has ample opportunities in other directions . The Federal Government ought to be run on indirect taxes and customs duties , with the exception of the long-estabIlished internal revenue taxes . " The time will come when the American people will wake up to this and refuse to permit the Federal Government to interfere with subjects of taxation which properly belong to the States . " House Democrats Elated . On the House side Speaker Clark , Chairman Underwood , and other Deinocratio leaders believe they have made a tenstrike of popularity in their proposed solution of the problem of the sugar schedule revision . Discussing the proposed tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax ever since I was old enough to know anything about public affairs and economic questions . A graduated income tax with a reasonable exemption is the fairest and justest tax that was ever levied . I have spoken on IL and expect to keep at it until it is put on the statute books . " Representatives Norris of Nebraska and Kent of California , Progressive Republicans , declared their intention of voting for the bill . Other insurgents declared the same thing , but refrained from being quoted at this time . Sonic of the Republican regulars are expected to vote for the excise tax bill , although they will vote against the sugar bill . Holding Companies Affected . The proposed law would affect holding corporations such as the United States Steel Corporation , it was said to-day . The bill was drafted by Representative Hull of Tennessee . who issued a statement relating to holding companies , as follows : " The present corporation tax law exempts all holding corporations from the tax it imposes . The proposed excise tax bill does not in terms impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does impose a tax upon the business of all individuals , for instance , whose net earnings exceed $5,000 , including all net earnings received or entitled to be received as dividends , or other compensations within the meaning of the act , out of the net earnings of any or - all corporations that do not themselves pay an excise tax . " Hence , every person connected with a holding corporation as a stockholder or otherwise . and who received or Is entitled to receive any portion of the annual net earnings of such corporations in excess of $5,000 , is liable for the tax , and both such persons and such corporations are compelled under suitable penalties to discover and disclose in every instance the exact amount cf annual net earnings upon which each of such person 's taxes is entitled to be computed . " Under the system of ' Collections at the source ' carried in this proposed bill each holding corporation would be required under suitable penalties to make return under oath to the Government of the amounts of its annual net earnings , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed as dividends or not , and pay the tax computed thereon for such person or persons . Of course , the proposed bill would apply to all holders of the bonds of such companies , and those receiving interest thereon in excess of $5.000 . " Representative Underwood , Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , said today that the bill would be reported to the House next week . It will receive precedence over the Free Sugar bill , as it would be useless to cut off the tariff on sugar before providing the way to raise revenue in its place .
