txt A bill is now before the Governor which , if approved by him , would destroy all reasonable discipline in , the civil service of the State and of the cities and counties of the State . Its effect would be most mischievous in this city , because of the enormous number of persons employed here , but it would also be very serious through ' out the entire State , and would do great harm in departments of extreme importance . " This is the Walker bill , which passed at the last moment , when the forces of cunning and greed ' had full swing in the hurry and confusion of the hour . Following is the substantive provision of the bill : No regular clerk or head of a bil1 reau or person holding a position in the classified civil service , subject to competitive examination , shall be removed except for incompetency or misconduct or ; insubordination , shown after a hearing , at which the accused may he represented by counsel , witnesses shall be sworn . and the testimony recorded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused . This practically strips the head of every office of discretion in the matter of removals as a means of discipline and of securing adequate efficiency . Every removal may be thrown into the courts . The first obvious result , and one of the most injurious , would be intolerable delay . No removal could be made final except after review by the courts , which in any case would take months , and often might take years . Organizations of employ-6s , handed together on the trade-union principle , would see to it that each matter was dragged along as far as practicable , with the use of all technicalities , in order to make removals as tedious , difficult , and bothersome as possible . The more reluctant the heads of offices could be made to incur the risks of litigation the better the employes would be satisfied . Clearly the effect upon the efficiency of the service , and , therefore , on the cost . of the service and on the value received by the public , would be great and very bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no express provision for the review of removals by the courts . None is needed . The bill , as may be seen by the language we have cited , makes a removal really a judicial proceeding , a trial ; with sworn witnesses , counsel , and recorded testimony . Of such proceedings the courts are bound to take cognizance , and to determine them according to the facts as shown , but also with reference to all usual technicalities . The bill is really based on the assumption that the public employe has a vested individual right to his office and Its emoluments . In equity he has nothing of the kind , and none should be accorded to him . He has a right to retain his office so long as the good of the service requires , and of this his superior officer should be the judge . He should not be removed for partisan reasons , but of this there is little danger if he can be replaced only by a successor who has to pass adequate tests of fitness . Entrance on the public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be left to the discretion of responsible heads of offices . No more insidious and evil change in the civil service statutes could be made than the one embodied in this bill . The Governor Would act wisely and in the public interest if he disapproved of it .
