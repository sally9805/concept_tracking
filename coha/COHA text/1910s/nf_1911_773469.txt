txt // pathy with our aspirations , and our natural prompting is to guard closely any expression of our hopes and ambitions . When they are near us our laudable purposes and desires shrink into insignificance and mere foolishness ; the charm of sentiment vanishes and life seems to lose color and zest . The effect of their presence is paralyzing , and we hasten from it as soon as possible . If we study these two types of personality , we shall find that the chief difference between them is that the first loves his kind , and the latter does not . Of course , that rare charm of manner which captivates all those who come within the sphere of its influence , and that strong personal magnetism which inclines all hearts toward its fortunate possessor , are largely natural gifts . But we shall find that the man who practises unselfishness , who is genuinely interested in the welfare of others , who feels it a privilege to have the power to do a fellow-creature a kindness , ? even though polished manners and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an elevating influence wherever he goes . He will bring encouragement to and uplift every life that touches his . He will be trusted and loved by all who come in contact with him . This type of personality we may all cultivate if we will . Magnetic personality is intangible . This mysterious something , which we sometimes call individuality , is often more powerful than the ability which can be measured , or the qualities that can be rated . Many women are endowed with this magnetic quality , which is entirely independent of personal beauty . It is often possessed in a high degree by very plain women . This was notably the case with some of the women who ruled in the French salons more absolutely than the king on his throne . At a social gathering , when conversation drags , and PERSONALITY AS A SUCCESS ASSET 20T interest is at a low ebb , the entrance of some bright woman with a magnetic personality instantly changes the whole situation . She may not be handsome , but everybody is attracted ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rare quality are frequently ignorant of the source of their power . They simply know they have it , but can not locate or describe it . While it is , like poetry , music , or art , a gift of nature , born in one , it can be cultivated to a certain extent . Much of the charm of a magnetic personality comes from a fine , cultivated manner . Tact , also , is a very important element , ? next to a fine manner , perhaps the most important . One must know exactly what to do , and be able to do just the right thing at the proper time . Good judgment and common sense are indispensable to those who are trying to acquire this magic power . Good taste is also one of the elements of personal charm . You can not offend the tastes of others without hurting their sensibilities . One of the greatest investments one can make is that of attaining a gracious manner , cordiality of bearing , generosity of feeling , the delightful art of pleasing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors fly open to sunny , pleasing personalities . They are more than welcome ; they are sought for everywhere . Many a youth owes his promotion or his first start in life to the disposition to be accommodating , to help along wherever he could . This was one of Lincoln 's chief characteristics ; he had a passion for helping people , for making himself agreeable under all circumstances . Mr. Herndon , his law partner , says : " When the Rutledge Tavern , where Lincoln boarded , was crowded , he would often give up his bed , and sleep on the counter in his store with a roll of calico for his pillow . Somehow everybody in trouble turned to him for help . " This generous desire to assist others and // to return kindnesses especially endeared Lincoln to the people . The power to please is a tremendous asset . What can be more valuable than a personality which always attracts , never repels ? It is not only valuable in business , but also in every field of life . It makes statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patients to the physician . It is worth everything to the clergyman . No matter what career you enter , you can not overestimate the importance of cultivating that charm of manner , those personal qualities , which attract people to you . They will take the place of capital , or influence . They are often a substitute for a large amount of hard work . Some men attract business , customers , clients , patients , as naturally as magnets attract particles of steel . Everything seems to point their way , for the same reason that the steel particles point toward the magnet ,  --  because they are attracted . Such men are business magnets . Business moves toward them , even when they do not apparently make half so much effort to get it as the less successful . Their friends call them " lucky dogs . " But if we analyze these men closely , we find that they have attractive qualities . There is usually some charm of personality about them that wins all hearts . Many successful business and professional men would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find what a large percentage of it is due to their habitual courtesy and other popular qualities . Had it not been for these , their sagacity , long-headedness , and business training would not , perhaps , have amounted to half so much ; for , no matter how able a man may be , if his coarse , rude manners drive away clients , patients , or customers , if his personality repels , he will always be placed at a disadvantage . It pays to cultivate popularity . It doubles success // possibilities , develops manhood , and builds up character . To be popular , one must strangle selfishness , he must keep back his bad tendencies , he must be polite , gentlemanly , agreeable , and companionable . In trying to be popular , he is on the road to success and happiness as well . The ability to cultivate friends is a powerful aid to success . It is capital which will stand by one when panics come , when banks fail , when business concerns go to the wall . How many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by fire or flood , or some other disaster , just because they had cultivated popular qualities , because they had learned the art of being agreeable , of making friends and holding them with hooks of steel ! People are influenced powerfully by their friendships , by their likes and dislikes , and a popular business or professional man has every advantage in the world over a cold , indifferent man , for customers , clients , or patients will flock to him . Cultivate the art of being agreeable . It will help you to self-expression as nothing else will : it will call out your success qualities ; it will broaden your sympathies . It is difficult to conceive of any more delightful birthright than to be born with this personal charm , and yet it is comparatively easy to cultivate , because it is made up of so many other qualities , all of which are cultivatable . I never knew a thoroughly unselfish person who was not an attractive person . No person who is always thinking of himself and trying to figure out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attractive . We are naturally disgusted with people who are trying to get everything for themselves and never think of anybody else . The secret of pleasing is in being pleasant yourself , in being interesting . If you would be agreeable , you must be magnanimous . The narrow , stingy soul is // not lovable . People shrink from such a character . There must be heartiness in the expression , in the smile , in the hand-shake , in the cordiality , which is unmistakable . The hardest natures can not resist these qualities any more than the eyes can resist the sun . If you radiate sweetness and light , people will love to get near you , for we are all looking for the sunlight , trying to get away from the shadows . It is unfortunate that these things are not taught more in the home and in the school ; for our success and happiness depend largely upon them . Many of us are no better than uneducated heathens . We may know enough , but we give ourselves out stingily and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad , generous , sympathetic , and magnanimous . Popular people , those with great personal charm , take infinite pains to cultivate all the little graces and qualities which go to make up popularity . If people who are naturally unsocial would only spend as much time and take as much pains as people who are social favorites in making themselves popular , they would accomplish wonders . Everybody is attracted by lovable qualities and is repelled by the unlovely wherever found . The whole principle of an attractive personality lives in this sentence . A fine manner pleases ; a coarse , brutal manner repels . We can not help being attracted to one who is always trying to help us , who gives us his sympathy , who is always trying to make us comfortable and to give us every advantage he can . On the other hand , we are repelled by people who are always trying to get something out of us , who elbow their way in front of us , to get the best seat in a car or a hall , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choicest bits at the table , who are always wanting to be waited on first at the restaurant or hotel , regardless of others . // The ability to bring the best that is in you to the man you are trying to reach , to make a good impression at the very first meeting , to approach a prospective customer as though you had known him for years without offending his taste , without raising the least prejudice , but getting his sympathy and good will , is a great accomplishment , and this is what commands a great salary . There is a charm in a gracious personality from which it is very hard to get away . It is difficult to snub the man who possesses it . There is something about him which arrests your prejudice , and no matter how busy or how worried you may be , or how much you may dislike to be interrupted , somehow you have n't the heart to turn away the man with a pleasing personality . Who has not felt his power multiplied many times , his intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faculties , when coming into contact with a strong personality which has called forth hidden powers which he never before dreamed he possessed , so that he could say things and do things impossible to him when alone ? The power of the orator , which he flings back to his listeners , he first draws from his audience , but he could never get it from the separate individuals any more than the chemist could get the full power from chemicals standing in separate bottles in his laboratory . It is in contact and combination only that new creations , new forces , are developed . We little realize what a large part of our achievement is due to others working through us , to their sharpening our faculties , radiating hope , encouragement , and helpfullness - into our lives , and sustaining and inspiring us mentally . We are apt to overestimate the value of an education from books alone . A large part of the value of a college education comes from the social intercourse of 2o6 PUSHING TO THE FRONT the students , the reenforcement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened and polished by the attrition of mind with mind , and the pitting of brain against brain , which stimulate ambition , brighten the ideals , and open up new hopes and possibilities . Book knowledge is valuable , but the knowledge which comes from mind intercourse is invaluable . Two substances totally unlike , but having a chemical affinity for each other , may produce a third infinitely stronger than either , or even both of those which unite . Two people with a strong affinity often call into activity in each other a power which neither dreamed he possessed before . Many an author owes his greatest book , his cleverest saying to a friend who has aroused in him latent powers which otherwise might have remained dormant . Artists have been touched by the power of inspiration through a masterpiece , or by some one they happened to meet who saw in them what no one else had ever seen , ? the power to do an immortal thing . The man who mixes with his fellows is ever on a voyage of discovery , finding new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden but for association with others . Everybody he meets has some secret for him , if he can only extract it , something which he never knew before , something which will help him on his way , something which will enrich his life . No man finds himself alone . Others are his discoverers . It is astonishing how much you can learn from people in social intercourse when you know how to look at them rightly . But it is a fact that you can only get a great deal out of them by giving them a great deal of yourself . The more you radiate yourself , the more magnanimous you are , the more generous of yourself , // the more you fling yourself out to them without reserve , the more you will get back . You must give much in order to get much . The current will not set toward you until it goes out from you . About all you get from others is a reflex of the currents from yourself . The more generously you give , the more you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out stingily , narrowly , meanly . You must give of yourself in a whole-hearted , generous way , or you will receive only stingy rivulets , when you might have had great rivers and torrents of blessings . A man who might have been symmetrical , wellrounded , had he availed himself of every opportunity of touching life along all sides , remains a pygmy in everything except his own little specialty , because he did not cultivate his social side . It is always a mistake to miss an opportunity of meeting with our kind , and especially of mixing with those above us , because we can always carry away something of value . It is through social intercourse that our rough corners are rubbed off , that we become polished and attractive . i If you go into social life with a determination to give it something , to make it a school for self-improvement , for calling out your best social qualities , for developing the latent brain cells , which have remained dormant for the lack of exercise , you will not find society either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , or you will not get anything . When you learn to look upon every one you meet as holding a treasure , something which will enrich your life , which will enlarge and broaden your experience , and make you more of a man , you will not think the time in the drawing-room wasted . The man who is determined to get on will look upon every experience as an educator , as a culture chisel , // which will make his life a little more shapely and attractive . Frankness of manner is one of the most delightful of traits in young or old . Everybody admires the open-hearted , the people who have nothing to conceal , and who do not try to cover up their faults and weaknesses . They are , as a rule , large-hearted and magnanimous . They inspire love and confidence , and , by their very frankness and simplicity , invite the same qualities in others . Secretiveness repels as much as frankness attracts . There is something about the very inclination to conceal or cover up which arouses suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in people who possess this trait , no matter how good they may seem to be , as in frank , sunny natures . Dealing with these secretive people is like traveling on a stage coach on a dark night . There is always a feeling of uncertainty . We may come out all right , but there is a lurking fear of some pitfall or unknown danger ahead of us . We are uncomfortable because of the uncertainties . They may be all right , and may deal squarely with us , but we are not sure and can not trust them . No matter how polite or gracious a secretive person may be , we can never rid ourselves of the feeling that there is a motive behind his graciousness , and that he has an ulterior purpose in view . He is always more or less of an enigma , because he goes through life wearing a mask . He endeavors to hide every trait that is not favorable to himself . Never , if he can help it , do we get a glimpse of the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open , who has no secrets , who reveals his heart to us , and who is frank , broad and liberal ! How quickly he wins our confidence ! How we all like and trust him ! We forgive him for many a slip or weakness , because he is always ready to confess his faults , and to make // amends for them . If he has bad qualities , they are always in sight , and we are ready to make allowances for them . His heart is sound and true , his sympathies are broad and active . The very qualities he possesses ? frankness and simplicity , ? are conducive to the growth of the highest manhood and womanhood . In the Black Hills of South Dakota there lived a humble , ignorant miner , who won the love and good will of everyone . " You ca n't ' elp likin ' ' im , " said an English miner , and when asked why the miners and the people in the town could n't help liking him , he answered . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a man . He always ' elps the boys when in trouble . You never go to ' im for nothin ' . " Bright , handsome young men , graduates of Eastern colleges , were there seeking their fortune ; a great many able , strong men drawn there from different parts of the country by the gold fever ; but none of them held the public confidence like this poor man . He could scarcely write his name , and knew nothing of the usages of polite society , yet he so intrenched himself in the hearts in his community that no other man , however educated or cultured , had the slightest chance of being elected to any office of prominence while " Ike " was around . He was elected mayor of his town , and sent to the legislature , although he could not speak a grammatical sentence . It was all because he had a heart in him ; he was a man . CHAPTER XVII IF YOU CAN TALK WELI , WHEN Charles W. Eliot was president of Harvard , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the education of a lady or gentleman , namely , an accurate and refined use of the mothertongue . " Sir Walter Scott defined " a good conversationalist " as " one who has ideas , who reads , thinks , listens , and who has therefore something to say . " There is no other one thing which enables us to make so good an impression , especially upon those who do not know us thoroughly , as the ability to converse well . To be a good conversationalist , able to interest people , to rivet their attention , to draw them to you naturally , by the very superiority of your conversational ability , is to be the possessor of a very great accomplishment , one which is superior to all others . It not only helps you to make a good impression upon strangers , it also helps you to make and keep friends . It opens doors and softens hearts . It makes you interesting in all sorts of company . It helps you to get on in the world . It sends you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best society , even though you are poor . A man who can talk well , who has the art of putting things in an attractive way , who can interest others immediately by his power of speech , has a very great advantage over one who may know more than he , but who can not express himself with ease or eloquence. 2I0 // No matter how expert you may be in. any other art or accomplishment , you can not use your expertness always and everywhere as you can the power to converse well . If you are a musician , no matter how talented you may be , or how many years you may have spent in perfecting yourself in your specialty , or how much it may have cost you , only comparatively few people can ever hear or appreciate your music . You may be a fine singer , and yet travel around the world without having an opportunity of showing your accomplishment , or without anyone guessing your specialty . But wherever you go and in whatever society you are , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be a painter , you may have spent years with great masters , and yet , unless you have very marked ability so that your pictures are hung in the salons or in the great art galleries , comparatively few people will ever see them . But if you are an artist in conversation , everyone who comes in contact with you will see your life-picture , which you have been painting ever since you began to talk . Everyone knows whether you are an artist or la bungler . In fact , you may have a great many accomplishments which people occasionally see or enjoy , and you may have a very beautiful home and a lot of property which comparatively few people ever know about ; but if you are a good converser , everyone with whom you talk will feel the influence of your skill and charm . A noted society leader , who has been very successful in the launching of debutantes in society , always gives this advice to her proteges , " Talk , talk . It does not matter much what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrasses and bores the average man so much as a girl who has to be entertained . " There is a helpful suggestion in this advice . The way to learn to talk is to talk . The temptation for // people who are unaccustomed to society , and who feel diffident , is to say nothing themselves and listen to what others say . Good talkers are always sought after in society . Everybody wants to invite Mrs. So-and-So to dinners or receptions because she is such a good talker . She entertains . She may have many defects , but people enjoy her society because she can talk well . Conversation , if used as an educator , is a tremendous power developer ; but talking without thinking , without an effort to express oneself with clearness , conciseness , or efficiency , mere chattering , or gossiping , the average society small talk , will never get hold of the best thing in a man . It lies too deep for such superficial efort . Thousands of young people who envy such of their mates as are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings and their half-holidays , saying nothing but the most frivolous , frothy , senseless things ? things which do not rise to the level of humor , but the foolish , silly talk which demoralizes one 's ambition , lowers one 's ideals and all the standards of life , because it begets habits of superficial and senseless thinking . On the streets , on the cars , and in public places , loud , coarse voices are heard in light , flippant , slipshod speech , in coarse slang expressions . " You 're talking through your hat " ; " Search me " ; " You just bet " ; " Well , that 's the limit " ; " I hate that man ; he gets on my nerves , " and a score of other such vulgarities we often hear . Nothing else will indicate your fineness or coarseness of culture , your breeding or lack of it , so quickly as your conversation . It will tell your whole life 's story . What you say , and how you say it , will betray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure . There is no accomplishment , no attainment which you can use so constantly and effectively , which will // give so much pleasure to your friends , as fine conversation . There is no doubt that the gift of language was intended to be a much greater accomplishment than the majority of us have ever made of it . Most of us are bunglers in our conversation , because we do not make an art of it ; we do not take the trouble or pains to learn to talk well . We do not read enough or think enough . Most of us express ourselves in sloppy , slipshod English , because it is so much easier to do so than it is to think before we speak , to make an effort to express ourselves with elegance , ease , and power . Poor conversers excuse themselves for not trying to improve by saying that " good talkers are born , not made . " We might as well say that good lawyers , good physicians , or good merchants are born , not made . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the price of all achievement that is of value . Many a man owes his advancement very largely to his ability to converse well . The ability to interest people in your conversation , to hold them , is a great power . The man who has a bungling expression , who knows a thing , but never can put it in logical , interesting , or commanding language , is always placed at a great disadvantage . I know a business man who has cultivated the art of conversation to such an extent that it is a great treat to listen to him . His language flows with such liquid , limpid beauty , his words are chosen with such exquisite delicacy , taste , and accuracy , there is such a refinement in his diction that he charms everyone who hears him speak . All his life he has been a reader of the finest prose and poetry , and has cultivated conversation as a fine art . You may think you are poor and have no chance in life . You may be situated so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be able to go to school or college , or to study music or art , as you long to ; you may be tied down to an iron environment ; you may be tortured with an unsatisfied , disappointed ambition ; and yet you can become an interesting talker , because in every sentence you utter you can practise the best form of expression . Every hook you read , every person with whom you converse , who uses good English , can help you . Few people think very much about how they are going to express themselves . They use the first words that come to them . They do not think of forming a sentence so that it will have beauty , brevity , transparency , power . The words flow from their lips helterskelter , with little thought of arrangement or order . Now and then we meet a real artist in conversation , and it is such a treat and delight that we wonder why the most of us should he such bunglers in our conversation , that we should make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is capable of being made the art of arts . I have met a dozen persons in my lifetime who have given me such a glimpse of its superb possibilities that it has made all other arts seem comparatively unimportant to me . I was once a visitor at Wendell Phillips 's home in Boston , and the music of his voice , the liquid charm of his words , the purity , the transparency of his diction , the profundity of his knowledge , the fascination of his personality , and his marvelous art of putting things , I shall never forget . He sat down on the sofa beside me and talked as he would to an old schoolmate , and it seemed to me that I had never heard such exquisite and polished English . I have met several English people who possessed that marvelous power of " soul in conversation which charms all who come under its spell . " // Mrs. Mary A. Livermore , Julia Ward Howe , and Elizabeth S. P. Ward , had this wonderful conversational charm , as has ex-President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . We all know people who use the choicest language and express their thoughts in fluent , liquid diction , who impress us by the wonderful flow of their conversation ; but that is all there is to it . They do not impress us with their thoughts ; they do not stimulate us to action . We do not feel any more determined to do something in the world , to be somebody , after we have heard them talk than we felt before . We know other people who talk very little , but whose words are so full of meat and stimulating brain force that we feel ourselves multiplied many times by the power they have injected into us . In olden times the art of conversation reached a much higher standard than that of to-day . The deterioration is due to the complete revolution in the conditions of modern civilization . Formerly people had almost no other way of communicating their thoughts than by speech . Knowledge of all kinds was disseminated almost wholly through the spoken word . There were no great daily newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries of vast wealth in the precious minerals , the new world opened tip by inventions and discoveries , and the great impetus to ambition have changed all this . In this lightning-express age , in these strenuous times , when everybody has the mania to attain wealth and position , we no longer have time to reflect with deliberation , and to develop our powers of conversation . In these great newspaper and periodical days , when everybody can get for one or a few cents the news and information which it has cost thousands of dollars to collect , everybody sits behind the morning sheet or is buried in a book or magazine . // There is no longer the same need of communicating thought by the spoken word . Oratory is becoming a lost art for the same reason . Printing has become so cheap that even the poorest homes can get more reading for a few dollars than kings and noblemen could afford in the Middle Ages . It is a rare thing to find a polished conversationalist to-day . So rare is it to hear one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is indeed a luxury . Good reading , however , will not only broaden the mind and give new ideas , but it will also increase one 's vocabulary , and that is a great aid to conversation . Many people have good thoughts and ideas , but they can not express them because of the poverty of their vocabulary . They have not words enough to clothe their ideas and make them attractive . They talk around in a circle , repeat and repeat , because , when they want a particular word to convey their exact meaning , they can not find it . If you are ambitious to talk well , you must be as much as possible in the society of well-bred , cultured people . If you seclude yourself , though you are a college graduate , you will he a poor converser . We all sympathize with people , especially the timid and shy , who have that awful feeling of repression and stifling of thought , when they make an effort to say something and can not . Timid young people often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school or college . But many a great orator went through the same sort of experience , when he first attempted to speak in public and was often deeply humiliated by his blunders and failures . There is no other way , however , to become an orator or a good conversationalist than by constantly trying to express oneself efficiently and elegantly . // If you find that your ideas fly from you when you attempt to express them , that you stammer and flounder about for words which you are unable to find , you may be sure that every honest effort you make , even if you fail in your attempt , will make it all the easier for you to speak well the next time . It is remarkable , if one keeps on trying , how quickly he will conquer his awkwardness and self-consciousness , and will gain ease of manner and facility of expression . Everywhere we see people placed at a tremendous disadvantage because they have never learned the art of putting their ideas into interesting , telling language . We see brainy men at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit silent , unable to tell what they know , when they are infinitely better informed than those who are making a great deal of display of oratory or smooth talk . People with a lot of ability , who know a great deal , often appear like a set of dummies in company , while some superficial , shallow-brained person holds the attention of those present simply because he can tell what he knows in an interesting way . They are constantly humiliated and embarrassed when away from those who happen to know their real worth , because they can not carry on an intelligent conversation upon any topic . There are hundreds of these silent people at our national capital ? many of them wives of husbands who have suddenly and unexpectedly come into political prominence . Many people ? and this is especially true of scholars  --  seem to think that the great desideratum in life is to get as much valuable information into the head as possible . But it is just as important to know how to give out knowledge in a palatable manner as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may be well read in history and in politics , you may be wonderfully well-posted in science , literature , and art , and yet , if // your knowledge is locked up within you , you will always be placed at a great disadvantage . Locked-up ability may give the individual some satisfaction , but it must be exhibited , expressed in some attractive way , before the world will appreciate it or give credit for it . It does not matter how valuable the rough diamond may be , no explaining , no describing its marvels of beauty within , and its great value , would avail ; nobody would appreciate it until it was ground and polished and the light let into its depths to reveal its hidden brilliancy . Conversation is to the man what the cutting of the diamond is to the stone . The grinding does not add anything to the diamond . It merely reveals its wealth . How little parents realize the harm they are doing their children by allowing them to grow up ignorant of or indifferent to the marvelous possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , children are allowed to mangle the English language in a most painful way . Nothing else will develop the brain and character more than the constant effort to talk well , intelligently , interestingly , upon all sorts of topics . There is a splendid discipline in the constant effort to express one 's thoughts in clear language and in an interesting manner . We know people who are such superb conversers that no one would ever dream that they have not had the advantages of the higher schools . Many a college graduate has been silenced and put to shame by people who have never even been to a high school , but who have cultivated the art of self-expression . The school and the college employ the student comparatively a few hours a day for a few years ; conversation is a training in a perpetual school . Many get the best part of their education in this school . Conversation is a great ability discoverer , a great revealer of possibilities and resources . It stimulates // thought wonderfully . We think more of ourselves if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold others . The power to do so increases our self-respect , our selfconfidence . No man knows what he really possesses until he makes his best effort to express to others what is in him . Then the avenues of the mind fly open , the faculties are on the alert . Every good converser has felt a power come to him from the listener which he never felt before , and which often stimulates and inspires to fresh endeavor . The mingling of thought with thought , the contact of mind with mind , develops new powers , as the mixing of two chemicals often produces a new third substance . To converse well one must listen well also ? hold oneself in a receptive attitude . We are not only poor conversationalists , but we are poor listeners as well . We are too impatient to listen . Instead of being attentive and eager to drink in the story or the information , we have not enough respect for the talker to keep quiet . We look about impatiently , perhaps snap our watch , play a tattoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitch about as if we were bored and were anxious to get away , and interrupt the speaker before he reaches his conclusion . In fact , we are such an impatient people that we have no time for anything excepting to push ahead , to elbow our way through the crowd to get the position or the money we desire . Our life is feverish and unnatural . We have no time to develop charm of manner , or elegance of diction . " We are too intense for epigram or repartee . We lack time . " Nervous impatience is a conspicuous characteristic of the American people . Everything bores us which does not bring us more business , or more money , or which does not help us to attain the position for which we are striving . Instead of enjoying our friends , we // are inclined to look upon them as so many rungs in a ladder , and to value them in proportion as they furnish readers for our books , send us patients , clients , customers or show their ability to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry and drive , before this age of excitement , it was considered one of the greatest luxuries possible to be a listener in a group surrounding an intelligent talker . Et was better than most modern lectures , than anything one could find in a book ; for there was a touch of personality , a charm of style , a magnetism which held , a superb personality which fascinated . For the hungry soul , yearning for an education , to drink in knowledge from those wise lips was to be fed with a royal feast indeed . But to-day everything is " touch and go . " We have no time to stop on the street and give a decent salutation . It is : " I low do ? " or " Morning , " accompanied by a sharp nod of the head , instead of by a graceful bow . We have no time for the graces and the charms . Everything must give way to the material . We have no time for the development of a fine manner ; the charm of the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . A new type of individual has sprung up . We work like Trojans during the clay , and then rush to a theater or other place of amusement in the evening . We have no time to make our own amusement or to develop the faculty of humor and fun-making as people used to do . We pay people for doing that while we sit and laugh . We are like some college boys , who depend upon tutors to carry them through their examinations ? they expect to buy their education ready-made . Life is becoming so artificial , so forced , so diverse from naturalness , we drive our human engines at such a fearful speed , that our finer life is crushed out . // Spontaneity and humor , and the possibility of a fine culture and a superb charm of personality in us are almost impossible and extremely rare . One cause for our conversational decline is a lack of sympathy . We are too selfish , too busily engaged in our own welfare , and wrapped up in our own little world , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one can make a good conversationalist who is not sympathetic . You must be able to enter into another 's life , to live it with the other person , to be a good listener or a good talker . Walter Besant used to tell of a clever woman who had a great reputation as a conversationalist , though she talked very little . She had such a cordial , sympathetic manner that she helped the timid and the shy to say their best things , and made them feel at home . She dissipated their fears , and they could say things to her which they could not say to anyone else . People thought her an interesting conversationalist because she had this ability to call out the best in others . If you would make yourself agreeable you must be able to enter into the life of the people you are conversing with , and you must touch them along the lines of their interest . No matter how much you may know about a subject , if it does not happen to interest those to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is pitiable , sometimes , to see men standing around at the average reception or club gathering , dumb , almost helpless , and powerless to enter heartily into the conversation because they are in a subjective mood . They are thinking , thinking , thinking business , business , business ; thinking how they can get on a little faster ? get more business , more clients , more patients , or more readers for their books ? or a better house to live in ; how they can make more show . They do not // enter heartily into the lives of others , or abandon themselves to the occasion enough to make good talkers . They are cold and reserved , distant , because their minds are somewhere else , their affections on themselves and their own affairs . There are only two things that interest them ; business and their own little world . If you talk about these things , they are interested at once ; but they do not care a snap about your affairs , how you get on , or what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our conversation will never reach a high standard while we live in such a feverish , selfish , and unsympathetic state . Great conversationalists have always been very tactful ? interesting without offending . It does not do to stab people if you would interest them , nor to drag out their family skeletons . Some people have the peculiar quality of touching the best that is in us ; others stir up the bad . Every time they come into our presence they irritate us . Others allay all that is disagreeable . They never touch our sensitive spots , and they call out all that is spontaneous and sweet and beautiful . Lincoln was master of the art of making himself interesting to everybody he met . He put people at ease with his stories and jokes , and made them feel so completely at home in his presence that they opened up their mental treasures to him without reserve . Strangers were always glad to talk with him because he was so cordial and quaint , and always gave more than he got . A sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great addition to one 's conversational power . But not everyone can be funny ; and , if you lack the sense of humor , you will make yourself ludicrous by attempting to be funny . A good conversationalist , however , is not too serious . He does not deal too much with facts , no matter how important . Facts , statistics , weary . // Vivacity is absolutely necessary . Heavy conversation bores ; too light , disgusts . Therefore , to be a good conversationalist you must be spontaneous , buoyant , natural , sympathetic , and must show a spirit of good will . You must feel a spirit of helpfulness , and must enter heart and soul into things which interest others . You must get the attention of people and hold it by interesting them , and you can only interest them by a warm sympathy ? a real friendly sympathy . If you are cold , distant , and unsympathetic you can not hold their attention . You must be broad , tolerant . A narrow stingy soul never talks well . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice , and of fairness , never interests you . You lock tight all the approaches to your inner self , every avenue is closed to him . Your magnetism and your helpfulness are thus cut off , and the conversation is perfunctory , mechanical , and without life or feeling . You must bring your listener close to you , must open your heart wide , and exhibit a broad free nature , and an open mind . You must be responsive , so that he will throw wide open every avenue of his nature and give you free access to his heart of hearts . If a man is a success anywhere , it ought to be in his personality , in his power to express himself in strong , effective , interesting language . He should not be obliged to give a stranger an inventory of his possessions in order to show that he has achieved something . . greater wealth should flow from his lips , and express itself in his manner . No amount of natural ability or education or good clothes , no amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use poor English .

" Zephyr made no reply , but floated from out the bowers of the sky , and all the rivers and lakes and seas , all the forests and fields , all the beasts and birds and men smiled at its coming . Gardens bloomed , orchards ripened , silver wheat-fields turned to gold , fleecy clouds went sailing in the lofty heaven , the pinions of birds and the sails of vessels were gently wafted onward , and health and happiness were everywhere . The foliage and flowers and fruits and harvests , the warmth and sparkle and gladness and beauty and life were the only answer Zephyr gave to the insolent question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Victoria once expressed herself to her husband in rather a despotic tone , and Prince Albert , whose manly self-respect was smarting at her words , sought the seclusion of his own apartment , closing and locking the door . In about five minutes some one knocked . " Who is it ? " inquired the Prince . " It is I. Open to the Queen of England ! " haughtily responded her Majesty . There was no rey . After a long interval there came a gentle tapping // and the low spoken words : " It is I , Victoria , your wife . " Is it necessary to add that the door was opened , or that the disagreement was at an end ? It is said that civility is to a man what beauty is to a woman : it creates an instantaneous impression in his behalf . The monk Basle , according to a quaint old legend , died while under the ban of excommunication by the pope , and was sent in charge of an angel to find his proper place in the nether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won friends wherever he went . The fallen angels adopted his manner , and even the good angels went a long way to see him and live with him . He was removed to the lowest depths of Hades , but with the same result . His inborn politeness and kindness of heart were irresistible , and he seemed to change the hell into a heaven . At length the angel returned with the monk , saying that no place could he found in which to punish him . He still remained the same Basle . So his sentence was revoked , and he was sent to Heaven and canonized as a saint . The Duke of Marlborough " wrote English badly and spelled it worse , " yet he swayed the destinies of empires . The charm of his manner was irresistible and influenced all Furope . His fascinating smile and winning speech disarmed the fiercest hatred and made friends of the bitterest enemies . A gentleman took his ( laughter of sixteen to Richmond to witness the trial of his bitter personal enemy , Aaron Burr , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Burr 's charming manner that she sat with his friends . Her father took her from the courtroom , and locked her up , but she was so overcome by the fine manner of the accused that she believed in his innocence and prayed for his acquittal . " To this day , " said she fifty years afterA // wards , " I feel the magic of his wonderful deportment . " Madame Recamier was so charming that when she passed around the box at the Church St. Roche in Paris , twenty thousand francs were put into it . At the great reception to Napoleon on his return from Italy , the crowd caught sight of this fascinating woman and almost forgot to look at the great hero . " Please , Madame , " whispered a servant to Madame de Maintenon at dinner , " one anecdote more , for there is no roast to-day . " She was so fascinating in manner and speech that her guests appeared to overlook all the little discomforts of life . According to St. Beuve , the privileged circle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches . Those arriving in the first coach had a rueful experience to relate ? a terrific thunder-storm , shocking roads , and danger and gloom to the whole company . The party in the second coach heard their story with surprise ; of thunder-storm , of steeps , of mud , of danger , they knew nothing ; no , they had forgotten earth , and breathed a purer air ; such a conversation between Madame de Stael and Madame Recamier and Benjamin Constant and Schlegel ! they were all in a state of delight . The intoxication of the conversation had made them insensible to all notice of weather or rough roads . " If I were Queen , " said Madame Tesse , " I should command Madame de Stael to talk to me every day . " " When she had passed , " as Longfellow wrote of Evangeline , " it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music . " Madame de Stael was anything but beautiful , but she possessed that indefinable something before which mere conventional beauty cowers , commonplace and ashamed . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the creatures of her will , and e shaped careers as if she were omnipotent . Even // the Emperor Napoleon feared her influence over his people so much that he destroyed her writings and banished her from France . In the words of Whittier it could be said of her as might be said of any woman : Our homes are cheerier for her sake , Our door-yards brighter blooming , And all about the social air Is sweeter for her coming . A guest for two weeks at the house of Arthur M. Cavanaugh , M. P. , who was without arms or legs , was very desirous of knowing how he fed himself ; but the conversation and manner of the host were so charming that the visitor was scarcely conscious of his deformity . " When Dickens entered a room , " said one who knew him well , " it was like the sudden kindling of a big fire , by which every one was warmed .

" I do n't think much of Choate 's spread-eagle talk , " said a simple-minded member of a jury that had given five successive verdicts to the great advocate ; " hut I call him a very lucky lawyer , for there was not one of those five cases that came before us where he was n't on the right side . " His manner as well as his logic was irresistible . When Edward Everett took a professor 's chair at // Harvard after five years of study in Europe , he was almost worshiped by the students . His manner seemed touched by that exquisite grace seldom found except in women of rare culture . His great popularity lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could describe , and which never left him . A New York lady had just taken her seat in a car on a train bound for Philadelphia , when a somewhat stout man sitting just ahead of her lighted a cigar . She coughed and moved uneasily ; but the hints had no effect , so she said tartly : " You probably are a foreigner , and do not know that there is a smoking-car attached to the train . Smoking is not permitted here . " The man made no reply , but threw his cigar from the window . What has her astonishment when the conductor told her , a moment later , that she had entered the private car of General Grant . She withdrew in confusion , but the same fine courtesy which led him to give up his cigar was shown again as he spared her the mortification of even a questioning glance , still less of a look of amusement , although she watched his dumb , immovable figure with apprehension until she reached the door . Julian Ralph , after telegraphing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned to his hotel at two o'clock in the morning , to find all the doors locked . With two - friends who had accompanied him , he battered at a side door to wake the servants , but what was his chagrin when the door was opened by the President of the United States ! " Why , that 's all right , " said Mr. Arthur when Mr. Ralph asked his pardon . " You would n't have got in - till morning if I had not come . No one is up in the muse but me . I could have sent my colored boy , but e had fallen asleep and I hated to wake him . " The late King Edward , when Prince of Wales , the // first gentleman in Europe , invited an eminent man to dine with him . When coffee was served , the guest , to the consternation of the others , drank from his saucer . An open titter of amusement went round the table . The Prince , quickly noting the cause of the untimely amusement , gravely emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his guest . Silent and abashed , the other members of the princely household took the rebuke and did the same . Queen Victoria sent for Carlyle , who was a Scotch peasant , offering him the title of nobleman , which he declined , feeling that he had always been a nobleman in his own right . Tie understood so little of the manners at court that , when presented to the Queen , after speaking to her a few minutes , being tired , he said . " Let us sit down , madam ; " whereat the courtiers were ready to faint . But she was great enough , and gave a gesture that seated all her puppets in a moment . The Queen 's courteous suspension of the rules of etiquette , and what it may have cost her , can be better understood from what an acquaintance of Carlyle said of him when he saw him for the first time . " His presence , in some unaccountable manner , rasped the nerves . I expected to meet a rare being , and I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had had an attack of seasickness . " Some persons wield a scepter before which others seem to bow in glad obedience . But whence do they obtain such magic power ? What is the secret of that almost hypnotic influence over people which we would give anything to possess ? Courtesy is not always found in high places . Even royal courts furnish many examples of bad manners . At an entertainment given years ago by Prince Edward and the Princess of Wales , to which only the very cream of the cream of society was admitted , there was such pushing and struggling to see the Princess , who // was then but lately married , that , as she passed through the reception rooms , a bust of the Princess Royal was thrown from its pedestal and damaged , and the pedestal upset ; and the ladies , in their eagerness to see the Princess , actually stood upon it . When Catherine of Russia gave receptions to her nobles , she published the following rules of etiquette upon cards : " Gentlemen will not get drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike their wives in company . Ladies of the court must not wash out their mouths in the drinking-glasses , or wipe their faces on the damask , or pick their teeth with forks . " But to-day the nobles of Russia have no superiors in manners . Etiquette originally meant the ticket or tag tied to a bag to indicate its contents . If a bag had this ticket it was not examined . From this the word passed to cards upon which were printed certain rules to be observed by guests . These rules were " the ticket " or the etiquette . To be " the ticket , " or , as it was sometimes expressed , to act or talk by the card , became the thing with the better classes . It was fortunate for Napoleon that he married Josephine before he was made commander-in-chief of the armies of Italy . Her fascinating manners and her wonderful powers of persuasion were more influential than the loyalty of any dozen men in France in attaching to him the adherents who would promote his interests . Josephine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field ? a preeminent leader . The secret of her personality that made her the Empress not only of the hearts of the Frenchmen , but also of the nations her husband conquered , has en beautifully told by herself . " There is only one asion , " she said to a friend , " in which I would luntarily use the words , I will ! ' ? namely , when I Quid say , I will that all around me be happy . ' " // the most petulant . Ill breeding invites and authorizes the familiarity of the most timid . No man ever said a pert thing to the Duke of Marlborough , or a civil one to Sir Robert Walpole . " The true gentleman can not harbor those qualities which excite the antagonism of others , as revenge , hatred , malice , envy , or jealousy , for these poison the sources of spiritual life and shrivel the soul . Generosity of heart and a genial good will towards all are absolutely essential to him who would possess fine manners .

Ile refuses his wife a little money to buy a needed dress , and accuses her of extravagance that would ruin a millionaire . Suddenly the bell rings . Some neighbors call : what a change ! The hear of a moment ago is as docile as a lamb . As by magic he becomes talkative , polite , generous . After the callers have gone , his little girl begs her father to keep on his " company manners " for a little while , but the sullen mood returns and his courtesy vanishes as quickly as it came . IIe is the same disagreeable , contemptible , crabbed bear as before the arrival of his guests . What friend of the great Dr. Johnson did not feel mortified and pained to see him eat like an Esquimau , and to hear him call men " liars " because they did not agree with him ? He was called the " Ursa Major , " or Great Bear . Benjamin Rush said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " the American Indians , " Dr. Johnson exclaimed : " There is not an Indian in North America foolish enough to ask such a question . " " Sir , " replied Goldsmith , " there is not a savage in America rude enough to make such a speech to a gentleman . " After Stephen A. Douglas had been abused in the // Senate he rose and said : " What no gentleman should say no gentleman need answer . " Aristotle thus described a real gentleman more than two thousand years ago : " The magnanimous man will behave with moderation under both good fortune and bad . He will not allow himself to be exalted ; he will not allow himself to be abased . He will neither be delighted with success , nor grieved with failure . He will never choose danger , not seek it . He is not given to talk about himself or others . He does not care that he himself should be praised , nor that other people should be blamed . " A gentleman is just a gentle man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was first a diamond in the rough . A gentleman is gentle , modest , courteous , slow to take offense , and never giving it . He is slow to surmise evil , as he never thinks it . He subjects his appetites , refines his tastes , subdues his feelings , controls his speech , and deems every other person as good as himself . A gentleman , like porcelain-ware , must be painted before he is glazed . There can be no change after it is burned in , and all that is put on afterwards will wash off . He who has lost all but retains his courage , cheerfulness , hope , virtue , and self-respect , is a true gentleman , and is rich still . " You replace Dr. Franklin , I hear , " said the French Minister , Count de Vergennes , to Mr. Jefferson , who had been sent to Paris to relieve our most popular representative .

" // Cowper says : A modest , sensible , and well-bred man Would not insult me , and no other can . " I never listen to calumnies , " said Montesquieu , " because if they are untrue I run the risk of being deceived , and if they are true , of hating people not worth thinking about . " " I think , " says Emerson , " Hans Andersen 's story of the cobweb cloth woven so fine that it was invisible ? woven for the king 's garment ? must mean manners , which do really clothe a princely nature . " No one can fully estimate how great a factor in life is the possession of good manners , or timely thoughtfulness with human sympathy behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are the open sesame to the best of society . Manners are what vex or soothe , exalt or debase , barbarize or refine us by a constant , steady , uniform , invincible operation like that of the air we breathe . Even power itself has not half the might of gentleness , that subtle oil which lubricates our relations with each other , and enables the machinery of society to perform its functions without friction . " Have you not seen in the woods , in a late autumn morning , " asks Emerson , " a poor fungus , or mushroom , ? a plant without any solidity , nay , that seemed nothing but a soft mush or jelly , ? by its constant , total , and inconceivably gentle pushing , manage to break its way up through the frosty ground , and actually to lift a hard crust on its head ? It is the symbol of the power of kindness . " " There is no policy like politeness , " says Magoon ; " since a good manner often succeeds where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing is the art of rising in the world . // The politest people in the world , it is said , are the Jews . In all ages they have been maltreated and reviled , and despoiled of their civil privileges and their social rights ; yet are they everywhere polite and affable . They indulge in few or no recriminations ; are faithful to old associations ; more considerate of the prejudices of others than others are of theirs ; not more worldly-minded and money-loving than people generally are ; and , everything considered , they surpass all nations in courtesy , affability , and forbearance . " Men , like bullets , " says Richter , " go farthest when they are smoothest . " Napoleon was much displeased on hearing that Josephine had permitted General Lorges , a young and handsome man , to sit beside her on the sofa . Josephine explained that , instead of its being General Lorges , it was one of the aged generals of his army , entirely unused to the customs of courts . She was unwilling to wound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to retain his seat . Napoleon commended her highly for her courtesy . President Jefferson was one day riding with his grandson , when they met a slave , who took off his hat and bowed . The President returned the salutation by raising his hat , but the grandson ignored the civility of the negro . " Thomas , " said the grandfather , " do you permit a slave to be more of a gentleman than yourself ?

In hastily turning the corner of a crooked street in London , a young lady ran with great force against a ragged beggar-boy and almost knocked him down . Stopping as soon as she could , she turned around and said very kindly : " I beg your pardon , my little fellow ; I am very sorry that I ran against you . " The astonished boy looked at her a moment , and then , taking off about three quarters of a cap , made a low bow and said , while a broad , pleasant smile overspread his face : " You have my yarding , miss , and welcome , ? and welcome ; and the next time you run ag'in ' me , you can knock nee clean down and I wo n't say a word .

A Washington politician went to visit Daniel Webster at Marshfield , Mass. , and , in taking a short cut to the house , came to a stream which he could not cross . Calling to a rough-looking farmer near by , he offered a quarter to be carried to the other side . The farmer took the politician on his broad shoulders and landed him safely , but would not take the quarter . The old rustic presented himself at the house a few minutes later , and to the great surprise and chagrin of the visitor was introduced as Mr. Webster .

" St. Paul 's speech before Agrippa is a model of dignified courtesy , as well as of persuasive eloquence . Good manners often prove a fortune to a young man . Mr. Butler , a merchant in Providence , R. I. , had once closed his store and was on his way home when he met a little girl who wanted a spool of thread . He went back , opened the store , and got the thread . This little incident was talked of all about the city and brought him hundreds of customers . He became very wealthy , largely because of his courtesy . Ross Winans of Baltimore owed his great success and fortune largely to his courtesy to two foreign strangers . Although his was but a fourth-rate factory , his great politeness in explaining the minutest details to his visitors was in such marked contrast with the limited attention they had received in large establishments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their Czar , who later invited Mr. Winans to establish locomotive works in Russia . He did so , and soon his profits resulting from his politeness were more than $roo , 000 a year . A poor curate saw a crowd of rough boys and men laughing and making fun of two aged spinsters i dressed in antiquated costume . The ladies were embarrassed and did not dare enter the church . The curate pushed through the crowd , conducted them up the central aisle , and amid the titter of the congregation , gave them choice seats . These old ladies although strangers to him , at their death left the gentle curate a large fortune . Courtesy pays . Not long ago a lady met the late President Humphrey of Amherst College , and she was so much // pleased with his great politeness that she gave a generous donation to the college .

Hence , no man ever put good will or energy into work done for him , and his patrons went to shops where they were sure of civility . " Some men almost work their hands off and deny themselves many of the common comforts of life in their earnest efforts to succeed , and yet render success impossible by their cross-grained ungentlemanliness . They repel patronage , and , naturally , business which might easily he theirs goes to others who are really less deserving but more companionable . Bad manners often neutralize even honesty , industry , and the greatest energy ; while agreeable manners win in spite of other defects . Take two men possessing equal advantages in every other respect ; if one be gentlemanly , kind , obliging , and conciliating , and the other disobliging , rude , harsh , and insolent , the former will become rich while the boorish one will starve . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the Bon Marche , an enormous establishment in Paris where thousands of clerks are employed , and where almost everything is kept for sale . The two distinguishing characteristics of the house are one low price to all , and extreme courtesy .

Something more must be done than is done in other stores , so that every visitor will rememA // ber the Bon Marche with pleasure . By this course the business has been developed until it is said to be the largest of the kind in the world . " Thank you , my dear ; please call again , " spoken to a little beggar-girl who bought a pennyworth of snuff proved a profitable advertisement and made Lundy Foote a millionaire . Many persons of real refinement are thought to be stiff , proud , reserved , and haughty who are not , but are merely diffident and shy . It is a curious fact that diffidence often betrays us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense mortification and embarrassment . Excessive shyness must be overcome as an obstacle to perfect manners . It is peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon and the Teutonic races , and has frequently been a barrier to the highest culture . It is a disease of the finest organizations and the highest types of humanity . It never attacks the coarse and vulgar . Sir Isaac Newton was the shyest man of his age . He did not acknowledge his great discovery for years just for fear of attracting attention to himself . He would not allow his name to be used in connection with his theory of the moon 's motion , for fear it would increase the acquaintances he would have to meet . George Washington was awkward and shy and had 1he air of a countryman . Archbishop Whately was so shy that he would escape notice whenever it was possible . At last he determined to give up trying to cure his shyness ; " for why , " he asked , " should I endure this torture all my life ? " when , to his surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would hide in the cellar when his parents had company . Practice on the stage or lecture platform does not always eradicate shyness . David Garrick , the great actor , was once summoned to testify in court ; and , // though he had acted for thirty years with marked selfpossession , he was so confused and embarrassed that the judge dismissed him . John B. Gough said that he could not rid himself of his early diffidence and shrinking from public notice . He said that he never went on the platform without fear and trembling , and would often be covered with cold perspiration . There are many worthy people who are brave on the street , who would walk up to a cannon 's mouth in battle , but who are cowards in the drawing-room , and dare not express an opinion in the social circle . They feel conscious of a subtle tyranny in society 's code , which locks their lips and ties their tongues . Addison was one of the purest writers of English and a perfect master of the pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being embarrassed . Shakespeare was very shy . He retired from London at forty , and did not try to publish or preserve one of his plays . He took second or third-rate parts on account of his diffidence . Generally shyness comes from a person thinking too much about himself ( ? which in itself is a breach of good breeding ? and wondering what other people think about him . " I was once very shy , " said Sydney Smith , " but it was not long before I made two very useful discoveries ; first , that all mankind were not solely employed in observing me ; and next , that shamming was of no use ; that the world was very clear-sighted , and soon estimated a man at his true value . This cured me . " What a misfortune it is to go through life apparently encased in ice , yet all the while full of kindly , cordial feeling for one 's fellow men ! Shy people are always distrustful of their powers and look upon their lack of confidence as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the reverse . By teaching children // early the arts of social life , such as boxing , horseback riding , dancing , elocution , and similar accomplishments , we may do much to overcome the sense of shyness . Shy people should dress well . Good clothes give ease of manner , and unlock the tongue . The consciousness of being well dressed gives a grace and ease of manner that even religion will not bestow , while inferiority of garb often induces restraint . As peculiarities in apparel are sure to attract attention , it is well to avoid bright colors and fashionable extremes , and wear plain , well-fitting garments of as good material as the purse will afford . Beauty in dress is a good thing , rail at it who may . But it is a lower beauty , for which a higher beauty should not be sacrificed . They love dress too much who give it their first thought , their best time , or all their money ; who for it neglect the culture of the mind or heart , or the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress than for their character ; who are troubled more by an unfashionable garment than by a neglected duty . When Ezekiel Whitman , a prominent lawyer and graduate of Harvard , was elected to the Massachusetts legislature , he came to Boston from his farm in countryman 's dress , and went to a hotel in Boston . He entered the parlor and sat down , when he overheard the remark between some ladies and gentlemen : " Ah , here comes a real homespun countryman . Here 's fun . " They asked him all sorts of queer questions , tending to throw ridicule upon him , when he arose and said , " Ladies and gentlemen , permit me to wish you health and happiness , and may you grow better and wiser in advancing years , bearing in mind that outward appearances are deceitful . You mistook me , from my dress , for a country booby ; while I , from the same superficial cause , thought you were ladies and // gentlemen . The mistake has been mutual . " Just then Governor Caleb Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dumfounded company , said : " I wish you a very good evening . " " In civilized society , " says Johnson , " external advantages make us more respected . A man with a good coat upon his back meets with a better reception than he who has a bad one . " One can not but feel that God is a lover of the beautiful . He has put robes of beauty and glory upon all his works . Every lower is dressed in richness ; every field blushes beneath a mantle of beauty ; every star is veiled in brightness ; every bird is clothed in the habiliments of the most exquisite taste . Some people look upon polished manners as a kind of affectation . ' I'hcy claim admiration for plain , solid , square , rugged characters . They might as well say that they prefer square , plain , unornamented houses made from square blocks of stone . St. Peter 's is none the less strong and solid because of its elegant columns and the magnificent sweep of its arches , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like our characters , are always under inspection . Every time we go into society we must step on the scales of each person 's opinion , and the loss or gain from our last weight is carefully noted . Each mentally asks , " Is this person going up or down ? Through how many grades has he passed ? " For example , young Brown enters a drawing-room . All present weigh him in their judgment and silently say , " This young man is gaining ; he is more careful , thoughtful , polite , considerate , straightforward , industrious . " Besides him stands young Jones . It is evident that he is losing ground rapidly . He is careless , indifferent , rough , does not look you in the eye , is mean , stingy , snaps at the servants , yet is over-polite to strangers . // And so we go through life , tagged with these invisible labels by all who know us . I sometimes think it would be a great advantage if one could read these ratings of his associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other self , who ever stands in the shadow of ourselves holding the scales of justice , that telltale in the soul , rushes to the eye or into the manner and betrays us . But manners , while they are the garb of the gentleman , do not constitute or finally determine his character . Mere politeness can never be a substitute for moral excellence , any more than the bark can take the place of the heart of the oak . It may well indicate the kind of wood below , but not always whether it be sound or decayed . Etiquette is but a substitute for good manners and is often but their mere counterfeit . Sincerity is the highest quality of good manners . The following recipe is recommended to those who wish to acquire genuine good manners : Of Unselfishness , three drachms ; Of the tincture of Good Cheer , one ounce ; Of Essence of Heart's-Ease , three drachms ; Of the Extract of the Rose of Sharon , four ounces ; Of the Oil of Charity , three drachms , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one ounce ; Of the Spirit of Love , two ounces . The Mixture to be taken whenever there is the slightest symptom of selfishness , exclusiveness , meanness , or **25;0;TOOLONG . Pattern after Him who gave the Golden Rule , and who was the first true gentleman that ever breathed . CHAPTER XIX SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND TIMIDITY FOES TO SUCCESS TIMID , shy people are morbidly self-conscious ; they think too much about themselves . Their thoughts are always turned inward ; they are always analyzing , dissecting themselves , wondering how they appear and what people think of them . If these people could only forget themselves and think of others , they would be surprised to see what freedom , ease , and grace they would gain ; what success in life they would achieve . Timidity , shyness , and self-consciousness belong to the same family . We usually find all where we find any one of these qualities , and they are all enemies of peace of mind , happiness , and achievement . No one has ever done a great thing while his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find ourselves . Self analysis is valuable only to learn our strength ; fatal , if we dwell upon our weaknesses . Thousands of young people are held back from undertaking what they long to do , and are kept from trying to make real their great life-dreams , because they are afraid to jostle with the world . They shrink from exposing their sore spots and sensitive points , which smart from the lightest touch . Their supersensitiveness makes cowards of them . Over-sensitiveness , whether in man or woman , is really an exaggerated form of self-consciousness . It is far removed from conceit or self-esteem , yet it causes one 's personality to overshadow everything else . A sensitive person feels that , whatever he does , 246 // wherever he goes , or whatever he says , he is the center of observation . He imagines that people are criticizing his movements , making fun at his expense , or analyzing his character , when they are probably not thinking of him at all . He does not realize that other people are too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote to him any of their time beyond what is absolutely necessary . When he thinks they are aiming remarks at him , putting slights upon him , or trying to hold him up to the ridicule of others , they may not be even conscious of his presence . Morbid sensitiveness requires heroic treatment . A sufferer who wishes to overcome it must take himself in hand as determinedly as he would if he wished to get control of a quick temper , or to rid himself of a habit of lying , or stealing , or drinking , or any other defect which prevented his being a whole man . " What shall I do to get rid of it ? " asks a victim . Think less of yourself and more of others . Mingle freely with people . Become interested in things outside of yourself . Do not brood over what is said to you , or analyze every simple remark until you magnify it into something of the greatest importance . Do not have such a low and unjust estimate of people as to think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and depreciating and making light of them on every possible occasion . A man who appreciates himself at his true value , and who gives his neighbors credit for being at least as good as he is , can not be a victim of over-sensitiveness . One of the best schools for a sensitive boy is a large business house in which he will be thrown among strangers who will not handle him with gloves . In such an environment he will soon learn that everyone has all he can do to attend to his own business . He will realize that he must be a man and give and take with the others , or get out . He will be ashamed to // play " cry baby " every time he feels hurt , but will make up his mind to grin and bear it . Working in competition with other people , and seeing that exactly the same treatment is given to those above him as to himself , takes the nonsense out of him . He begins to see that the world is too busy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people look at him , they are not usually thinking of him . A college course is of inestimable value to a boy or girl of over-refined sensibilities . Oftentimes , when boys enter college as freshmen , they are so touchy that their sense of honor is constantly being hurt and their pride stung by the unconscious thrusts of classmates and companions . But after they have been in college a term , and have been knocked about and handled in a rough but good-humored manner by youths of their own age , they realize that it would , be the most foolish thing in the world to betray resentment . If one shows that he is hurt , he knows that he will be called the class booby , and teased unmercifully , so he is simply forced to drop his foolish sensitiveness . Thousands of people are out of positions , and can not keep places when they get them , because of this weakness . Many a good business man has been kept back , or even ruined , by his quickness to take offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clergyman , well educated and able , who is so sensitive that he can not keep a pastorate long . From his distorted viewpoint some brother or sister in the church is always hurting him , saying and thinking unkind things , or throwing out hints and suggestions calculated to injure him in the eyes of the congregation . Many schoolteachers are great sufferers from oversensitiveness . Remarks of parents , or school committees , or little bits of gossip which are reported to them make them feel as if people were sticking pins in them , metaphorically speaking , all the time . // Writers , authors , and other people with artistic temperaments , are usually very sensitive . I have in mind a very strong , vigorous editorial writer who is so prone to take offense that he can not hold a position either on a magazine or a daily paper . He is cut to the very quick by the slightest criticism , and regards every suggestion for the improvement of his work as a personal affront . He always carries about an injured air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly detracts from an otherwise agreeable personality . The great majority of people , no matter how rough in manner or bearing , are kind-hearted , and would much rather help than hinder a fellowbeing , but they have all they can do to attend to their own affairs , and have no time to spend in minutely analyzing the nature and feeling of those whom they meet in the course of their daily business . In the busy world of affairs , it is give and take , touch and go , and those who expect to get on must rid themselves of all morbid sensitiveness . If they do not , they doom themselves to unhappiness and failure . Self-consciousness is a foe to greatness in every line of endeavor . No one ever does a really great thing until he feels that he is a part of something greater than himself , until he surrenders to that greater principle . Some of our best writers never found themselves , never touched their power , until they forgot their rules for construction , their grammar , their rhetorical arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their style . It is when a writer is so completely carried away with his subject that he can not help writing , that he writes naturally . He shows what his real style is . No orator has ever electrified an audience while he was thinking of his style or was conscious of his // rhetoric , or trying to apply the conventional rules of oratory . It is when the orator 's soul is on fire with his theme , and he forgets his audience , forgets everything but his subject , that he really does a great thing . No painter ever did a great masterpiece when trying to keep all the rules of his profession , the laws of drawing , of perspective , the science of color , in his mind . Everything must be swallowed up in his zeal , fused in the fire of his genius , ? then , and then only , can he really create . No singer ever captivated her audience until she forgot herself , until she was lost in her song . Could anything be more foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one 's advancement in life ? I know a young lady with a superb mind and a fine personality , capable of filling a superior position , who has been kept in a very ordinary situation for years simply because of her morbid sensitiveness . She takes it for granted that if any criticism is made in the department where she works , it is intended for her , and she " flies off the handle " over every little remark that she can possibly twist into a reflection upon herself . The result is that she makes it so unpleasant for her employers that they do not promote her . And she can not understand why she does not get on faster . No one wishes to employ anyone who is so sensitive that he is obliged to he on his guard every moment lest he wound him or touch a sore spot . It makes an employer very uncomfortable to feel that those about him are carrying around an injured air a large part of the time , so that he never quite knows whether they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong in his business and he feels vexed , he knows that he is liable to give offense to these people without ever intending it . // A man wants to feel that his employees understand him , and that they take into consideration the thousand and one little vexations and happenings which are extremely trying , and that if he does not happen to approach them with a smiling face , with consideration and friendliness in his words or commands , they will not take offense . They will think of his troubles , not their own , if they are wise : they will forget self , and contribute their zeal to the greater good .

" Tact clinches the bargain , Sails out of the bay , Gets the vote in the Senate , Spite of Webster or Clay . " " I NEVER will surrender to a nigger , " said a Confederate officer , when a colored soldier chased and caught him .

" I do not know how it is , " said Napoleon in surprise to his cook , " but at whatever hour I call for my breakfast my chicken is always ready and always in good condition . " This seemed to him the more strange because sometimes he would breakfast at eight and at other times as late as eleven . " Sire , " said the cook , " the reason is , that every quarter of an hour I put a fresh chicken down to roast , so that your Majesty is sure always to have it at perfection . " Talent in this age is no match for tact . We see its failure everywhere . Tact will manipulate one talent so as to get more out of it in a lifetime than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till noon ; tact is up at six . " Talent is power , tact is skill . Talent knows what to do , tact knows how to do it . " Talent is something , but tact is everything . It is not a sixth sense , but it is like the life of all the five . It is the open eye , the quick ear , the judging taste , the keen smell , and lively touch ; it is the interpreter of all riddles , the surmounter of all difficulties , the remover of all obstacles . " The world is full of theoretical , one-sided , impractical men , who have turned all the energies of their lives into one faculty until they have developed , not a full-orbed , symmetrical man , but a monstrosity , while all their other faculties have atrophied and died . We often call these one-sided men geniuses , and the world excuses their impractical and almost idiotic conduct in most matters , because they can perform one kind // of work that no one else can do as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in merchandise , though he may be an imbecile in the drawing-room . Adam Smith could teach the world economy in his " Wealth of Nations , " but he could not manage the finances of his own household . Many great men are very impractical even in the ordinary affairs of life . Isaac Newton could read the secret of creation ; but , tired of rising from his chair to open the door for a cat and her kitten , he had two holes cut through the panels for them to pass at will , a large hole for the cat , and a small one for the kitten . Beethoven was a great musician , but he sent three hundred florins to pay for six shirts and half a dozen handkerchiefs . He paid his tailor as large a sum in advance , and yet lie was so poor at times that he had only a biscuit and a glass of water for dinner . He did not know enough of business to cut the coupon from a bond when he wanted money , but sold the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his more practical classmate Stafford became rich . One of Napoleon 's marshals understood military tactics as well as his chief , but he did not know men so well , and lacked the other 's skill and tact . Napoleon might fall ; but , like a cat , he would fall upon his feet . For his argument in the Florida Case , a fee of one thousand dollars in crisp new bills of large denomination was handed to Daniel Webster as he sat reading in his library . The next day he wished to use some of the money , but could not find any of the bills . Years afterward , as he turned the page of a book , he found a bank-bill without a crease in it . On turning the next leaf he found another , and so on until he took the whole amount lost from the places where he had deposited them thoughtlessly , as he read . Learning of a new issue of gold pieces at the Treasury , he // directed his secretary , Charles Lanman , to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he put his hand in his pocket for one , but they were all gone . Webster was at first puzzled , but on reflection remembered that he had given them away , one by one , to friends who seemed to appreciate their beauty . A professor in mathematics in a New England college , a " book-worm , " was asked by his wife to bring home some coffee . " How much will you have ? " asked the merchant . " Well , I declare , my wife did not say , but I guess a bushel will do . " Many a great man has been so absent-minded at times as to seem devoid of common-sense . " The professor is not at home , " said his servant who looked out of a window in the dark and failed to recognize Lessing when the latter knocked at his own door in a fit of absent-mindedness . " Oh , very well , " replied Lessing . " No matter , I 'll call at another time . " Louis Philippe said he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could black his own boots . The world is full of men and women apparently splendidly endowed and highly educated , yet who can scarcely get a living . Not long ago three college graduates were found working on a sheep farm in Australia , one from Oaford , one from Cambridge , and the other from a German University , ? college men tending brutes ! Trained to lead men , they drove sheep . The owner of the farm was an ignorant , coarse sheep-raiser . He knew nothing of books or theories , but he knew sheep . His is three hired graduates could speak foreign languages and discuss theories of political economy and philosophy , but he could make money . He could talk about nothing but sheep and farm ; but he had made a fortune , while the college men could scarcely get a living . Even the University could not supply common // sense . It was " culture against ignorance ; the college against the ranch ; and the ranch beat every time . " Do not expect too much from books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that there is a practical wisdom without them , won by observation . " The use of books must be found outside their own lids . It was said of a great French scholar : " He was drowned in his talents . " Over-culture , without practical experience , weakens a man , and unfits him for real life . Book education alone tends to make a man too critical , too self-conscious , timid , distrustful of his abilities , too fine for the mechanical drudgery of practical life , too highly polished , and too finely cultured for every day use . The culture of books and colleges refines , yet it is often but an ethical culture , and is gained at the cost of vigor and rugged strength . Book culture alone tends to paralyze the practical faculties . The bookworm loses his individuality ; his head is filled with theories and saturated with other men 's thoughts . The stamina of the vigorous mind he brought from the farm has evaporated in college ; and when he graduates , he is astonished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and things , and is therefore outstripped in the race of life by the boy who has had no chance , but who , in the fierce struggle for existence , has developed hard common sense and practical wisdom . The college graduate often mistakes his crutches for strength . He inhabits an ideal realm where common sense rarely dwells . The world cares little for his theories or his encyclopedic knowledge . The cry of the age is for practical men . " We have been among you several weeks , " said Columbus to the Indian chiefs ; " and , although at first you treated us like friends , you are now jealous of us and are trying to drive us away . You brought us food in plenty every morning , but now you bring very // little and the amount is less with each succeeding day . The Great Spirit is angry with you for not doing as you agreed in bringing us provisions . To show his anger he will cause the sun to be in darkness . " He knew that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day and hour it would occur , but the Indians did not believe him , and continued to reduce the supply of food . On the appointed day the sun rose without a cloud , and the Indians shook their heads , beginning to show signs of open hostility as the hours passed without a shadow on the face of the sun . But at length a dark spot was seen on one margin ; and , as it became larger , the natives grew frantic and fell prostrate before Columbus to entreat for help . He retired to his tent , promising to save them , if possible . About the time for the eclipse to pass away , he came out and said that the Great Spirit had pardoned them , and would soon drive away the monster from the sun if they would never offend him again . They readily promised , and when the sun had passed out of the shadow they leaped and danced and sang for joy . Thereafter the Spaniards had all the provisions they needed . " Common sense , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of it . " When Caesar stumbled in landing on the beach of Britain , he instantly grasped a handful of sand and held it aloft as a signal of triumph , hiding forever from his followers the ill omen of his threatened fall . Goethe , speaking of some comparisons that had been instituted between himself and Shakespeare , said : " Shakespeare always hits the right nail on the head at once ; but I have to stop and think which is the right nail , before I hit . " It has been said that a few pebbles from a brook in the sling of a David who knows how to send them to // the mark are more effective than a Goliath 's spear and a Goliath 's strength with a Goliath 's clumsiness . " Get ready for the redskins ! " shouted an excited man as he galloped up to the log-cabin of the Moore family in Ohio many years ago ; " and give me a fresh horse as soon as you can . They killed a family clown the river last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " What shall we do ? " asked Mrs. Moore , with a pale face . " My husband went away yesterday to buy our winter supplies , and will not be back until morning . " " Husband away ? Whew ! that 's bad ! Well , shut tip as tight as you can . Cover up your fire , and do n't strike a light to-night . " Then springing upon the horse the boys had brought , he galloped away to warn other settlers . Mrs. Moore carried the younger children to the loft of the cabin , and left Obed and Joe to watch , reluctantly yielding the post of danger to them at their urgent request . " They 're coming , Joe ! " whispered Obed early in the evening , as he saw several shadows moving across the fields . " Stand by that window with the axe , while I get the rifle pointed at this one . " Opening the bullet-pouch , he took out a ball , but nearly fainted as he found it was too large for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obed felt around to see if there were any smaller balls in the cupboard , and almost stumbled over a very large pumpkin , one of the two which he and Joe had been using to make Jack-o ' - lanterns when the messenger alarmed them .

" They 'll sound the war-whoop in a minute , if I give them time , " he whispered , as he raised the covered lantern to the // window . " Now for it ! " he added , pulling the coat away . An unearthly yell greeted the appearance of the grinning monster , and the Indians fled wildly to the woods . " Quick , Joe ! Light up the other one ! Do n't you see that 's what scar't ' em so ?

Thurlow Weed earned his first quarter by carrying a trunk on his back from a sloop in New York harbor to a Broad Street hotel . He had very few chances such as are now open to the humblest boy , but he had tact and intuition . He could read men as an open book , and mold them to his will . He was unselfish . By three presidents whom his tact and shrewdness had helped to elect he was offered the English mission and scores of other important positions , but he invariably declined . Lincoln selected Weed to attempt the reconciliation of the " New York Herald , " which had a large circulation in Europe , and was creating a dangerous public sentiment abroad and at home by its articles in sympathy with the Confederacy .

England was working night and day prering for war when Weed arrived upon the scene , 26o PUSHING TO THE FRONT and soon changed largely the current of public sentiment . On his return to America the city of New York extended public thanks to him for his inestimable services . He was equally successful in business , and acquired a fortune of a million dollars .

He paced the distance to the point last noted , and said : " This is the approximate width of the stream . " He was promoted .
