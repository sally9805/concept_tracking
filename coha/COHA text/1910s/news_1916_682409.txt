txt Wages are being advanced generally in the shipping and steel trades , but for different reasons . The similarity oflaetion by the Steel Corporation and the independents reproduces locally the situation at Youngstown. where the raising of wages was followed by indictments . Nothing like that is expected here , because the Youngstown indictments were dismissed as preposterous . But there is a sequel in every State to the " conbthe meaning Of ' figures so large ? facilitate this process ; presumably , the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce is not content with announcing in its annual report that its members compute from the orders in hand a sale this year of 1,250,000 cars .

The Federation of Labor was outraged by the discovery that in various States labor is regarded as a commodity , regardless of the Federal statute to the contrary enacted by the requirement of the federation . All that was accom- I pushed at Washington is threatened by the action of the Youngstown District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a precedent contrary to the principles af the federation . Accordingly Mr. GOSIPErtS is promoting in every State the enactment of a law like the Clayton law . He is forwarding to the central unions generally a draft of a statute forbidding the treatment of labor as a . Commodity . That is to say , since labor is not a commodity courts can not take cognizance of crimes by labor about labor , courts can not issue injunctions for the protection of employers and of their property , picketing and boycotting are to be legalized , and labor is to have Its will generally . A better way to antag ? - onize public opinion hardly could be devised . That is the conspiracy of labor , which exempts itself front the anti-trust laws if such law 's are passed and enforced . The conspiracy of employers is exemplified by the action in the steel trade in raising wages 10 per cent . in order to give the workers a share of the prosperity of the employers , according to their announcement . There are worse reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . may seem all right to those accepting it . and , in fact , may be more generous than employers can give permanently . It Is easy to recall concerns which levied an assessment upon shareholders and passed dividends in order to keep their concerns going in the hard times a few years ago . The steel trade conspirators themselves went without their dividends for that purpose . and there were other cases in the electrical industries . Mr. Bnowx. the local Secretary of the seamen , says : " We ? are asking " wages that will meet the eompeti- ? " tion of other trades . " That is candor itself and may he a better reason for allowing the demand than any excess of profits . The " prevailing rate of wages " is not something to argue about . Labor stands for the right " day and the right " wage and resents a bonus as a bribe , an inducement that the strong shall betray the weak by setting too high a standard of accomplishment . The seamen and the subway workers were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher wage because they can get it in other trades , and without them the employers can not keep their work going . The contrast between the two conspiracies , and the two sets of reasons for raising wages , are signs of the times .
