txt // Range of fusion determined by practical considerations . Again , as in the treatment of the fusion which leads to space perception , we must appeal to the central coordinations which are worked out under the stress of practical demands . One fuses sensory factors into the percept of a thing because he can adjust himself to certain aspects of experience in a single act . Thus , one speaks of a bookcase and its contents as a single object when he merely wishes to name over the articles of furniture in his room . He distinguishes the separate books as objects when he wishes to take them out and use them . The range of one 's experience of a thing is thus seen to depend not on sensory processes but on the practical motives which lead to the synthesis of more or less comprehensive groups of these sensations into single phases of experience . Changes in percepts through repetition . The fusion of factors into single groups becomes easier after repetition . Thus the expert rifleman comes to recognize at once the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wind which will influence his shot , factors which might have coexisted indefinitely without being fused . All this he has acquired as the result of repeated efforts to shape his conduct in accordance with the demands of his total environment . Indeed , such a case of acquired fusion of widely divergent sensory factors may very frequently involve in its earliest stages conscious effort to adapt action to whole groups of sensations . The unity is made more and more compact as repeated efforts are undertaken to recognize the factors together , so that ultimately the perceptual unity , which began in a conscious relating of factors , becomes a synthetic unity of the ordinary type ; thus , we learn to see pen and hand and paper together when we learn to write , until all the factors which enter into the act of writing and its conscious control are unified , and the final consciousness seems very simple , although it is a complex of many factors . COMBINATIONS OF SENSATIONS i9i Parallel development of perception and habit . Discussions of perceptual fusion might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that the development of organized perception and the development of organized activity always go hand in hand . The training of eye and hand in any technical art , of ear and vocal cords in singing or speaking , of ear and hand in playing a musical instrument , go together in practical experience . The expert in every line not only acts more skillfully but he sees or hears more skillfully and comprehensively . Perception is discriminative and complete just in so far as the factors of experience are organized into wholes appropriate for individual reaction . Our present purposes , however , can be fully satisfied without a complete study of habits . The perceptual fusion involved in the recognition of an object is one phase of organization ; habit is an expression of this organization and will be taken up in a separate , later chapter . Time as a general form of experience . Before leaving the subject of perception it is important that we consider briefly a form of arrangement which has often been regarded as similar in character to the space form ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relation between several factors of experience . Like space , it is not a sensation quality . It is even more general in character than space , for it is not merely a form of perception ; it is also , and indeed chiefly , a form of the indirect , or memory , experiences . A percept is always in the time series , but it is always in that portion of the time series which we call " the present . " It will , accordingly , be appropriate for us to discuss in this connection some of the attributes of " the present , " leaving the other phases of time consciousness to be taken up in connection with memory . Experimental determination Of the scope of " the present . " " The present " is not a single point of experience ; it is a group of experiences . Some experimental // evidence as to the possible length of " the present " may be gained as follows : Tap rapidly on the table at intervals of half a second or less , producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind can be grouped into a single easily apprehended unity . The observer will have little difficulty in determining the limit of such a series if he will simply listen to the taps and refrain from counting . A short series of five or six taps will leave behind in consciousness a feeling of perfect definiteness and ease of apprehension . If such a series is exactly repeated , or if a second slightly different series is sounded , the observer will be in no doubt as to the likeness or unlikeness of the two series . If , on the other hand , a series of twenty or thirty taps is sounded , the observer will recognize that at a certain point in the series a state of confusion sets in . The series is no longer apprehended as a unity , but has a vaguely defined massiveness which seems to elude the mental grasp . Scope of " the present " and its varying conditions . The ability of the observer to group together a series of experiences is radically modified when the series itself is changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , or if it is given a slightly different quality , as in a series of musical notes , the scope of the immediately recognized group will be much increased . If the taps come irregularly , either in point of interval or in point of intensity or quality , the scope of the unitary group will be decreased . Time relations in verse and related systems of experience . All these facts appear in such practical forms of time perception as those which are utilized in making up English verse . The recognition of the successive feet in poetry is facilitated by grouping the sounds into simple compact groups . The character of each group is determined by variations in intensity , quality , and content in such a large number of ways as to satisfy the demand for novelty // in experience , while at the same time retaining very fully the characteristics necessary for temporal uniformity in the successive groups of factors . Time arrangement as conditioned by the rhythmical changes in nervous processes . To find a precise physiological basis for the time grouping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more general than those which constitute the physiological basis for space perception and for general perceptual unity as exhibited in the recognition of objects . Indeed , we must go far enough , as indicated above , to recognize that the conditions of temporal discrimination are involved in indirect memory processes even more than in perception . Such a general characteristic is to be found in the fact that all nervous processes are constantly fluctuating in intensity because the inner nervous condition is never in equilibrium . The nervous condition is a living process , now rising to a higher intensity , now declining to a low intensity . This can be seen if an observer will pick out in the constellation Pleiades a faint star which is just visible , and watch it for a time . He will find that it disappears and then reappears for an interval , only to disappear again . The rhythmical change is here so complete that it is perceived as a change in the object . A like fluctuation of intensity is present in all sensory impressions , even if the sensation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to disappear entirely . Perception more than the flux of sensations . In addition to the fluctuations in experience which result from the conditions in the nervous system , there are changes which arise from the relation of the observer to the object . For example , as one makes his way down the street he sees some object for a moment and then loses sight of it until he comes once more to a point from which he can observe it . In all this flux of experience action must be based on a recognition // of the permanency of objects which transcends present sensations . We project our fluctuating sensations into a series which provides for time changes which are not changes in the things themselves . Thus we find new evidence that experience is organized out of sensations but goes far beyond sensory qualities and intensities in the attributes which it exhibits . Time is not a sensation ; it is a form in which sensations are held because the mind recognizes in objects a permanency which extends beyond present personal experience . SUMMARY Discussions of perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief summary . Perception involves , first , a spatial order ; second , the compact fusion of sensations into percepts of separate objects in the world ; and third , the beginning of a temporal order . The spatial arrangement is intimately connected with movement , being the arrangement given to sensory factors under the mechanical demands for characteristically different reactions to different sensory factors in the total mass of experience . Fusion of sensations into separate recognitions of objects is , like spatial arrangement , related to activity , for all those phases of sensory experience will be fused together which require one and the same response . Finally , time recognition depends on the flux in experience which comes to be recognized as a flux not interfering with the permanency of objects . CHAPTER IX HABITS Organic retentiveness . Up to this point only casual reference has been made to the fact that the nervous system is constantly undergoing structural changes as a result of use . When an impulse passes from cell to cell , it leaves behind a path which makes it easier for some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . In this way it is also made . easier for later impulses to be brought together . Very soon the effects of past experience become so complicated that it is impossible to picture them in detail . Thus , when one learns the name of an object , there must be traced through the nervous system a series of paths which make it possible in all later experience for the percept of that object to arouse the tendency to articulate the name . Or , to take another type of example , when one has thought of Europe and Asia as parts of a great continental mass , it becomes easier in all future experience to couple these two ideas in thought . The facts referred to in the last paragraph are grouped together under such general terms as " organic memory " or " retentiveness . " It is one of the most important facts about the nervous system that it is highly retentive . As a result of this retentiveness , present action of any part of the nervous system is explicable only in small measure by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received into a network of paths which carry the impulse here and there in accordance with past experiences through traces left behind by such experiences . iC5 // Remoter conditions of retention . Considered in a large way , all structures of the nervous system are the results of past development . The coordinations which the child inherits result from racial experiences , and no individual can face the world without reflecting in all of his instinctive attitudes the fundamental experiences of his ancestors . Ordinarily we do not think of these remoter effects of experience . We use the terms " memory " and " retention " to refer to those phases of personal experience which we consciously connect with our own past contact with things and people . When the ordinary man uses the term " memory , " he thinks of a reinstatement as nearly as possible of some situation experienced at an earlier date . One remembers what he saw and did yesterday . For the psychologist this is only one case of retention and revival . From the doings of yesterday there come over into to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is skill of hand which is the product of a slow and systematic learning process ; there is accuracy of spatial reference which makes it possible for the individual to put his hand with precision on the object before him or at the right or left . There are modes of attention ; there are attitudes of fear and anger , all of which come out of the past development of the individual but are ordinarily not recognized as due to nervous retention . Before taking up the cases of memory which are usually recognized as coming under that name , it will be well to study those less noticed forms of organization which bring the past into the present and affect the present without being recognized through introspection . Instincts . The simplest cases of this type are the instincts . As was pointed out in an earlier chapter , every individual is born with certain main outlines of his nervous structure provided through inheritance , exactly as the other structures of his body are provided through inheritance . If an individual ? // has arms and legs , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these extremities with the spinal cord . The structure of the sense organs is also provided through inheritance , and , as has been made clear in earlier discussions , there is little or no change in the character of these organs in the course of individual experience . Inheritance , however , goes even further than to provide these main structures . The central organs themselves are , to some extent , mapped out at the beginning of individual life . The result of this central organization is that at the time of birth the muscles of the body are not merely under the general control of the nervous system , they are under the control of organized centers which are able , to a certain extent , to coordinate the activities of different parts of the body . Protective instincts . Illustrations of instincts occur in the life of any animal and in the early life of human infants . For example , if a young bird hears a loud sound , this sound not only discharges itself through the nervous system , but because of the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the muscles of the whole body in that form of behavior commonly described as feigning death . The individual bird does not recognize the significance or value of its behavior , at least the first time it executes it . The act can therefore not be explained as due in any way to individual intelligence . Furthermore , the same form of action appears in all members of the species . The organization which controls the activity has been worked out in the course of the experience of the bird 's ancestors as a form of protective movement to be put into operation whenever the animal is threatened by an approaching enemy . To say that the young bird which performs this movement is cognizant of danger and assumes an appropriate attitude would be to invert the true relations exhibited in the situation . The mode of behavior is immediate and depends directly upon the external stimulation plus the inherited 19S PSYCHOLOGY organization . The attitude of fear results from the action which takes place without the animal 's control or choice . The inner experience of fear is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sound through the ear or the ability to respond to the sound with the muscles of the body . Food-taking instinct . Other typical illustrations of organized instinctive modes of behavior may be drawn from a study of the human infant . One of the most fundamental instincts of the infant is the instinct of sucking . Any young mammal responds to a small object placed between its lips by a complex form of reaction which nature has provided as the only possible means of supporting the animal 's life during a period when individual experience is not sufficiently mature to guide it in securing its own food . The form of consciousness which accompanies this instinctive behavior is , of course , a matter of speculation , but it seems highly probable that the experience of the infant is one of emotional excitement and of satisfaction when the act finds some appropriate object on which to express itself . ? Instincts established through selection . The process by which the instincts have been evolved is most elaborate . In the later stages of animal evolution those members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protection and food-taking perish . It is easy to see how the instincts are perpetuated through natural selection . In somewhat the same fashion we can imagine how , through a long regressive series , those nervous systems were gradually selected which provided the forms of reaction most favorable to the preservation of life . Delayed instincts common . In treating of human instincts the matter is somewhat complicated by the fact that a great many instincts are present only in incipient forms at the beginning of life and are fully matured at a relatively late period . A good illustration of such a delayed instinct is // found in the tendency of the young child to walk . That this tendency is inherited is shown by the fact that it will mature , even if there is little or no individual practice . The common development of the young child is a mixture of maturing instincts and ambitious efforts on the part of the child himself and of those surrounding him to hasten the development which would naturally come , even if no exertions were made in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who for one reason or another had never made any individual effort to mature this mode of activity suddenly exhibited it under suitable conditions in a fully developed form . Young animals have frequently been experimented upon in a way to show that their modes of locomotion are wholly instinctive , even though locomotion develops only at a relatively late period in life . Thus young birds which have been incubated in isolation and have been caged until they reached full maturity will fly with the natural mode of flight of their species as soon as they are liberated . Impossibility of distinguishing instincts from later-acquired forms of behavior . As there are instinctive modes of behavior which develop somewhat slowly during the early years of life , it is impossible to draw a line and say that every form of activity which matures after a certain period is independent of direct hereditary organizations . It is equally impossible to say , on the other hand , that the inherited tracts in the nervous system are in no wise modified in the course of individual experience . Indeed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is built up a system of refinements and modifications which constitute the characteristic mark of the individual . Habits from instincts and from independent conditions . Instincts are sometimes simplified in the course of use ; at other times they are united into larger systems of action or are broken up into their elements and recombined into new // types of composite activity . We turn , then , to the consideration of these processes of activity which are related to instincts merely as outgrowths and may therefore be treated as the products of individual experience . Those modes of behavior which depend upon individual experience are called habits . In order to make clear the relation of habit to instinct , it should be pointed out that not all habits grow directly out of single well-defined instincts . For the purposes of our discussion two classes of habits may be distinguished : first , there are habits which develop out of instincts ; second , there are habits which develop by a process of selection from among the diffuse activities which appear whenever there is no definite mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may refer to these two types of habits as habits developed from instincts and habits developed from diffusion . Development of habit through conflict of instincts . An illustration of a habit developed from instincts is found in the case in which a child develops a certain definite attitude toward certain animals . This attitude of the child can in many cases be shown to have originated out of a conflict between two tendencies . There are two fundamental instinctive tendencies in every child , indeed in every young animal . Every young animal tends , on the one hand , to run away from any strange or unusually intense stimulation . A large object moving toward the eyes , a loud sound attacking the auditory organs , or a strange odor or taste will stir up in a young animal a mode of action of the protective type . There is , on the other hand , among all of the higher animals an instinct toward contact with members of the same species and with related forms of animal life . Thus , young birds naturally tend to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects which are in any way similar to members of their own species . So also do young mammals . Young puppies and young kittens are extremely fond of // companionship , and even certain of the more solitary animals naturally herd in packs or in small groups , especially when young . The human infant exhibits both of the two fundamental instinctive tendencies which have just been described . When , accordingly , the child is for the first time confronted by an animal , its reaction may be one of withdrawal or one of friendly contact . Which of the two natural tendencies is actually selected will depend upon a variety of circumstances . If the instinct of flight or protective activity is strong , either because the individual child is disposed to react in this way more emphatically than in the direction of social contact or if the instinct of protection is rendered especially pronounced by some accident of excessive external stimulation at the particular moment , then the instinct of fear will dominate and the social instinct will be suppressed . In such a case the specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . Sometimes the attitude is so thoroughly determined by the first contact with the animal that all through life the individual tends to follow the initial impulse received at the first experience . There are persons who have a very strong attitude of fear for cats and dogs , which attitude has become a fixed individual habit after being selected from among the various possible instinctive modes of response which existed through inheritance at the beginning of life . Nervous development concerned in the selection of instincts . The nervous mechanism involved in a habit which has resulted from selection among instincts is relatively easy to explain . We need only to assume that the stimulation which is given at the first experience has two possible lines of discharge , either one of which would be through a welldefined instinctive tract . The conditions of the first encounter carry the stimulation in question into one of the two instinctive channels , and thereafter this selected channel becomes the natural and easy path of discharge for the // stimulus whenever it recurs . The habit is , accordingly , dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines which of the possible instincts shall be selected . Habit as a modified instinct . A second somewhat different type of derivation of habit from instinct is found in cases in which the final mode of activity is not along the line of any single instinct , but is a compromise in which one instinct is modified by conflict with other instinctive tendencies . Suppose , for example , that the human infant who naturally tends to be afraid of an animal is encouraged by circumstances to assume a friendly attitude toward the animal of which he is naturally afraid . His attitude and mode of reaction may be modified to a greater or less extent , so that instead of expressing the full tendency of his instinct to run away , he may have merely a suppressed internal recoil from the animal , while all of his grosser protective movements are modified . Many of the human instincts are probably thus somewhat reduced in intensity and in their form of expression . Darwin argued at length that the expressions of human and animal emotions are in many cases simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions in human beings are , according to his view , remains of early forms of activity in the jaw and mouth muscles , which once accompanied real combat . The changes in circulation and respiration which come with fear and embarrassment are to be regarded as partial expressions of certain fundamental instincts . For example , when we are frightened there is for an instant a pause in all the internal activities preparatory to the violent activities necessary to flight , and after this first pause there comes a rapid beating of the heart which originally accompanied flight . When in mature life one refuses to indulge in flight , he may , nevertheless , have all the internal activities . If , however , he persists in refusing to run , the inherited tendency may , // through this fact , be gradually overcome even to the point of disappearance . Importance of heredity in explaining consciousness . Such examples as these tend to emphasize heredity . The individual is seen to begin life with a large stock of possible habits and instinctive attitudes . His final attitudes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , but a great number of the fundamental possibilities in human nature are given at the beginning of life . We may say , therefore , that an individual is born with a large stock of attitudes quite as much as with a large supply of organs of sense and forms of possible sensory experience . The inherited attitudes are not specific in their application until after individual experience has worked out the application , but they are native and explicable only in terms that recognize their fundamentally hereditary character . Diffusion a mark of lack of organization . Turning now from the habits which are developed through the selection and modification of instincts , we come to the habits which can not properly be traced to any single instinct or group of instincts . Let us suppose that a stimulus or a combination of stimulations is introduced into the nervous system of the child but finds no specific channel of discharge open to it through inherited organization . This stimulation will produce an excitation which will be very widely distributed throughout the whole nervous system , because it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , it must be transmitted through the nervous system until it finds a discharge into the active organs . The stimulation will ultimately issue through the avenues of motor discharge into the active organs of the body , but instead of issuing in a well-coordinated series it will be distributed diffusely and irregularly and will affect a great number of muscles . An example of the diffuse distribution of stimulation in mature life is seen when one is suddenly startled by // an unexpected loud noise , and there follows a general contraction of the muscles throughout the whole body . Such a strong stimulus breaks over all of the bounds of organization in the central nervous system and is distributed diffusely throughout the body . A diffuse distribution of the stimulation is clearly a disadvantage to the individual . The state of the organism after the stimulation is such that the individual is not well adapted to his environment , his activities are not concentrated in any single direction , and he is altogether unprepared to meet the future demands which the stimulation may impose upon him . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accompanies such diffuse activity is quite as unorganized as the bodily attitude , and this , also , is an intolerable condition for any individual . The process of modifying such a diffuse reaction , of developing definite and precise attitudes on the mental side and well-coordinated movements on the physical side , is a long , complex process , carried out by the organism and by consciousness with the delays and complications which appear in every process of natural development . Development of habit from diffusion . If we take a form of activity which has little or no instinctive background , such as the activity involved in writing , and observe the early stages of the effort to develop this type of activity into a habit , we discover the characteristics of a diffuse activity . It will be found , first , that movement is excessive in both extent and intensity . The child who is learning to write moves not only the necessary muscles of the fingers and hand directly engaged in writing , but the muscles of the other hand as well . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitation throughout the whole organism is one of the most obvious facts to be observed in such a case . In the second place , the elements of movement which are present are not coordinated into harmonious wholes . The various muscular contractions involved in the // earliest attempts at writing seldom enter into such relations that there is economy in their several activities . This will be apparent if one observes the way in which the fingers and the hand act during the child 's formation of series of letters . There must always be a movement of the hand during writing to carry the fingers across the page . In the child 's writing the fingers are used as long as they can be used without any cooperating hand movement . The hand is brought into play only after the fingers have become so cramped that they can no longer make lines . When this cramping of the fingers reaches such a point that it can go no farther , the finger movement is altogether suspended for a moment and the hand is moved forward in a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , the fingers being used quite to the exclusion of the hand . This obvious lack of combined activity of the hand and fingers illustrates a general fact which is also exhibited by the incoordination of the learner 's several fingers in relation to one another . The thumb and first finger do not at the outset cooperate with each other in the harmonious way in which they should . For example , at the beginning of an upward stroke , as in the written letter 1 , the first finger presses downward against the pencil or pen more vigorously than is necessary and , as a result , the thumb is called upon to do an excess of work in order to overcome the unnecessary downward pressure of the first finger . There is thus a lack of harmony and even a certain degree of interference in the organs which are directly involved in the activity . The explanation of diffusion and incoordination at the beginning of development is similar to the explanation of the general diffusion of the activity throughout the whole muscular system in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses which excite the muscles do not follow definite channels . In the case now under consideration the channels are not yet developed , while in the case of the loud zo6 PSYCHOLOGY sound they are not able to confine the strong discharge to definite paths . Undeveloped movements . Another characteristic of an undeveloped movement is one which is closely related to its incoordination , and consists in the fact that the various phases of movement are all of brief duration , not being united with each other into a continuous series . If one examines the writing of a child , he finds that the lines , instead of being continuous , fluent lines , are made up of short , irregular parts . The direction of the movement in these short , irregular parts is very frequently away from the general direction which the movement should follow . We may say that the movement is a succession of efforts to produce the line rather than a sequence of coordinated muscular contractions appropriate to the general movement . When the movement develops , as it does after practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their sequence can not be detected ; they are no longer separate factors . The adult who begins to write the letter L does not make a series of separate movements as the pencil is carried along the upward stroke . He does , however , make a series of muscular contractions . The transition from the irregular succession of separate movements to a series of contractions constituting phases of a single complex activity , which , however , is thoroughly unified , results from the coupling together of a series of nervous tracts which provide for the proper temporal distribution of the motor excitation . Diffusion analogous to all forms of overproduction . It is clear from the foregoing study of the characteristics of an undeveloped activity that nature approaches this problem of development in the same way in which all the problems of development are approached ; namely , through excessive productions and selection of the proper elements . Since the child does not have the proper nervous organization to control his movements , nature has provided that he shall make a // superabundance of movements involving all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not directly concerned in the final activity . If , in this excess of movement , certain factors accomplish the end toward which the individual is working , these successful constituents of movement will gradually be emphasized and the unsuccessful constituents will gradually be eliminated , until finally diffusion gives way to a limited number of precise and well-defined combinations of activity . If the selected factors are repeated together a sufficient number of times , the nervous activities involved in each particular phase of the movement gradually become connected with each other . Conscious correlates of habit . The conscious accompaniments of action which has grown habitual are easily described . There is a feeling of familiarity when one is trained to respond to sensations ; there is a definiteness of discrimination which makes one 's percepts sure and clear . Too often the psychology of habit has been guilty of the statement that habituation leads to unconsciousness . This is not the case . When we can deal skillfully with any situation , we have an attitude of attention and of assurance wholly different from the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the discerning man ; his discernments may disregard certain factors and emphasize others , but , on the whole , he will give attention to that which is most important in guiding action . Instinct , habit , and mental attitudes . The reader will be able without detailed discussion to see the relation of this chapter to the earlier chapter which deals with mental attitudes . All mental life exhibits natural likes and dislikes , acquired sympathies and antipathies , forms of attention and interest . These are related , as was shown before , to modes of reaction . We now see how these tastes and interests are developed as a part of , the individual 's adjustment of himself to the world . Some tastes are traceable to inherited instincts , // others to acquired habits , and so on through the list . The important fact for psychology is that past experience comes over into the present in the form of fundamental attitudes and tendencies . The introspective observer is likely to make the mistake of thinking that his likes and dislikes are the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from a remote past , even in some cases from his racial inheritances . Applications of the doctrine of attitudes to social science . What is shown by these few examples is of the greatest importance for the social sciences . Social life has developed innumerable habits in the individual . We pass each other on the right ; we accost our friends on the street ; we gather about the table and take our food in an orderly way . In these and a thousand of the customs of social life we record the experience of the past . At the moment we find ourselves in sympathy with our surroundings . Indeed , we should be most uncomfortable if our surroundings did not call for those forms of behavior which are laid down by habit in our nervous systems . Personal habits and social customs have thus come to be two aspects of a single line of development . Here again we are often too much in the midst of the experience itself to see how our social attitudes came into being and what is their real character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly important special habit . Among the habits developed by human beings none is so elaborate as speech ; none is so intimately related to the higher levels to which human experience attains . Speech is evidently a form of muscular behavior , as can be readily observed if one notes the movements in the thorax , larynx , and mouth during articulation . So complex , however , are the mental processes related to the movements involved in speech that we ordinarily overlook entirely the physical side of the process and think of speech only as one of the higher forms of mental activity . Speech and ideas closely interrelated . There would be logical justification for a postponement of the discussion of speech until after the description and classification of ideas and of those thought processes which develop with the evolution of language . Speech would then be treated , as it is in the thinking of most people , as a product or expression of higher intelligence . But speech is more than a product of thought ; it is the instrument which makes thought possible ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction which is essential to the higher attitudes of discrimination and comparison . Just as the processes of perception are not merely receptive but involve reactions , so the higher thought processes are active and depend for their character on those forms of behavior which make up the speech habit . We are justified , therefore , in discussing speech before treating of ideas , even though we shall have frequent occasion in 209 2I0 PSYCHOLOGY this chapter to refer to the higher mental processes before we have described them in detail . Speculations regarding the nature and origin of speech . Speech has from the earliest history been recognized by man as a unique power . It is the distinguishing characteristic between Greek and barbarian , between Hebrew and gentile . In more emphatic degree , it is the mark of distinction between man and his nearest relatives in the animal kingdom . Long before there was a science of human nature , man speculated curiously as to the source from which language came . His first answer was that the Deity gave it to him by a special act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation theory of the origin of language ignores , however , certain facts which are too obvious to be set aside . It ignores the fact that animals have the ability to make certain vocal sounds which they utilize for purposes of communication with one another . We can not explain how it is that animals have modes of expression so closely related to human language without , at the same time , recognizing the natural origin of language itself . Furthermore , the processes of human expression are constantly undergoing changes and developments which are so natural and so definite in their character that it seems probable that language has always been evolving just as it is at the present time . If the principles under which language as we know it is developing can be ascertained , it is reasonable to project these laws back of the historical period and to assume that the beginnings of language were also under the regular laws of development . The creation theory has therefore gradually given way to various theories which attempt to give a naturalistic explanation of language . The imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that language originated from the tendency to imitate sounds . This theory , while it would explain certain of the special forms of words , can not give any adequate // account of the way in which an individual develops the power of turning imitation to the special ends of speech . There are a number of different animals that are capable of a wide range of imitation , but they have never developed a language , as has man . This is clear evidence that the essence of language is not to be found in imitation , but rather in the use to which the imitative power is put . The interjection theory . It has also been suggested that language developed out of the interjections which man naturally used in his most primitive stage of development . If he was astonished by any sudden stimulation , he naturally gave forth ejaculations in response to the sudden excitation . These ejaculations , it is said , came gradually to have the power of calling to mind the situations to which they belonged and ultimately became the means of communication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems improbable that man began with simple forms of expression , but that the theory does not explain how these simple forms of expression acquired a meaning and importance which they did not have at the beginning . What is needed , rather than a formal description of the first expressions used by primitive man , is a consistent psychological explanation of how the ejaculations came to have significance for mental life and to serve as the vehicles for elaborate thought processes . Roots of language in natural emotional expressions and their imitation . The psychological explanation of language begins with a general reference to the statements made in earlier chapters . Every sensory stimulation arouses some form of bodily activity . The muscles of the organs of circulation and the muscles of the limbs , as well as other internal and external muscles , are constantly engaged in making responses to external stimuli . Among the muscles of the body which with the others are involved in expressive activities are the muscles which control the organs of respiration . There can be no stimulation of any kind which // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of inspiration and expiration . In making these general statements , we find no necessity for distinguishing between the animals and man ; so far as the general facts of relation between sensations and expression are concerned , they have like characteristics . That an air-breathing animal should produce sounds through irregularities in its respiratory movements when it is excited by an external stimulus , especially if that stimulus is violent , is quite as natural as that its hair should rise when it is afraid or that its muscles should tremble when it is aroused to anger or to flight . Imitation . The important step in the development of language is the acquirement of the ability to use the movements of the vocal cords for purposes other than those of individual emotional expression . The acquirement of this ability is a matter of long evolution and depends in its first stages upon social imitation . The importance of imitation in affecting the character of animal behavior appears as soon as animals begin to live in packs or herds or other social groups . Other imitative communications of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , there is no reason why attention should be confined exclusively to the forms of activity which result in sounds . All animals imitate the activities of other members of their species on a very large scale . The stampede of a herd of cattle is an excellent illustration of the importance of the tendency toward imitation . The frightened animal which starts the stampede does not consciously purpose to communicate its fright to the other members of the herd ; it is performing a natural act of its individual life . Incidentally , it affects all those about it by arousing in them a violent form of imitative activity . The stampeding herd may have no consciousness whatever of the original cause of fear in one of its members ; the real cause of the stampede and of the resulting excitement in the herd is the example of the one frightened // animal . Thus we see that the activity of an animal takes on , because of the reaction of its social environment , a significance which the original act never could have had unless it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is true of activity in general is true of activities which result in sounds . The sound produced by the activities of the vocal cords can impress itself readily upon the ears of some other animal , more readily by far than the visual impression of trembling or of general muscular tension . If , now , the animal which hears the sound has itself produced this sound or one closely resembling it in quality and intensity , there will be a natural tendency for the sound stimulation to arouse in the second animal a sympathetic response . Witness the tendency of all the dogs in a community to bark together or of all the roosters to begin crowing together when one gives the signal . The result of imitating the sound will be to throw the imitating animal into an emotional state very similar to that of the animal which first made the noise . This result will be more likely to follow if the two animals are closely related in their organization and types of activity . There will be relatively less tendency to sympathize with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity aroused through imitation in the listening animal will not agree in character with the activity of the animal which sets the example . Thus , one can judge from his own experience that there is very little possibility of arousing in a human being the mental state which appears in dogs or cats through imitation of the sounds which they produce . In general , imitation of sound is valuable as a means of arousing sympathy only between animals sufficiently related to each other to have similar modes of producing sound . Limitation of forms of animal communication . Given the similarity of organization which makes imitated sounds significant , we have a type of communication provided which // is widely utilized in the animal world . The food calls and the danger signals of birds are significant to other members of the flock . Such calls have definite natural relations to the organized responses of all members of the species . It is to be noted that these calls do not constitute a language in the sense in which human sounds constitute a language , for the bird calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kind of food or the particular kind of danger discovered by the animal which makes the sound . The sounds serve merely to arouse certain attitudes . An animal can induce in its fellows a tendency to fear and flight by means of cries which in the history of each member of the flock have been associated with fear , but the animal can go no farther in its communications than to arouse emotional attitudes . The first stages of human articulation like animal cries . There are stages of human infancy which are closely related to the stages of animal life thus far described . The human infant does not at first make sounds as the result of any conscious desire to communicate its feelings to those about it , much less does it use its sounds for verbal discussion of the details of its conscious experiences . The infant makes noises exactly as it swings its arms and legs , because the muscular contractions which produce these noises are instinctive motor expressions related through heredity to the stimuli which arouse them . Later there appears a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this imitation may serve to put the infant in some contact with its social environment and give it a medium of communication comparable in character to that which we find in animals . This is not language , however , for imitation alone is not enough to develop language . Further processes must take place before the full development is effected . Articulations selected from the sum of possible activities . While imitation applies to many different forms of activity , such as those of the limbs or face , a moment 's consideration // will make it clear that the activities which produce sounds have a number of unique advantages as vehicles of imitative communication . The ability to produce sounds depends largely upon the animal itself and very little upon external conditions . Contrast sound with visual impressions . Visual impressions are cut off in the dark ; they are cut off by intervening objects and by a turning of the head of the observer . Sounds travel wherever there is air ; they are as easy to produce in the darkness as in daylight ; they can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the chief means of social communication , even among the animals . The result is that the vocal cords and the ability to discriminate sounds are highly developed long before the development of language proper . Evolution of ideas and speech . The advance which human language makes beyond animal communication consists in the fact that human language relates sounds to ideas as well as to emotional attitudes . This step can not be taken until ideas are present in the minds of both parties to the communication . We find ourselves , therefore , at this point involved in a perplexing circle . Human mental processes as we know them are intimately related to language . Even when we think about our own most direct experiences , we use words . Yet these words are not explicable except when we assume complex ideational processes as the necessary conditions for their development and interpretation . Did human mental advance result from the development of language , or did language result from the development of ideas ? The only answer to this question is that language and ideational processes developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stages of the development of true language we may assume , therefore , that both speaker and auditor have reached a stage of development where it is possible to have higher nervous and conscious processes . // Such higher processes are to be contrasted with mere emotional attitudes . For example , if one sees his fellow being pointing in a certain direction , there is a strong tendency to turn and look in the same direction . There will result in this case not an emotion but a common attention to some object . The gesture of pointing is , accordingly , a mode of communication which rises to a higher level than does the cry of fear or the food call . Its development opens the way for a higher system of communication . Gestures and broad scope of attention . Still higher is the gesture that depicts some elaborate act . Thus , when a man is hungry he will point to his mouth and make the gesture of taking up food and carrying it to his mouth . This simple gesture will not be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited range of attention . If the animal thinks of food , it can not entertain any other ideas . It spends all its mental energy seeking food rather than trying to communicate with some other animal . In human life there is breadth of attention exhibited in a gesture . The person who makes a gesture includes in his experience the person with whom he wishes to communicate , plus the idea which is to be communicated . The animal may have a simple idea but not the complex of ideas involved even in gesture . This ability of man to have two centers of attention can be explained anatomically by recalling that man has great masses of cerebral tissue within which impulses can be worked over . The animal has only a little brain tissue , and any impulse received in the brain must be discharged very soon in the form of a motor impulse . The hungry animal must act at once in the effort to remove hunger . Man , on the other hand , has enough brain tissue to hold the impulse in suspense , unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a complex way with full regard both to his fellow beings and to his hunger . // Gesture , or gesture language as it is called , is thus seen to be not merely a complex form of behavior but one which expresses a new type of relationship between the reactor and his environment . Gesture is a social form of behavior involving attention to persons as well as to objects . Indeed , gesture supersedes the more direct forms of attack on objects . Evolution of gestures in direction of simplification . The earliest forms of social communications undoubtedly included much gesture if , indeed , they were not limited altogether to gesture . The term " natural sign " has been used in describing these early gestures . The gesture was so full and pantomimic in character that the interpretation was almost as direct as in the case of an emotional expression . The gesture could be interpreted by anyone who had passed through an experience at all like that of the person making the gesture . All that we need to assume by way of explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earlier paragraphs and the higher power of reviving ideas . The later development of gesture language brought with it a reduction of the gesture so that it became a mere remnant of the earlier act . This reduction to a simpler act was possible within the group of those who had learned to communicate with each other . Thus , instead of requiring the full pantomime to communicate the fact that one was hungry , it came to be enough that one pointed in the direction of the mouth . A mere clue served to arouse the idea . This stage is reached when both the parties to the communication have developed the power of supplying the ideas needed for interpretation to such a high level that it is very easy to call out the idea by the slightest hint . Speech a highly specialized mode of behavior . This development , which made it less and less important that the gesture be a full pantomime , opened the way for a selection of certain particular forms of activity which became the vehicles of communication and were wholly set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available as organs for communication of ideas so long as the ideas had to be depicted in full by means of elaborately imitable gestures . But as the need of gestures diminished and the power of supplying ideas increased , the vocal cords proved increas- . ingly useful as special organs of social communication just because they were not otherwise used . The hands which were used for communication during the period when gesture was evolving were in demand for the direct practical activities of life . When two individuals wish to communicate with each other , it is often extremely inconvenient to suspend all other activity , to lay down what one may be carrying , to come where one may be clearly seen , for the purpose of holding a parley . The vocal cords , on the other hand , are not required for the practical purposes of life . They are easily disconnected in their action from the general mass of the muscles and , therefore , very naturally became the organs for a system of social activities . One of the most primitive forms of vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of vocal reactions to handwork . The workers secured social cooperation through the song , their hands in the meantime being occupied in practical work . Consequences of specialization . The fact that speech thus separates itself from other forms of bodily activity and becomes a highly specialized system of behavior brings with it a number of important consequences . First , it is possible for speech to develop to a high level without involving the corresponding development of any of the practical arts . What is sometimes called pure verbalism may result . Thus a student may acquire mere words and not have any power of applying the words which he repeats to other forms of behavior . Second , the specialized character of speech results in the sharp differentiation of one local language from that // of other sections . Ultimately each language grows so far from the parent root that it is wholly unintelligible except to those who are trained in its special forms . Third , there is a possibility that ideas will be attached to sounds so loosely and ambiguously that the two parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and the same sounds . Speech an indirect form of behavior . Speech as a form of behavior thus lacks that direct relation to the outer world which most habits exhibit . It takes on a highly artificial character . Its uses are controlled by social convention rather than by natural necessity . We may therefore very properly describe speech as an indirect , conventional form of behavior . Evolution of writing . The stages of evolution of speech which have been described in the foregoing paragraphs are exemplified in essentially the same sequence , though in slightly different form , in the evolution of the art of writing . Writing at first direct in form . The earliest stages of writing were those in which pictographic forms were used ; that is , a direct picture was drawn upon the writing surface , reproducing as nearly as possible the kind of impression made upon the observer by the object itself ( see Fig. 54 ) . To be sure , the drawing used to represent the object was not an exact reproduction or full copy of the object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image was thus aroused by a direct appeal to the eye . Anyone could read a document written in this pictographic form if he had ever seen the objects to which the pictures referred . There was no special relation between the pictures or visual forms at this stage of development and the sounds used in articulate language . Concrete examples of such writing are seen in early monuments , where the moon is represented by the crescent , a king by the drawing of a man wearing a crown . An example of this stage of writing is also supplied // by the ancient Chinese forms shown in the upper line of Fig. 5 5 Images reduced to lowest terms as powers of reader increase . The next stage of development in writing began when the pictographic forms were reduced in complexity to the simplest possible lines . The reduction of the picture to a few sketchy lines depended upon the growing ability of the reader to contribute the necessary interpretation . All that was needed in the figure was something which would t -r AA a e f h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded and explained by Garrick Mallery in the Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology , 1888-1889 , p. 363 The writer , a girl of the Bear totem , b , summons her lover , who belongs to the Mud Puppy totem , d , along the various trails indicated , to the lodge , c , from which the beckoning hand protrudes . The inclosed figures at 1 , j , and k are lakes . The crosses indicate that the girl and her companions are Christians . " The clear indications of locality , " writes Mallery , " serve as well as if in a city a young woman had sent an invitation to her young man to call at a certain street and number " suggest the idea to the reader 's mind . The simplification of the written forms is attained very early , as is seen even in the figures which are used by savage tribes . Thus , to represent the number of an enemy 's army , it is not necessary to draw full figures of the forms of the enemy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some brief indication , perhaps at the beginning of the series of lines , to show that these stand each for an individual enemy . This simplification of the drawing leaves the written symbol with very much larger possibilities of entering into // new relations in the mind of the reader . Instead , now , of being a specific drawing related to a specific object , it invites by its simple character a number of different interpretations . A straight line , for example , can represent not only the number of an enemy 's army , but it can represent also the number of sheep in a flock , or the number of tents in a village , or anything else which is capable of enumeration . The use of a straight line for these various purposes stimulates new mental developments . This is shown by the fact that the development of the idea of the I Fie . 55 . Ancient and modern Chinese writing The upper line shows ancient forms of Chinese writing ; the lower line shows the derived modern forms . Reading from left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , " " mountain , " " tree " ( or " wood " ) , " dog " number relation , as distinguished from the mass of possible relations in which an object may stand , is greatly facilitated by this general written symbol for numbers . The intimate relation between the development of ideas on the one hand and the development of symbols on the other is here very strikingly illustrated . The drawing becomes more useful because it is associated with more elaborate ideas , while the ideas develop because they find in the drawing a definite content which helps to mark and give separate character to the idea . Striking examples of the simplification of form in order to facilitate the writing of symbols are shown in Figs. 55 and 56. // Written symbols and their relation to sounds . As soon as the drawing began to lose its significance as a direct perceptual reproduction of the object and took on new and broader meanings through the associations which attached to it , the written form became a symbol rather than a direct appeal to visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in itself , it was not . The way M Fm . 56 . Ierivation of the Roman letter M from the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic owl The four forms in the upper part of the figure are Egyptian forms . The first on the left is the usual hieroglyphic picture of the owl , or , as it was called in the Egyptian language , mulal ' . The three remaining upper forms are found in the writings of the Egyptian priests . The first form on the left of the lower series is an ancient Semitic form . Then follow in order an ancient Greek form and two later Greek forms . ( From I. Taylor 's " The Alphabet , " pp. 9 , ro ) was thus opened for the written symbol to enter into relation with oral speech , which is also a form of symbolism ( see Fig. 56 ) . Articulate sounds are simplified forms of experience capable through association with ideas of expressing meanings not directly related to the sounds themselves . When the written symbol began to be related to the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation between them . The Egyptians seem to have established // such relations to some extent . They wrote at times with pictures standing for sounds as we now write in rebus puzzles . In such puzzles the picture of an object is intended to call up in the mind of the reader not the special group of ideas appropriate to the object represented in the picture but rather the sound which serves as the name of this object . When the sound is once suggested to the reader , he is supposed to attend to that and to connect with it certain other associations appropriate to the sound . To take a modern illustration , we may , for example , use the picture of the eye to stand for the first personal pronoun . The relationship between the picture and the idea for which it is used is in this case through the sound of the name of the object depicted . That the early alphabets are of this type of rebus pictures appears in their names . The first three letters of the Hebrew alphabet , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ox , " both , which means " house , " and girnmel , which means " camel . " The alphabet . The complete development of a sound alphabet from this type of rebus writing required , doubtless , much experimentation on the part of the nations which succeeded in establishing the association . The Phoenicians have generally been credited with the invention of the forms and relations which we now use . Their contribution to civilization can not be overestimated . It consisted not in the presentation of new material or content to conscious experience but rather in bringing together by association groups of contents which , in their new relation , transformed the whole process of thought and expression . They associated visual and auditory content and gave to the visual factors a meaning which originally attached to the sound . Pictures thus came to mean sounds rather than objects ( see Fig. 56 ) . Social motives essential to the development of language . The ideational interpretations which appear in developed // language could never have reached the elaborate form which they have at present if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual when left to himself is to drop back into the direct adjustments which are appropriate to his own life . He might possibly develop articulation to a certain extent for his own sake , but the chief impulse to the development of language comes through intercourse with others . As we have seen , the development of the simplest forms of communication , as in animals , is a matter of social imitation . Writing is also an outgrowth of social relations . It is extremely doubtful whether even the child of civilized parents would ever have any sufficient motive for the development of writing if it were not for the social encouragement which he receives . Social system as source of the form of words . Furthermore , we depend upon our social relations not merely for the incentives to the development of language but also for the particular forms which oral and written language shall take . It is much more convenient for a child born into a civilized community to adapt himself to the complex symbolism which he finds in the possession of his elders than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that tendencies exist early in life toward the development of individual forms of expression . A child frequently uses a certain sound in a connection which can not be explained by reference to social usage . It may be a purely individual combination , or a crude effort to adopt something which has been suggested by the environment . This tendency to give sounds a meaning might prove sufficient to work out a kind of language , even if the individual were entirely isolated from his fellows ; but the natural tendencies are very early superseded by the stronger tendencies of social imitation , and in the end the social system completely dominates individual development , dictating in all cases the forms of words . // Social usage and the domination of individual thought . In adopting the forms of expression used by those about us , we are led to take up certain general social forms of thought which ultimately control the whole mental life . The effect of this social influence is so far-reaching that it is quite proper to say that an individual is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations , at least in the higher phases of his mental life . The fundamental forms of direct activity , which constitute the personal habits by which we have succeeded in adapting ourselves to the demands of the physical world , are to a certain extent unsocial . They are , to be sure , alike in different individuals because they have grown up , as was shown in our earlier discussion , under the demands of a common physical environment . Our forms of space perception , for example , are not the creations of our own individual caprice but rather the arrangement which we have given our sensory experiences in our effort to fit ourselves to a world which dictates these space relations to us . Since we have all grown up in the same space world , our space ideas are alike . The community of social ideas expressed in language is of a different type . Even the direct , relatively unsocial forms of perception are influenced by these higher social forms of thought . If , for example , there is no word in a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to a certain number of days ' journeys , it is not likely that the individual will feel any tendency to discriminate fifteen miles from seventeen . His attitude in this matter will be determined by the attitude of his social environment , and he will neglect in his thought , as do those about him , the finer details of distance . Similarly , if there are no names for certain forms of property rights , it is not likely that the individual will , of his own initiative , recognize these forms of right as belonging to those who constitute the social group with him . // Social ideas dominate individual life . The history of thought has been , in large measure , the history of the development of certain social ideas which could be marked with definite names and made subjects of thought , because they were so marked . Consider for a moment the difficulties which would be experienced in conducting any train of thought with regard to the forces of physical nature if there were no names for the different forces and no fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is true in a general way that general tendencies of thought have been dependent upon the development of words to express ideas , it is still more true in the case of the individual that his mental tendencies are very largely determined by the forms of social thought expressed in words . A child who has had his attention called to certain colors and who is , at the same time , given a name for these colors is more likely to identify them in later experience than if no name had been given . The name serves as an incentive to the concentration of attention upon a particular phase of experience which would otherwise be lost in the general mass of sensations . Without the word the possibility of dwelling upon the single phase of experience in thought would be small . This is the reason why the retention of facts in memory is so closely related to the naming of objects . Experimental evidence of importance of words . Some experimental , evidence can be adduced to show that names are of great importance in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of gray paper ranging from black to white , and is asked to discriminate as many of these different grays as he is able to recognize with certainty , it will be found that he can distinguish ordinarily about five classes of gray shades . He can distinguish the very dark from those which are medium dark , the very light from those that are medium light , and he can place between the // dark and the light grays a middle shade which he is not disposed to classify as either light or dark . Beyond this fivefold discrimination he will find that he is very uncertain . If , now , after making this test under ordinary conditions , the individual is allowed to examine the various shades of gray and to adopt a series of names or numbers for them , it will be found that he can notably increase the range and certainty of his discrimination . The names furnish , as stated above , definite means of concentrating attention upon slight differences which existed from the first but were not noted in experience . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attachment to them of definite names , they become permanent additions to the individual 's equipment and can be retained more easily than they could be as mere unnamed sensation qualities . Number terminology as a device for recording possessions . One of the best illustrations of the significance for mental life of the creation of a terminology is found in the case with which a developed individual uses numbers . In general , it may be said that primitive languages have only a very meager number terminology . Savage tribes have frequently been known to have no number terminology reaching above ten , and in some cases tribes have been reported with a number terminology not reaching beyond three . There are certain forms of direct perceptual experience which can be utilized up to a certain point instead of the developed number system which we now have . If a herdsman has a herd of cattle for a period long enough to become acquainted with its individual members , he can recognize the size of the herd by recalling the individuals which make it up . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to estimate his wealth directly through the general impression made upon him by collecting all of his wealth at a single point . As soon as the direct recollection of each individual possession came , // in the development of human wealth , to be too cumbersome a form of representation , and the collective image became too vague to be relied upon , man naturally endeavored to devise a method of recording his property and retaining it in consciousness in some simplified form . Instead of trying to remember every one of his possessions , he adopted some system of tally . At first he began counting off on his fingers each different article which he wished later to be able to recognize , or he adopted in some cases one of the more elaborate methods found among savages who use pebbles or shells . The Latin root which appears in our word " calculate " and all related words is the word for pebble , and indicates that the early forms of computation among the Romans consisted in the use of pebbles . Symbols for groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , there naturally arose the necessity for grouping the tallies so that they could be easily surveyed . The method of grouping the tally marks in a system convenient for recognition is suggested by the five fingers on the hand , and this is often adopted , even by savage peoples . A clear indication that this grouping appeared in the natural tally systems can be seen in the symbols used by the Romans to indicate numbers , for in this system the number five and the number ten are crucial points in the notation , and show the adoption of a new group symbol to include many individual symbols in a more compact form . Parallel growth of number names and system of ideas . As the number system was worked out into a system of major and minor groups there was a tendency to develop a system of articulation directly related to the tally system . Number of the primitive tally form probably developed just as did writing , without reference to speech . The creation of words which should express number was slow , as indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolical system needed to develop to a high degree // before the demand for corresponding articulation was felt . As soon as the demand for articulation became sufficiently pressing , the words appeared , and they show distinctly in their character the tendency toward groups . Further than this , the names for successive tallies came to be the means , not only of referring to individual marks but also of referring to the serial arrangement of these marks . Thus , the names " one , " " two , " " three , " etc. are not significant merely as names of tally marks ; they have also each its special significance as the name of a special position in the total series . Development of arithmetic depends on an appropriate system of numerals . The advantage to the child who finds a complete number terminology developed is very great . The more perfect this terminology for purposes of expressing quantitative relations , the more complete and rapid will be his initiation into the forms of thought which the terminology expresses . The historical illustration of this fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of notation which was imported from the East in the Renaissance period . The written number symbols which had been used by the Romans were crude and rendered any forms of arithmetical manipulation extremely difficult . The Arabic system was so much . more complete and economical that it immediately took the place of the older and cruder symbolism . How long it would take an individual child to acquire independently anything like the mathematical ability which , with the aid of his social environment , he acquires through the adoption of the developed Arabic number system can hardly be imagined . Certain it is that his forms of thought are now dominated by the social system into which he is born , and this system was in turn borrowed in toto from non-European nations . Social world unified through common forms of thought . There is in this acceptance of the social system not only an // economy which operates to the advantage of the individual , but there is the additional fact that the individual becomes thereby a part of the social whole in a fashion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are bound together as intelligent beings by the common systems of tradition and language to a degree which makes us no longer centers of merely individual adaptation , but rather parts of a general organization which has a certain unity and exercises a dominating influence over many individuals . This social unity perpetuates customs and practices so that we have , in addition to the bodily structures which we inherit , a social heredity which guides us in the activities of personal life . Language is the chief medium for this social heredity . Changes in words as indications of changes in individual thought and social relations . It is in connection with the development of social institutions that we find the most radical changes in human language . If an individual comes upon a new idea and coins a new word for its expression , the new word gains standing and comes to be a part of the permanent language of the community only when others feel the same necessity as the inventor of the word for this new means of expression . When , therefore , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon it that there has been a corresponding series of social as well as of individual experiences related to the word . The detailed history of words is a detailed history of individual mental attitudes toward the world , and at the same time a detailed history of the social relations in which individuals have joined . Illustration of change in words . It will not be in place in this connection to enter into any elaborate linguistic studies , but one illustration may be used to indicate something of the character of the psychological and social study which grows out of the history of words . In his " English Past and Present , " Trench gives an account of the development // of the word " gossip . " This word was originally used at baptismal ceremonies and referred to the sponsor who stood for the child in a way analogous to that in which to-day the godparent stands as sponsor for the child . The first three letters of the word " gossip " are derived directly from the word " God , " and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a modification of the word " sib , " which is even now used in Scotland to indicate a relative . When the social institution of baptism was a matter of larger community significance than it is to-day , the word was needed to express the relationship of the individuals involved in the ceremony ; but being a general form of expression rather than an image of a particular individual , it came easily to refer to other phases of social contact than that which was primarily thought of in connection with the baptismal ceremony itself . The worthy sponsors of the child unquestionably indulged , even in the early days of the ceremony , in certain exchanges of information with regard to other members of the community , and this social function which the individual served was very readily connected with the word coined to refer primarily to the religious function . As the religious ceremony came to be less and less elaborate , and there was a decreasing demand for reference to the religious function , the word gradually drifted over to the second phase of meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears in softening l he din " God " to an s , made this transfer of meaning easier . Indeed , as we have seen at various points in our discussions , words become true symbols only because they are simplified so as to take . on easily new types of relation . Thus , the word " gossip " ultimately lost its original meaning and came to signify something which it signified only very vaguely to the minds of those who first used it . Furthermore , it is clear that this transfer of meaning is directly related to the development of the social institution with which the word was connected . The mental attitude of the individual who // uses the word to-day and the social character of the institution are both entirely different from the attitude and institution of earlier times . Words as instruments of thought beyond immediate experience . Other illustrations of the developments which take place in language can be found in the introduction of new words with new inventions and new discoveries in science . Once the habit of using words is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy method of marking any experience which it is desired to consider apart from the general setting in which that experience appears . If to-day a civilized individual wishes to think of certain relations such as the physical force of gravity , or the economic facts of value , and to consider the bearings of the factors which enter into these relations , he will devise some word or phrase by which to mark the relations and hold them clearly before his thought while he considers all of the facts . There comes to be thus a system of experiences which we are justified in describing as constructed in consciousness for the purpose of guiding attention ; these constructs have , as contrasted with ordinary mental images , very little content . Indeed , the reduction of the content of thought to the lowest possible minimum is the tendency of all mental evolution . The child has undoubtedly a more concrete imagery than the adult . The adult finds as he learns to use words fluently that the imagery which at first was necessary to explain them falls away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much condensed ; as , for example , when all the cases of falling bodies are thought of at once under the single term " gravity . " In the discussion of habits it was shown that as experience becomes more completely organized into habits , the memory content and even the sensory contents receive less attention . An organized attitude is substituted for a complex of content factors . In somewhat analogous manner , words may be regarded as means of // epitomizing consciousness , while they permit the highest type of ideational elaboration of experience . The widest variety of content factors may be related to words ; that is , the use of a word is often cultivated under the guiding influences of concrete content , as when the child builds up the idea of animal through direct perceptual contact with dogs and horses . After a time the concrete memory images attached to the word fade out and leave the word as a substitute , as a minimum content to which ( as when the man condenses his whole attitude towards all kinds of animals into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Images and verbal ideas . When , therefore , we ask what it is that a person thinks of in his use of a word , we shall certainly go astray if we attempt to answer that the word calls up all of the concrete experiences with which it has been connected and with which it may be connected . For example , let the reader ask himself what presents itself in consciousness when he sees the word " animal . " It would be still better if , instead of choosing some word thrown into the text as an isolated illustration , we should ask the reader to give an account of the mental experiences through which he passed when he observed one of the words that came in the course of the general discussion . For example , what was called up a moment ago when the eye passed the very definite word " text " ? The answer to these questions with regard to the content of consciousness at the moment of recognition of words will certainly not be that the mind is filled with trains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . The consciousness of a word has sometimes been described as a feeling or an attitude , and such a description as this unquestionably comes nearer to the truth than does the explanation of meaning through images , which has sometimes appeared in psychological discussions of this matter . // A general term such as " animal " or " text " turns the thought of the reader in one direction or the other without filling the mind with definite contents . The content of experience arises rather from the total phrase or sentence ; the single word indicates only the direction in which this content is to be sought , or in which it is to be applied in some future stage of mental activity . For example , if I say that all animals are subject to man 's dominion , there is much more of attitude in the whole experience than there is content . We look down upon the animals ; we feel their inferiority ; we recognize ourselves as above them . The attitude of mind experienced is the all-important fact . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into imagery , if one contemplates it long enough . Thus , one may turn the thought into images by thinking of himself for the moment as the representative man . looking down upon the animals gathered as he saw them in childhood in some picture of Adam naming the animals . But all this concreteness in one 's description of the animals and of himself is recognized as too picturesque to be true to ordinary experience . We can stop and fill out the attitude with appropriate imagery if we like , but we do not ordinarily do so . The truer statement is that the idea comes as a single simple attitude and prepares one to go on from a position of superiority to some appropriate sequent relation . The value of the words lies in the fact that they carry experience forward , furnishing only so much content as is necessary to support thought without overloading experience with all the detail . Other illustrations of thought relations . Again , take another illustration which shows that there may be nicety of shading in our thought relations without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " savage , " we are likely to take an attitude of superiority somewhat analogous . to that taken toward the animals , but flavored more than the former idea // with a concession of equality . If we speak of higher beings , such as angels , we assume an entirely different attitude , without necessarily giving ourselves the trouble to fill in any definite content . Indeed , the content of any thought referring to the higher beings is recognized everywhere as more or less of a makeshift , in that we fill in the unknown with such images as we can borrow from ordinary life , the images being symbols , not true representations . Concrete words . All this has been expressed by certain psychologists in the statement that general ideas are in essence nothing but dispositions toward activity . Here we have a formula which is very closely related to the formula which we derived in our discussion of the development of percepts . There are , undoubtedly , direct motor habits and consequent attitudes in connection with many concrete words . It is , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude assumed when we think of the word " animal " is anything like a complete bodily attitude such as would be assumed in the presence of animals in concrete experience . The mental attitude aroused by the word probably has as its direct physiological parallel a bodily movement which is a much-reduced resultant of earlier direct attitudes . It is in its present form merely a faint reverberation , significant not for direct adaptation but merely as a step in the development of a general and perhaps very remote form of activity . The present attitude is one of those indirect forms of human adjustment which render the experience of man freer and more ideational than the experience of the animals . The bodily movement in such cases is symbolical and transient , assumed merely for the sake of carrying the individual forward into a more complete state which lies beyond . Examples of words arousing tendencies toward action . The matter may be made clear by considering what happens when by means of words one is told that he is to go first to the right until he reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the left and go straight ahead . There are clearly certain tendencies toward direct bodily movements aroused by the words " right " and " left " and " straight ahead . " These tendencies toward movement , it is true , are not significant as present adaptations to the environment ; they are significant merely because they give the thinking individual a certain tendency , which may , indeed , work itself out later in a much more fully developed and concrete form , but is at present a kind of suppressed , incipient form of action . If one has thought out a series of movements toward the right and left , he will have developed within himself a form of behavior which , on the presentation of the appropriate stimulation in the form of the signpost or building at which he is to turn , will serve as a sufficient preliminary organization to arouse a significant and concrete form of behavior . The preliminary thought attitude and faint bodily expression serve , therefore , in a tentative way to aid subsequent direct adaptations . Abstract words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of direction but abstract phrases , such as the phrases by which men are exhorted to patriotism , obviously the emotional stirring which one feels as the result of these exhortations is by no means adequate to explain the true significance of the word " patriotism . " A man can not become truly patriotic by going through the inner stirrings which this word arouses . Indeed , in not a few cases vague emotional responses check rather than promote the development of true interpretations because the vague response satisfies the need of the mind for experience but gives no complete or adequate content . The trouble with the emotional response lies not in the fact that it is emotional but in the impossibility of its expressing fully the whole significance which the word must carry . Such an abstract term as that under discussion can be made potent for direct bodily organization only when it is supplied through proper settings with some definite and final purpose of an active kind . To be truly patriotic one must be // aroused to some definite form of public service . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left " and " right . " The abstract word taken alone is the expression of a relation . If it is treated as a final factor of experience , it will dissipate itself in vague emotional reactions . To take still another illustration : If in the course of a scientific discussion one is told that a certain problem needs very much to be investigated , the word " problem " will arouse within the individual some kind of a responsive attitude which can be described in a general way as an attitude of hesitation , of turning hither and thither in the search fora solution . But the conscious process will be more than the attitude of hesitation and turning , for it will have a form and significance determined by the whole train of ideas into the midst of which this attitude of hesitation and turning is injected . Thus , if the problem is in geology , the attitude of inquiry will be very different from that which would be assumed if the train of thought related to astronomy . We may therefore speak of the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its character . Another way of expressing the matter is to say that the attitude is in the world of ideas for the time being rather than in the world of practical adjustments . We mean by such statements as these that the attitude is merely a temporary step in the process of ideational organization ; it is not an immediate reaction on any object . It is an indirect and elaborate phase of adaptation ; it has value and significance because of the turn which it gives to the ideational process rather than because of the concrete imagery or reaction to the world of things . Contrast between concrete images and abstract ideas . The indirectness of verbal forms of consciousness and of the related nervous processes involves , as has often been noted in discussions of language , certain dangers of possible maladjustment . Concrete images and direct forms of experience can not , because of their limited nature , be turned in very // many directions . Verbal ideas , on the other hand , especially if they are abstract , are capable of a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual content . Besides this , there is a disadvantage in the use of abstract terms in that two individuals , while they may start with the same general tendency of attention , may , in the course of the use of the words , drift apart , without being as clearly conscious of their divergence from each other as they would he if they dealt constantly with concrete percepts . It is a much more definite method of interchanging ideas to demonstrate the objects themselves , or to demonstrate some concrete representations of the objects , such as pictures or models . If one does not have pictures or models , he naturally tries to correct the errors which are likely to creep in when he is using words , by calling up from time to time as concrete an image in the mind of his listener as it is possible to evoke by the use of words . We all of us feel the relief in any continued discourse when a figure of speech , or an illustration , is used . The figure of speech gives us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case may be remote from the immediate subject of thought , it may be related to the present discussion only as a kind of rough analogy , but the presence of some characteristic which illustrates and renders concrete the abstract discussion is a relief in the midst of abstract relational terms and furnishes the means of correcting possible tendencies toward divergence of thought between the speaker and the listener . An illustration is even more definite in its character , and so long as it calls up in the minds of the speaker and listener the same kind of concrete images , it is a direct corrective of the possible looseness of verbal thought and verbal communication . Particular images as obstructions to thought . How far one should be picturesque in his language , and how far one should , on the other hand , use terms which are not related // to definite mental pictures , is a matter which must be determined by the demands of the particular situation at hand . It would be quite impossible in any generalized science like physics continually to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , of the general law of gravity , he can not be dealing with all of the specific cases of gravity known to his experience , nor can he feel himself bound to a single illustration . IIe may come back to the single illustration in order to hold his verbal idea true to the concrete facts , but he should cultivate the ability to get away from the concrete cases into the wider sweep of thought which is covered by the general word . Ideas or indirect forms of experience characteristic of man . 1 n concluding this discussion of language it will be well to reiterate that human life has taken on , through the development of indirect modes of consciousness and behavior , an aspect which differentiates it altogether from the life of animals . The consequences for human nature of the evolution of a mode of reaction such as speech is , are unlimited in importance . The full significance of this unique mode of behavior will become increasingly apparent as we canvass in detail the problems of ideation and abstraction . CHAPTER XI MEMORY AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter reference was made to ideas without any effort to describe in full these important phases of experience . It now becomes necessary for us to take up the treatment of ideas and of the complex processes of thought which are made up of ideas . The way has been prepared for this discussion by the conclusions reached in all earlier chapters . Let us review briefly the essentials of our earlier studies . First , animals develop inner states in their efforts to respond to sensory stimuli . Second , the higher animals become increasingly able to carry on elaborate internal readjustments . Corresponding to these elaborate readjustments are certain complexes of sensations and certain attitudes which gradually grow more and more highly differentiated . Third , the inner organization of man and his closest relatives in the animal world is such that experience is progressively recorded in the form of habits of reaction and corresponding mental states . We are now ready to ask what is the form of this inner enriched mental life which man develops in the course of experience . Our popular language is well supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that man stores up in memory ideas and thoughts . We speak of recalling the past , of images in the mind , of an inner world of thoughts and thought relations . Ideas not derived from present impressions . In all such phrases as the above there is a sharp contrast between present sensory impressions and the experiences which are 240 // brought over from the past . There is also a recognition of the overwhelming volume of past experiences . The inclividual faces the world of the present moment with a mind set and prepared through long training . What we call intelligence is not the impression of the moment but a body of experiences drawn out of the past . Ideas as revivals . Let us consider some of the simplest types of ideas . If one closes his eyes and thinks of the scene which a moment before impressed itself upon his vision , he will recognize that his consciousness is filled with a substitute for direct visual sensations and percepts ; this substitute is called a memory image . When one thinks of an absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutes for direct auditory impressions of the voice . When one thinks of a rough surface without touching it , the image contains substitutes for tactual factors and their perceptual organization . These illustrations serve to emphasize the scope of the word " image , " which it will be seen is used not merely for vision but also for all spheres of experience . Advantages of relative independence of sensory impressions . Before taking up any of the details regarding the character and laws of memory images , it will be well to dwell briefly upon the great advantage to the individual of possessing these substitutes for direct impressions . The mind supplied with memory images is relatively independent of contact with objects ; the images may serve as the basis for attitudes and for reconstructive organizations which may be of the highest significance in individual life . A commonplace illustration of this advantage is seen whenever one runs over in his mind the various places in which he has been and where he might have left a lost object . More complex illustrations may be drawn from the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus using the images in consciousness as substitutes for real // objects . To be sure , there are certain disadvantages which connect themselves with these advantages . The inventor can make more mistakes in this imagery than he could if he tried to fit together real things , and one 's false memory of where he left his property may lead him far astray . But taken in the large , the freedom from the necessity of always waiting for direct impressions is one of the great superiorities of the higher forms of mental life . Individual variations in imagery . One of the most important statements to be made in the description of memory images is that different individuals show great differences in the character and vividness of their memory images . Some years ago Galton asked a number of individuals to test their mental imagery by calling up as definitely and fully as possible the familiar objects of the breakfast table . After the memory image had been called up , the observer was requested to state how clear the mental image was in color and form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled objects with a vividness and detail altogether comparable to their perceptual experience . These Galton called good visualizers . Others described their memory images as extremely vague and hazy . Still others , who were between the extreme classes , stated that their mental images were restricted in extent and were relatively fainter than the percepts themselves but , nevertheless , fairly comparable in general character to direct sensory experiences . Galton 's tests have frequently been repeated , and his results have been fully corroborated . Furthermore , it has been found that persons who have faint visual images have , in some cases , vivid auditory images . Some persons have vivid tactual imagery or vivid memory of movements . The blind , for example , can have no visual memories ; their memory consciousness must therefore be filled by a totally different type of content from that which exists in the mind of the normal individual . // The accidents of individual experience and mental imagery . Not only is the type of memory very different in different individuals , but the special contents differ according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons have looked at the same scene from two different points of view , their imagery will be different ; certain near and vivid factors for one person will be vague and remote for the other . Then , too , individual attitudes react upon the contents of experience to determine the character of imagery . If an especially pleasing or disagreeable color has been presented to a given individual , it may continue in his memory for a long time , while a second individual looking at the same color , but not greatly pleased or displeased by it , may very soon forget it altogether . Dependence on vividness and recency . In spite of individual differences in mental imagery , there are certain general statements which apply to all persons and all types of memory . All other conditions being equal , memory depends upon the vividness and recency of the sensory impression . It should be noticed that memory does not depend on intensity but on vividness . If intensity results in the concentration of attention upon the impression , then intensity may indirectly help to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been centered will continue in memory long after the disappearance of an impression which passes without attention . The recency of an impression is also a matter of importance . Careful quantitative tests show that impressions fade with relative rapidity at first and at a very gradual rate later . We forget many impressions entirely in the first few moments after they are received . What we retain beyond the first brief period is more likely to continue as a relatively permanent addition to the content of consciousness . The training of memory . Much may be said with regard to the scope of memory and with regard to the possibility // of increasing the scope of memory by training . It is doubtless true that the ability to retain impressions differs greatly with different individuals ; some retaining many impressions and carrying them forward through long periods , others having little or no ability to retain . So clearly marked are these natural characteristics of different individuals that the changes produced through practice are relatively small . Indeed , Professor James asserts that there is no possibility of changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shown to be out of harmony with the facts , for there are evidences of increase in the scope of memory through training . Nevertheless , Professor James 's statement is probably much nearer the truth than the popular assumption that memory can be radically changed through practice . Retention as distinguished from recall . Another general fact regarding memory is that experiences are not actively recalled without some present impression or related memory which serves as the motive or occasion for the exercise of memory . The mere retention of an impression is not the whole of memory . For example , at this moment there must be retained by every reader of these words hundreds of proper names . There is no motive for the recall of most of them . If one should find in the text , however , such a phrase as " author of the Iliad , " one of the proper names would be recalled and memory would become active for that one name . This name might in turn suggest other memories . The fact that memories are thus linked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train or sequence of processes was noticed long ago by Aristotle . He described the principles of memory , or , as they were later designated , the laws of association . There are two general principles of association which we may note : first , the principle of association by contiguity ; and , second , the principle of association by similarity or contrast . // Association by contiguity . When one thinks of the letter A he is very likely to recall also the letter B , because the two have so often followed each other in experience . The first line of a poem suggests the second ; the sight of one of two intimate friends suggests the other . In general , when two experiences have been intimately related in earlier experience , the appearance of one is likely to serve as a sufficient motive for the recall of the second . Association by similarity . When , ? ' -c c ) one sees a face which has eyes , or ? ' A c c nose , or mouth like those of another ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall the absent FIG. 57 . Association by person . In such a case as this the similarity two faces now associated need never The full-drawn circles represent the elements of the preshave appeared together in the past ; cut experience . Of these elelt is enough that they contain the ments A attaches itself also to the system of elements repsame feature . This relation between resented by the dotted line two experiences having a common circles . A , when taken with the circles b , b , b , constitutes factor is evidently a more complex the present experience ; A , fact than association by contiguity , when taken with the circles c , c , c , constitutes the recalled for it involves a sufficient analysis experience . A is obviously or concentration of attention upon a the center of relations between the two systems single feature to separate it from its present surroundings and make it the link of connection with a group of experiences not now present . The diagram in Fig. 57 represents the situation . The circle A represents a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , b are the other features . In a past experience , A has been part of a system of features of which c , c , c , were the others . If A becomes the subject of special attention , it can revive the elements c , c , c , and thus detach itself from b , b , b the features of the present complex in which it stands . In general , then , whenever a factor of experience now present has appeared // in earlier experiences in a different combination , the earlier combination may be recalled through association by similarity . Association by contrast . Association by contrast will be clear after the foregoing discussion of association by similarity , for no contrast can exist without like elements . One may contrast a candle and the sun because they both give light , or the moon and a coin because they are both round , but in each of these cases the basis of the contrast is a common factor . New products evolved in ideation . Thus it is seen that memory images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by continual association and readjustments memory images change their character and in the later stages show quite as much the effects of readjustments in mental life as the results of initial impression . When two ideas have been associated by contrast , there is an analysis which tends to break up the original memory images and bring to clear consciousness one element of the associated ideas together with what we may properly call the new idea of contrast . When the idea of contrast arises , the descriptive term " image " becomes less appropriate than it was for the simple ideas with which the discussion began . Ideas not all images . The idea of contrast is an idea of a higher type . It is very difficult to state what is the content of such an idea . It is a kind of shock of difference , a feeling of intellectual opposition . Indeed , there are many psychologists who insist on the use of the term " imageless thought " in describing such an idea . They mean by this term to draw attention to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite revivals of sensory content but with certain tendencies of consciousness which are to be sharply distinguished from memory images . Perhaps the best description which can be given will be by the use of an analogy . The mind is calling up a series of images when suddenly it turns in a new direction . The abrupt // turning is a real experience , often very vivid and , important for all later thinking . Just at the moment of turning there must have been an experience . What was the experience of turning ? It was an experience which linked together two images , but it was not in itself an image . Tendency to revert to imagery type . The more complex ideational experience becomes , the more elements there are which must thus be described as imageless . On the other hand , it is to be noted that there is a tendency to develop devices by which the mind can mark and hold steadily before it these imageless ideas . When one has had the experience of contrast , one tends to mark the experience by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a stable unit in thought . Advantages of indirect forms of experience . All these statements draw attention to the fact that ideas are , more than any other phase of experience , flexible and subject to inner readjustment . Thus , even when dealing with revivals of perceptual experiences every person has his own peculiar image depending on his point of observation and his personal powers of retention . Courts of law are familiar with this fact and attempt to eliminate by comparison of much testimony the purely personal elements which always attach to a memory image . The flexibility of ideas , as has already been pointed out , may be of great advantage because it puts the individual in possession of a device for thinking out changes in the perceptual world . When men put together ideas , they do so because ideas are flexible . If they get them put together in a productive way , they often make up a model to which later the hard material world may be made to conform . We are brought by this statement , as we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between direct and indirect modes of adjustment to the world . The physiological conditions necessary to the formation of ideas // are undoubtedly provided for in the nervous processes which go on in the association areas of the cerebrum . In the lower animals , where the association areas are small or lacking , there is little evidence of ideas . In these animals sensory processes pass to motor discharge with greater directness than in man . In like manner the infant seems to be wholly absorbed in percepts . This is related to the fact that the tracts in the association areas are the latest to develop , the process of development being , as noted in an earlier chapter , distinctly traceable for a period after birth . Animal behavior direct and perceptual , human behavior indirect and ideational . The significance of the evolution of the association areas can be seen by contrasting the modes of human behavior with the modes of behavior exhibited lower in the scale of life . If an animal is aroused to anger by some stimulation , it responds by directly attacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some form of agreeable excitation , it makes clear its pleasure in an immediate reaction . There is in animal life i very little delay or indirection in response . When we contrast all this with human life , we are impressed by the fact that man 's activities are most of them indirect . They require more time to mature . Thus , if a man sees an object passing before him , he may be thrown into a long train of thought rather than into a direct series of activities . The long train of thought is possible because man has a complex central nervous system through which the impression may circulate before it passes out as a motor impulse . Or man 's action may be indirect in another sense , as was shown in the chapter on speech . Instead of attacking the object directly , he may call his neighbor and talk the matter over with him , ultimately arriving at a mode of action only after a long series of verbal preparations and plans which are indirect and related only in the most remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The world of ideas comes ultimately to be a world of superior importance . Its laws of association are free and independent of the world of things . One can think of the cities of the country as belonging together because in the mind cities are associated , while in reality they are held apart by great stretches of territory . Influence of ideas on things . The result of the evolution of this inner world of ideas is that man ultimately puts together not only in his mind but in his actual conduct elements of the world which would never have been put together except for the laws of mental association . The laws of association are thus made to dominate the world of things . Tool-consciousness . Take , for example , the invention of tools . Primitive man was cut by a stone or torn by a thorn . Did he merely cry out with pain as an unintelligent animal might ? Not at all . He saw that the sharp edge which had injured him might be of great use to him if it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone and plucked the thorn and put them to the uses which he saw first in his own mind and afterward realized in material readjustments . Knowledge of nervous process limited . It must be frankly admitted that this discussion has carried us beyond our knowledge of the conditions in the nervous system . We know in a general way what association areas are , e , d but we do not know the details of their organization . We know ideas introspectively more intimately than we know their objective conditions . Traditionally , psychology has begun with ideas and given less attention to those lower and simpler forms of experience with which we dealt in earlier chapters . For this reason the science of psychology has suffered in its relations to the biological sciences . Either ideas have been thought of as facts wholly apart from bodily life or they // have been declared in a vague way to be dependent on laws of physical being . Psychology has oscillated between a purely theoretical spiritualism and a crass materialism . The mind has been regarded either as wholly distinct or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution . The view to which our study has led us can be expressed in evolutionary terms . Gradually the animal world , in working out its reactions to the environment , has evolved an inner world conditioned by indirect and tentative reactions . This inner world is social in many of its characteristics ; that is , it is a world through which individuals of the same type are drawn into sympathetic communication . The inner world is one in which ideas as substitutes for things are rearranged . The inner world is thus distinct from the lower levels of bodily adjustment , but is at the same time a part of the economy of individual relation to the world and is directly evolved out of the efforts at direct adjustment . Such an explanation of the place of consciousness in evolution gives us the fullest justification for our emphasis on those aspects of ideas which are not copies or reproductions of sensory impressions but new modes of rearranging experiences . We shall continue our discussion , accordingly , with a treatment of the changes produced in experience through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND THE FORMATION OF CONCEP'T 'S Adaptation through ideas . The animal adapts itself to its environment by cultivating better modes of direct reaction , such as greater speed of running or greater skill in the use of its teeth or claws . Gradually there appears in the highest animals a new mode of adjustment in the tendency to organize into social groups . The social group is a protective device which gives the individual greater strength than he can cultivate in his own individual organism . As soon as the social group evolves there must grow up , and there do grow up , types of activity designed to hold the group together . In man this latter phase of evolution culminates , and social cooperation becomes one of the dominant facts in life . No longer does man compete with his enemies by cultivating greater and stronger muscles ; he meets the struggle for existence by social cooperation . His reactions on the world are in large measure indirect . He invents a world of social forms which can be described only by saying that it is an artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means the evolution of a new type of adaptation . The competitions of human life are at a new level , wholly different from those of animal life . The character of this new type of adaptation can be studied through an analysis of one system of human behavior such as commerce , which has no parallel whatsoever in the animal world . 251
