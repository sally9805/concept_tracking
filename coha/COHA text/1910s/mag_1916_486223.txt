and of some form of certain guarantee that another such war should not burst upon the world . Here , surely , are " worthy " objects of the war . If it is necessary to fight on to secure them , we share the conviction that the Allies are bound to pour out more blood and treasure . In particular do we feel as keenly as we did when Germany was trampling Belgium under foot , that England would be forever disgraced if she did not fling into the combat all that she has , if to do so is necessary in order to put back the Belgian people into their homes . It is not a question of being pro-Ally or anti-German , but of a monstrous crime crying to heaven to be righted . And if the only way to right it is by continuing the bloody struggle , then we shall have to speak of the war , in the exalted and devout phrases which Lincoln used in his second Inaugural , as the " scourge " mysteriously employed by the Almighty to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , however , is not now the case presented by those in neutral countries , and by many in the belligerent nations , who are urging steps towards peace . They do not wish to surrender a single one of the worthy obients of the war . They merely raise the question whether - it may not be possible to attain those objects without fighting on till utter exhaustion comes . If they could be so attained , not alone every man of humane instincts , but every soldier in the field  --  unless he had fallen into the state dreaded by Gen. Robert E. Lee , where military men love war for its own sake  --  would turn away from further bloodshed with a shudder . Now , it can do no harm to debate this . We shall not see a Peace Congress among the warring nations to-morrow or next week or next Month . But it can do only good to set men discussing what will have to be done when such a Congress does meet ; or to begin to tormulete the terms that must be demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lasting peace . " And no more than this is really intended by the proposals of one tenor and another which philanthropic and sagacious men are putting forward . They do not expect to succeed at the first attempt . They count upon delays and rebuffs . But they insist that it is well to begin ' talking freely all round about the true objects of the war . The sooner we know accurately the terms of a possible peace &Mended; bY the various belligerents , the sooner will pe'ace among them become possible . FREE DISCUSSION OF WAR AND PEACE . A lively and instructive debate took place in the House of Commons on November 16 . Questions were asked regarding a peace meeting in Cardiff which had been broken up in a riotous manner . The replies of the Government were so unsatisfactory that the Labor leader , J. H. Thomas  --  who has , by the way , stood firmly for the resolute prosecution of the - war , and greatly aided the Government in its dealings with munition-workers , and so on  --  moved the adjournment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly discussed . Mr. Thomas declared that a war for liberty must not be so waged as to deprive British citizens of the liberty freely to meet and to say what they thought of military compulsion or the terms of a possible peace . The Home Secretary , Mr. Samuel , made in reply an adroit and fair-sounding speech . He stood by , in principle , the historic English position that " an Executive Government in a democratic country such as this ought not , especially in a time of War , to assume to itself a right of determining when opposition to its own policy should be expressed , auu ? 46 , y 14 " uv , , also adhered to the view that it was wisest to let dissatisfied people blow off their steam in public , rather than drive them into secret movements which might be more formidable than open ones . The right of public Meeting , to be sure , was qualified in wartime . Responsibility was thrown upon the Home Secretary by the Defence of the Realm act . ' or . Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground of apprehended disorder , but had " always declined " to do so . He gave the general assurance that " the Home Office and the police would do their best to secure freedom of speech , which even in time of war the Government of this country had always tried to maintain . " Wit he Proceeded to point out that , outside of London , the police authorities were locally independent ; they had the power to ' decide whether a peace meeting would lead to disturbance , and to prohibit it for the sake of public order . Of course , they have done this many times . Mr. Samuel did not deny this , but he did affirm , with a pleasing flash of the old Liberal spirit , that he thought it better that such a meeting as that at Cardiff should be allowed to be held , even if accompanied by disorder , so that it might not be said throughout the world that the Brithili Government had been " imitating its enemies and preventing the expression of opinion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . There are , it is true , papers like the Saturday Review which contend that no member of the House of Commons should be allowed to ask a question , much less make a speech , about the terms of peace ; but the practice is growing . Mr. Snowden , for example , called upon the Government a few days ago to state its view of the tentative peace proposals of the German Chancellor , and to let the country know whether it would not take steps to . " promote peace negotiations . " In answer , Mr. Bonar Law declared that the speech of the German Chancellor was " based entirely on the idea of a peace after a German victory " ; and that the Government stood by the statement of peace conditions made by the Prime Minister . It is clear that this leaves the diplomatic deadlock where it was ; but every sign is to be welcomed that people in England are recovering their freedom of speech about the war and about the possibilities of peace . In Germany something of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the people , as represented in the Reichstag , to be consulted about the settlement of the war , was made in connection with the setting up by the German Government of the dubious Kingdom of Poland . This was regarded as a definite abandonment of the hope of a separate peace with Russia ; and a great many Germans had clung to that . But the point is made by several German newspapers that this act is a violation of the promise that the people should have a voice in the terms of peace . Here is a step away from a certain kind of possible peace , yet the Ministry took it without in the least asking the approval of the Reichstag . On this head even an organ like the Berlin Post affirms : A painful impression makes itself felt . The Polish solution is the product of an autocratic form of government such as could not have been revealed in a more drastic form in this war , which has already taught us a few lessons . And this in spite of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded nothing more urgently than that they should be heard before the negotiations had been completed . It can not , unhappily , be said that the end of the war is in sight . The mighty passions which it has let loose seem almost as if they had got beyond the control of Governments . It is not surprising that Kings and Emperors are aghast at the terrible forces which they had not the statesmanship to hold in leash . But this is no reason why there should not be the freest discussion of a way out , not only for the belligerents , but for all civilization . Refusal even to debate it or to attempt to define it will not much longer be tolerable . There ought to be a much clearer " standing offer " of peace than we have yet had from either the Allies or the Teutonic Powers . A writer in the December Atlantic does not put it too strongly when he says : " Each belligerent is under the gravest suspicion till terms are unequivocally stated . " GERMAN EFFICIENCY AND GERMAN MILITARISM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as a military system merely but as a social force , we must look outside of Germany . They are found abundantly in this country . It is doubtful whether a Treitschke or a Bernhardi has ever claimed for the Prussian drill-sergeant the miracle-working powers which any Defence Society in these United States is ready , nay , eager , to concede him . Through all exhortations to a greater national efficiency for America there runs the assumption that German efficiency to-day is what the German army has made it . Intelligence , education , Industry , thrift , loyalty , obedience , family discipline , the sense of order and of co. operation , have all been injected into the German blood by the gigantic hypodermic of the General Staff . That is why compulsory military service is so ardently advocated by people who would never have conscription for its own sake : Heaven forbid . It is order to teach our boys a decent respect for their parents that we need universal training ; in order to teach our manufacturers how to utilize waste products ; to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to teach our city governments how to eliminate graft ; to teach our farmers how to double their crops . In other words , it is in order to educate a new set of virtues into the American people that we must have compulsory service . For see what Prussian militarism has done for the German people ! In this sense Gen. Leonard Wood far outstrips von Hindenburg and von Reventlow in his appraisal of German militarism . When von Hindenburg announces a victory he gives credit , in the first place , to the German people , to their heroism , their loyalty , their resourcefulness , and their capacity for self-sacrifice . Every German defiance , every German assertion of the nation 's readiness and ability to hold out to the end , is based only in part on the Empire 's military efficiency . Much the heavier stress is laid on those " purely German " virtues which were German for centuries before history knew Frederick the Great , von Roon , and Moltke . The gospel of Germany 's destiny to rule the nations , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based by its proponents on the virtues of the German soldier , but on the biological superiority of the German race . It is not Frederick and Moltke that made the German an Aryan , that made him blond , that made him the agent for the highest aspirations of the human soul , that made him , in short , that perfect creation which Houston Stewart Chamberlain and his school have so completely described ; nature did it . Even the German 's fighting ability , which might well be credited to the teachings of Prussian militarism , is regarded by these panegyrists as only the manifestation of that Furor Teutonieus which the Roman historian identified a good many years before Frederick . When a German speaks of the Prussian army as the maker of Germany , he is speaking only of the German state . He regards the army as the instrument which has given unity and security to the German people , and so enabled it to develop its natural capacities . But when an American orator on preparedness speaks of the Prussian army he credits it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roentgen and Dr. Ehrlich . As between Gen. Leonard Wood and Houston Stewart Chamberlain , the latter is much nearer to the truth ; not surely in the sense of the pre-ordained biological superiority of the German race , but in the implication that the present strength and efficiency of the German people are to be explained primarily by certain natural virtues which militarism may have disciplined , economized , capitalized , but which it certainly did not create . Why is it that the German army has regularly failed against its opponents in the west and has regularly succeeded against its enemies in eastern Europe ? Because armies to-day can not be divorced from nations . It is the entire resources of the nations that are now pitted against one another , and Germany 's demonstrated superiority over the Slav in battle is only a reflection of the superiority of German national efficiency to Slav efficiency . That superiority , to any one acquainted with even the outlines of European history , is not the creation of yesterday or the day before . For nearly a thousand years the civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in central and eastern Europe . Long before Frederick the Great , the German settlements in Poland , in Russia , in Transylvania , were the centres of a higher  --  the dangerous word must be used ? Kultur . The skilled artisans and merchants in medieval Slavdom were the Germans . They composed the Burger-turn , the bourgeoisie , with the rise of which modern progress is so intimately bound up . The German colonists in Russia up to the present have been models of systematic and intelligent labor among an unprogressive and primitive population . The Russian of to-day uses the term German as a testimonial and a sneer . In Tolstoy , in Turgenieff , in Dostoievsky , German stands for a materialistic but concededly efficient mode of life . Neither the German army nor the state will primarily explain Germany 's modern industrial development and her emergence as a formidable competitor among the nations of the West . Dyestuffs did not proceed directly from Sedan , but from that gift for intense concentration , for infinite research , for patient experiment , which gave a name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is beside the question to renew the debate whether German scholarship ever produced works of genius , or whether the German chemists have made original discoveries . A synthetic dye industry may be developed without geums , just as a battle may be won through sheer preliminary drudgery . This question , then , it would be well for our preparedness experts in national psychology to keep in mind : Whether German military efficiency has created the German national efficiency , or whether it is itself the product of historic national traits , And , secondly , whether an American psychology can be created by the imposition of the German system of military gymnastics , or whether America can best realize itself by being true to its own genius . THE RESERVE BOARD AND LOANS TO EUROPE . The statement issued at Washington by the Federal Reserve Board last week regarding investment of American bank funds in Treasury bills of European Governments deserves weighty consideration , as the opinion of the responsible central committee of our banking system . It is necessary to read the statement with great care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? purport . We have already observed some disposition to infer that the Board is objecting to the loans offered by-European Governments in this market , on the basis of their soundness as investments . But the Board does nothing of the kind . Quite to the contrary , its statement specifically points out that " the natural absorbing power of the investment market supplies an important regulator of the volume of our sales to foreign countries in excess of the goods that they send us . " The present enormous excess of that sort has resulted mainly from purchases by European Governments , whether of foodstuffs or war munitions . The economic regulator referred to by the Board would naturally , therefore , be negotiable securities of those Governments . It is true that the statement , after admitting that the Board " is not called upon to advise private investors , " does suggest guardedly that " the investor should receive full and authoritative data  --  particularly in the case of unsecured loans  --  in order that he may judge the future intelligently . " This warning , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to such tenders as have been made in behalf of Russia and Germany , where the terms of the loan involved what was virtually a speculation in exchange rates . It could scarcely apply to the Anglo-French loan of 1915 , for instance , which , being payable interest and principal in gold in the United States , provided on its face the necessary data in the simplest form . But the Board ought , in ? our judgment , either to have been more explicit in this matter , or else to have said nothing about it . The language of the Federal Reserve Board clearly indicates that it has its eye simply on the bank position . The Board sees possible influences " which , if not kept under control , would tend towards instability . " Its view is that this tendency might assert itself through the purchase , by a given bank or set of banks , of the short-term European Treasury bills " to a disproportionate degree , " thus restricting the bank 's resources available for ordinary business loans . But the Board goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discount . Taking it for granted that the proposed Treasury bills , issued to run only one to six months , will as a matter of fact be constantly renewed at maturity , the Reserve Board cautions the banks under its jurisdiction that " it does not regard it in the interest of the country at this time that they invest in foreign Treasury bills of this character . " All this , it is clear , involved a question of wise or unwise banking methods , and reflects in no sense on the soundness Of the Treasurybills themselves . Judgment as to the attitude of the Board in the matter is likely to depend on the extent to which one accepts the Board 's assumption of a constantly and rapidly increasing borrowing in this form . It is not a simple question . A London correspondent has cabled that offers of such bills were expected to be " merely occasional , isolated transactions . " Furthermore ? a paint on which the Board 's statement seems to us to lay insufficient stress  --  the proceeds , even of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American manufacturers or merchants , and reappear as deposits in the American banks . The Board itself admits that any " slowing down in the process of credit extension " might mean curtailment of our export trade . On the other hand , it Should be observed that the amount of English Treasury bills of the character described , at present in the hands of London banks and bankers , is abnormally large . In peace times , the bills are issued in anticipation of collection of the taxes , and are redeemed as the tax money comes in . The British Exchequer issues them nowadays in anticipation not so much of tax collections as of the floating of a longterm war loan . Assuming , as the financial markets in the next few days appeared to do , that the Board 's apprehension of an issue so large as unduly to tie up bank resources was reasonable , even Wall Street concluded , after thinking the matter over , that the warning against the Treasury bills was in line with proper conservatism . The New York agents of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been instructed by the British and French Governments to withdraw their Treasury bills for sale " ; this both because of a " desire to show every regard to the Federal Reserve Board , " and because the sale of such bills " has never been an essential part of the Allied Governments ' financial plans . " With this announcement , the incident was definitely closed . It is clear that the dispute concerned primarily a question of banking practice and the American banking position . The Board did not suggest that the policy of our investment market making loans on a sound basis to the strong Allied Powers should be suddenly abandoned . " The United States , " so says the Reserve Board 's statement , " has now attained a position of wealth and of international financial power which , in the natural course Of events , it could not have reached for a generation . " Such an international position brings obvious international duties , one of which is to finance , on the basis Of acquisition of securities of our foreign customers , the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . AMERICAN INCOMES The most striking fact presented by the figures of the income tax for the fiscal ' year 1916 is that the amount collected on individual incomes shows the enormous increase of 65 per cent . over the preceding year . For the year ending June 30 , 1915 , that amount was $41,000,000 ; for the year ending June 30 , 1916 , it was $68,000,000 . The number of persons paying the tax has remained almost stationary throughout the three years during which the law has been in operation ; this year the number was 337,000 . It is notable , too , that while the returns show a very large increase of income all along the line among those who pay the tax , the percentage of increase is far greater among the big incomes than among those of moderate amount . This is indicated at once by the fact that the amount collected at the normal rate  --  one per cent . on the entire net assessable income of every individual , whatever additional amount he may have to pay as super-tax  --  has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on examining the figures , we find that incomes below $20,000 have yielded much less than 50 per cent . increase , while the super-tax on higher incomes shows an advance of much more than 50 per cent . Indeed , of the entire $68,000,000 , no less than $44,000,000 is super-tax , collected on the excess over $20,000 of an individual income , while last year this same super-tax ( for the rates have not been changed ) yielded only $24,000,000 . We have here an increase of 80 per cent . And the rise in the rate of increase is fairly steady within the group of the super-taxed , as we advance from the well-to-do to the rich and the ultra-rich . The super-tax collected for the range from $20,000 to $50,000 increased 50 per cent. , from $50,000 to $70,000 the increase was 60 per cent. ? from , $75,000 to $100,000 it was 75 per cent , from $100,000 to $250,000 it was 85 per cent. , and above that it was nearly 100 per cent . In other words , the big incomes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposed to indicate them , twice as great in the calendar year 1915 as in the calendar year 1914 . There is , however , a consideration that makes this conclusion very untrustworthy , at least as meaning what it would generally be taken to mean . The law requires the listing , as part of a person 's income for the year , of any gain made through the sale of securities or other property . In case the property had been bought prior to the operation of the Income-Tax law , the gain must be apportioned , the portion of it listed for taxation being determined by the ratio of the time since the law went into effect to the whole interval between purchase and sale . If the purchase was made during the income-tax period  --  that is , at any time since March 1 , 1913 ? the whole gain must be listed . It is obvious that if this law was generally complied with , vast sums must have been set down for taxation as income which are not in any true sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of men of wealth . The figures give , therefore , certainly an exaggerated , and possibly a very highly exaggerated , notion of the actual increase of income during the past year . It would be possible for the Government , without in any way disclosing the affairs of individuals , to ascertain and publish the most salient facts as to the extent to which gains in the sale of securities have contributed to the increase in the legal returns of income In the aggregate and in the various classes . And if the returns are to have any value from the standpoint of economic study , this must be done . This same consideration affects still more deeply a showing which , on its face , is even more striking than that relating to the size of the big incomes . It will be remembered that the first statement concerning the operation of the law , Issued two years ago , gave the number of persons having an income of more than $1,000,000 as 44 ; this year the number is 120 . This difference is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is to be ascribed to the factor just considered . That some of the increase in all directions may be owing to more rigorous administration of the law is also to be noted ; but it is hardly likely that this has played a sufficient part to make a serious difference in the character of the showing . And it is only fair to remember that , after getting the bona-fide increase in true incomes , the increase is measured in money , not in substantial value . In a time of rapidly rising prices , a considerable increase of money income is properly to be set down as merely compensating for the lowered value of the money unit . That there has been a very large increase In the true incomes of the well-to-do and the rich , and that this would be shIowa by the tax report after all the factors we have referred to had been allowed for , is , however , quite certain .
