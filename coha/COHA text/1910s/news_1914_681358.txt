txt I have been able to gather from a number of reliable sources some - additional details with regard to the fighting which took place during Sunday and Monday in Northern France . On . the first of those two days the British forces had a well-earned and needed rest . To their right , however , the French were very fiercely attacked quite early in ' the day . In the earlier part of the day 's encounter the enemy in tremendous strength attacked the French forces in front of La Fere , and as the Germans were in very much superior strength , the French commander deemed it advisable to take up : a position ' beyond La Fere . That was the sum total of the German advantage . The attack was renewed on the French In their new position , but two desperate onslaughts made no impression on it . On MondaY there waa severe-fighting " all along the line , but With ' the exception of a slight gain of ground on the extreme left round Amiens , the Germans made no progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking power was apparent during the fighting on ? both days . Several soldiers who saw the terrible rushes of the enemy in the Mons , Charleroi , and St. Quentin fighting told me that their ' frontal attacks on Sunday and Monday were not nearly so determined . Lure by reigned Retreat . On Monday , I am told , part of the British force and the section of the French army on the right of the British succeeded by a feigned retreat in edraWing forward , in. the La Fere region a considerable German force . Intrenched riflemen and Maxims punished the enemy very severely and forced them back with a loss which must have amounted to between 500 and 600 in killed and wounded . " I do n't know what has come over the German riflemen , " an officer said to me today , " but our men have become almost totally indifferent to the German rifle fire . While it is going on they do their work , singing , whistling , and joking in the trenches . " An army doctor , who heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable way . Of 500 wounded who had come under his ' notice or whom he had treated , only one was suffering from a rifle - bullet wound . All the others had been hit by shrapnel bullets or bits of shells . On Monday the Germans did a great deal of artillery work in support of their infantry . The British replied with Maxim and rifle fire , and all accounts speak of the deadly accuracy of both . I met today t. gunner who was in charge of a Maxim gun and who at one time found himself right in the centre facing an oncoming German frontal attack . " But we did mow them down , " he said , " the section in front of me must have consisted of 800 men , and every one of them got something . We cleared the whole lot out from the flanks , others closed up and at last we had to run for it . We were forced to leave the gun behind , but luckily a well planted German shell knocked it to bits before the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies are not content to remain to be attacked all the time . They are keeping the enemy on the qui vive . The Belgians , French , and English take turns at keeping the Germans awake . That is accomplished by countless feints , skirmishes and alarms . The German army , indeed , must be an army that gets little sleep , and an officer of my acquaintance was told by a German prisoner , an officer of artillery : " We would rather run short of ammunition than be kept constantly without sleep as we have been so often . " Those wearing-out tactics will doubtless tell a tale just as the tremendous slaughter 1 in frontal attacks must be having a serious effect on the nerves of the ' Kaiser 's soldiers . There can be little doubt of that and I am convinced that it is correct to say that for the moment the German forward march has been arrested and there are other factors at work , combining to destroy what hopes the Germans may have of achieving victory . Even with . Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at the end of the war , but faced with a ' situation which looked ' - like and , indeed , would be , in all - reality  --  the beginning of-a ' new campaign in which all . the disadvantaOs ' Were on . their side . Sci much , I ' thinIi-J ' ' may . be:permitted to say . The brains of the allied armies are not at rest . They consider what is beyond tomorrow . They are Snaking sure that the future holds no Surprises . For us it can be stated with conflience that the Ames are drawing a net in which Prussian militarism ' Will be caught and will perish . As I have said , it is something to see the troops in this region , be they veterans or newcomers , French , Belgian or English . Their quality and high spirit is the same ; you look in vain among the ranks of their thousands for a gloomy face . They are just the men one would ask for , and any one who thinks- things are going badly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Itere in the ranks of the army , which is doing the work , there is no vestige of anything approaching despair . They hold their hearts and heads high . It is the refugees who are the pitiful feature of this war , with its long sweeping line of armies . I doubt if the worst side of actual warfare can equal the tragic sight it is to see those homeless and often bereaved people flying- from their homes .
