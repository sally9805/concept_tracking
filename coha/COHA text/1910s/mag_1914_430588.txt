 |p501  The Path of Learning WE could go to school by either of two ways . We could follow the drive down to the gate and take the road east for nearly quarter of a mile and then turn south for a mile , at the end of which , where the section roads crossed , we should find the schoolhouse . Taking this way , we would go along between barb-wire fences , bordered with a shaving of scant prairie grass , and when we got to the top of one hill we saw another just like it before us . The advantages of this way were almost entirely social . Other children came and went along the road , and we had the pleasure of exchanging views on current topics with them ? they knew a great deal that we did not know ? and of getting tags at successive gates . The scanty traffic of the road afforded varied interests , too , as well as a chance of rides with the good-natured drivers who overtook us . Many different kinds of men went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had any room at all to spare or any horse-strength , did not pull up when he was beside us , with a Whoa ' and a push on the creaking brake , and a cordial Want a ride ? ' ? the word we had been waiting for . If it did not come , he was a mean thing , and the boys made demonstrations in the re'a'r of the wagon to illustrate their opinion . The social intercourse of the road had an added attraction because , as we did not usually take that way , we were regarded by the others as company of a sort , and had the advantage of their hospitality . We took the road @# @# when it was wet weather , or in winter when the snow . was deep or soft , or when some impulse of sociability led us to walk home with the other children . At other times we cut down through the orchard , ? a very convenient thing to do at the right season , ? and then along a farm-road beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter-section of original prairie , still unbroken . That way was a half-mile shorter than the other and we were encouraged to take it in suitable weather , for one of the vague or unuttered becauses of which grownups had always an endless store in mind . Aside from its convenience this path offered many allurements . It was surprising that we reached school at all , there was so much to see along the way . The orchard itself ? from the time when the burnished mahogany of its tops changed to the faint rosiness of the closed buds and then to the cool pink of the open blossoms , and we breathed hard and deep all the way through it to get all possible of this enriched air , until the day when the last wagon had driven around to gather up the down apples ' ? offered us a hundred reasons for staying along the way . If nothing else delayed us , we ? Mary and I , that is , not the boys ? must take a bouquet for the teacher or for the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precariously into a topply bottle or into the shallow depths of the ink-well . The bouquet came from a Ben Davis or  |p502  Limbertwig tree , though ; the most reckless person would not sacrifice a Jonathan or Red June possibility . The orchard once passed , we sped along pretty rapidly by the milder attractions of the cornfield and the farm-road , unless a butcher-bird on wire-fence or hedge-tree , or a harmless blue-racer , or a toiling family of tumble-bugs , made us pause . No one has written a book about tumble-bugs , although they are much more interesting than the intelligent bees . If a snake were certainly harmless , Henry and John conscientiously killed it , even at the risk of tardiness . If it bore the dreadful tradition of being deadly poisonous , they let it escape . We should have liked one of those new-fashioned schools where the pupils arrive at their own sweet will , as often at eleven-thirty as at nine . We never found a teacher of that charming attitude of mind . Ours always had a predilection for keeping us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up delinquencies , or making us write our names in a papa list on the blackboard . One discerning teacher made Henry write out the family list ? knowing doubtless that within the family circle vicarious punishment does not long remain merely vicarious . Beyond the cornfield a barb-wire fence waited to be crossed . Any one who has crossed a barb-wire fence , at least any one who wears the garments of civilization , knows what exigencies and problems that offers . But after the fence came the stretch of prairie grass . Half the flavor of going to that country school would have been lost had we not had the experience of crossing the wild grass in the mornings and evenings . That made a frame into which all the events of the day were set . There were early summer mornings when the grass was only shoe-high , soft and springy under foot and de- liciously green , and the calls of the , meadow-larks dotted its quiet here and there , and we could n't help , however good our intention , darting out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a wild verbena or a horsepipe to take apart and stick together again ; June mornings when the sweet wild strawberries colored the southward-sloping hillside and we barely escaped being late . to school , our fingers and lips telling the tale of our foraging , even at that ; September mornings when we found bulrushes ripebrown in the slough our path skirted , and chased each other with stiff , dry bristles of jimson weed ; late autumn mornings when the tardy sunrise reddened all the lovely pink in the drying bunches of prairie grass , even while the frost lay on the yellow upper blades , and we raced with the wild tumbleweeds , and reached school all prickly with broken bits of tickle-grass secreted in unreachable places among our garments . There were autumn evenings , when all the grass lay pale under a dead gray sky and the strange cry of the fleeing wild geese came down to us from far up in the grayness , and we sped along home to a warm supper and a cozy indoors . There were sunny winter days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky curving over the rose and the buff of the prairie ? or else over acres of bright snow , smooth and unbroken save where a man had been sent along to make a path for us . And then early spring again , and the wild geese going back , joyful this time we thought , and the floating V of the wild ducks , and the rreen creeping up from the roots of The grasses , and the sharp , satisfying smell of burning cornstalks in the air . These and a thousand other things formed the . experiences which led us up to the door of the schoolhouse in the @#  |p503  morning , and caught us up there again in the evening , when we had finished quips and pungent courtesies with the other children at the schoolhouse door and set off on our own road . The schoolhouse itself differed from the hundreds that have appeared in literature , in that it had not a single romantic element in its construction , or surroundings . Its little square yard ? was enclosed by a smooth wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was set out with a few cottonwoods and box-elders , still small . A long hitching-rack , the bark all worn away from the poles by the teeth of mully-grubbing ' horses and the feet of young acrobats , surrounded it , and a stile allowed us to cross the fence ? of more use for social purposes however than for this , since no one would wait to cross a stile when it took only an instant to roll under the fence . The schoolhouse sat by the road , and I suppose it could be called a ragged beggar sunning , since the shade was scanty and it was never all 9 in repair at once . It was of the general proportions of a Greek temple , but the resemblance to a Greek temple was not close It bristled fiercely with lightningrods , a sign of the successful loquacity of some agent or of the scientific faith of the school directors . And there was a covered well-house at the side of the yard . The well-house was mainly a show , however . For when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reasons frankly explained by the children , ? and when the water was drinkable the windlass-handle was gone or the bucket was staved in . These things did not matter , however . It would have been a great pity if the well had been always usable , because then we could not have brought the water from the Browns ' well , half a quarter down the road . A journey to the Browns was a F LEARNING 503 rare excursion , especially for us smaller children , since the big boys and girls were too likely to arrogate the privilege to themselves . The Browns had not only a well , but a loom where a grandmother worked , weaving rag-carpets , and a cider-mill and a sorghum-press and a leach , trickling off lye for soft soap . There was always reason for hanging around to watch some interesting operation . The Browns made sauerkraut too , and had a smokehouse , and there was always something going on there which did not occur at our house , and which added to the joy of going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe . There was scarcely an hour on a spring day when some publicspirited one was not offering to pass the water or to fetch a fresh bucket from the Browns ' well . The ceremony of passing the water added some of the charms of social intercourse to our academic pursuits . It was almost like serving afternoon tea . The passer put on little graces and manners and took the opportunity to exchange persiflage , sometimes involving a sly liquid retort , with the passees . We made it a point to show our fastidiousness by drinking as close to the handle as possible , a spot which was supposed to be sequestered . Nine tenths of us drank from that place . As it seems to me now , the elements of this section of our education consisted of the following things : slaterags , the Fifth Reader , notes , passing the water , headmarks , what the big girls said , Blackman and a torn dress , spilled ink , and pokeberry substitute , the big boys , apples , staying in , speaking pces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? the book , not the science , ? partial payments , chronological recapitulations . I suppose we learned a few other things , but these are all I remember . They are  |p504  the projecting mountain-tops above the general mist of education . Being educated is a hazy sort of thing anyway . As to the slate-rag , the least said the soonest mended . But no object connected with our early intellectual development stands more clearly before my mental vision than that slate-rag ? a fabric in dull grayish black with an accompanying odor of Araby ? and the small vial of water which all housewifely little girls affected . I ca n't claim that I was housewifely , but I was easily made emulous in any line ; and in fact there are many purposes not domestic to which water may be put . So I , too , had my little bottle of water . In a jocular or vindictive mood , you filled your bottle to the brim and then after you had reached your seat you put your thumb on its mouth , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , and pressed down on your thumb . A simple law of physics took care of the result ? though not always of the consequences . That was one of the advantages of using a bottle instead of keeping water in the ink-well ? where we never kept ink . The teachers were too cautious for that . There were children who did not rise to the plane of owning bottles of water at all , but used a convenient natural resource . And there were some who did not have slaterags , but used their sleeves . But on the other hand there were priggish little girls , now doubtless , high in the profession of domestic science , who flaunted their pride in the number and size and shade of their slate-rags , to a disgusting degree . I suppose there was a time in the life of every slate-rag when it was white and dry and odorless . But that was an intimation of immortality early forgotten . I generally had Augusta Horlocher ( pronounced Highlocker ) for -a seat-mate . Seatmateship , I may say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires mutual forbearance and complementary virtues . Augusta was a domestic soul who spent more time in washing up the desk and putting my things over on my own side than she did in learning definitions . When Augusta emptied the waterbottle it was always for a worthy purpose . I ca n't say the same for myself , but I helped her ? having got permission to communicate ? with complex fractions . Poor Augusta never got beyond decimals . She washed her slate assiduously , but between times she never could get the answer . I hardly know why it is the Fifth of all the Readers which I distinguish in memory , except that the Reader we were interested in was never the one out of which we were at the time supposedly learning to read , and the contents of which were already tiresomely familiar , but one ahead of that , which we borrowed from the big girls to read at our desks . The Fifth Reader was in advance of us longer than any of the others , so of course I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had heard , but it was like a digamma or an ideal : no one had ever really seen one . Even the big girls never reached it . Learning to read meant learning to read aloud . It did n't make any difference whether we learned to get the meaning from a selection ' by reading it to ourselves . The thing was to be able to pronounce the words out loud and to give the definitions at the bottom of the page . There were two rules for reading . One was to let your voice fall at the end of a sentence , and net to read over a comma ; the other as to read all words in italics very loud , those in capitals fortissimo . That was a rule we could appreciate . There was a result to which definite measurement  |p505  could be applied . In the Fourth Reader was a soft little poem which ended with a tender epitaph , printed in small capitals ; we came out strong on that epitaph . When we read in concert , as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , one could have heard ' SOMEBODY 'S DARLING LIES BURIED HERE , ' forty rods away . Did you ever get a note in school ? ? from a boy ? ? from a big boy ? I suppose there are other experiences in life that are comparable to this , but certainly there is nothing else at that time which combines the same elements , ? dramatic , embarrassing , gratifying , triumphant , delicious , queer . Not that there was anything in such a note ? the outside , as the missive first came to view , was much more thrilling than the contents . But the very sight of it ? penciled on rough blueish scratchpaper , and ragged-edged and rumpled ? as it was flipped across an intervening space , or offered slyly behind a geography , or dropped on the desk as the writer went up to the A spelling class , gave a sensation not to be duplicated in any later years . The contents , I regret to say , were insignificant , negligible . It is to be hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the mere fact of getting such a note , of having it written to yourself , of forecasting the contents , of having the other girls . see you get it , all that in addition to the exciting fear that the teacher might see ? once she made a girl read a note out loud !  --  filled the moment with peculiar emotion . Notes had a family connection with apples which appeared mysteriously on your desk or were offered slyly at recess , with gum-drops , ? available only on Monday , since people went to town only on Saturday , ? with being chosen in Clap-In-and-Clap-Out , with valentines in the valentine box , with distinguished attentions in Drop-theme Handkerchief and such games , and ? acme of romance ! ? with your name carved by some one , bold and unashamed , on some one 's desk . The pleasures of the affair were largely - factitious , however . The notes which looked so promising and had nothing in them were typical of the whole matter . It was all like Clap-In-and-ClapOut or Miller-Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after you had settled down in partnership , shyly uncomfortable and unable to think of anything to say , the game was largely over for you ? no more excitement , no suspense ; you were merely an onlooker on life . Your partner in discomfort became very unattractive , and you rather envied those not yet chosen . As you looked around you saw no one you liked less than the boy who had chosen you . Cube root and partial payments were the two great mountain peaks of the science ? I had almost called it the art ? of arithmetic : Many a climber faltered and failed before he reached the dizzy heights of their summits . To have mastered them was to have a reputation for scholarship and intellectual attainment , not only in the school but in the whole neighborhood , and even in adjoining ones , which nothing could shake . When , at a ciphering-match , after other competitors had been following the easy paths of cancellation and long division , you called for cube root ' with an easy nonchalant air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your allies , and visible consternation mingled with awe spread among your foes . ' rIt was almost glory enough for one life . When you came to the last great problem in partial payments ? a Titanic problem , a problem to set Homeric heroes ? and you were chosen by the teacher to put it o/the black-rr+ .506 THE PATH (  |p506  board for the benefit of the class , it was a half-day 's work . You were excused from all other classes while you wrought at it . You essayed a modest demeanor while you explained it to the unsuccessful ones , but it was difficult to support . It is an instance of the bad management of destiny that after all this preparation you should never be in the position of a large creditor with such a problem to solve , and that a bankclerk can sum up all your little finances with a few clicks of an insignificant machine . I supposed at such moments of glory that in my riper years I should spend a part of every morning computing interest and courteously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useless to us . Chronological recapitulations afforded a chance to achieve the same sort of scholarly triumph that partial payments did . Studying history meant reading along hazily about this and that , with only one thing really clear , namely , that the United States was always right , no matter what it vas doing , and whoever interfered was wrong , ? wickedly , shamelessly wrong . We came out on solid ground about once a month , however , when we reached a chronological recapitulation . Here were concrete facts , isolated , to be sure , and rather meaningless ; but committing ' them was a definite task , to which we could buckle down with a satisfying effort of will . When learned , they were to be written in a long list on the blackboard . You wrote them by putting down all the dates first , in a wavy disjointed line , and then , beginning at the top , you set in order the appropriate happenings . Sometimes you forgot , and left gaps in the progress of events , where important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction . Something happened in 1775 , you meditated with chalk on lip ? but what was it ? A chronological recapitulation was a leveling process , where all events assumed precisely the same importance . It was a kind of historical multiplication table . Sometimes the class recited the list in concert , ? a popular form of recitation which made individual weakness inconspicuous . The performance began in full cho-rus : - 1607 , Virginia was settled at Jamestown. 1609 , Henry Hudson navigated the Hudson River . 1610 , Starving time prevailed in Virginia . But only a quartette survived into the eighteenth century , two of these fell in the hardships of colonial life , and only a soloist sighted the French and Indian war . Glory waited the soloist , however , and in so difficult a feat as this the failure of the others was regarded as something to be condoned . There were other chances for academic distinction , such as the writing lesson , in which , however , proficiency was of a distinctly low order , ? Augusta had a beautiful copy-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one could achieve in either reading or spelling . The glory which went with headmarks was not of so fine a type as that which was attained through partial payments or chronological recapitulations , but still one would not be without it . Even in speaking pieces one could attain a sort of eminence , though in this as in all artistic achievement , the result was less definite and logically certain than in the pursuit of pure scholarship . After ? you got used to speaking pieces there was a kind of pleasure in it . I got my pieces largely from Chambers ' Cyclopedia of English Literature , where I found many a thing that suited my fancy , at least ; whatever other merits  |p507  they lacked , they had the virtue of variety . But I suspect the audience liked them much less than the selections from the ragged Speaker Number Three , which came into requisition weekly . As I recall the process of education now , the lunch-basket seems to occupy a disproportionately large place in it . The receptacle was more frequently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the children said pail , ? since a bucket stood the physical strain better than a basket , and was more easily replaced from month to month . A great many different situations and dramatic interests and physical joys and sorrows were connected with that daily dinner-bucket . From the moment when Maldy or my mother packed it brim-full in the morning and tucked in the special red-bordered make of napkin which was devoted to school use , until we dropped the empty bucket inside the kitchen door at night and were promptly bidden by Maldy to pick it up and put it away , it was , one might say , an active element in our lives . In the first place , there was the daily ? semi-daily , in fact ? question as to who was to carry it . Dramatic and emotional possibilities hovered about this problem , which was no simple one . It involved intricate issues of precedence and succession and privilege , and physical superiority and age and sex , and who did it last , and vigor of conscience and proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could foresee or provide for . Mary shamelessly pleaded privilege of sex and age . But I , being a suffragist by birth and so prideful as to be loath to acknowledge physical inferiority , accepted my turn as a matter of principle and only contended that I should not have more than my turn . Having brothers is a great quickener of moral courage . One day , Henry , who was at times sophistical beyond belief , proved by some masculine system of logic that if women ought to vote I ought to carry the bucket as often as both he and John : and they set the lunch at my wrath-paralyzed feet and went racing off . The spirit of Deborah and Semiramis and all the rest of them descended upon me . I placed the bucket in a fence-corner , hid it with a clot of tickle-grass , and went highmindedly on . The look on the faces of the boys when they discovered my act sustained me in many an hour afterward ; and they never tried the experiment again . After being generously supplied from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lunch on the way home and ate it in restored amity , tinged with respect on the part of the boys , I was pleased to notice . Henry carried the bucket home . That was not the only time when we found ourselves dinnerless . Sometimes through real forgetfulness or genuine misunderstanding of the transportation system , the packed bucket remained standing on the kitchen table , and we were left at noon , or rather at recess , for no one could wait until noon , unsupplied with what seemed at times to be the main object of going to school . The result , however , was far from tragic . The readiness with which the other children divided their own resources and laid their offerings before us , was entirely characteristic of the temper of the prairie . I had never been in the Eckharts ' house and never would be , but I ate with cordial relish their cold boiled eggs and their pieplant pie , with its subconscious flavor of sauerkraut . The relish was partly superinduced by curiosity , however . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which we had looked with curious and speculative eye . 508 THE PATH C  |p508  Some of the children had the custom of trading select morsels in moments of cordial intimacy ; but that was forbidden by the authorities at our house , I did n't know why . We could n't even exchange apple-cores , after the pleasant social manner of the fluffs and Browns . I tried it once , exchanging the luscious , translucent heart of a Jonathan for the dry remains of a Ben Davis , mysteriously but unmistakably flavored with sausage and that breadand-buttery taste which is undesirable except in bread and butter . I was n't sure but there was a taste of Huff on it too . After that experiment it was easy to obey the injunction not to exchange . But on the occasions when we were thus the objects of public charity , we courteously sampled everything that came our way , from the rich browntopped coffee-cake of the Eckharts ? again with the sauerkraut flavor ? to the cold biscuits with only milk and sugar for spread , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opportunity was as valuable as a whole course in sociology . The fluffs were renters too , but they had mince pie and always a little glass of preserve . In bad weather or on rainy days , the lunch pervaded the whole noonhour , reappearing at intervals and filling in the interstices of Clap-In-andClap-Out , or charades . At these times we set our provisions on the desk-tops and began the meal with some show of ceremony . On other days , when the normal excitement of Blackman , or Dare-Bale , or coasting , called us , we dispatched our lunches so rapidly that they hardly seemed to have existed at all , and took a prompt departure for the outdoors , holding a final slice of bread and jam aloft on a smeary palm , and eating it into a neat curve around the edges . The most conscientious member of the family was always left to put away the remains . It is needless to say that Mary put ours away : The real epicure of the school was Augusta Horlocher . All pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mood of easy friendliness , cracking her hard-boiled eggs ? the pickled limes of our time - on the forehead of her intimate for the day , or , in a period of soul-aloneness , on her own brow ; Augusta scraping the greater part of the preserves over to one corner of a slice of bread , so that the last bite should be preeminently the best ; Augusta eating roll-jellycake and reveling in the mechanical process , following round and round its snail-like convolutions without once removing it from her lips until the centre was reached ; Augusta retiring with her choicest morsel to a quiet corner where no covetous glance could seem to urge her to divide ; pictures like these showed an art of enjoyment which none of the rest of us ever attained . It was through the big girls , I believe , that the major part , the really desirable part , of our education was carried on . They had attained a wisdom of life which , amid the reserve practiced by the elders at our house , I despaired of ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not know , and which in fact no one at our house seemed to know . It behooved me to be hanging about , listening to what ' they had to say to each other , ? only they so often whispered , ? and picking up any savory crumb of knowledge that they kindly dropped for me . What greatness the big girls possessed : They were so worldly-wise , so authoritative . I ca n't remember that they shone academically ; they often bore , very lightly , too , the ignominy of being in classes with us , and even at that by no means outstripping us . They even had to be put back ' on oc/ casion . But at recess and noon it was different . Then we dropped into our proper place and they rose to theirs . No one else can ever be so grown-up as they were . Every sign of maturity about them was a wonder . Augusta was really more impressed than I was . All other incentives to ambition had passed over Augusta , leaving her unmoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she should have been committing her spelling-lesson , she was slyly but seriously piling her hair on top of her head . And she spent much time sitting out to the end of the seat and letting her skirt hang straight down until it reached the floor , so that it would look long and grown-up . She would look down at this expanse of trailing garment , feel her small stack of hair , and wave the fan made from a leaf cut neatly out of her copy-book and carefully wimpled , and have the most blissful feelings . As for me , I coveted the knowledge of the big girls more than I did their years . There was Amanda Huff . I learned a good deal from her while she sat in front of me . Amanda was quite sixteen , an age which we understood marked an epoch in feminine experience . She was going to stop school pretty soon , she was so big . Even now she very readily stayed out for housecleaning , or the baby , or washing . Joe Withers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in school , having got permission to speak ' to ask the grammar lesson , she told me all that had happened the night before . Her information marked clearly the stages in Joe 's courtship , a progress to which , to do her justice , Amanda was offering no obstructions . I was a young confidant , but a very responsive one . I learned a good deal from Amanda . But when I began to tell it to my mother she spoke of having my seat changed , and I divulged no more . My mother 's views on education by experience were limited . Amanda was married the next year , and so lifted above companionship with me forever . I never attained the state of being a big girl myself , because my sojourn in the school was too short . So I never could know their feelings or their glory . They were still looking down on me as a little girl , I have no doubt , when on a June last day ' I stacked my other books and my slate upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie quarter-section for the last time . There were masses of blue spiderwort and white anemone down by the slough that day , I remember , and ripe strawberries among the grass .
