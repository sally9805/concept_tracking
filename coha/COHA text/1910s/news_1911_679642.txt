While he was bending over the tub he was seized with an attack of vertigo and fell unconscious into the tub . His foot struck the hot water faucet and turned it on . He was found lying unconscious aria partly submerged in the water four hours later . His bcdy was badly scalded . He was taken to a sanitarium. and died two days later .
