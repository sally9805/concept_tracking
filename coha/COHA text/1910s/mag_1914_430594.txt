 | WHAT attitude shall conscientious German-Americans take towards the war of nations now convulsing Europe and particularly towards the country of their ancestry ? The question is one to cause no end of heart-break , not only to them but to numerous Americans as well , who for one reason or other find themselves in debt to German learning or German kindliness . Should they imitate the multitudes who are shouting " Germany , right or wrong ! " and waive all effort to place the blame by some such conscience-salve as the phrase , " The Kaiser has sources of information not open to the public and knew he had to strike or be overwhelmed " ? There are plenty of other reasons given in defense of the Kaiser . He is a new St. George slaying the Slavic dragon who would destroy the civilization of Western Europe . He and his people are the victims of British envy and jealousy due to their extraordinary conquests on the seas and in the marts of the world . A hatred of forty-three years and a never-quenched desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their alliance with the Czar of all the Russias . Misinformation , ignorance , garbled despatches from French , Belgian , and English sources , and lack of appreciation cf the fact that the Kaiser is the true protector of the intellectual aspirations and the superb idealism of his people , ? all these are the reasons why , public sentiment in the United States is on the side of the Kaiser 's enemies . In brief every man 's hand has been raised against Germany because , as the Kaiser put it , God has been with her ; she has prospered exceedingly and the wicked now rejoice that evil days have come upon her . This and much more is put forth by those who are for " Deutschland , Deutschland uber Alles . " What intensifies the difficulty of the German-American is that there are two Germanys . One is that of the Kaiser and of the military autocracy , those who believe in the divine right of rulers , in the mailed fist , in government by aristocracy , in might as against right , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rations be armed to the teeth . Its adherents are those who see in the Waif enrock another hat of Gessler , before which the public must bow . They uphold the officers who cut down lame cobblers or run through civilians at some fancied insult , and applaud those wearers of the uniform who resort to the duel , long since outlawed by the enlightened sentiment of the world . These are the Germans who entrench in power the . ennobled and enriched classes ; who are without trust in the people and are utterly opposed to any extension of democracy , relying for aid upon a subservient bureaucracy ; who support the Prussian Government in its refusal to remove the inequalities among voters within its electorate , ? against which 100,000 Prussians protested last year on a single day . Incidentally they are of the type that gives so much offense to the rest of the world . They are arrogant and supercilious and frankly without faith in anything save the power of the sword . It is they who have dictated the foreign policy which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Bismarck 's leadership originally entered in 1882 the game of taking the lands of backward races , in which all their neighbors and we ourselves have indulged . It is they who give the utterly false impression that all Germany has been bent on conquering where it could . It is they who make a large part of the world forget that the Germans are among the most lovable , useful , and enlightened of people ; that they are bound to us by ties that ought to be indissoluble . Have they not enriched our blood ? Did they not come to us by the hundred thousand , fleeing from home because of a noble idealism which they transferred to our country , pledging their faith with their blood upon our battlefields of civil strife ; but always on the side of the Union and human liberty ? Surely no German-American who really believes in republican institutions , in popular government , in the ideals of Washington and Lincoln , can uphold this Germany . But there is another Germany besides this one of the autocrats , ? totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great souls who have really made the spirit of the nation , its thinkers , its teachers , its  | scientists , its civic administrators , its poets , its glorious musicians , its philosophers , its idealists , its patriots of the wars for freedom and of the lost struggle for liberty in 1848 . OUR DEBT TO INTELLECTUAL GERMANY To this Germany thousands of Americans owe a debt of never-ending gratitude . From it hosts of our teachers , our professional men without number , and others in every rank of life have drawn their most cherished inspirations . To it we owe in ' considerable measure our university development ; from it came in large degree the impetus towards good civic government which has been one of the glories of our American progress in the last two decades . From this Germany Lloyd-George has plagiarized those plans for the improvement of the welfare of the masses which have made him at once the bestbeloved and best-hated man in Great Britain . In the civic care of its own this Germany has led the world , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build the city beautiful and made good and progressive government the birthright of all its urban dwellers . In no other nation has science in the same degree become the partner of commerce and of industry . Nowhere else has there been a keener , if as keen , an intellectual freedom among those whose lives are dedicated to the pursuit of truth , or to the instruction of the young . Nowhere has there been a greater reverence for the aristocracy of intellect or as generous a recognition of its achievements . To sit at the feet of its inspired teachers , men and women have come from all quarters of the globe knowing that in a hundred fields this Germany led the world . And it is this Germany which to-day lies prostrate before us . It is this Germany which is being slaughtered , whatever the reason or the excuse for the war . On behalf of this Germany any really enlightened ruler must have stood for peace against the world , no matter who might be mobilizing or where . - To the support of this Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in England , ? had the Kaiser but cried out its need and asked for allies to defend and not to break the peace . For it anyone who realized its moral grandeur and worth ought to have been willing to have abdicated rather than to plunge it into the abyss , the hell of war . But there it lies to be ravaged by its de ? fenders and its enemies at will . For it there can be no victory , whoever wins . It is not only the laws which are silent between arms ; all intellectual and spiritual activities cease when men 's sole thoughts are to kill , to destroy , to immolate , to make a mockery of Christianity . A whole generation is to be wiped out ; the flower of the land between the ages of nineteen and twenty-four is to be sacrificed at a despotic ruler 's will ; perhaps another Goethe , a Schumann , a Helmholtz , are to be cut off in their youth ; all the talents these boys possess is certain to go for naught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful spectacle of human carnage the world has ever seen , ? by a sudden reversion to the stone age ; to preach thereafter the long outworn and blasphemous doctrine that God is on the side of the mightier battalions . If those of the Kaiser prove to be the better drilled so as to kill the greater number of their fellow human beings , intellectual Germany will not profit but will suffer thereby . A HATED NATION It is not merely that its spiritual growth has been checked and that the pursuit of knowledge is at an end . A terrible blow has been struck at Germany as the seat of wisdom . International bonds of infinite worth have been sundered not to be reunited for decades to come ; the Germany of calm , scientific reasoning has been submerged by the mad rush into a war in which the Kaiser has staked the Empire itself , as well as every achievement of the nation-builders of 1870 and of those who have erected the great commercial edifice which has been the wonder of the world . If there is envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these feelings give way to helpless rage , to bitter enmity , to dread and fear if the greatest of military machines should triumph ? Will not there be another Napoleon only a shade less dangerous than the overlord of a century ago , to inspire distrust and to court another Waterloo ? And if Germany is conquered and lies prostrate in sackcloth and ashes what endless humiliation will be hers ! What dreams of revenge upon all the world may not then fill the minds of those who so gaily set out to humble their sister-nations to East and West ? Is it not certain that whatever the outcome , Germany will for decades be the most hated of nations ? Every reactionary element in the German Empire , every privileged class , every believer in the divine right of the few who have obtained power , every militarist and imperialistic tendency will have been 336 THE AMERICAN RF  | strengthened at the expense of the liberalism and culture of Germany , ? a Germany burdened with a horrible millstone of debt , ? of which it can shift only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it wins . Here is precisely where a chief wickedness of the war policy lies . Nearly four million of German citizens have enrolled themselves in a party to belong to which the Kaiser declared at Essen a few years ago was to commit treason to the nation . These traitors now have been forced into the ranks , but the evils against which they protested are no less , their devotion to their cause is the same . They have fought imperialism at every turn , only to be bound and delivered now by the old snares , the old teachings that one 's country must be upheld in war time ; that it is proper to commit murder if one but murders by the wholesale , ? teachings that are to-day doing their anti-Christian work in England , France , Russia , and Austria as well . The cause of liberalism is the chief political hope of Germany , as against the rule of the Prussian Junker , the grasping landlords , the insolent tariff barons , a bigoted Catholic clergy as in Eavaria , and the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialist party than all their own leaders combined . It is not because of such government by the few , as some would contend , but in spite of it that the liberal , the cultured Germany of to-day is what it is . What might it not be if its intellectual freedom were to be typical of the freedom of the masses ? How much greater might not be the spiritual kingdom which it has built for itself under these conditions ? THE GERMAN MASSES ENLIST OUR SYMPATHY The masses of the Kaiser 's empire ! To them surely the sympathy of the world must go out as to the poor Belgians who have died about Liege without knowing why , realizing only that a hell of shot and shell had burst without warning upon them as lightning from the sky . On the heads of the German masses lies not the blood guilt . They come from smiling homes , from the castled hills of Thuringia , the vine-clad banks of the Rhine , the plains of Prussia , the poppied fields of Bavaria . They and their kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by favorable social legislation , held back by the heavy taxes imposed by the military Moloch , and by their three years of army service ; hampered in the cities by grinding poverty and checked everywhere by iron castes . Their villages have only just begun to grow , to give signs of a development corresponding to that of the cities ; to them have come at least the harbingers of social justice ; something of the prosperity of the nation was beginning to be theirs . But now the mother of every son between nineteen and twenty-four years must know her boy upon the firing-line , to destroy the sons of some other mother , ? because the " Triple " Alliance demanded it . For these solid peasants , the backbone of the country , war can bring nothing save woe and debt . Will it avail to tell them that the Slavic peril must be combated ; that in this worldwar Destiny speaks and that it had to come sooner or later ? Are they not inevitably to count the cost when the slaughter is over ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treason , " which dictates that such things shall not be ? Will they not turn to anyone who teaches that it shall be taken out of the hands of one man or a group of men to say whether a nation shall return to barbarism and slay the best that is in it ? For a German-American whose heart goes back to the country that gave him or his fathers birth there should be no difficulty in deciding where his sympathies should lie , if he be truly an American citizen . Sorrow as he must for the German masses , if he places reason above emotion and sympathy , he can but withhold his support from the Kaiser who approved in principle the Austrian ultimatum to Servia and made no better than a dicer 's oath the solemn promise of the Empire to respect the neutrality of Belgium . If he be loyal to the principles of this republic the German-American can only hope that absolutism has brought about its own downfall ; that this may mark the end of Kaisers , as of great armaments . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its men of peace , of knowledge , science and art , let him now pay the debt by being true to their ideals . He might well remember that Goethe himself faced a German army , when it had been beaten by ragged French republicans , to assure it that then and there a new epoch had begun . The immeasurable sins of the rulers of Europe and their militarists can only be expiated now by the beginning of a new epoch which shall mean that the masses shall be the kings of Europe as they are the rulers with us to-day ; that the last vestiges of feudalism shall be swept away to make room for government by and for the peoples .
