txt 8o A Brief f Course in the Teaching Process gives one the feeling of excellence or perfection of form , provided always that it is this beauty of the product which most engages the attention , and that interest in technique is subsidiary . To express the same idea in another way : if one 's knowledge of technique makes him overcritical or oversensitive , he is apt to lose all enjoyment in his concentration upon the technique , in looking for weaknesses , or in his feeling of discomfort because of imperfection . What significance , it may be asked , has this for our teaching ? Mainly this , that we must renumber that appreciation is in large measure a matter of the emotions , and that any attempt to over intellectualire the process will defeat the end we desire to secure . There is no other kind of work in which the attitude of the individual at the beginning of the exercise is as important . There is a story told of a teacher who wished to teach a beautiful poem , the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She began with the birds that the children knew ? sparrows . In a short time the children developed the notion , and very justly , that sparrows were a pest , that they had driven away our song birds , and that it would be a good thing to exterminate them . The children were ready to go forth to the slaughter ; and then came the poem with its admonition to kindness toward birds . These children would , of course , have been more impressed had this preparatory work been omitted entirely . Very frequently for work of this kind , the very best preparation is found in placing children directly in contact with that which you hope to have them appreciate . Read the poem , play the music , expose the picture to view , and allow them to do their work . Later a somewhat more detailed treatment , possibly involving many repetitions , will give opportunity for increased appreciation . Children should not be forced to give expression to the feeling awakened . The teacher may accept gladly such expression as comes spontaneously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part most enjoyed . Especially to be avoided are Lesson for 4pprecialion expressions such as : " Do n't you think this beautiful ? " " Do n't you enjoy this ? " and the like . Children under such stimulation are apt to say that they enjoy whether they do or not . They are just as anxious to do the right thing as are some of their elders . To be constantly directed , always told what to admire , means lack of confidence in one 's own ability to judge of excellence , or , even worse , the attitude of the hypocrite who admires that which he thinks it fashionable to favor . It is probably safer to judge of the success of work of this kind by the expression on the faces of the children than by the words you may persuade them to use . In a lesson of this type the teacher does the best work when she acts as interpreter . Success depends not so much upon initiative on the part of the children as upon the ability of the teacher to sympathize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to greater heights by the force of suggestion growing out of her own joy in that which she presents . It is by voice , by gesture , by suggestion , and by explanation , ? in all , by providing the most favorable opportunity possible for appreciation , keeping herself as much as possible in the background , ? that the teacher makes provision for the development of this power by children . Much is gained in power of appreciation by giving opportunity for creative work on the part of children . The group of children who have composed a song , and who have labored diligently to make the music which they have written fit the spirit and rhythm of the words , will find a new meaning in the lullaby which they are asked to learn to-morrow . Music will mean so much more than pitch , time , notes of different value , and the like . Through their own attempt they will have realized in the best possible way the fact that the music of the song is intended to express feeling in harmony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to draw a landscape will by virtue of that fact grow in power to enjoy the landscape placed on the wall for his enjoyment . And so for any other field in which we seek to develop power of apprecia-G A Brief Course in the Teaching Process tion ; to attempt to create for himself will give the child a better understanding of the elements which go to make up excellence , and the contrast between his own effort and that of the master will greatly enhance the value of the latter in his eyes . Thus far in our discussions of the lesson for appreciation we have interpreted it to mean the development of the aesthetic emotions . There is another sort of appreciation which involves rather more of the intellectual element , but which , so far as teaching method is concerned , may probably be treated to greatest advantage in this same connection . Indeed , there are cases , as in literature , where both elements are involved . In the study of a drama of Shakespeare we are concerned not only with the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of men and women as they have acted and reacted on each other in their common environment . In history we have this drama extended to include a nation or the nations of the world in their relations to each other . In either case we have the record of cause and effect , an account of social experience fundamentally akin to our own . Appreciation here involves the ability to follow the logical relations which are recorded . In proportion as one becomes aware of the motives which have actuated men , the relationships which have existed among them , the organization and outcome of their activities , he has widened his own experience . This possibility of a vicarious extension of the child 's social experience is one of the reasons for giving history and literature a place in our school curriculum . Let us inquire what is involved in securing appreciation of this type . Take , for example , the appreciation of the period just preceding the Civil War . I low are we to understand this remote situation ? We can not observe directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution of a problem in our present experience , gather data by means of observation ; nor can we test our conclusions by experiment . Our first great need is to have presented all of the facts possible . We may read the histoLesson // rian 's account , or have it read to us ; we may get hold of the newspapers published at that time ; read the debates which took place in Congress ; peruse the letters of men and women who lived and wrote at that time ; make inquiry concerning the number of slaves , and the value of the Southern plantations worked by them ; try to find out why slavery had been abolished in the North , and by every means possible familiarize ourselves with what men said and did and the conditions under which they worked at that time . We must have this material made accessible to the children through books or by word of mouth before we ask them to follow the logical relations established among these facts by the historian . Appreciation has its beginning in the abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are to work , and is consummated when the child has , through his own efforts and by following the development of another , come to understand the play of cause and effect , the organization and relationship existing among these human activities . Work of this sort has in the last step something in common with the inductive lesson , but with this difference , that the children are in the main concerned with appreciation of facts and of the relationships established among them by some one else , presumably the expert historian . It is more a matter of understanding than the discovery of new truth . Of course , there are lessons in history in which the problem is just as distinct as in any science , and where the work can be best described as inductive or deductive reasoning . And so likewise for literature . The author presents the situation , and draws his conclusions , supposedly true to the logic of human action . The teacher may need to supply details which are missing , may need to guide the children in their attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must he mainly interpretation of facts provided ; and presumably , if great literature is studied , the appreciation of the author 's interpretation of the human relations is of vastly greater im84 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process portance than the attempt at interpretation which the children may make . Appreciation does not mean quiescence , ? far from it . Neither does it concern itself primarily with the discovery of new truth or excellence . Rather we aim to understand , and to enjoy , when the rsthetic cmot.ions are involved , the work of the masters . If we can , even in some degree , lead children to think their thoughts , to interpret human activity and human feeling as they have interpreted i t , we shall have most signally widened and enriched t heir experience , and shall have made available for them for alit heir lives a source of recreation and enjoyment , a storehouse of wisdom , which may constitute their greatest indebtedness to our efforts in their behalf . 17 . CHAPTER VIII THE STUDY LESSON THAT it is the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be too often reiterated . To be able to reason clearly one 's self ; to have control of one 's habits ; in short , to know how to use one 's energies to best advantage when the problems of life are encountered , is the greatest benefit to he derived from education . We shall concern ourselves in this discussion with study as it involves controlled t h i n k i n g , whether inductive or deductive ; with the most economical method of making knowledge more available for use by increasing the possibility of recall ; and with the possibility of reducing certain knowledge or responses , whether physical or mental , to the basis of habit . In general , our problem in teaching children to study consists iii making them conscious of the best methods to be employed in logical thinking , or in the formation of habits , and then in giving sulticient practice in the use of these methods to make them the habitual manner of reaction , as far as this is possible . It is true , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of mathematics or geography may be swayed by prejudice when the question concerns politics or religion ; and that . the man who knows best how to form desirable habits may be so bound by some other that he will fail to achieve that which he knows to be desirable . Be this as it may , if the school makes the child conscious of the most economical methods of work , the chances for later efficiency are greatly increased . Strangely enough , what we have been prone to call good 86 // teaching has not always accomplished this desired result . It has too often happened that the direction and help offered by the teacher have tended to make the child dependent , utterly unable to do a piece of work for himself . Even when children have supposedly been required to do much thinking , the teacher has sometimes weakened her work by continually stepping in to propose the next step whenever a critical point has been reached . The argument which proves conclusively that children do not learn to work independently is found in their inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in the college to use their time to good advantage . ' In teaching children how to study , the first step involves a clear statement of the problem to be solved . The teacher who says " take the next five pages " can not expect that the children will do anything more , so far as learning how to study is concerned , than waste time in fulfilling her demands . We think hard when we have a problem to solve . If it be true that children need to have an aim clearly in mind when they are at work with the teacher , it is much more essential that they should have clearly in mind the goal toward which they are striving when they work alone . Whenever children are expected to do any work at their seats or at home , the type of assignment becomes a determining factor . It is a mistake to suppose that a minute or two at the end of a recitation will be sufficient to make clear to the pupils the problem involved in the work to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make assignments is when , as the subject is developed , a problem arises which can not then be solved . A good recitation ought to culminate in the statement of the questions yet to be answered quite as much as in a statement of what has been accomplished . If the class has been kept intellectually alert , there ought to be raised by the children 88 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process many questions , which maybe assigned either to the whole class or to individuals for report at a succeeding recitation . A very good incentive to study is found in making assignments to individuals or groups for report to the whole class . Even if the problem itself is not of surpassing interest , the desire to contribute one 's share to the group project , and the wish to do as well as one 's neighbor , will stimulate to greater effort . It would be well if teachers tested their own work and the children 's comprehension of the assignments made by asking frequeuntly during the study period for a statement of the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . to advantage , children must know what they seek . The attitude which we hope to develop should lead a child to ask , when in doubt , such questions as these : " What am I to try to and I out . from reading this chapter ? " " What any I to look for on the excursion ? " " What is the problem which we and now discussing ? " " Is the report which has just . been made to the point ? " " Did John 's answer have anything to do the question we are discussing ? " and the like . When children have learned to expect to work toward the accomplishment of some definite result in thought as well as in ; s lion , when they hold to the main issue regardless of the allurements of subsidiary problems which should be held for Liter investigation , when they become critical of the contributions offered by hooks or by their companions , then , and not . until then , have they taken the first step in learning to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aim or problem as an element . in successful study , and when their practice is guided by this consciousness , they will meet with another difficulty in learning how to secure the data adequate for the solution of the problem . Before leaving the elementary school , children should know how to use dictionaries , encyclopedias , gazetteers , year books , and the like . It is passing strange that college students often seem not to know // the purpose either of the table of contents or of the index in the books which they use . It is pitiful to see a person leafing through a book trying to find information on some question at issue , when in a minute he could find in the index just the page or section in which this topic is treated , and so spend the time gathering data instead of wasting it in a random search for the information desired . It is necessary to teach children to consult the indices and tables of contents of books , and to give them frequent practice in work of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . Another help to the collection of data might very well begin to be used in the intermediate grades of the elementary school ; it is the practice of noting , when more than one book or source of information is used , just where the information is to be found , and something of its nature . If the pupil consults more than one authority , the one read last may raise questions which must be answered by a return to those used earlier , and one ought to be able to turn directly to the sources formerly consulted . Or it may be that a similar problem , or one having much in common with it , will arise a week or a month later , when a record of the sources of information consulted before will lighten the work by half . A record of this sort could be kept in notebooks , or , as is done by older people who know how to work , in a card index . Of course work of this kind presupposes the use of some books other than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children the command of the technique of study we shall have to provide ourselves with more than a single book for a subject . Another way by which children can be greatly helped is teaching them how to take notes and how to annotate . There is no exercise more valuable to the student , so far as his future work is concerned , than practice in writing in a very few words the gist of a paragraph or page . As they reflect later , they may want to know the argument of this authority or that , but they must have it in condensed form or they will be little 90 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process better off than when they began their work . A very helpful exercise is to have children to abstract , either orally or in writing , a page or two of a book which they are studying , and to compare results . In this work the problem is that which confronts the thinker at . every stage of his work , the selection of that which is relevant . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think logically , among the mass of possible data we must always choose that which in our judgment is relatively most valuable for our purpose . The teacher in the organization of material for presentation in any subject is confronted constantly with the problem of relative values . Not all can be presented , even though relevant to the issue involved ; hence , choice must be made . And just so , if the child learns to study , to conduct his own investigations , he must be made conscious of this need of discrimination , and he must be given practice in its exercise . Adequate study demands not simply that an abundance of data which bear on the problem be secured , but that the validity of the c la t a be brought into question . Children ought not to accept blindly the statements of books or even of the teacher . The one thing which characterizes the student is his search for truth , his attitude f inquiry as opposed to an appeal to authority . I t is well for children at times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doubt . It is equally important , of course , that they be willing to acknowledge their mistake , should proof be forthcoming in support of the book . If a child really studies , he must , even as an adult. , find statements of fact , the records of observations or experiments , which are at variance with the evidence which he already possesses . It is just in this particular that the student differs from ordinary men who allow others to do their thinking for them . The student may not be able to settle the question , and so forms a judgment which is frankly tentative . Children ought to have the experience of finding that there are some questions to which a definite // answer can not , in the present state of knowledge , be given . They should be shown , wherever possible , how the conclusions of men on some of the most important problems that have been studied have changed from time to time . They can at times be made to realize the folly of overhasty generalization . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect upon his experience , whether the experience has been recently acquired with the express purpose of solving his problem , or is some more remote element in experience which may shed light on the question in hand . A skillful teacher can guide in this process of reflection , and will later tell them what is meant , and demonstrate for them something of the value of the practice . It is quite worth while for a student to know when he has concentrated his attention upon a problem , and just what is meant by reflection . Many older people deceive themselves into thinking that they are exercising themselves in these directions when a slight acquaintance with the elements involved in fixing attention or in reflection might awaken them to the futility of their practices . There need be nothing occult or hard to understand about the practice of study . It is not a matter of terminology nor of a systematic course in psychology , but rather consists in guiding the individual in his practice of the art , and then making known to him the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be enlightening to compare the emphasis upon careful examination of data , the formation of tentative rather than fixed judgments , the guarding against hasty generalizations , and the emphasis upon reflection with the steps of presentation , of comparison and abstraction , and of generalization in the inductive lesson , and with the corresponding steps of the deductive lesson . The conviction will probably be deepened that when the teacher instructs the student in the art of study she is making available for him the method which she employs in instruction . This must be the relationship ; for the teacher 92 A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process can do nothing more than take account . of the way the child learns , and adapt her method to his possibilities . The habit of verification is one of the most important from the point of view of learning how to study . The questions which the student must constantly ask himself are : " Can the conclusions be applies I ? " " I ) o they always hold ? " " Does it work ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction the originator of them may have found in deriving then ) . At every step in the progress of his thought the conclusions must be tested by an appeal to known facts . The teacher can not too frequently insist upon this step as the criterion of the worth of the thinking which has been done . And the insistence will he necessary , for it seems natural for human beings to become so enamored of their theories that they hesitate to expose them to the test which may prove them false . Teaching children to memorize : Throughout the school life of the chill , memorizing is a regular part of his work . If practice alone ? were necessary , every child should soon learn how to do Ibis kind of work icr the most economical manner . The great difficulty is that often neither teacher nor pupil has given any thought I o the met hod employed , their attention having been wholly engrossed with success or failure in achieving the result . It is ; c well established principle of psychology that . the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t hat which we wish to recall has been identi- , fled . The more associations nude , or the more perfect our control of any system of ideas which involves that which we wish to remember , the greater the probability of bringing to mind the fact when we need it .. As Professor James puts it : " Of two men with the same outward experience , the one who thinks over his experiences most , and weaves them into the most systematic relations with each other , will be the one with the best memory . " And along with this fact is another equally important for the teacher : that we may not hope to increase // the native power of retentiveness . The child whom we teach may be endowed by nature with little or much power of this sort , and we can not change it ; but we can improve his method of memorizing . The first step in memorizing is to understand . If we try to commit to memory the words of a book when we do not fully comprehend the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. upon our ability to remember the things because they have been once present in mind ; and our efficiency will depend wholly upon our quality of native retentiveness . But , unfortunately , for want of knowledge of a better method , children are frequently satisfied that they are doing adequate work when they are repeating over and over again the words which they have made little attempt to comprehend . Even when the sense of the words to be memorized is fairly clear , it is uneconomical to employ this method of accretion . The child who studies the poem by saying first the first line , then the second , then the first and second , then the third , then the first , the second , and the third , depends upon mere repetition , not upon thinking , for the persistence of the impression . It has been demonstrated that on the basis of the amount of time required this method is uneconomical . Add to this the fact that after the first complete repetition , later successful recall depends upon the efficiency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no doubt of the folly of such a method of procedure . It is no wonder that children who commit to memory in this way forget so readily . They may have understood what they said when they first repeated the poem ; but the method they employed almost precludes the building up of a system of associated ideas on the basis of careful thinking . If the child has read aloud and understands the selection to he memorized , the next thing to be done is to analyze it into its principal thought units ; and then each of these large units 94 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process of thought may be again carefully scrutinized until a full appreciation of the thought has been accomplished . The thought of the whole may then be stated , using as far as possible the words of the author , and then each of the subdivisions or thought units may be examined in more detail in order to get the shade of meaning that is brought out by this or that word , by relationship of coordination or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or phrase . It will be necessary , as the work progresses on the large thought units into which the selection has been divided , to return constantly to the whole thought in order to keep clear the relationship of the part to the whole , and to establish the part in the system of ideas which we seek to build up . " All the evidence we have goes to show that the method of memorizing by wholes is most economical . " If children were taught to work in this way , there would be little drudgery about memorizing . The careful , thoughtful study once completed , memorization has been accomplished . The energy and attention of the child have not been centered upon a merely technical process , but he has been concerned mainly in trying to appreciate fully the thought that he is to make his own . Memory work of this kind is highly educative , not merely because of the product , but also because of the process employed . Suppose , for example , you wish children to memorize Stevenson 's Bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night And dress by yellow candle-light . In summer , quite the other way , I have to go to bed by day . I have to go to bed and see The birds still hopping on the tree , Or hear the grown-up people 's feet Still going past me in the street . // And does it not seem hard to you , When all the sky is clear and blue , And I should like so much to play , To have to go to bed by day ? You would begin by reading the whole poem , calling to mind the experiences of the children in going to bed before dark on the long summer evenings and of the cold , dark winter mornings when they may have dressed before it was light . The number and the kind of explanations which will need to be made will , of course , depend upon the previous experience of the children and the time of the year . Then the poem might be read again a time or two . After this preliminary work has been done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us suppose that the reply was about as follows : " A little boy had to get up before it was light in the winter , and go to bed before it was dark in the summer . In summer when he went to bed he heard the birds hopping on the trees and the people walking past him in the street . He thought it was hard to have to go to bed when it was still daylight , when he wanted it so much to play . " If the main facts were less well told , or if there were notable omissions , it would be necessary to get at least an outline of the main thought before proceeding . Now we are ready to call the attention of the children to three main thoughts , each told in a stanza . First , the difference between getting up in winter and going to bed in summer . Second , what did the boy in the story see and hear when he went to bed before dark ? Third , how do you feel when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still so clear and blue , and you would like so much to play ? It will be very easy to get the thought of the first stanza Impressed in the words of the author . It will help to read the whole poem again , the teacher meanwhile asking the children to pay particular attention to the way the author says It . Possibly there will be some difficulty with " quite the other way , " but skillful questioning will get the correct form . 96 A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process And so for the second and third stanzas ; if the thought is clear , the words will follow very easily . After each thought has been thus carefully developed , with the whole story always in mind , and the words of the author have been made the vehicle of expressing the thought by the children , it will be advantageous to have the poem repeated several times by individual members of the class . In this repetition the dramatic element should enter as far as possible . To suit the action to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly to strengthen the impression , and thus aids recall . It may 1w thought that the illustration used was particularly well adapted to illustrate the theory advanced . Or some teacher may say that children would memorize Bed in Summer without teaching . It may , therefore , not be out of place to suggest that the best way to discover for one 's self the value of the method is to try it . It will work equally well if the subject is Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address , a selection from the Declaration of Independence , the Twenty-third Psalm , or any other masterpiece of English . The principles to be applied are essentially the same even when verbatim memorization is not required . To get lasting control of the facts of geography or of history , one must have reduced them to a system . There must be a relating of less important facts to more important , a clustering of important points of reference to any other facts which are logically related . This , indeed , is just what scientific organization means , and the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to save labor . The memory is relieved of much of its burden when once we have established the relationship of cause and effect , of equivalence , of similarity , or of analogy among facts . It is this association of ideas on a logical basis which counts most in the possibility of recall . It is quite possible for children , very early in their school life , to begin to apply these principles and to become conscious of the fact that the way they do their work has an important // bearing upon the ease with which it is accomplished and the permanency of the results gained . The work of the teacher is not done by merely dictating the method , even though that may help greatly to establish right habits of study ; our best assurance that the method will be employed when the teacher is not present to direct the work is found in our knowledge that the children not only habitually , but also when a question arises or there is a suggestion of another way , consciously employ the right method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to inquire how children may be led consciously to employ the principles of habit formation when their school work involves work of this type . They can be taught the function of drill or repetition , and can be led to see under what conditions such work will prove most successful . It is not difficult to prove to a boy that his listless , half-hearted work in repeating the spelling of the words he has missed is making little improvement in his ability to spell them . A boy can be led to see by an illustration in which he himself is the chief actor that concentrated attention will make much difference . Let him see how much he can accomplish in ten minutes , and thus get him in the habit of using this means when he finds that he is not working up to his normal capacity . Show him that a new impetus will be given and that attention will be easier if he reverses the order , writes instead of spelling orally , or closes his eyes and attempts to visualize the words . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making , he will welcome the suggestions which make the task easier . Later you can teach this same boy the need of verification before drilling himself whenever a question of fact is raised . In t he beginning , of course , the doubt or question will be raised by t he teacher , and it will be the chief work of the child to find an authority and assure himself that he has the right idea or form before proceeding . A big step in the education of a child has been taken when he is able to say , " I know I am right , because 98 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process I have consulted the commonly accepted authority . " Occasions will arise constantly in the- study of any subject where , instead of asking the teacher or being satisfied with information which is of questionable validity , the child should , as a matter of habit , turn to the authority for verification . It is not at all unusual for children to have misgivings , but they too frequently end by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doubts , to be somewhat critical , is significant for education only when one is led thereby to endeavor to discover the truth . ( ' children will work to advantage when they realize that these steps of doubt , verification , repetition , with undivided attention , are essential to good work . Children can be taught the necessity of accuracy in practice . Any day 's work in a schoolroom will furnish illustrations of the danger of lapses and the necessity of guarding against them . The fallacy of the notion that " this one does n't count ' ' can be made just as clear to children as to adults . So , too , the mistaken notion t hat cramming maybe substituted for systematic work day in and day out can be brought to the attention of pupils . It would be a good plan for every teacher to ask herself questions like the following : " What would the children do if I did not carefully direct their work ? " " How much better able are they now to work independently than they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take a book and find in it the part which bears upon the topic assigned for study , and do they do it with the least possible waste of time and energy ? " " Do they know how to memorize ; what it means to concentrate their attention ; how to reflect ? " " Are they more open-minded or more dogmatic on account of the year spent with me ? " " Have they established the habit of verification ? " " Do they appreciate the method to be employed in habit formation ? " To answer these questions honestly will give the teacher some idea of her success as a teacher , for the teacher 's goal is realized in proportion as her pupils have // advanced in power to work independently of her guidance or control . In teaching children how to study , it will be well to devote whole periods to this type of exercise . The teacher will gain much in the progress which her class will make by taking a period frequently during which she studies with the children . By example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of study and then making them conscious that they have done their work to the best possible advantage , rather than by telling them what to do , she will secure the maximum of results in her endeavor to teach children how do study . CHAPTER IX REVIEW OR EXAMINATION LESSON THE review or the examination , in so far as methods of teaching are concerned , present the same problem . We seek by means of exercises of this type to bring about a better organization of knowledge , to test the efficiency of our work by finding out whether or not pupils can , when put to the test , utilize the knowledge or habits which we have labored to make available for them , whether they are actuated by the ideals and purposes which we have sought to inculcate , whether they do actually employ the most economical methods of work when they meet a situation which challenges their strength . I t will be recognized at once that work of this sort is a part of every recitation . But for our own satisfaction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be imposed by those higher in authority , we may at times feel the need for a stated exercise of this sort . A review should mean a new view , a placing of facts in their true relationship . It should mean a clearer view of the topic or the subject which the children have been studying . It avails little to go over the ground that has already been covered more rapidly . The purpose to be accomplished is not to fix in mind a series of unrelated facts . In our discussion of memory we had occasion to call attention to the fact that recall of past experiences was conditioned by the number and the quality of the associations which had been established . And it is not simply a matter of recall . The use that we can make of a fact depends upon our ability to relate it logically to other facts . It is quite possible that a man of great native reten-lox 102 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process tiveness might be able to recall thousands of facts , and yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective action . To bring about such an organization of ideas demands that from day to day the new facts or principles that are learned be consciously related to the old . It will not be economical to put off all reviewing until the end of the month , or quarter , or term . The step taken in advance to-day can be properly appreciated only when it is seen in relation to that which has gone before ; and the work of the past week or month will , in turn , by this additional effort be seen in truer perspective . There are , however , convenient units into which subjects naturally divide themselves ; and when one of these units has been completed , it may be well to take a period or two for the express purpose of review . We may then clear up any misconceptions , give a chance for additional verification and application of the knowledge thus far gained . It can not be too strongly emphasized that the review which really counts is one in which the teacher works with the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment over them . There is nothing more disastrous to the best type of work than the idea on the part of children that the review lesson is the teacher 's opportunity to ask catch questions , or to overemphasize unimportant details . Children respond very quickly in such a situation by their endeavor to cram , with little or no effort at organization , all of the facts that they have been taught . A convenient stimulus to the proper sort of review is found in the requirement that pupils prepare an abstract or topical outline of the ground which has been covered , and submit it , preferably from memory , for class criticism and discussion . If the teacher asks questions , she should be very careful to see that they are questions of large scope which demand organization , or still better the application of organized knowledge . This brings us to the problem of testing . The only adequate test of school education , as of all other Review or Examination Lesson I03 education , is action . The nearer we can in our tests reproduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . Not that we can always have him actually present in the situation ; but when that is impossible , we can present for his consideration ideal situations which correspond to those which he will later find . The possibilities of presenting precisely the test which he will meet and is meeting in life are , I believe , much greater than most examiners suspect . We have discovered after many years that the best test of a child 's ability to spell in the only situation in which he will ever need to spell is to test him in that situation ; i.e. by judging his ability in writing words in connected discourse . The way to discover whether one can speak or write grammatically is to listen to him speaking or reading what he has written , and not to ask him to recite rules of grammar . The only real test of a child 's ability to give adequate oral expression to the story or poem is to see whether or not he can make clear the thought and furnish enjoyment to others , preferably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reads . We can assure ourselves that we have awakened an interest in literature and history , when we know that children read good books other than those which we compel them to read . The success of manual work , the time spent in art or music , ought certainly to be measured by ability to make and to decorate , the singing of songs , and the desire to hear music , or to see pictures . The more occasions that can be found for the application of the arithmetic we teach in actual measurements and computations which have real significance to children , the better will children understand their work , and the more certain we can be of their future efficiency . ' It is coming to be a recognized principle of nature study that the common things , the animals and plants which are significant for our living , are the ones which should 1 o4 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process engage our attention ; and we expect that children will , on account of the teaching , enjoy more , take better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animal life with which they come in contact . Even in such subjects as history and geography , one can hope to had just such applications while the child is studying as are apt to occur in his later life . The presentation of the results of the study of a country to a school assembly with the aid of pictures and a lantern , or the interpretation of current events in the light of their geographic setting will afford no mean test of the children 's knowledge of geography . The comparison of to-day 's happenings in the light of the events of a decade or a century ago ; the explanation of the historical reference in the period devoted to literature ; the writing and presentation of a historical drama , will afford as great application of one 's knowledge as most of us ever make . Work of the sort indicated above will not only serve to test the value of the work that children have done , but will also add greatly to the interest and enthusiasm with which children do their work . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of this we can be sure , the more work of this kind we do with our pupils , the firmer will be their grasp upon their work and the greater is apt to be their power to satisfy even less adequate tests . Examinations have another function which we as teachers should not overlook . Any adequate test of children 's abilities is also a test of our teaching . It will probably not be best for us to try to defend ourselves by pleading the inadequacy of the test , nor the backwardness of the pupils when they corrte to us , nor their parentage , nor any other less common reason . If children do not write as well as they should , if they misspell words they commonly use in their written work , if they can not tell the story , recite the poem , solve the problem , describe the geographical area , or relate the events of the historic period , we had better inquire whether we have helped them // to work to best advantage , whether we have clearly differentiated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods suitable to accomplish the desired result . There may be mistakes made , but , all things else being equal , the teacher who gets results is the best teacher . We shall do better work , children , teachers , and supervisors , when we have provided for our use more definite standards or scales by which to measure our results . There is no reason why we should not have a scale which would enable us to tell with a fair degree of accuracy just what the standing of this group of children is in writing , in ability to perform the fundamental operations in arithmetic , in spelling , in writing compositions , in discussing the geography of North America , in decorating a cover for a notebook , or in any other subject or aspect of their school work . Beginnings have been made in this direction , and we may hope for more as time passes . ' As these units of measure are perfected and applied in examining the results of school work , we will , of course , hear the cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher does can not be measured . The obvious reply will be that efficiency in accomplishing results which can be measured need not in any way prevent a teacher from exercising that influence or doing that sort of work which is not recorded on examination sheets . Rather it will be found , I venture , that the efficient teachers , as measured by the results which we can test , are , on the whole , the teachers that are doing the noblest work . Strength of personality , appreciation of child nature , a life which by its example makes for truth and beauty in other lives , arc qualities not uncommon in the teacher who is glad to be judged by the results which pupils can demonstrate . CHAPTER X THE RECITATION LESSON THE recitation lesson as commonly conducted consists in having children tell what they have read in their textbooks . Sometimes the teacher accepts or even demands that the pupils recite by repeating the words of the book . Better teaching requires rather that they render the thought of the author in their own language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy ends which may be accomplished by such an exercise , some of the common deficiencies in work of this type , and the modifications which are advisable in the light of the principles already enunciated . The recitation lesson commonly tests the pupil 's memory for facts . The questions asked and answered serve to reveal to the teacher the knowledge or lack of it on the part of the pupil . In a way this testing also gives the teacher some idea of the amount of work done by the pupil . The great weakness of work of this kind is found in the tendency to demand and to accept words , the rehearsing of facts unrelated and unorganized . Of course this need not be true , since it is entirely within the power of the teacher to frame her questions in such a way that the pupil 's grasp on the whole topic rather than his memory for isolated facts is tested . The recitation which tests the pupil 's ability to present in orderly fashion the substance of the thought found in the sections assigned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1'Ile topical recitation affords an opportunity to develop on the part of children the ability to stand on their feet and speak to a question for some minutes . And it may be suggested in this connection that we should develop more power of this sort 107 io8 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process than is commonly found in our schools . The ability to express one 's self adequately on the topic under consideration will always make for effectiveness in social life . It would be well to test the progress of our pupils from grade to grade by their ability to speak more effectively and for a longer period as they advance through the school , on some topic connected with their school work . When pupils are required not simply to recite on some topic which is presented for their consideration , but are required to furnish their own outline and to recite on the basis of their own organization of the selections which they have read , the recitation may become a valuable exercise in thinking . The success of work of this kind will depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work has been provided . It will not require much thought simply to follow the paragraph headings or marginal notes of the author and to present the organization as a basis for recitation . If , however , a problem has been suggested the solution of which may be found in the pages assigned for study , then the recitation may test the pupil 's power to analyze and organize the material which the book provides . And this is the only test of a thorough mastery of the book . We do not read to find out everything that an author says . Our needs may demand a very different ordering of facts , we may use facts in entirely new relations , and may ignore much that was essential from a different point of view . Children have read their textbooks thoroughly when they have derived from these texts the facts or ideas which are essential in the solution of their problem , the satisfaction of the aim which they hope to realize . This ability to use to best advantage a book is a very valuable accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifies its use . Too frequently we find adults who seem to feel that they must try to gather all of the knowledge and must try to follow none other than the author 's point of view in their reading . These persons read one book , // and , as a result , believe one theory . It seems not to disturb them greatly that the next book they read takes the opposite point of view and that they range themselves on that side of the question . Books are , or at least ought to be , our servants , not our masters , and in the handling of books in his regular school work the child ought to come to realize their true function . There is no greater proof of a lack of thought than the ready acceptance of whatever one finds in print . There is great danger in the use of textbooks that children and teachers will become satisfied with words , that they will come to think that the repetition of the formula of the textbook is proof of knowledge . Textbooks are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made frequently enough by those who possess a very wide knowledge of the field in which they write ; and by some strange process of thought they have apparently reached the conclusion that the way to make a subject simple is to condense it . Many of our most used textbooks are merely summaries or outlines of the subject treated . They lack richness of detail , and state conclusions instead of furnishing a large number of experiences , from which one may , through processes of logical thought , derive the generalizations of the subject . Take , for example , most of the textbooks in history for elementary schools , and read carefully upon any topic selected at random , and then ask yourself just what these words mean to twelve-year-old children ; or , better still , ask these children who repeat so glibly the words or reproduce the statements of the book just what they mean by the words they use . Try to discover whether they have any adequate knowledge of facts , or any command of images , which would make possible the generalizations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember that a textbook is not logical for children because it has been logically arranged by the scholar . The test is rather to be found in the pupil 's ability to reproduce in his own thinking the steps which have made possible the conclusions of the author . 1 to A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process Any wide-awake teacher can make her work more interesting and more significant for children , if she will carefully provide for the enrichment of the text . The sources from which data can be gathered , regardless of the subject under consideration , are almost without number . Especially to be recommended are the standard works in the subjects . It will be interesting to discover that children would rather read Parkrnan than to study the text in which some less competent person has endeavored to tell his story in a few paragraphs which mean absolutely nothing to the child . The magazines which publish articles of wide social interest will furnish much helpful material . There is no school that may not greatly enrich its work by an appeal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experiments . We need our textbooks as a summary , as a convenient condensed outline , or as books of reference ; but we must provide as best we can other books of reference which will furnish the details which are impossible in the limited number of pages allowed to the text . In every room of every school a library of books , pamphlets , magazine articles , and illustrative material should be found , and every teacher should expect to increase this collection and to improve its quality as the years go by . It will give new meaning to notebooks and note-taking , if both teacher and children realize that the books thus prepared are a real addition to the texts used . A comparison of the work done by different members of the class will add interest in the work . One of the greatest deficiencies of the recitation lesson is the danger that nothing new will be presented . It-is not intellectually stimulating to listen to others who repeat simply the thought with which you are already familiar . Where good notebook work is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stimulus to thought , through the presentation of new material , will greatly strengthen the work . A tendency in work of this type to accept vague and inT h e Recitation Lesson i i i definite answers is another argument against the recitation lesson which consists merely in rehearsing the words of the book . Statements are apt to be vague when ideas are vague , and we may not expect ideas to be very clear when the child lacks experience . The child 's power of expression , aside from the difference in original talent in this direction , is conditioned first of all by his acquaintance with things and processes . The recitation lesson , as it is ordinarily conducted , gives little opportunity for this sort of firsthand knowledge . To work at the sand table , to construct with wood , clay , paper , or yarn , to experiment , and to observe carefully the working of nature may mean more for the command of language than much more time devoted to so-called language lessons . But the effective use of such experience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher makes for adequate expression . The teacher who accepts the vague and indefinite answer encourages slovenly habits of expression and incidentally slovenly habits of thought . It is usually a mistake to say to a child : " I know what you mean even though you have not said it . " Children are often lazy enough to allow the teacher to do their thinking for them , if the teacher willingly accepts the burden . Thinking is necessary for expression ; language is the tool of thought ; we can do no greater service to children than to hold them for what they say , give them credit for the thought which they express and no more . Words for children , as well as for adults , are used to conceal ignorance as well as to reveal thought . A child is quick to take advantage of the teacher who will accept any sort of an answer and interpret it as a statement containing t bought . Indeed , it is possible that a child may even come to think that his incoherent statements , his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recitation lesson is found in the tendency to develop the purely individualistic attitude . If excellence consists in endeavoring to repeat more of the book z z z A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process statement than any one else , manifestly it is your advantage to hinder rather than to help others in their work . The attitude of excessive competition on the one hand , and of indifference on the other , are both avoided when children work together for common ends . The standard of the school should be cooperation and helpfulness . The recitation lesson in its least desirable aspects will not disappear until all of our teachers realize that teaching does not consist in baring lessons . The broader the training of the teacher , the better her understanding of child nature and of the meaning of education , the less likely is she to resort to this method to any considerable degree . We shall , it is true , so long as we use textbooks , take occasion to discover what use children have made of them ; but this testing will be incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . CHAPTER XI QUESTIONING IN all teaching much depends upon the skill with which the teacher stimulates and guides the class by means of the questions which she asks . Occasionally one finds a teacher who seems to think that the sole purpose of questioning is to test the knowledge of her pupils . She asks hundreds of questions which can be answered merely by an appeal to the memory . This sort of testing is valuable for review , but it does not necessitate thought . When a teacher habitually asks these fact questions , the children respond by trying to remember the words or the facts given in their books . A type of question still less worthy is the direct question ,  - -  the one that can he answered by yes or no . The teacher who asks , " Is Albany on the Hudson River ? " does not expect the children to think . If they are fairly bright , they will probably guess from her inflection whether the answer is yes or no . In any event. , after one guess has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers second often deceives both the teacher and himself into thinking that he really knew the answer . ' I'lie question which suggests an alternative is in effect the same as a direct question with its alternative answer of yes and no . " Does the earth turn on its axis from east to west or from west to east ? " is no better than to ask , " Does the earth turn on its axis from west to east ? " Indeed , the alternative question in the example given is worse than the direct form , since it suggests a wrong answer which may make sufficient impression to confuse the pupils when the question arises again . 114 a // The leading or suggestive question is much used by teachers who attempt to develop with children generalizations for which they have no basis in knowledge . It is perfectly possible to have children give some sort of expression to the most profound generalizations of science or philosophy , if one is only skillful in suggesting the answers which they are to give . As an example of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a teacher who thought she was having her children think about the growth of plants . " Did you plant your flowers where the sun would shine on them ? Do you think plants would grow in a very dark place ? What do plants need to help them to grow ? When the ground gets dry , what will you sprinkle on the ground to help the plants to grow ? What do plants need besides light to make them grow ? Would your plants grow if it was very cold ? What do plants need besides light and moisture to make them grow ? " If such a series of suggestive questions is asked , the responses will be prompt and the waving of hands most vigorous , but surely there has been very little necessity for thinking on the part of the children . This brings us to the crux of the whole problem . A question in order to be most stimulating must be of sufficient scope to demand that the experience of the children be organized anew with reference to the problem under consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ought frequently to ask herself whether her questions are of sufficient scope . If all the children can answer every question asked immediately , the questions have not been very successful from the standpoint of provoking thought . It takes time to think . The question of large scope will be followed , not by a wild waving of hands , but rather by a period of quiet reflection . The teacher who was trying to have her pupils t pink about the conditions of plant growth should have asked one or two thought-provoking questions instead of the larger number of suggestive questions . She might have put the fol1 16 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process lowing questions : What have you known any one to do to get good , strong , healthy plants ? Would it be possible to change any of these conditions and still have the best plants ? What is necessary for the growth of plants ? If questions similar to the above are asked , one might naturally expect children to relate and to compare experiences , in fact , to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts concerning plant growth which had been observed in their experience . If the teacher wants the children to get some adequate idea of a mountain , in their work in home geography she might tell them about it or read them a description ; but even after the best &script; ion she would want to question them in order to have them think about the facts which had been given . She might ask : I low long do you think it would take a man to walk to the toll of a mountain ? What would be the difficulties in getting to the top ? If you stood on the top and threw a stone , how far down the mountain do you think it would go ? To ask good questions takes careful thought and planning on the part of the teacher . A half dozen thoroughly good questions often make a recitation a most stimulating exercise in thinking , while the absence of this preparation on the part of the teacher not infrequently results in the ordinary listless class period , which may actually be harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well for every teacher to ask herself the following questions when she is dissatisfied with the results of her teaching : Were my questions clear and concise ? Did they challenge the attention of all the members of the class ? Did the children need to think , to organize their experience with reference to the problem in hand before they answered ? Was the sequence good ? Was it possible for every child to answer some of the questions ? Did each child have a chance to answer ? Did the children ask questions ? ? When children are active mentally , they will have questions to ask In asking questions much depends upon the novelty of the Questioning I I 7 form in which the question is put or of the issue which is presented . The writer has enjoyed asking several groups of teachers why they teach . The answers have been most varied , and on the whole indicate the real attitude of these men and women toward their work . A very different response is secured , however , when you ask the same groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess that they hope to realize the aim of education in their teaching , and that it is because they hope to participate in the development of socially efficient men and women that they teach ; always provided you have asked a question concerning the aim of education . The difference in the two situations is accounted for by the difference in the wording of the question . In the one case these teachers really asked themselves the question ? why do I teach ? They answered in terms of their experience . Some taught for money , some because it was a respectable calling , some for want of anything better to do , some because they liked children , and some because of their appreciation of the significance of education in our modern democratic society . In the other case , the answers were given in words conveying ideas which were supposed to be those most acceptable to the teacher . It is often helpful to state the opposite of the common expression of a generalization and to suggest that you are willing to maintain this point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induction and deduction was begun with the statement : " Induction always begins with a generalization and moves to the consideration of particulars . Deduction always begins with a particular and moves to a generalization . " The class was excited because the usual form of expression had been reversed , and , before the period was over , did some thinking about the commonly accepted definitions of induction and deduction . These definitions had really been nothing but a lot of words to juggle with , rather than the embodiment of clear ideas . This method of shock through the unfamiliar form of the question , or by means of a statement which challenges z z 8 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process attention because it is seemingly contrary to the accepted formula , is one of the surest means available to the teacher who would stimulate thought . It may be objected by some teacher that the form of question indicated . whew-gives little or no place to the necessary reciting from books ; that when one wants to discover whether the pupils have ; studied carefully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is to ask the fact question . In reply , it may be said that questions which call for the use or organization of facts demand not only the knowledge demanded by the fact question , but the more significant use of these data . It is true that some teachers still hear lessons . On the whole , there is too much telling of what the book says and too little teaching . The skillful teacher , in the assignment of her lesson , will give the children problems concerning which they can find information in their books . The recitation will demand the answer to the questions that have been put previously , as well as to such other questions as may be necessary in the development of these problems . If the book is to be given a larger place , the recitation may be topical . Here , again , the large topics which are assigned should demand not a repetition of the headings and paragraphs of the book , but rather the outline furnished by the teacher , or , better still , made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the text . There is little use in trying to furnish children with the knowledge of an encyclopedia . They will forget all except that which has become part of a system or scheme of ideas which have meaning and significance because of their organization . It is true that facts are the raw material of thinking , and it is equally true that those facts which have had some place in our thinking are the ones which we retain for future use . Aside from the form of the question , the teacher must consider the technique of questioning . One of the most common mistakes is to call on the bright children almost to the exclusion of the less capable . The writer has repeatedly followed closely // the distribution of questions among the members of a class , only to discover that often from one fourth to two thirds of the class were not called upon at all , and that generally three fourths or more of the questions were addressed to a very small number of children . Most teachers would find it interesting to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions assigned to each child . Such a score would help to explain the lack of interest and backwardness of some pupils . One hesitates to suggest that questions should not be given to the pupils in any regular order from the beginning to the end of the class by rows of seats or otherwise . Of course the teacher who does this notifies the members of the class that they need not be troubled about the work until their turn comes . Almost as bad , from the standpoint of maintaining the feeling of responsibility by the whole class , is the method of asking questions which prefixes the question with the name of the child who is to answer . When the teacher says , " George , will you summarize the points which have just been made , " John , Henry , Mary , Catherine , and all the rest realize that there is nothing for them to do . The teacher should rather announce her question , and then wait long in the question which is repeated . Children soon come to know whether they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may wait until the second or third statement before they will be called upon . There is another weakness often shown in repeating questions , viz. : the question is varied in form , which , in some cases , leads to confusion in the minds of attentive pupils , or the different forms used enable the child to guess the answer which is desired . To repeat questions is to acknowledge either that the form in which it was first put was not good or that the children were not expected to attend to the first statement of the problem . Either alternative will be avoided by a thoughtful , well prepared teacher . Ito A Brief Course in the Teaching Process The besetting sin of most teachers is the practice of repeating the answers given by children . If the recitation is a place where children are to discuss their problems together , then every answer should he addressed to the whole class , not to the teacher . The teacher who repeats each answer can not expect the children either to recite to the class or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lere is another chance for an interesting experiment . Score one every time you repeat an answer , and then try to see how soon you can eliminate this bad habit . It is often helpful to stand or sit in some part of the room not directly in front of the class . The fact that the teacher is among the class , one of them at least in position in the room , will make it somewhat easier for children to talk to the whole group . This habit of repeating the answer really grows out of the feeling which so many teachers have that the function of questions is to test for facts , and that in the recitation the answer should be addressed to the teacher and given by her to the class so that all may be made aware of the correct answer . The position which has been maintained is that the main purpose of questioning is to stimulate thought . Even if questions were mainly useful as a means of testing for facts , it would still be unwise to repeat the answers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asking of questions by pupils is unsatisfactory . If the children are thinking , really trying to solve the problem at issue , they will have questions of their own . If any single test were to be applied to the strength of the teacher 's questions , this would probably he best . Needless to say , the questions which children ask should , as a rule , be addressed to the class , or to some one member of the class , and not to the teacher . Some of the best lessons are those which end with children 's questions still unanswered , these problems furnishing the point of departure for the study which is to precede the next day 's work . If any one thinks that questioning is a simple matter , one that deserves less consideration than has been given to it , let Questioning I 2 I him sit down and write four or five good questions which might be used in teaching a first-grade lesson on the dog ; a fifth-grade lesson on the Southern states ; a seventh-grade lesson on making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravity . The teacher who will get some one to write down for her the questions which she asks in a single recitation will be surprised both at the number ( it will be almost unbelievably large ) and the quality of the product . There is nothing more searching than to attempt to write down beforehand the half dozen or more pivotal questions which are to be used in a recitation . When the attempt is made , any weakness in knowledge , in organization of subject matter , or in appreciation of the pupil 's point of view with relation to the material to be presented , will become apparent . There is no one thing that a teacher can do which will bring a greater reward in increased teaching power , than systematically to prepare questions for one or more recitations each day . If the writer could be sure that any group of teachers would try conscientiously to improve in the art of questioning , he would be just as sure that these same teachers would be rated by any impartial critic as superior to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of the teacher 's work . 1 22 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 6 . Why is it important to consider the form or the wording of the question you ask ? 7 . How can you challenge the attention of every member of your class by the questions which you ask ? 8 . Why is it poor method to repeat the answer given by one of the pupils ? g . Do your pupils recite to you , or to the class ? ro . When would you expect children to ask questions ? To whom should such questions be addressed ? rr . Criticize the questions used by the teacher in the following stenographic report of a high school recitation in English . A lesson on the old ballads has been given before . The text used was Seward , Narrative and Lyric Poems , pp. 20-35 . Teacher : Before we begin to talk about modern ballads , let 's see what you got from your first impression of the old ballads last time . In the first place , give four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Pupil : Fighting , principally , and some romance . Teacher : What do you mean by romance ? Pupil : Romance ? that is all . Teacher : People meant different things ? fighting , or love ? do you mean love ? Pupil : No , lighting  --  romance . ( Teacher writes on board " romance . " ) That is about all I know , in the first ? old ballads ; oh , yes , one gruesome one , about c ? . Teacher : ( ' orbies ? Pupil : Yes . Teacher : I lorror , perhaps . Pupil : Yes . Teacher : Flaworth ? Elsworlh : I t only happened once , ? lovers separated and met again . Teacher : Yes . ( Writes " Fighting , Tales of Horror , Shipwreck , Parted Lovers . " ) Is that a fair list ? I should think so . Let us see about the spirit in which they were written , that is , the kind of qualities the people in those ballads showed , and the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupil : I think bravery . Teacher ( writing " bravery " ) : Anything else ? Pupil : A hero and a villain . Teacher : Hero and villain ; in other words , you take sides ? Pupil : Yes . Teacher : What other qualities besides bravery ? // Pupil : Treachery , of the kind in the ballad of Johnnie Armstrong . Teacher : Yes , and the hero shows what quality ? Pupil : He believes in the king even when he is summoned before him . Teacher : Good faith on one side , and treachery on the other . Anything else ? Pupil : Honor . Teacher : Honor , yes . ( Writes " honor . " ) Pupil : A great deal of honor among themselves . Teacher : Loyalty to each other ; and as regards their enemies , what ? Pupil : They used to fight for fun , and they had certain rules ; they were not really angry , they had to keep certain rules . Teacher : In other words ? Pupil : They could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of honor even toward your enemy , a sort of amateur spirit . Pupil : Courtesy to their enemies . Teacher : Courtesy , ? and perhaps we might say this includes being true to the rules . Could we say anything about the style in which these poems were written , kind of language , and kind of verse form ? Pupil : Could be put to music . Teacher : Easy to sing , for one thing ? Pupil : Yes . Teacher : Complicated tunes , or simple ? Pupil : Simple . Teacher : How about the words , the English ? Pupil : Old English and Scotch . Teacher : Old English and Scotch ; easy or hard to understand ? Pupil : After you have read two or three , I do n't think it is hard . Teacher : If you had been an old Scotchman of those times , should you say they were written in hard or easy language ? Pupil : Simple , ? quaint . Teacher : Simple and quaint ? old-fashioned . Let us turn to the ballads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these old ones . The first one , Lord Ullin 's Daughter ? as regards the subject matter , is it the kind of story you think would appeal to ancient writers ? Pupil : It seems so ; this one was about an elopement , they seem to write that kind of story . Teacher : Anything else ? Pupil : Shipwreck . Teacher : Do you think the old ballad writers would have been satisfied with the way the story came out ? 124 A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process Pupil : I do n't think so ; they liked to see their side win ; the lovers won in this case , but were drowned ; I do n't think they would have liked it that way . Teacher : If they are going to get away from the father , they ought to get away clear . I think that is true ; things end simply in the old ballads , it is an out-and-out tragedy or a happy ending . Pupil : They had some death , like Johnnie Armstrong , where the hero was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : By treachery . Teacher : Was there any here ? Pupil : No . Teacher : Were they killed through anybody 's fault , or by accident ? Pupil : I3y accident . Teacher : I low is it in the old ballads ? Pupil : I n the first stories they were not , ? a shipwreck . Teacher : But in most cases it is a matter of somebody 's treachery . In Sir Patrick Spence who gets drowned ? Pupil : The Scotch nobles . Teacher : There it is the lords and all those other fine noblemen . As far as the style goes in Lord Ullin 's Daughter , should you say that the story goes rapidly , as rapidly as possible , or should you say that if an old ballad singer were telling the story , there is something that could be left out ? Pupil : I think so . Teacher : ( ' an you see any group of verses that could be left out without breaking the story up ? Pupil : I think where it described the boat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , A stormy sea before her ? When , oh ! too strong for human hand , The tempest gather 'd o'er her . " Those descriptions could he left out ; and ( reads ) : ? " For sore dismay 'd , through storm and shade , Ills child he did discover : ? One lovely hand she stretch 'd for aid , And one was round her lover . " Teacher : You think the picture of how she looked in the boat does not count ? Pupil : I like it , but it could have been left out . Questioning I25 Teacher : The old ballad singers would have left out that part . Are there things in the earlier part of the poem that could be left out if you just wanted the story ? Pupil : The first verse . Teacher : Better if they got started at once , perhaps . Miss Weiss ? Miss W. : The third verse : ? " And fast before her father 's men Three days we 've fled together , For should he find us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He says right after that that the horses are right behind him , so he could have left that out . Teacher : He spends too much time in talking to the boatman , that is true . Pupil : The seventh verse . " By this the storm grew loud apace , The water-wraith was shrieking ; And in the scowl of Heaven each face Grew dark as they were speaking . " Teacher : You ca n't help wondering why they did n't get in the boat , and stop talking . The old ballad writers pared it all down to nothing but the story . Turn to the next one , ? Lady Clare ; would that have pleased the old ballad writers ? Pupil : I think it would have . It is just the kind of love story they liked , ? it all turned out well . Teacher : Turns out well in the end ; and in it the lovers show what kind of qualities ? Pupil : Faithful . Teacher : You like that ? Pupil : Yes . Teacher : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable qualities of a good love story . I wonder if any one noticed the language of this poem , anything that would show that Tennyson was trying to imitate the language of the old ballads ? Pupil : " I trow they did not part in scorn . " Teacher : " I trow " ? that sounds old-fashioned . Anything else ? Pupil : The way he brings in the nurse : ? 126 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process " In there came old Alice the nurse , Said , ' Who was this that went from thee ? ' ' It was my cousin , ' said Lady Clare ; ' To-morrow he weds with me . ' " And " thee " and " thou . " Teacher : How about the word " Said " ; has that any subject ? Pupil : " Alice the nurse " is subject of both came and said . Teacher : Yes : anything else ? Pupil : The last of that verse , " To-morrow he weds with me . " Teacher : That sounds old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teacher : What line ? Pupil : " Are ye out of your mind , my nurse , my nurse ? " Teacher : And " Yet here 's a kiss for my mother dear , My mother dear , if this be so , " sounds like the kind of repetition a man would make on a guitar , or something like that . " ' Play me no tricks , ' said Lord Ronald , I ' or I am yours in word and in deed . Play me no tricks , ' said Lord Ronald , ' Your riddle is hard to read . ' " It comes again and again . When you come to Lucy Gray , a poem which was very famous , and which is , perhaps , a little hard to get the real spirit of at first ; did any one feel especially attracted by that ? Miss Graves ? What did you like about it ? Miss G. : It was entirely different from the others , ? the way it turned out , ? well , just the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to go easier than the others . Teacher : We have rather taken it for granted all along that all these were very easy , ? easy to sing . Pupil : I do n't think the later ballads are nearly as easy to sing as others . Teacher : You think this Lucy Gray is different , you like the descriptive verses in it ? Any special phrases or description that particularly struck you , Miss Graves ? Miss G. : I do n't see any just now ? Teacher : Any one happen to remember any ? Pupil : " The minster-clock has just struck two . " Teacher ; Miss Thibaut ? // Miss T. : " Her feet disperse the powdery snow , That rises up like smoke . " Teacher : " Her feet disperse the powdery snow , That rises up like smoke . " Would that be in place in one of the old ballads ? They were n't interested in the appearance of the snow very much . Miss Weiss ? Miss W. : I think I like this ballad because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you everything ; it does n't say surely that she is still alive , it leaves it to you to think about it . Teacher : Do you think Wordsworth himself thinks she is still alive ? Pupil : I think he does ; I do n't know if he does , but I think he does . Teacher : In this remote country region , the people who would maintain that she was alive would be ? ? Pupil : The country people . Teacher : What is Wordsworth 's attitude ? Pupil : I do n't think he credits it very much ; I think he respects it , but I do n't think he credits it . Teacher : He does n't tell you whether he expects you to believe it or not ; but at any rate , there is a fineness of feeling toward the country people that makes him respect the country superstition . Pupil : I think she must have been lost , because if she had n't , she might have come back to her mother and father . Teacher : Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't tell you out and out that she was drowned . Pupil : I think he does ; he says her footsteps stopped in the middle of the plank , and something must have happened there . Teacher : The actual drowning was not described ; you can not help feeling that in the old ballads they would have given you a full description , like Sir Patrick Spence ; the ballad ends how ? Pupil : Wordsworth was not trying to imitate the old ballads , was he ? Teacher : No ; it is a good deal further away from the old ballads than the others we have had ; it is a more imaginative poem , more beauty of phrasing and thought . Any other questions or comments about Lucy Gray ? Pupil : I like this verse : ? " They follow 'd from the snowy bank Those footmarks , one by one , Into the middle of the plank ; And further there were none . " 128 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process Teacher : You think that is because of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount to himself ? Pupil : Yes . Teacher : That quality of reticence , is n't it ? flow is it in modern times ; have you noticed how you respect people who do not say quite all they feel ; they keep their deepest feelings largely to themselves , and you can only guess at it by what is left unsaid ? Are the kind of people who are represented in this poem the sort of people you ordinarily encounter in the old ballads ? Pupil : I do n't think we do ; the chief characters were the nobles and barons , the highest people iu England and Scotland . Teacher : These people were what ? Pupil : Common people , Teacher : You get that from what phrase in the poem ? Any one ? Pupil : Just after he asked her to go for her mother : " At this the father raised his hook " ; he would n't have done that if he had n't been a working man . Pupil : I do n't think he would have sent Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been riding in a coach and four . Teacher : How is it with some of the other early writers ? Was Shakespeare more interested in common people or wealthy ? Pupil : Wealthy . ' The questions and answers quoted represent about two thirds of the work of a period . Note the number of questions , their scope , the amount of thought necessary on the part of the pupils , the explanations offered by the teacher , and the relative amount of talking done by teacher and pupils .

CHAPTER XII SOCIAL PHASES OF THE RECITATION EMPHASIS has already been given to the social aim in education . This chapter will discuss in some detail the possibility of realizing this aim through the conduct of the recitation . The real advantage to be derived from grouping children in classes is found in the opportunity which is afforded for exchange of ideas . A group of children seated with faces to the front responding to the teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomaly . The recitation is more than a place for the teacher to test the knowledge of the children , or to explain to them as a group some phase of their work with which they have had difficulty . It maybe well to inquire concerning the motives which operate , the activities present , and the results commonly achieved by the recitation . In many classes children seem to feel that the main purpose of the recitation is to please the teacher . Nor is the teacher 's attitude different . She praises or blames in proportion as the children answer her questions or follow her directions . Of course there are times when it is the main business of the teacher to test children or to direct their activity ; but more commonly it is the office of the teacher to work as a member of a group who are working together for the realization of some worthy end . Both teacher and pupil should be pleased when progress is being made in the work at hand because of the active participation of all of the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less worthy than that of pleasing the teacher . Children not infrequently are somewhat attentive to the work of the 130 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process class because they fear the punishment which follows failure . The more ambitious , on the other hand , come to look upon the recitation as an opportunity to display their superiority . They believe , and too often they are right , that the chief end of school work is to get ahead of some one else , ? to get a higher mark . In each of the cases mentioned , the motive is essentially individualistic . Better have the boy at work in order to please the teacher than to have him idle ; better use punishments and rewards and secure some results in knowledge and habits than to fail of these desirable ends : but the socialization of the boy and the maximum of intellectual activity for each member of the group can only be brought about in a situation which is genuinely social . What could be more natural than that children should ask each other questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in cooperation for the satisfaction of a common end ? This presupposes that they have a problem or purpose which is genuine . But that is only to assume that there is some real reason for intellectual activity . Or let us suppose t 11 ; 1 1 t he children are at work in order that the product of their effort may be used in some social situation . It is not particularly difficult under such conditions to get the liveliest kind of discussion , to secure the most earnest cooperation , or to have pupils themselves accept in a considerable measure the responsibility for progress in their work . This difference in attitude toward school work , if once established , is apparent in all subjects . The work of a class in reading or literature will be transformed when children work together to understand and appreciate its content . Instead of the complaint that John has lost the place , it will be discovered that he not infrequently has a question to ask , or that he can contribute an explanation . The writer has seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning a reading lesson as they were on the playground in inquiring concerning the games they played or the novel expeSocial // riences in which they were interested . The teacher had attained this result by making the children understand that they ought to ask each other questions when they did not understand the thought expressed in their books , and that one of the best ways to explain was to tell of a similar experience which they had had . In a class in nature study in a fourth grade a boy told a wonderful story of the activities of a squirrel . Ordinarily the teacher might have been expected to tell the boy that the story was untrue and that she did not want that kind of stories . In this class , however , the children felt responsible for the contributions which were made . The story had no sooner been told than the narrator was plied with questions . Where had he seen the squirrel ? On what kind of a tree ? What was the color of the squirrel ? Just when did the events related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally admitted that his story had a very slight basis in fact . The rebuke thus administered by his classmates probably did more toward giving this boy respect for truth than a dozen statements by the teacher that his contribution was unsatisfactory . In an eighth-grade class the children were discussing the panic of ' 73 . One of the boys maintained that the causes of panics were , in general , the same , regardless of the activities of a few individuals occupying important positions in government or in the commercial world . His contention was mainly that it was unfair to charge a president or a political party with the distress occasioned by a panic , when in reality the cause was to be found in economic conditions over which neither president nor party had control . One of the girls in the class objected , and cited as proof the panic of ' 37 , which she claimed was caused by President Jackson . The teacher could have settled the question immediately by an authoritative statement , which most classes of children would have accepted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class to participate in the discussion . In the 132 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process end the members of the class consulted textbooks and other more complete histories , and reached their own decision with comparatively little help from the teacher . The value of this work in history consisted mainly in the fact that the children , having once discovered the problem , felt responsible for its solution . They were engaged in the liveliest kind of thinking and discussion . They were learning where to go , and what materials to use in the solution of this kind of problem . Possibly work in the industrial arts offers the very best chance for group work . At every turn in work of this kind there is t he denurnm I for careful planning involving discussion of ways and means , and for cooperation in the execution of the plan . A group of second-grade children were occupied most profitably with the partial furnishing and daily care of the teacher 's rest . room . They had first of all to decide what they could do to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could make pillow , table , and couch covers , and window curtains , and that they could keep the room clean . In determining materials and design , as well as in the execution of the work itself , there was need for cooperation . The children gained not only in appreciation of some of the elements of home-making , but also in ability to plan and to work toget her . ' l'hey were being socialized both by the content of their work and by the method employed in executing it . Another group of children , fifth grade , spent a number of weeks working together in planning and building a playhouse for the first grade . A wide-awake teacher enlisted the cooperation of three grades in the making and selling of candy in order to get money enough to buy pictures for the school . The preparation of a picnic luncheon , or meal for guests invited by the cooking class , the making of a large rug from many smaller rugs woven in such a way as to contribute to the pattern of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing of the account of an excursion or other school exercise in order that // the best results may be brought together in the final account which is to be used in a school paper , are examples of the kind of work which may involve the kind of activity which makes for present social efficiency , and , therefore , for that social efficiency which it is the ultimate purpose of education to achieve . One of the best ways to transform the recitation from a place where lessons are heard to an active social group is to plan definitely for a variety of contributions from the individual members or small groups of the class . When each member of the class studies the same pages of the same book , there is little incentive either to try to tell well what the book contributes to the problem in hand , or to listen to the recitation of one 's classmates . If , however , one group of children have been referred to one book , another to a second book , and still another to a magazine article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some reason why each should do his best in reporting , and a genuine motive for following closely the contribution of each member of the class during the recitation is provided . Work of this sort is easily available in history , geography , nature study , or manual training . In the subjects which seem to lend themselves less easily to variety in assignment , many possibilities will be found by the teacher who is anxious to prove the efficiency of this method . The best reading that the writer has ever seen in a third grade was done by children who read to each other . They used the readers in the school and books from home and from the public library . Each child was permitted to make a selection and submit it to the teacher for approval . Then came the period of preparation , extending often over two or three days or even a week . During this time the child was supposed to study the selection carefully , learn the pronunciation of difficult words , and practice reading the selection so that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one good reason for reading aloud is to read to an audience who cares to hear what you have to offer . These children were participating 134 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process in a social situation which demanded much of them , and they enjoyed the hard work which was necessary because the motive back of it all was genuine . In arithmetic , if arithmetic deals with the quantitative aspect of the experiences which the children are having , it will be possible to allow for some variety in the work which is assigned . If the problems are real , there will be a considerable interest manifested by the children in the solution of the problem and the results which are secured . Suppose a class were given a list of the articles which are to be put in a Thanksgiving basket , with instructions to find the cost of the basket so that a friend may pay for one of the donations which the class plans- to distribute . In such a situation the children will be most eager to compare prices and total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course the carping critic will say that it is easy to devise a few cases of the sort listed above , but that in real school work you have n't time to make such plans . The only answer is that the difference between superior teaching and the kind that one sees all too commonly is found in the ability and willingness of the artistic teacher to be more nearly true to her ideals than are others . Any teacher , who is sufficiently interested , can find many situations in which she can vary the work of the class in such a way that the recitation period shall become a place where each member of the class brings his individual contribution . Possibly the greatest need in our schools to-day is for more purposeful work for children . We are so much concerned about the many things which children ought to know that we are tempted to spend most of the time drilling children on facts which have very little meaning for them . The demand that the school be socialized is only another way , of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school itself and in their lives outside of school . It has seemed possible , in a few schools , to give children opportunity in the industrial arts to work at making something which they really want for // themselves , or upon a project which may involve the welfare of the group , as , for example , when they work upon school apparatus or furniture . An eighth-grade group of boys made the furniture for the principal 's office ; the children at Hyannis , Massachusetts , make baskets , brooms , hammocks , raise vegetables , build a boat or a fence , as occasion demands . ' At Tuskegee the more mature students have even burnt the bricks and constructed , the buildings for the school . If a significant project in the industries is undertaken , it may furnish the motive for doing work along many lines . The raising of vegetables may involve arithmetic in the measuring of beds and the buying of seeds , in finding the value of the product , and , if the product be sold , in the keeping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well involve a visit to a farm ; the measuring of an acre ; the estimating of the cost of production of milk and butter ; and the return from the investment . The cost and means of transportation might be studied ; a churn , butter bowl , and paddle might be constructed ; and finally a complete account of these many experiences might be written and printed . If children are engaged in activities of this sort , there will be no question of socializing the school . By the very nature of their activities children will be led to question each other and their teachers ; they will of necessity cooperate in those phases of the work which involve team work . But it is not in the industrial arts alone that school work may deal with genuine situations . A good teacher finds a hundred situations in which children can write for an audience . The writer recently attended the closing exercises of an elementary school where the graduating class had composed a play which they presented . The main plot of the story centered in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the essays which were read were those which the children had written dui. - 1 36 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process ing the regular class work . In geography the members of a sixth-grade class prepared talks to accompany pictures thrown on the screen from a lantern . In history certain incidents of the period which a class was studying were dramatized and presented to the whole school . The president of a water company in a middle-western city told the writer that they kept things in better shape at the water works since they had agreed to allow the children to come to visit the waterworks whenever a teacher chose to bring a class . In the same city there is an unusual number of pianos in the schools , school playgrounds are being established , parents ' associations are active in cooperation with the teachers to improve school conditions . If one were asked to explain why the schools in this city are better , why they are so loyally supported and so proudly spoken of by all classes of people , the answer would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a closer relationship between the school and activities outside the school in home and city than in most other places . If teachers more commonly had in mind the needs of the children during the time they are not in the school , it would be easier to find situtions in which the school activities would be significant because of the genuine needs which are felt by the children . If there were nothing gained toward socializing children through activities involving the cooperation of the whole group , the fact would remain that the best type of intellectual activity can be secured only with this most genuine of all incentives . Most people , even as adults , think better when they have some one with whom to discuss the problem in hand . It is true , too , that often the best teacher is one whose experience is somewhat similar to bur own and whose attitudes and difficulties are similar to ours . Children can often interpret where teachers fail . It can not be too often reiterated that it is the chief business of every teacher to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at the end of any term 's work better able to work for themselves , more ready to take the // initiative , more capable in defining their problems , in gathering data , and in finding solutions than they were at the beginning of the period , then the work has been a failure . Creative work 1 is not done when some one stands over the child and dictates his eveiy step , nor does thinking consist in answering the questions which a teacher may put concerning the facts recorded in a text . There is entirely too much truth in the charge which is sometimes brought against our schools , that they fail to keep alive the intellectual activity which is natural to childhood . We must never lose sight of the fact that a child who is vigorous intellectually , actively sympathetic with those causes which make for the general welfare , and able and willing to work in cooperation with others , even though this may mean that he subordinate himself to others for the time being , is the type of individual upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . It is necessary to emphasize the social side of school life because we have , in our anxiety to impart information and form habits , neglected this aspect of school life . The pity of it all is that in neglecting the child 's social development we have done less efficient work in the fields we sought to emphasize because of the lack of genuine motive . Whether we are concerned with habits , with the acquisition of knowledge , with development in clear thinking , or in fixing ideals , the maximum of return will be secured in the genuinely social situation . Children working together on real problems are being socialized through participation in social activities . There is no other way in which the school can contribute so certainly to the accomplishment of the aim of all education . CHAPTER XIII THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF CHILDREN INTELLECTUAL development , and more especially intellectual efficiency , are conditioned in no mean degree by one 's physical condition . Schools have too frequently , and with justice , been accused of producing physical defects in children . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure take account of the hygienic conditions under which school work is done , as well as provide for the elimination or amelioration of physical defects . We now have open-air schools for consumptives , medical inspection , and dental clinics . There are some schools which provide school lunches at a nominal price or without cost to the pupils . Corrective physical training is coming to be recognized , along with special playground work . Everywhere appreciation of the importance of physical health as a condition prerequisite to intellectual vigor is leading those who have the welfare of the community at heart to demand that active measures be taken to protect and nourish the bodies of school children . It is the purpose of this chapter to indicate briefly the relation of teachers to this movement for physical well being . The demand that light be sufficient and that it come from the right direction is familiar to all teachers . It may be argued that teachers can not control the lighting of their rooms . The author has known teachers who have had blinds properly placed , walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Some teachers have even been instrumental in securing alterations in buildings or the erection of new buildings . Teachers who know that the area of 139 140 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process windows should be one fourth of the floor space , that the light should be admitted from one side of the room , and that it should come over the children 's left shoulders , may not be able to meet all of these conditions ; but they can do all that is possible to ameliorate defects , and can call attention to the dangers which the situation possesses for their pupils ' eyesight by giving or having given tests and making known the results . Modern school buildings are built with artificial ventilating systems . ' I'lhe success with which any system works depends in no inconsiderable measure upon the teacher . By opening windows in one room the efficiency of the ventilation of all other rooms in the building may be impaired . Failure to note the temperature may mean that children and teacher are suffering from a condition easily remedied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her room recorded on the blackboard , where every one can see it , at least twice ( luring each school session . Needless to say , the thermometer should be accurate , and , if possible , hung in the center of the room , not more than four or five feet from the floor . Teachers are responsible for right habits of posture . If seats need to be adjusted , the teacher should note the fact and notify the principal . Although special cases may demand expert advice and care , the teacher must hold herself responsible for the posture of t he majority of the class . Defects of vision may be either the cause or the effect of improper position of the body , and should bring from the teacher an urgent appeal for careful examination and correction . Frequent rest periods should be provided , the habit of correct posture insisted upon , and simple corrective exercises given by the teacher . Schoolrooms are not infrequently the center of infection for the community . Any teacher can insist upon separate drinking cups , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child appears with a rash , with an abnormal temperature , and not infrequently with only a cough , the teacher should appeal to the principal , the health inspector , or others // in authority for the elimination of the child from the group . The author has been in schoolrooms where two or three children in the incipient stages of whooping cough were allowed to infect the whole class . A school superintendent was distressed with what proved to be a veritable scourge of scarlet fever in one of his schools . Upon visiting the school he found one child on the playground proudly showing the other children how he could take flakes of skin from his arm . No one expects teachers to be expert diagnosticians , but any teacher should acquaint herself with the more common indications of childish diseases , and should act promptly when her suspicion is aroused , even though she prove to be wrong in half the cases . If anything is wrong , eliminate the child from the group , suggest that a physician be consulted , and await developments : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her activity in eliminating contagious diseases , the teacher may often be the first to detect deficiencies in sight or hearing . Children who are inattentive and apparently dull may often be found to hear indistinctly . A very simple test for hearing is to tap a pencil against a desk out of sight of the child , and ask him to tell how many taps he hears . Headaches , squinting , the position in which the book is held , often indicate to the teacher eye deficiency which parents have not suspected . Any child who gives indications of eye trouble should be tested by teacher or principal , and , if any indications of difficulty are found , the parents should be urged to consult a competent oculist . Dr. William H. Allen gives the following suggestions to teachers who would discover cases of adenoids and enlarged tonsils : 1 X42 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process " 3 . Stuffy speech and delayed learning to talk . Common ' is pronounced cobbed , ' nose , " ( lose , ' and song , " sogg. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding of the teeth . " 5 . Deafness. " 6 . Chorea or nervousness. " 7 . Inflamed eyes and conjunctivitis . " Any one who has known a child with a bad case of adenoids or enlarged tonsils , and who has followed the progress of the same child after the removal of the defect , will not think it too much trouble to insist that suspected cases receive the attention of a physician . In these cases , and where the child is suffering because of the ills superinduced by bad teeth , the teacher must work with the parents . Often through mothers ' clubs or parents ' associations , addressed by a physician and by teacher , the necessity for action , from a purely economic point of view , if from no other , can be impressed upon parents . I t. is possible that we shall have to resort to an appeal to private charity to save the child , or perhaps we shall in time have free compulsory dental , surgical , and medical clinics . The children are society 's greatest asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers should be most active in all movements which make for child welfare . There is no other group of people better acquainted with the needs of children , none other which stands in so strategic a position with relation to parents and the community at large . Parents should be taught the necessity of plenty of sleep , wholesome food , and clean skins for children . Better devote time and energy to this education of parents than attempt to teach children handicapped by the lack of proper living conditions . The anti-tuberculosis campaign , the pure milk crusade , the demand for medical inspection , should be earnestly supported , if not instituted , by the teachers of children . Health is not an individual matter . The welfare of the whole group is bound up in conditions which spell disaster for the individual . // Finally the teacher has a right to good health . Living under bad hygienic conditions , with children who are unclean and diseased , should not be demanded of any teacher . The efficiency of the work which the teacher does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her health . If it is true that the teacher may suffer because of diseased children , it is none the less true that a teacher in poor physical condition injures all of the children she is pledged to help . Happy , healthful lives for children and teachers is a condition which will be brought to pass when all teachers work for this end . CHAPTER XIV MORAL TRAINING CHARACTER building must always be recognized as a most important function of the school . It is a mistake to divorce the intellectual training of children from growth in morality . If our country demands increased industrial intelligence , the training of men and women for leadership in manufacture , trade , and commerce , much more must it demand citizens of sterling character . Industrial and intellectual supremacy can mean nothing to a nation unless righteousness prevails both in public and in private life . The idea that the schools of our democracy are to train for citizenship has always been interpreted to mean an education which will fit for a life of service to the best interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is barred from our schools , does not mean that we are as a people irreligious , much less that we undervalue the significance of the moral training of our children . School conditions offer advantages for moral training , even though the overemphasis on intellectual attainments may at times seem to give the teacher little opportunity for work in this direction . The fact of a group of children who may learn to work together , to help each other , to respect each other 's rights , to serve the best interests of the whole group , in fact a situation which demands just those virtues which are demanded in society outside the school , makes the . school in some respects an ideal situation for training in morality . Of course it is possible that the demand for intellectual attainment may so occupy the mind of the teacher that she will // I46 A Brief Course in the Teaching- Process resort to repression in order to get results in habits and knowledge . It is true , too , that the curriculum may be so narrow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of activity which best lends itself to the development of social virtues . But if adverse conditions hinder somewhat the work of the teacher , they can not deny a very important place to the school in the formation of character . The increased responsibility of the school for the moral training of children becomes apparent at once when the influence of the home and the church of to-day are contrasted with the strength which these institutions once possessed . Regret it as much as we may , neither home nor church is as potent in the development of morality as they once were . Before the dominance of the factory system the boy or girl who participated in the activities of the home gained in appreciation of necessity for cooperation and in understanding of his responsibility to the group in a way that is denied the modern child . To be a party to those industries through which food was secured , clothing obtained , and shelter provided meant the exercise of all of the social virtues . It was fitting under such a regime that the school should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under our present conditions the demand is insistent that the school provide , in some measure , through its curriculum , its organization , and by means of its methods of instruction , for the development of the attitude of responsibility , aid that positive morality which places a premium upon doing good . Let us inquire still more closely concerning the conditions under which moral training must be effected in the school . First of all there is the fact of heredity . The children with whom we work are different by nature , and nothing that we can do will make them all alike . Then , too , there is the added factor of training before the school age . Many children come to school with bad habits and low ideals . The one thing that every teacher ought to realize as fundamental in moral trainMoral // ing is the fact that differences in children must be met by a corresponding difference of appeal on the part of the teacher . Over against the differences due to heredity and previous training , there is to be found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect , inquire , emulate , sympathize , contest , wonder , are proud , and the like . This instinctive equipment furnishes the basis for actions which in turn become habits . The problem of the teacher is to use these instincts in securing desirable responses . Of course , undesirable responses have their basis in instinct . Here it is the business of the teacher to make the undesirable response result in discomfort , or , better , to substitute a desirable response . To be too proud of one 's attainment as contrasted with others may be unlovely , but to be proud of work better done to-day than yesterday is a positive virtue resting upon the same instinctive foundation . The teacher may be worried because of the imitation of that which is socially undesirable , but she may use this same tendency to react to produce the social graces . There are cases in which the attempt to substitute may fail , and the necessity for inhibition by accompanying the undesirable response by unpleasant results arise . The important thing is not to neglect this instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for moral development , and their neglect may result in lack of moral strength throughout the life of the individual . Besides the differences among individuals , there are differences corresponding roughly to stages of development . The authority which is accepted without question by children of six will be seriously questioned by the adolescent . Children grow not only in their ability to judge of the right action , but also in their demand that authority be amenable to reason . There can be no doubt but that rational morality is the type which the school should attempt to develop . To this end it is essential that the responsibility of children for their own 1 48 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process actions and for the welfare of the whole group should increase as they pass through the school . There is a possibility of controlling little children through fear , but the time comes when threats no longer avail . It is a sorry spectacle to see a mature individual who must still be controlled by fear of the results which will follow misconduct . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not result in arrested development in morality . The desire for social approval develops throughout the school period . When children or adults fail to see the reasonableness of a demand , this appeal to approval of the group may be most effective in securing desirable responses . The rule which the teacher must follow is never to appeal to a lower motive when a higher may be used . Fear , respect for authority , faith in the wisdom of the one directing , desire for social approval , ability to pick out the essentially moral element in the situation , and desire to act in accordance with one 's best judgment , - thus runs the hierarchy of motives which control . In any group some children can be appealed to by one motive and some by another . The teacher who is developing moral strength in the group will constantly seek to appeal to the children on a plane just higher than that which they have hitherto occupied . Another factor which plays an important part in conditioning the work of the school in developing morality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishes the basis for belief in the continued development of society . The progress that has been made , the standards once established , become the common heritage of the members of the group . Drunkenness is no longer considered gentlemanly ; we do not lie to our enemies when they have a right to know the truth ; our ideal of civic righteousness demands that a man be as honest when he serves the whole people as he is when he deals with individuals . The importance of this factor of environment in determining the moral ? // life of the individual is admitted even by those who emphasize most strongly the importance of original nature . For the school it gives hope because of the influences which may there be brought to bear upon the child ; and it adds a problem , because the school may not ignore the home or the street from which the child comes . It does not seem unreasonable to expect that teachers will at no far distant day become most active in all activities which make for better , cleaner , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a relatively small part of their waking hours . The physical condition of children and teacher has much to do with the possibility of effective school work , and training in morality is not an exception to the rule . There is not much use in trying to form moral habits , nor in asking children to form moral judgments , in a room filled with foul air , with the temperature above seventy-five . Poor physical condition on the part of the teacher is often responsible for lack of control on the part of children . A nervous , worn-out teacher is apt to nag , is almost sure to magnify insignificant acts , and by virtue of her lack of control of herself is in no position to control or instruct children . It would seem at times that we need medical care for teachers even more than for children . One child in poor physical condition may be hard to manage , and may fail to gain much either intellectually or morally from the school ; but one teacher in poor physical condition may do positive injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dyspeptic teacher may mean the formation of bad habits which it will take weeks or even months to eradicate . We are beginning to realize that there is a direct relation between hygiene and morality . The underfed , overworked , physically unfit are so frequently immoral that we had almost charged their condition to their immorality . In doing so we were often confusing cause and effect . However the problem may be solved so far as adults are concerned , we are satisfied that children of school age are entitled to happy , healthful 150 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process lives in so far as it is possible to achieve this result . The work done to secure better physical conditions , both in school and at home , is probably as significant for the morality of children as is any instruction that is given ; and such care for the physical welfare of children is the condition without which we have no right to expect them to grow morally strong . While all arc agreed as to the necessity for moral training in our schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used . One school advocates direct moral instruction by means of fairy tales , history , and other stories , and by moral precepts . The advocates of this form of instruction believe that . they can in this way make children understand clearly what is right , and because of the emotional reaction produced by talc or story the children will not only know the right , but will also want to do right . Those who believe in indirect instruction find in the regular work of the school , in the teaching of all subjects , as well as in the control of the children in school , the best opportunity for moral instruction . With regard to the direct method , it seems to the writer that it is assumed that " to know right is to do right . " So far as the emotion aroused by a story of bravery , or honesty , or temperance is concerned , the chances are that it will have entirely evaporated before any occasion for action is found . And right here is one very great danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused without any outlet in the corresponding action may result in developing individuals who are entirely satisfied with the emotion . They learn to delight in emotions , and lack efficiency in action . The time to tell the story of bravery is when bravery is actally demanded ; or for the child who knows the story simply as a story and without any attempt to use it to teach morality , the story may be referred to when this virtue is demanded . Likewise with the moral precept . For one who has had some experience in acting in accordance with his best moral judgment , the precept may be used as a significant generalization . Honesty may be
