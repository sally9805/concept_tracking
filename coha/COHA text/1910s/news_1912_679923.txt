txt Two remarkable and beautiful portraits by Gainsborough are placed on view today at the Scott &; Fowles Gallery . One is the portrait of the Duchess of Cumberland , of which the sale to Henry E. Huntington at the reported price of 8200 , - 000 recently has been announced . This lovely half length is one of the most exquisite portraits ever painted by the artist- The delicately formed head , with its high dressed hair , the small , spirited , red mouth , the slender hands demurely folded over a gauze start are painted with the utmost daintiness and sympathy . and the color Is both discreet and warm . In addition to its beauty , the portrait of the Duchess has a romantic history . It was shown in the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908 , together with the portrait of Count Rumford . now exhibited with it in the Scott &; Fowles Gallery , and the famous " Blue Boy , " owned by the Duke of Westminster . It had been well known and highly praised , and no word had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original condition . Presently It passed into the hands of Mr. Wertheimer for the sum of f20,000 . Mr. Wertheimer 's practised eye detected repainting , and before he bought the picture he felt certain that nearly all of it had been repainted , so that only the eyes , one hand , and the left shoulder showed Gainsborough 's own touch . These portions were so fine , however , that he paid the price asked , and forthwith sent the picture to a restorer to have the superficial layer of new paint taken off . The restorer was loath to take the risk , but the owner of the picture insisted , and when he finally got his way it was fount that the new paint rolled oft with the least possible difficulty and had served the useful purpose of keeping Gainsborough 's own brushwork in fresh and beautiful condition . The repainting , which was extremely well done , is accounted for on the ground that with the change of fashion the extravagant headdress worn by the lady became obnoxious to her and she desired to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In doing this the artist employed probably was drawn into a more nearly complete concealment of the original than he had intended to make . The portrait " before " and " after " ; was reproduced in The London Sphere before it came to this country , and the difference is seen to be nothing short of amazing . In its present aspect it 15 undeniably as brilliant and charming a piece of work as this greatest of English masters could achieve . The second portrait , that of Count Rum-. ford , has a special interest for the American public in the fact that the sitter was an American . It is amusing that the three portraits of Americans painted by Gainsborough should each have been a Benjamin  --  Benjamin Franklin . Benjamin West , and Benjamin Thompson , ( Count Rumford . ) Benjamin Thompson was a Massachusetts boy , horn in 1753 on a. farm . Having no liking for a farmer 's life he was apprenticed to a Salem merchant , and used his spare moments to such good advantage that before long he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate an eclipse . Later he studied medicine in Boston and later still taught school at Concord . When the Revolution broke out he received the military commission of Major ; but probably through indiscreet discussion of the appalling situation had aroused the ill will and suspicions of a certain body of officers , and though he demanded proof which was never brought of his alleged Royalist sympathies , life in America was made impossible to him . He went to England where he won many honors for various services . The Elector of Bavaria was so much impressed by him that he called him to his service at . Munich and the King of England granted him permission to accept the offer , at the same time knighting him . His great work in Germany was suppressing the system of beggary which at that time had attained huge proportions in Bavaria . He also turned an old hunting ground into the famous American park , near Munich , to which loyal American pilgrims still faithfully make their way . He said brilliantly : " To make vicious and abandoned people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them virtuous . But why not reverse this order ? Why not make them first happy and then virtuous ? " A great scientist , a great philanthropist. a great administrator , he was also ? charming and courtly gentleman of great elegance of manner and refinement of aspect . His portrait shows that the type was one particularly fascinating to Gainsborough , and the scrupulous drawing and thin glazes of pigment hardly concealing the outline beneath , are a joy to the connoisseur . The costume is the scarlet coat of a general officer of the British Army . and the splendid tract of intense color is so astutely managed as not in the slightest degree to overpower the sensitive beauty of the head . In the present day of high prices it is Interesting to note that the portrait brought more than any other man 's portrait of the eighteenth century school has ever commanded . To-morrow a third Gainsborough , the portrait of the young Viscount Downe , which belongs to an American collector , will be placed on view with these . It is a Gainsborough year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
