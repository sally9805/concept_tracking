 | The last decade of the past century and the first of this one were so rich in the discovery of papyrus manuscripts containing hitherto unknown portions of Greek literature that our histories of the literature must be revised or rewritten every few years . Christ 's History of Greek Literature has now reached its sixth edition . The prolific source of these new finds is Egypt , where for two thousand years they have lain buried either in the rubbish-mounds of her ancient cities or in the cartonnage of mummy-cases or within the coffin by the side of the dead to serve for his delectation in the other world . Here in their various hiding-places they have been preserved from disintegration and decay through the remarkable dryness of Egypt 's almost rainless climate . The dates at which the different papyri were written extend from the middle of the fourth century before Christ down to the fourth century of our era , the time when papyrus gave way to parchment as the usual writing material for literature . One of them comes from the age of Demosthenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written as far back as the end of the classic period . The value of these new discoveries is not only the intrinsic worth of the literature of a highly talented people ; they also reveal to us in some cases new literary types , like the pan and the nome , that before were virtually unknown . Six orations of Hyperides more or less complete came to light in Egypt between 1847 and 1890 . Before their discovery Hyperides was merely a name ; of his fifty-two speeches only a few short fragments survived . Yet his fame in antiquity was so great that many placed him above Demosthenes , the Rhodian school of oratory took him as its model , and Cicero mentioned him by the side of Demosthenes as an example of finished and polished eloquence . " If merits were to be counted , not weighed , " says the author of the tract On the Sublime , " Hyperides would stand far above Demosthenes . " Though he has grace and charm , beauty and simplicity of style , a natural and easy manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and grandeur of Demosthenes , and so must yield first place to him , but to him only among political orators . We are told that there was in Budapest in the sixteenth century a complete manuscript of Hyperides with scholia , which disappeared when the city was captured by the Turks in 1526 . All the more gratifying therefore is the recovery of some of his orations in recent years . One is a speech Against Demosthenes in which he accused the great orator of having received a bribe from Harpalus . The most important discovery is his Funeral Oration . This has a special interest and value because it is the only one of the extant funeral orations that was actually delivered : and , furthermore , it was esteemed by an ancient critic as perhaps the highest achievement of panegyric oratory . The only complete speech is the one For Euxenippus . The offhand and informal way in which it begins , " Well , gentlemen , as I was just now saying to those sitting near me , I am surprised that you are not already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy close , " Now , Euxenippus , I have done the best I could for you . It remains for you to entreat the jury , summon your friends , and bring your children into court , " illustrate the " careless grace " of Hyperides . In this speech and in his defense of Lycophron , he was pitted against the orator Lycurgus , one of the Attic Ten . The oldest and best of the manuscripts of Hyperides , and almost the last to be found , is a plainly written and attractive papyrus in the Louvre which contains his first speech Against Athenogenes , one of his masterpieces . His client had been tricked by the Egyptian Athenogenes , with the help of the beautiful courtesan Antigone , into buying Athenogenes ' perfumery business for the sum of forty minas , and found later on to his sorrow that he had taken over along with the business debts to the amount of five talents . He therefore sought to annul the sale . The year 1891 was the banner year for the publication of new finds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another speech of Hyperides , the one Against Philippides , Euripides ' Antiope , Aristotle 's Constitution of Athens , and the Mimes of Herodas . The last two were discoveries of first importance ; the recovery of either alone would have been a triumph . In the necropolis of the village of Gurob in the  | Fayum some mummy-cases made of layers of papyri pasted together came to light , and on being separated the papyri were found to contain , along with many non-literary documents of the third century B. C. , a fragment of the Phaedo of Plato and four columns of the lost Antiope of Euripides , going back in all probability to the same early date . Antiope , the daughter of King Nycteus , bore to Zeus two sons , Amphion and Zethus , whom she exposed at birth . They were , however , reared to manhood by a shepherd to whose hut she came in flight after many years . Her sons did not recognize her , and were on the point of tying her to the horns of a wild bull at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherd who she was , and they accordingly meted out this fate to Dirce . Their slaughter of Dirce 's husband , Lycus , the usurping king of Thebes , was prevented by Hermes , who , as the deus ex machina of the play , turned over the kingdom to Amphion . The most extraordinary literary discovery of recent years is Aristotle 's treatise on the Constitution of Athens , so highly reputed and widely known in antiquity . It was Tound on the back of a waste papyrus containing some old farm accounts of the year 78-:9 A. D. , written not by the hand of professional scribes but probably by private individuals . It is one of a series of one hundred and fifty-eight constitutions of ancient cities which the philosopher studied and described , and the only one of this number that has survived . It falls into two parts : the first is historical and records the successive changes that took place in the development of the Athenian constitution from the beginning down to the return of the democrats after the rule of the Thirty Tyrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens as it was in Aristotle 's own time and of the machinery by which it was operated . The first part is nearly complete and makes large additions to our store of knowledge ; the second , though more fragmentary , has behind it the authority and trustworthiness of the great Aristotle for the account of contemporary institutions of government , such as the council , the archons , and the law courts in Athens , and this first-hand evidence is of the greatest value to the student of constitutional history . Eight Mimes of Herodas amounting to some seven hundred verses came to light in Egypt . These are little pictures of  | Greek life , sketched vividly and realistically . They usually take the form of a lively conversation between two or three characters . The personages belong to the middle and lower classes ? the gossiping women , the fashionable shoemaker , the pander , the go-between , the scolding mother , the jealous mistress . The Schoolmaster will serve as a specimen . Scene , a school for boys . Lampriscus is the master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Metrotima . Drub this boy of mine , Lampriscus , till the soul of him , drat it , is left nowhere in his body but the lips . He has ruined me by playing pitch and toss . Where the door of the school-teacher stands , he can not tell ; but the gamblingplace , where street-porters and runaways take up their quarters , is so well known to him that he will point it out to strangers . His unhappy tablets lie neglected , but his dice are shinier than our oil-flask which we use for everything . As for spelling out a word , he does not even know his alpha , unless one shouts it five times in his ears . I am driven to call myself a fool for not making him a donkey-boy , instead of putting him to study in the hope of having a support for my declining years . But it 's no use scolding , for if we go on , he runs away from home , stays out three days and nights , sponging upon his grandmother , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squats up there upon the roof , with his legs stretched out , like a tame ape , peering down . Just fancy what his wretched mother suffers in her heart when she sees him there . I do n't care so much about him indeed . But he smashes all the roofing into broken biscuits ; and when winter comes , I have to pay two shillings for each tile , with tears of anger in my eyes . All the neighbors sing the same old song : Yonder 's the work of Master Kottalos , that boy of Metrotima 's . ' " ( Abridged from Symonds . ) The schoolmaster then proceeds to " lam into " him with a cutting switch of bull 's hide , and the boy cries to him to stop . Metrotima would have the flogging continue as long as the whip holds out or until the sun goes down . " I 'll shut your mouth up with a gag , " says the schoolmaster , " if you go on bawling . " " Nay , then , I 'm silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder me . " And here the whipping ceases . The next notable event was the discovery of poems of  | Bacchylides that had been lost for fourteen centuries . Previously only forty short fragments of his works were known ; in 1896 fourteen odes of victory like Pindar 's and six dithyrambs or narratives about the Greek heroes , aggregating nearly 1400 verses , were found in Egypt in a papyrus of the first century B. C. They add about 100 new words to the Greek dictionary , 90 of them being ornamental epithets . On two occasions Pindar and Bacchylides were commissioned to write triumphal odes in celebration of the same victory of Hieron at the national games , and the Syracusan tyrant seems to have preferred the simpler poetry of the easy and graceful Bacchylides to the rich splendor and lofty grandeur of Pindar 's odes . The sounder judgment of the author of the treatise On the Sublime , however , ranks Bacchylides below Pindar , ascribing to him uniform excellence and an elegant and polished style but denying to him the genius and imagination of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless a charming poet with an easy . flowing style , and he was numbered by the Alexandrians among the nine best lyric poets of Greece . Besides giving us another writer of odes of victory to put by the side of Pindar who previously stood alone here , the new find reveals to us the dithyramb , a species of lyric poem known before only from fragments . The dithyramb Theseus is in the form of a dialogue . This gives it a special interest , because in the evolution of Greek tragedy from the dithyramb there was one stage of the development in which the single actor carried on a conversation with the chorus , just such a conversation as we have between Aegeus and the chorus in the Theseus . Hence this , the only extant dithyramb in dialogue form , has high value in the study of the origin of the drama . Another poem , The Youths or Theseus , though broadly speaking a dithyramb , is in fact a choral paean to Apollo . It narrates an incident that occurred on shipboard when Minos was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens to be the prey of the Minotaur in the Labyrinth ? Athens ' tribute after her subjugation . Minos made advances to the maiden Eriboea , she cried out to Theseus for help , and he stood forth as her champion , setting his own descent from the sea-god Poseidon over against Minos ' claim to be sprung from Zeus , the god of the heavens . To prove his parentage Minos called  | on Zeus to send the lightning , and when it came he challenged Theseus to jump into the sea and in token of his kinship to Poseidon recover the ring that he threw overboard . Theseus obeyed at once , was carried quickly by dolphins to the beautiful abode of his father Poseidon , was there clad in purple and crowned with a wreath , and soon reappeared with the gifts of the god at the side of the swiftly speeding ship . Six new odes of Sappho have been recovered in a fragmentary condition . The first after much conjecture and restoration proves to be a prayer to the Nereids for the safe return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his reconciliation with her . This brother Charaxus had been bewitched in Egypt by the beautiful courtesan Rhodopis , Rosy Cheek , and had lived with her after ransoming her at a great price . Herodotus reports that Sappho rebuked him bitterly for his profligate life and for this stain upon the family honor , and we may perhaps have a part of this rebuke in another fragment recently found . In the ode first mentioned she makes reference to the cutting words she used in this poem , and she is ready to welcome him back with open arms , if he will turn away from his past and from Rhodopis . The remaining poems have to do with her pupils and girl-friends . In one she laments the departure of Mnesidice who has gone to live in Sardis , there to shine among the Lydian ladies as the rosyfingered moon among the stars . Sadder far to Sappho , as she tells us in another fragment , was the going of her beloved Atthis who left the poetess for a rival teacher . In another poem , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a vision in which Hermes , the conductor of the souls of the dead to the nether world , appears to her , and she tells him how she longs to die . In the opinion of editors and translators the new fragments have lines and stanzas that are equal to anything we have of Sappho , but even if they should not reach up to the high level of her best , they are at least Sappho 's , and that is high praise . The year 1897 marked the beginning of a series of unusually productive excavations in the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus , modern Behnesa , situated on the west bank of the Nile , 120 miles south of Cairo . Some low mounds here were found to  | be ancient rubbish-heaps that contained large quantities of Greek papyri , both literary and non-literary , dating from various periods from the first to the seventh century . The non-literary pieces include official and private letters , contracts , wills , proclamations , petitions , census returns , court records , and documents of every sort that belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a part , no doubt , of the archives of the government record-office that were cleared out from time to time , as they became valueless , and thrown on the rubbish-heap by the basketfull , sometimes basket and all . So plentiful was the yield that five more seasons , from 1902 to 1907 , were devoted to this lucrative field , and in the whole period the excavators , Grenfell and Hunt , dug up and gave to the world much new literature in addition to valuable manuscripts of works already known . One evening they came upon a basketful of broken literary papyrus rolls at sunset , too late to get them out that day . A strong guard was set over the precious treasure for the night , and next morning it was found to contain among other things three new pieces of literature . First , there were paeans of Pindar , that is. songs of supplication or thanksgiving ? a class of Pindar 's poems that was virtually unknown to us before , since only 12 short lines had survived . The new papyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Bacchylides , contains parts of nine paeans in forty columns of 280 complete verses . The second discovery was a part of the Hypsipyle , a tragedy of Euripides . The third was a new history of Greece for the years 396 and 395 B. C. , containing much additional information not recorded by Xenophon and Diodorus and an interesting digression on the Boeotian constitution . It plainly formed part of a large historical work of first rank , which some ascribe to Cratippus , others to Theopompus . No greater discovery has been made in the field of history since the finding of Aristotle 's Constitution of Athens . At another time during this season the excavators brought to light about 75 lines of the poems of a practically unknown poet Cercidas , and fragments of the Acts of Peter and of the Acts of John ; and in other seasons they found parts of two plays of Sophocles , the Eurypylus and the Trackers ; fragments of Satyrus ' Life of Euripides , written in a popular style and ,  | strange to say , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origins ( Aetia ) of the Alexandrian poet Callimachus , containing in part the well-known love story of Acontius and Cydippe , and also a fragment of his Iambs , which tells of an altercation that took place between the laurel and the olive as to the merits of each . A discovery made soon after the beginning of the excavations is of more than ordinary interest . It is a page from a papyrus book containing a collection of sayings of Jesus , unconnected in thought and each introduced by the words " Jesus saith . " Some of them are familiar , like that about the mote and the beam ; others combine a new with an old passage , like " Jesus saith , A prophet is not acceptable in his own country , neither doth a physician work cures upon them that know him ; " and others are entirely new , as , for example , " Jesus saith , Except ye fast to the world , ye shall in no wise find the kingdom of God ; and except ye make the Sabbath a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another papyrus leaf of the same date , the second century , containing other sayingsl of our Lord was found in February , 1903 . These bear a general resemblance to the former series , and , since they have an introduction ? " These are the words which Jesus the living Lord spake to . . . and Thomas " ? they are in all probability the beginning of an extensive collection , to which the sayings first discovered also belong . One of them , an uncanonical saying , " Jesus saith , Let not him who seeks . . . cease until he finds , and when he finds he shall be astonished ; astonished he shall reach the kingdom , and having reached the kingdom he shall rest , " has special interest because it is found in Clement of Alexandria as a quotation from the Gospel according to the Hebrews , and Harnack regards it as in substance a true saying of Christ . Besides these Logia or Sayings of Our Lord , two fragments of uncanonical gospels ' were found at Oxyrhynchus , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manifest to us , and when shall we see thee ? " and Christ 's answer " When ye shall be stripped and not be ashamed . . . ; " the other relating a conver- sation between Jesus and a Pharisee in which our Saviour emphasized inner purity in contrast to outer cleanliness ? plainly an effort of some late writer to illustrate the teachings of Christ in Matthew XV 1-20 and Mark VII 1-23 . Drama is well represented in the recent finds . About 500 new lines of Sophocles , nearly as many of Euripides , and more than 1500 of Menander have been recovered . Foremost among the fragments of Euripides is the Hypsipyle , a story connected with the expedition of the Seven against Thebes . Hypsipyle saved her father , King Thoas of Lemnos , and helped him escape at the time when the other women of the island killed the men . Later the Argonauts stopped at Lemnos on their way to Colchis , and by their leader Jason Hypsipyle became the mother of twin sons , Euneus and Thoas . But upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to flee for her life , and being caught by pirates she was sold as a slave to Lycurgus , king of Nemea . Some years later when the play opens she is the nurse of Lycurgus ' infant son . From her words we learn that her heart still yearns for Jason . Two travelers arrive at the palace in Nemea seeking shelter for the night ; they are in fact her own sons , Euneus and Thoas , searching for their lost mother , though she does not recognize them . Notwithstanding the absence of the king they gain admission . Meanwhile , events of great moment are transpiring : the Argive king , Adrastus , and the other captains who with him are marching against Thebes to resore Polynices to the throne have reached Nemea , and now the seer Amphiaraus comes upon the scene and asks to be directed to running water , so that he may make libation to the gods on crossing the frontier . Hypsipyle consents to show the way , and leaves the baby on the grass . In her absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer death , for , though she pleads that she is innocent of any evil intent , the queen turns a deaf ear to her . On her way to her doom , hopeless and alone , she calls on Jason , on her children , on Amphiaraus . At that moment the seer reenters and pleads her cause . He does more : he both convinces the queen of her innocence and he makes Hypsipyle and her sons known to each other . Furthermore , he proposes that the army give the royal child a public burial and institute the Nemean games in his honor . In his death the seer finds a  | presage of the failure of the expedition against Thebes . Such is the probable course of the plot of the Hypsipyle , as indicated by the fragments which are scattered throughout the whole extent of the drama . Of the Cretans , the Imprisoned Melanippe , and the other Euripidean plays that were brought to light , much smaller portions were recovered . It was a great piece of good fortune to find in Egypt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was previously only one extant specimen , the Cyclops of Euripides . The satyr-drama took its name from its chorus of satyrs or goats . It was a species of drama between tragedy and comedy , resembling the former in its structure and in having for the most part the same dignified characters , but approaching the latter in the liveliness of treatment and in handling such subjects as suited the coarser and more jovial natures of Silenus and the satyrs . In the exhibition of tragedies it was the custom to add to a trilogy or group of three tragic plays a satyric afterpiece , which was both closer to the primitive type of drama and more pleasing to the people by reason of its happy ending and its less serious nature ? a " frank concession to mere mortal levity , " says Browning . Such a play is the Trackers . The 400 lines that were found , perhaps as much as one-half of the play , are enough to enable us to make out the plot fairly well . Its subject is the theft of Apollo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only six days old ? the well-known story that is told in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes . The prologue is spoken by Apollo , who is engaged in the search for his stolen cattle and offers a reward for the capture of the thief . The god 's display of gold induces old Silenus to speed forth on the quest accompanied by the chorus of satyrs , the " Trackers . " These with heads to the ground like dogs on the hunt soon find the tracks of the cattle and follow the trail to a cave , but are surprised to find the footprints reversed . At the cave 's mouth they hear an unearthly sound and are panic-stricken ; it is the music of Hermes ' newly invented lyre within . Silenus reproaches them for their cowardice . Again the sound is heard , and the satyrs are about to flee in terror . Presently after repeated knocking , the nymph Cyllene appears and tells them of a new-born son of Zeus within who , though only six days old , has by a marvelously  | rapid growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single day invented a lyre from the shell of a tortoise and strips of cowhide . The chorus maintains that the cowhide came from Apollo 's cattle , and charges the boy with the theft ; Cyllene resents the accusation and stoutly defends him . The second half of the play being lost , one is left to conjecture , but it is safe to assume that Silenus and the chorus informed Apollo and claimed the reward , and that , as in the Hymn to Hermes , when the infant faced the angry god , he appeased him by giving him his lyre . In the plot as outlined humorous scenes are not lacking : satyrs playing the part of hunting dogs ; the mischievous pranks of the youthful god in stealing the cattle and backing them into the cave ; and the young thief face to face with the angry Apollo and ready to square accounts with him by the gift of the lyre . Besides the Trackers , small fragments of Sophocles ' Assembly of the Achaeans and of another of his plays , probably the Eurypylus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory knowledge of their plots . The comic poet Menander is undergoing a gradual resurrection in Egypt . Fourteen newly found lines of his comedy , the Flatterer , were published in 1891 , and sixty more in 1903 . This is the play from which Terence admits that he took the characters of the parasite and the braggart soldier in his Eunuch . A continuous passage of 87 verses from Menander 's Countryman came to light in 1897 . Of his play entitled the Girl with the Shorn Locks 51 lines were found the same year , and two parchment leaves of 61 and 60 verses a decade later . But the crowning discovery was made in July , 1905 , when large parts of four plays , amounting to more than 1200 lines , were uncovered in the foundations of an old Roman house on the site of ancient Aphroditopolis . In this papyrus there are 52 verses of the Hero , 517 of the Arbitrants , 320 of the Girl with the Shorn hocks , all but 48 being new lines , and 344 verses of another play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnected short fragments , now we have complete and consecutive scenes ; and , whereas the old fragments were preserved in most cases because they contained some general truth neatly expressed or some fine saying that suited the purposes of the anthologist , the new finds furnish us the material for estimating Menander 's ability in the construction  | of plot and the delineation of character . As was to be inferred from the plays of Terence , who borrowed from him so extensively , Menander wrote comedies of love and intrigue with plots that have little variety . As a rule they tell a story of illicit love or rape , of the exposure of infants who are later rescued , of separation and suffering , and , in the end , of the discovery of unsuspected relationships , often through the device of trinkets , then a general recognition and a happy solution , and finally marriage . It is rather in the delineation of character that Menander excelled , perhaps one should say , in the delineation of types of character , for , while some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find this friend and pupil of Theophrastus , the author of the Characters , painting types like the stock characters familiar to us from Latin comedy . No survey of Greek literature unearthed in recent years is complete that does not include a mention of the Persians of Timotheus , the poem on the sea-fight of Salamis , whose discovery in what proved to be the oldest extant Greek manuscript revealed to us the character of the nome , a species of poetry of which no example had hitherto survived . Since , however , an article was written on the subject in this magazine soon after the publication of the editio princeps , a repetition of the discussion here is unnecessary . " The British Museum had the good fortune to acquire in Egypt many of the papyri which contain the new portions of Greek literature that have been under consideration . Several of these treasures ? all the more valuable because in most cases there is no other copy in existence ? are placed on exhibition by the authorities of the Museum in a prominent place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who wishes to examine them . Here may be seen Aristotle 's Constitution of Athens ; the very part of the Herodas manuscript that has in it the Schoolmaster , of which an outline has been given ; Hyperides ' Speech against Philippides in a papyrus written in the first century before Christ ; the Paeans of Pindar ; the New Sayings of Jesus , those found in 1903 ; and , what is most striking of all , a long sheet of papyrus , perhaps 20 inches long , containing six of the twenty new odes of Bacchylides , one of those on exhibition being The Youths or Theseus .
