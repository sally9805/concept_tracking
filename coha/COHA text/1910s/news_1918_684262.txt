txt UNITY IN 1898 AND 1918 . The Kaiser Watching Our Election Then as Now . Mr. Tumulty , the President 's ? secretary , in reply to the men who criticised the President for his appeal to the people to give him a Democratic Congress until peace should be concluded between the Allies and the Central Powers , showed very definitely that President had made a similar appeal for a . Republican Congress while the peace conference between Spain and the ' United States was in progress . The motive behind the appeal of both Presidents was the same , to wit , that the enemy might not , by apparent discord here , be misled into prolonging the discussion of the final settlement . The differences in the circumstances of the two appeals are differences in the manner of their making , and in the magnitude of the issues at stake , and the respective progress of their settlements ' , with all the preponderance in favor of President Wilson . Mr. Wilson through the press issued his appeal to the people . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . That was in October of 1808 . During that month Mr. Theodore Roosevelt , the Rough Rider candidate for Governor of New York . was marking several speeches a. day , and he uniformly included in each of them an appeal for the election of Republican Congressmen and a Republican United States Senator , in order that President might have aupport . The ? Nvar with Spain was not a world in conflagration. la was fought with sixteen thousand soldiers ferried to Cuba over a water already freed of the enemy 's vessels , and not with two million men convoyed across three thousand miles of ocean beset by submarines . The future political position of the world was not trembling in the balance held above that peace table In Paris . And yet . enough was at stake then to justify the President in asking a support equal to that which Mr. Wilson asks now . Those appeals and that apprehension of a delayed peace adjustment were not regarded as sophisticated , insincere and partisan , nor accusative of the suspected loyalty of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in impa rtia lily , conducting with eminent fairness The Review 01 Reviews magazine , wrote in his November issue , published immediately before the election of Nov. 8 , 1808 : Congr-sa in unanimously supporting the President at the outbreak of the war , expressed the overwhelming views of the people of the entire country . The elections of this month ought to show all the rest of time world that the Americans are not fickle-minded and that they are still supporting the administration . The dilatory tactics of the Spaniards in the peace conference at Paris and In the evacuation confer . nee at Havana are to lye viewed with a good deal of seriousness . It might ? rove l'ev'y unfortunate if at this critical juncture the elections should seem lo writ against the President and his " Alg : ? rism " as a public issue is not undc , rstood in foreign parts , and if " Algerians " should defeat the Republican party this Fall the result would be InterpretA abroad as a condemnation of the war and its larger results . This would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would encourage the Spanish diplomats to protract the negotiations still more tediously , while seeking in every direction to draw other European countries into the controversy . And when the election was over his comment upon the response to President and upon the effect of that answer was partly in this paragraph , whiclt makes very- significant reading in this present juncture : It was evident that the Spanish peace commiss ; oners we're. making delay t Paris by Instructions front Madrid . There WfOi ** impresmou lit Europe that the nature of the demands made by the American pace commi. ; sioners might be considerably modified in case of a Democratic victuory on Nov . S. The first reports . Indeed . 01 the American elections as disseminated ' it Europe were to the . effect that the ' voters had condemned the administration Lunt were averse to the plan of having anything to do with the Philippines . ? ' ? Arrangements were made to have the German Emperor visit Spain on his way home from Palestine . For one reason or another his sensational Oriental visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely arranged that he was to aelept the Spanish Invitation and go to Madrid . Just what changed his plans at the last v.1:1 perhaps not be made public in our time . It is likely enough , hOWeVC1 ' . that the Hon. Andrew D. White , our Ambassador at Berlin . could throw some light on the matter if he Wc113 at liberty to do so . The implication seems to be that Ambassador White told the Kaiser tnat our November elections indicated unity of purpose . The Kaiser , having again returned from Palestine , nay again be waiting our November verdict . AUGUSTUS THOMAS . New York , Oct. 31 , 1915 . GERARD PRAISES WILSON . Former Ambassador Says Diplomacy Backed Up Our Battles . Former Ambassador James W. Gerard " made public yesterday a statement. , in which he urged support for President Wilson in his demand for a Democratic Congress . He declares his knowledge of German psychology led him to believe that the election of a Republican Congress would he interpreted in Germany as a defeat and repudiation of the President and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow Wilson needs no defense from me . He is a master psychologist . He understands human nature and human aspiration . He understands the German nature and German psychology . None can deny that his ability o interpet the ideals of men has givent him the pre-eminent place in world leadership . " His diplomacy , no less than the strength of allied arms , has broken the strangle-hold of Germany 's influence over her allies . Bulgaria 's American diplomatic representative is authority that . Wilson diplomacy prompted the surrender of his country . Wilson diplomacy has brought Turkey a supplicant to his feet , begging mercy . Wilson diplomacy is disintegrating AustriaHungary . " Wilson diplomacy will bring unconditional sun-enure- from Germany . It will dissipate the Germanic dream of rebarbarizing the world and it ' will annihilate the power and influence of all those who sought to . make such dreams realities . " Wilson diplomacy has heartened and strengthened that element in Germany which the allied press and public have looked forward to as one of the strong means of bringing about Germany 's military defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The people in all the world 's democracies approve the leadership of Woodrow Wilson , indorse his war record . and concur in his policies . The American people have now only one way of insuring an unhampered continuation of his world leadership  --  to comply with his earnestly and sincerely made request to elect a Congress upon which he knows and every one else knows he may rely , and from which he knows and you know he will receive unobstructed support for his and your war and peace aims . " An election of a Democratic Congress to support and stand by him is your only means of showing to him and to the world that you stand by year President . He deserves this wholehearted indorsement . Europe knows it . You know R. Germany knows it  --  but her rulers pray to their German Gott to move you to repudiate him . " I know that the German pre es would herald the defeat of a Democratic Congress as a defeat and direct repudiation of the President and his leadership . I know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . I know that their reaction would he to believe their unscrupulous leaders and censored prea ? when they were told that you had repudiated and disowned your President , and their instant and honestly-believed conclusion would be that you did it . because he made war on them and because yon did not believe in unconditional surrender . " Encouraging this belief , the military party in Germany would regain the ascendency and the German people would be galvanized into fighting resistance . " There is no long way around . The short wary is the American way . The President 's leadership must not be discredited in the eyes of our Allies or our enemies . " Party or no party , there is but one , course for Americans to pursue in this supreme hour of test - and crisis . Support the President ! Indorse him , support him , sustain him by electing a Democratic Congress that will stand behind him until America 's superlative and historic task is finished . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
