two young men strike a bargain and decide to go in ? to soap , not into the making of soap , but into the advertising of a soap that does not exist . The theory which occurs to them is that by setting up as rivals of the old man , whose notions of advertis ? ing are conservative , they can threaten his business and compel him to buy them out . They feel a cer ? tain official sanction from the whole American peo ? ple in attacking the soap octopus . There is in them the lovable aggressiveness of youth , a nimbleness and resourcefulness of mind which enable them by cajolery , swindling and lying , to collect enough money to begin business . In the second act the new soap company is em ? bodied in an office ; the blonde moustache is gone . Though no soap exists , a soap is being advertised strenuously by these two bright young men . They have plans for a factory which they do not intend to build , but which they do intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build . They are creating " good-will " and a trade-mark for a soap that costs a dollar a cake . At first no results show , and the financial situation is desperate . But they extricate themselves by such ingenious methods as passing bogus checks and swindling the other young Harvard man . The father enters , disturbed by the advertising campaign , and the son , to the immense amusement of everyone , proceeds to sell the " old duffer " the bankrupt fraud of a business . But the pretty stenographer naively gives away the truth , and the soap king departs unde ? ceived , leaving the bright young men to their ter ? rible fate . Then miraculously the power of advertising ap ? pears . In this darkest hour the great American public becomes clamorous for the dollar soap . The bright young men buy up some trust soap at three cents a cake and fill the first order . But the public is unsatisfied . Marshall Field 's agent ar ? rives from Chicago with a consuming passion for a mountain of soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does n't exist , the good-will , everything , at a fabulous price . The father is im ? pressed , and he , too , begins to bid . The pretty stenographer manages the deal and finally sells the " concern " to him for a sum which makes the audi ? ence purr . Advertising has done it . Advertising has created values which did n't exist , has made something out of nothing , turned wind into gold , a waster into a magnate , an empty fraud into a flourishing business . It is all very funny , with " lots of punch , " " lots of get up and go , " zip , flurry , American cleverness , all justified by the fact that the young man has " put it over . " The authors were not writing a satire , but a pane ? gyric backed by all the faith of Broadway . And they are as clever as the young men in their play ; they , too , have their little joke . " It Pays to Adver ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ment of advertising , and of the big national adver ? tisers . For on the torrent of dialogue there float bits of fact by which the names of the noisiest busi ? nesses , from Wrigley 's Spearmint to Boston Gar ? ters , are dinned into the ears of the audience . It is , of course , not traditional in play-writing to adver ? tise goods from the stage , to make their trade ? marks part of a drama . But that is what this play does . It pursues one step further the magazine policy of surrounding reading matter with publicity , and if the logic of the situation is developed we shall have Bibles with magazine advertisements , sermons in which mention can be purchased , and school-books garnished with Campbell 's Soup . It even occurs to me that I am serving the same cause in this article , for , as the press-agent says : " It 's being talked about that counts ; what is said does n't matter . " We are a good-natured people , and the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticize or you are a highbrow . You must under no circumstances confess that blatancy and cheapness lacerate your soul , for the virtue of Broadway is to be a good Indian . WALTER LIPPMANN . Limits of Cooperation THERE is no safer practical assumption than that not one of the " regenerative isms " is to have its way with the world . Anarchism , communism , individualism , socialism , with impetu ? ous variants like syndicalism , divide men largely on the line of temperament and partial experience . Each has its period of exclusive and romantic faith before settling to its task of working with other agencies which choose a different name . In the early nineteenth century some of the most pene ? trating minds held that individualism was to sweep everything before it . Migrations , and the growth of states made possible by technical changes in in ? industry and traffic , have shown this touchy ortho ? doxy to be wholly inadequate . Individualism has had to recognize other " isms . " Too much of theworld 's work must be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph , telephone , express companies and innumerable other " monopolies " drop under state control . It is not alone Panama canals , Alaskan railways , reclamation service , conservation , insurance against industrial misfortune , and the great issues of the public health which daily enlarge the functions of the state , but every addition to these new central ? ized powers becomes at once a reason why further tasks are thrust upon them . Precisely as money has been loaned to weaker nations with the provi ? sion that they buy goods from the lender , so great manufacturers are now quietly aiding city owner ? ship , even lending financial aid , in order to secure a market for their products . Without a shock the public listens to the Postmaster-General as he tells us openly what we may expect of the parcels post . If it carries eleven pounds it may carry twenty , an hundred , or a carload . Just as little are we sur ? prised to read from that past master in large finance , Mr. Perkins : " The Stock Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only way to restore confidence is to place the Exchange under control . " Sometime , when these government un ? dertakings have attained sufficient extent and var ? iety , the limits of desirable monopoly will appear . At present we are caught in this world-drift to ? ward an ever strengthening state control . It will prove expensive , but every forward-moving people is asking more of it . In the strictest sense this tendency is socialistic . It lessens the avenues of private investment and private adventure for profits . Among some forty peoples living under every imaginable form of gov ? ernment , this movement has been so steady as to stimulate the sectarianism of the socialist . The logic of his " ism " becomes a fatality . Because so many things are toppling toward government con ? trol , he reasons that everything will revert to it , and " government by the people , owning and demo ? cratically administering all the machinery of pro ? duction , shall come to its own . " Nowhere is there a solitary sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever socialism has gained in ? fluence enough to force it into positions of respon ? sibility , the cooler heads already know that every ? thing is not going to the state or the city . The ablest criticism of collectivist orthodoxy is no long ? er from without but from within . There are no ? where more intelligent socialists than those who have begun to tell us why everything is not going to collectivist control ; why socialism will reach its limits as well as individualism . We now know that socialism is to play a great and increasing part in the future , that its greatest service is still before it . It becomes droll only when it struts before us as a monopolist . Socialism has got to live with free and individualistic forces powerful enough and various enough to hold its excessive claims in check . There is also in individualism , anarchism , and communism that which will never be left out of any wholesome and vigorous society . Cooperation , too , has also been an " ism . " Its dreaming pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked to see it triumph in every field of industry . The proof is at last over ? whelming that only a portion of the world 's wealth-making and distributing will be done either by the " self-governing workshop , " which drops out the employer and takes all his risks , or by the far more important fellowship known as " consumers ' co. operation " of the Rochdale type . It is in this lat ? ter that the great strides have been taken , and yet in every country limits appear from within the movement itself . According to the earlier belief , competition was to disappear , all middlemen were parasites , and advertising was useless waste . At the very heart of this freer and more democraticbusiness it has been learned that competition is necessary , that many middlemen are as useful and as productive as the man who grows wheat , that much advertising is as strictly among the utilities as the baking of bread . Simply by long and success ? ful business experience cooperation has learned to distinguish between the huge abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their possible uses . With this discovery has come a new sense of cooperation itself . It , too , is learning to live with those who prefer a different name . Just as con ? sumers are becoming conscious of their power , just as they are learning to organize that power to their own advantage , they are learning also that perma ? nent centers of human interest exist which can never be identified with consumers ' interests . The interest of those who sell their product , the interest of the worker in his union , have their own antagon ? isms to men as consumers . Over them both the state is organized . In simplest graphic form it represents the circle within a circle . Every mechan ? ical and natural power which becomes the center of private privilege is being forced within that inner circle . It is the area of compulsion , of uni ? formity , of bureaucracy . It has the strength and the weakness of a strictly limited competition . The inner , socialistic line will become larger as certain big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are brought within it . Sometime we shall learn to subjugate these monopoly powers to public uses , thus preventing private persons from exploiting them , and then that enormous free outer area will be left for private business , private initia ? tive , experiment and adventure . A great deal of capitalism , in the sense of pri ? vate profit-making and hiring of wage-labor , will still go on outside the " socialized " circle . It is probable that a good deal of large-scale private in ? industry of the bolder , risk-taking sort will go on there also . With monopoly powers once under so ? cial control , these free activities will be safe . To ? gether with the thousands of cooperative associa ? tions , they will form the best counterweight and un ? privileged competitor to the bureaucratic lethargies of the state . Except through business affiliations with state and city , cooperation will have its chief activity and best growth outside the inner circle . With the stu ? pendous work done by the state , cooperation must compete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries in variable and more hazardous enterprises , and a growing number of those who are essentially artists in their craft . These more individualistic and even anarchistic types will not submit to group management . It is their gift and their strength that they will not co ? operate . I know a grocer who is one of the artists . It is his delight to have a small business ; not a family more than he can personally look out . for does he want on his books . " With a bigger trade , " he tells me , " I can not follow the individual taste of my customers . " No cooperative store can or ought to put that grocer out of business . He is twin brother to those industrial frontiersmen whose fun it is to discover and to satisfy some new and legiti ? mate want among men . It is precisely such benef ? icent limits as these that cooperators are learn ? ing to recognize . Indeed , just as it helps us to be free once for all from the fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social problem , it is no less a help to be able to see and to admit the limits within which industrial cooperation has to perform its part . The most telling popular criticisms against it lose their force when these limits are frankly faced . The demands of space exclude both illustrations and qualifications necessary to meet some obvious criticisms on the thesis here maintained . These re ? strictions may be met in part when we look further at cooperative experience in the United States and in Europe , and to the relation which the movement bears to capitalism and socialism alike . JOHN GRAHAM BROOKS . CORRESPONDENCE " Timid Neutrality " SIR : When a new periodical appeals to the public for support , it has a right to expect a clear statement of principles . An editorial in the second issue of " The New Republic " gives me the impression that this has not been given . If there is a field where at present clear ideas are needed , it is morality , and nowhere is this more vital than in the discussion of Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " treaties will never acquire sanctity until nations are ready to seal them with their blood , " I feel the Editor is making a statement the consequences of which he has not thought out . Is this a primitive view , or modern thought ? Both Germany and England are at present sealing their beliefs with their blood . Which does it prove to be right ? Neither ; it is a test like the trial by fire and other primitive standards . Treaties become sacred as they conserve the interests of both parties to the contract . They become a menace when they interfere with social progress . No amount of blood-shedding will make them sacred if the enforcement is to the interest of only one party . The Belgium issue is put in general form by asking , " Are we bound by agreements our grandfathers made ? " It becomes American when we ask , " If a careless city council bargained away the rights of the people in a perpetual franchise , are the people of succeed ? ing generations to be held by this contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , how ? " I wonder how we can have a " New Republic " without a clear enunciation of the moral principles on which it rests . Does , for example , the Constitution of the United States become sacred because we are willing to die in its defense , or because it conserves the interests and welfare of the American people ? If the latter principle gives its security , can we say that " promises are idly broken " if modifications in it are made to increase prosperity ? Is higher morality and social sanctity a blood bond or a bond of welfare ? To show the application of these facts to Belgium , I shall say that in 1839 the King of Prussia bound himself and his " heirs " to respect the neutrality of Belgium . In 1871 the German Empire was founded , which gave to the people a voice in the control of national affairs . The German Empire has never ratified this act of the King of Prussia , nor has there been any period since then when the German people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone knows that the economic welfare of Germany and Belgium are bound together . They form parts of one economic unit . Which view should pre-vail in the moral court , the economic or the racial ? I shall be interested in the Editor 's reply . I fear that his race feel ? ing got the better of his moral judgment . SIMON N. PATTEN . University of Pennsylvania . An Answer to E. P. H. SIR : The attitude of the Congressional Union , since it split with the National Woman 's Suffrage Associa ? tion a year ago , has been one of dignified and consistent silence in the face of persistent and sometimes vicious at ? tacks upon its every act . Nevertheless , I believe that as a member of the Congressional Union I may voice what I personally feel , at least , in reply to E.P.H. The National Suffrage convention has repudiated the Congressional Union , and E.P.H. may derive much com ? fort from this circumstance ; but the Congressional Union , with a large and fast growing membership , lives on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undeviatingly by the Union appeals more and more in its large vision to earnest and thoughtful support ? ers of equal suffrage throughout the country . The feel ? ing that through the Bristow-Mondell amendment , which provides without compromise for nation-wide suffrage , the vote can be obtained with the greatest ease and celerity , more and more prevails . It is for a " New Nationalism " for women that the Congressional Union is working . The States ' Rights doctrine of the Democratic party is unalterably opposed to this , therefore it is quite consistent that the Congressional Union should oppose the Demo ? cratic party . This policy has been followed only in the suffrage States , and by this means , for the first time the women of the country who are voters have been asked to assist in bringing the franchise to their sisters in the non-suffrage States . The campaign shows no Democratic ad ? vocate of woman suffrage lost to the cause by this method of attack , but rather an increased and insistent adherence to suffrage by candidates of all parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness in the attitude of members of Congress has resulted . E.P.H. has little ground for fear that a policy of opposition to a party endangers its ultimate support . Political history proves the contrary . I may also add that the assumption that New York State is the key to the situation is a shibboleth which is not sup ? ported by the history of the woman suffrage movement . M. S. O.
