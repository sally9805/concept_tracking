WITH its second number , that of July 13 , 1565 , the Nation opened its columns to communications from its readers , and from that time to the present the stream of letters dealing with an infinite variety of topics has never ceased . Rather , what began as a rivulet has in the course of years grown to a stream of impressive volume , has indeed overflown its banks and had to be turned into a new channel . For many years the letters to the editor of sufficient interest or importance to merit insertion in the Nation have far exceeded the space that in a paper of limited size could properly be allotted to them . Many have been returned to their senders ; many others , after achieving the dignity of type , have languished long in galley form , only in the end to find oblivion in the waste-basket because there was no room for them in the paper . The loss , unavoidable as it was , was unfortunate and was regretted by none more than by the editors , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing from various points of view , as among the most valuable and interesting features of the Nation 's columns . It is in order that a portion , at least , of this interesting material may not go to waste that we publish the present supplement , which it is intended shall set a precedent for others of a similar character to be published at suitable intervals . What follows represents a selection  --  for evennow it has been found impossible to print half of the material available  --  from the accumulated letters of half a year . Deliberately , in sign of mourning for past neglect , we have thought it well to omit the date lines . Often the context will betray the belated appearance of the letters , but the intrinsic interest of them , we think , is not affected by the postponement . At any time , for instance , we should find pleasure in the views of Sir George Otto Trevelyan on the reading of Latin as one of the consolations of old age  --  two subjects , surely , on which none is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer . Or again , Dr. Marshall 's and Prof. Hoernle 's discussion of aesthetics is not less interesting in December than it was in July , when the article that prompted the exchange of views appeared . No moment more than another is to be called " timely " for an unfolding of the delights of exotic Honolulu , and we are very sure that M. Bois would always find a sympathetic audience to listen to his apologia addressed to American womanhood . To those correspondents of the Nation whose communications even the heroic measures we have thought it well to take have failed to save from oblivion we can only make our apologies , begging them to possess their souls in ' patience and to continue to give the Nation the advantage of their views on whatever topics appeal particularly to their interest . Issues and Incidents of the War THE DIFFICULTIES OF PEACE To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sra : When the war is over the nations of Europe will make what will be called peace , but the fact that the armies will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permanent peace . It is , of course , impossible to foretell the details of the conditions of the treaty which will be made at the end of the war , but it seems desirable to state broadly what are the reasons which render doubtful a permanent and durable peace The chief reason may be put in a single sentence . No treaty of peace can be permanent which does not grapple fairly with the question of nationality , and it has hitherto proved an insoluble problem for European statesmen to deal with the actual conditions of Europeon life so as to recognize the claims of nationality without encouraging that clash of interests which in the end brings about war . Nationality is more frequently discussed than defined ; in fact , the difficulties of the question begin with the definition . It is clearly not exclusively conditioned by either race or language , and probably the best that can be said is that men belong to the same nation when they possess either a common tradition as to the past , or a common hope for the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do after them . Nationality thus raises life to a higher plane than that of the family or tribe , but falls far short of unity , so that to thinking men the existence of a world of many nations has at all times been a stimulus to visions of something higher . In theory , then , the world has long recognized the existence of , a higher unity , but unfortunately the numbers of those who have been so dazzled by the vision of a commonwealth of the race as to ignore the just claims of nationality have been about balanced by those to whom patriotism has seemed the final form of human virtue , and between them we have been apt to forget that the problem is neither the extinction nor the glorification of nationality , but its propel adiustmer in a larger system . Nevertheless , the problem has already had a long history . The earliest and the least satisfactory attempt at solution was the method of the Babylonian Empire , which endeavored to solve the problem by eliminating all the nations within the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylonian nation identical with the larger group . It proposed , in fact , finally to settle the question of international relations by having only one nation . The legitimate heirs of that line of policy , with results which have differed one from another only in the degree of disaster which they have met , have been , in the modern world , Russia and Turkey . The treatment of the Armenians by the one , and of the Finns by the other , are only the last examples , within the range of our own memories , of the way in which they have been faithful heirs of the heritage of Babylon ; for Poles , Ukrainians , and Jews in the north , Greeks , Bulgarians , and Wallachs in Thrace and Macedonia , Copts and Syrians in the south , unite in their testimony that the policy of Russia and Turkey has always been the same , even though there has been somewhat less brutality and a little more intelligence In the methods of the northern nation . Both have endeavored to solidify a great empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominant race on all the others . The experiment is now some five thousand years old , and it has always met with failure . More recent and as remarkable for its success , when it has been fairly tried , as has been the Babylonian plan for its failure , Is the experiment which was started by Rome , and- has been carried out by methods which differ only in detail by Great Britain and the United States . Each of these countries has endeavored to respect fully the different nationalities which go to make up the federation or the empire of the whole , and at the same time to prevent the rights of the Individual members of the groups from conflicting with the general common good of all . America and England have both made mistakes , both have not infrequently been ruled by politicians who have been ignorant of the real meaning of the tradition of the countries which they were called to govern , and both have committed some crimes , but on the whole they have no reason not to be proud of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , it has been rather from the failure to apply their principles than from any defect that was inherent in the principles themselves . Germany has for some time seemed to be wavering between a whole-hearted following of the Roman model and a relapse into the errors of Babylon , Russia , and Turkey . Against the treatment of Saxony and Bavaria has to be set that of the Poles in Posen and of the French in Alsace-Lorraine . But some of the recently suggested terms of peace raise the hope that the true Germany  --  not the Germany which destroyed Louvain and torpedoed the Lusitania and Arabic  --  will in the end join decisively with England and America and choose to follow the example of the Roman Empire . One of the good results of this war is the abundant proof that civilization is best and most strongly built up by nations which are united by the enjoyment of local freedom and the sentiment of loyalty to a common heritage of empire which binds them together in groups by chains , which , as Burke once told the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as iron bands , " while the opposite policy of distrust and coercion defeats its own object , and breaks down so soon as strain Is put upon it . If this were all , one might look forward with considerable hope to the future of Europe after the war , but in at least two districts ? Alsace-Lorraine and the Balkan kingdoms  --  the question is unfortunately complicated by the existence of nationalities which are not separated by geographical boundaries , but are , as it were , superimposed one on another . The truth is that  --  if the problem be not utterly Insoluble  --  the one thing which could solve it would be for both Germany and France to step aside from Alsace , and say in effect , " Gentlemen , it is your misfortune that the inhabitants of your country have two nationalities ; the triumph of one ? means the destruction of the other . We will both withdraw ; henceforth Alsace Is a new country ; forget that you have rival traditions as to the past , and learn to have a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither French nor German , but Alsatian . Though you speak two languages , that need not prevent your being one nation any more than it prevents Walloons and Flemings being all Belgians . " Such a policy might succeed , though it is doubtful whether the passions roused in Alsace-Lorraine by foolish rather than bad government for the last forty years could at once be assuaged . The position after the war Is more likely to resemble that in Ireland , where , though " strong government " and " coercion " have not succeeded in quenching the Irish spirit , It has so divided classes and districts that a united Ireland is impossible . Moreover , is there the smallest chance that either Germany or France would agree to such a scheme ? Certainly not now ; possibly after two years more of war if there be a neutral power strong enough and wise enough to make the suggestion in such a way as to " save the face " of both countries . Equally unfavorable Is the outlook in the southeast of Europe . In the Balkan kingdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to see how any permanent organization can be reached . The countries which have already been organized as self-governing entitles ? Rumania , Servia , Bulgaria , and Greece  --  have largely succeeded by a process of expelling the members of other nationalities , and many of these outcasts have been collected , though not united , In what used to be the Turkish provinces of Macedonia and Thrace , in which the confusion is made even worse confounded by the fact that the whole of the seacoast is dominated by a large and flourishing colony of Spanish Jews . How is this district to be cleared up satisfactorily , seeing that even small towns are occupied by two or three nationalities all animated by the strongest racial hatred ? They may unite in war , but they will always quarrel in peace . It will require a wise and united Europe to control them and to refrain from exploiting them as it has done in the past . It is for this reason that , although the treaty which will mark the end of the war will possibly pave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at least a chance that a great step will be taken towards the combining of nationalities , in larger groups , in such a way that a general policy of home rule will not exclude the central control of common interests , It will probably fall far short of completely solving the question of peace , because both in the west and in the southeast of Europe there are districts in which national distinctions and geographical boundaries do not coincide , and the common hopes which the inhabitants cherish are not for peace in the future , but rather for a successful war of extermination . Unless European statesmen have something better to suggest than any terms hitherto hinted at , we are not in sight of peace at the end of the war , but only of an armed truce . K. LAKE . Cambridge , Mass.WHO ARE OUR ENEMIES ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sur : The question as to whether we are against the Germans or against the Allies seems to have obscured the really more significant one as to whether it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is entirely pertinent to ask which of the two contending parties has shown anti-American feeling and developed anti-American activity . Have the Belgians , the Servians , or the Italians infringed our rights ? Hardly . Nor have the Japanese , the Russians , or the French behaved very offensively to us , in connection with the present war . Perhaps , also , it would be fair to say that Turkey , even though a mere tail wagged by the Central Powers , has been only slightly offensive in a direct way . There remain Germany ( of which Austria is , after all , a sort of protectorate ) and England . Which of these two has shown itself the more disposed to damage us ? England has interfer d . omewhat with our trade . Let that be admitted . We have lost , by her action , certain dollars . But we have lost no lives , not even of our men , let alone our women and children . And which indicates the greater hostility to another nation : to hold up its trade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance-sheet is a pretty conclusive one . The pro-German has his excuses and extenuations , or even his approval ; but here are the facts . Again , we have not suffered from England any infringement of our sovereignty on our own soil . That has not been questioned by word or deed . We have not had to dismiss any English diplomatic officers . We have uncovered no English plots against our domestic peace ; nor yet any attempts to foment external troubles for us . There are no English-Americans asserting their allegiance to an external Power while enjoying the privileges and immunities of American residence or citizenship . There are many Americans who are friendly to England ; but these are not hyphenates . The English have shown no disposition to extend a protectorate over us , as Dumba seems to have wished to do . Now comes the pro-German , insisting that there is reason for all these infringements , petty or enormous , in that we choose to go on doing what neutral nations have regularly done  --  making and selling munitions  --  or because we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be persecuted for making and selling munitions , we are being treated as enemies ; and if we are to suffer for thinking as we please , we are not free , but in so far vassals . Spying on other people is not generally considered to be a friendly occupation . Well . the Germans have been spying on us , we now know , in a most thorough , systematic . and efficient way . Have the English done this ? And who has spent gold for our discomfort ? If the English have succeeded in subsidizing our newspapers , then they must either have found a paltry and scurvy lot of American editors ( unless they have put in their own creatures ) , or else they must have made very serious inroads upon their resources ; otherwise they could not have succeeded so well . For , at the rate of expenditures met by the Germans , and to little purpose , in order to enlist the Huertas and others , the British successes , not to ruin the Empire , must have been easily purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we have property destroyed , there lives ; Though the author of original works also , he is especially entitled to the gratitude of both nations for having made one of the most prominent of modern English writers  --  and one of the most peculiarly Anglo-Saxon and un-French in spirit  --  a household name in France . M. d'Hunaieres was a cosmopolitan and a traveller in all lands , but England and her empire had a special attraction for him . He had often visited British India , and had a profound knowledge of it . Not only by his translation of Kipling , but by studies of British Imperialism , such as his book entitled " L'Ile et l'empire de la Grande-Bretagne " ( 1905 ) , he took rank in that band of Frenchmen who have done so much by their pens in recent years to disseminate a knowledge of British thought and ideals in France , and to remove the prejudices which for centuries have stood in the way of a real entente cordials . When war broke out , M. d'Humieres was appointed to what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anglo-Indian contingent in France . But the spirit which made Kipling 's tales of daring and heroism congenial to this Frenchman turned out to be more than a purely literary one : and last March he begged the Minister of War to give him a more active role , with the tragic result for Anglo-French civilization recorded above . A. F. BRUCE CLARK . University College , Toronto , Canada . The War in Literature ROMAIN ROLLAND ON WAR . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sra : A correspondent of the Nation has done well to quote Romain Rolland 's " JeanChristophe " in connection with the European war . Surely no recent reader of that great novel can fail to have been impressed with the Insight of its author into precisely those national characteristics and ideals  --  halfgrasped hitherto , or wholly misunderstood by most Americans  --  which have been revealed so strikingly by the present conflict . Unlike Bernhardi 's work , " Jean-Christophe " is not conceived in the spirit of prophecy . Yet in chapter after chapter Rolland anticipates subjects of discussion and conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prophetic character of the work has remained so long unnoticed . But if Rolland is to be quoted now , the weight of his authority must not be thrown into one side of the scales alone . It would be possible to cull from his pages a formidable anthology of anti-French passages , like the one quoted by Mr. Mendelson . But to do this would be to follow the method pursued by the makers of French readers for the German schools . Your correspondent will doubtless remember that in the case of JeanChristophe this piece of Prussian foresight failed . " The German editors had selected those pieces of French literature which seemed to establish by the testimony of the French themselves the failings of the French and the superiority of the Germans . But they had no notion that what they most exposed to the eyes of an independent mind like Christophe 's was the surprising liberty of those Frenchmen who criticised everything in their own country and praised their adversaries . " " I can not help seeing the arguments of my enemies , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is with Rolland himself . Not the least admirable quality of his discussion is the intellectual detachment  --  so rare in these days , even among neutrals  --  which enables him to see the strength and weakness of both peoples with an impartial eye . A defender of Germany who calls Rolland to witness has invoked a dangerous power . Against the passage describing the cult of force by a recent sect of Frenchmen , we may put this searching analysis of the alliance of militarism with philosophy and idealism in Germany ( English translation , Volume I , page 565 ) : They were people who had not the strength to love or hate , or believe or disbelieve  --  in religion , in art , in politics , in daily life ; and all their energies were spent in trying to reconcile the irreconcilable . Especially since the German victories they had been striving to make a compromise , a revolting intrigue between their new power and their old principles . The old idealism had not been renounced . There should have been a new effort of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forgery , with making it subservient to German interests . Like the serene and subtle Schwabian . Hegel. who had waited until after Leipzig and Waterloo to assimilate the cause of his philosophy with the Prussian state  --  their interests having changed , their principles changed , too . When they were defeated , they said that Germany 's ideal was humanity . Now that they had defeated others , they said that Germany was the ideal of humanity . When other countries were more powerful , they said , with Lessing , that " patriotism is a heroic weakness which it is well to be without , " and they called themselves " citizens of the world . " Now that they were in the ascendant , they could not enough despise the Utopias a la Frangaise . Universal peace , fraternity , pacific progress , the rights of man , natural equality : they said that the strongest people had absolute rights against the others , and that the others , being weaker , had no rights against themselves It was the living God and the Incarnate Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , and oppression . Force had become holy , now that it was on their side . Force had become the only idealism and the only intelligence . Even more interesting than this is Rol-land 's insistence on certain essential qualities of French national character which the world has now learned no longer to deny . Christophe has inherited the traditional German view of the French as " a clever people , skilled in practical things , amiable , talkative but frivolous , susceptible , and boastful , incapable of being serious , or sincere , or of feeling strongly  --  a people of pathos , much gesticulation , exaggerated speech and pornography . " And in the first weeks of his residence in Paris he sees much to confirm this impression . Later he learns that the France which he has seen is but the surface . Through the friendship of Olivier he comes to know and admire the true France . " You are all the same , " Olivier tells him . " All your countrymen who come among us see only the parasites who suck our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their minions and their hangers-on and their harlots ; and they judge France by the wretched creatures who prey on her . Not one of you has any idea of the real France living under oppression , or of the reserve of vitality in the French provinces , or of the great mass of the people who go on working , heedless of the uproar and pother made by their masters of a day . " In the France now revealed to him Christophe discovers surprising qualities . " Instead of a gay , sociable , careless , brilliant people , he saw men of a headstrong and close temper , living in isolation , wrapped about with a seeming optimism , like a gleaming mist , while they were in fact steeped in a deep-rooted and serene pessimism , possessed by fixed ideas , Intellectual passions , indomitable souls , which it would have been easier to destroy than ' to alter . " In a later passage , describing a war scare , Rolland anticipates some of the most striking lessons of the actual outbreak . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk with victory , and the absolute incapacity of German statesmen to understand other races " " The great mass of the German people had nothing at all to do with the provocation . They were shocked by it . The honest men of every country ask only to be allowed to live in peace ; and the people of Germany are particularly peaceful , affectionate , anxious to be on good terms with everybody , and much more inclined to admire and emulate other nations than to go to war with them . " Under pressure of impending war , all the discordant elements of France fly together ; and the friendship of Olivier and Christophe , whit they had thought to be established above national prejudice , comes near to disruption . " Yes , " said Christophe good-humoredlY , when the storm was passed , " I have seen you all united . . . . It 's a fine thing to feel the mighty torrent rushing you along , and the demons that were let loose in your hearts . " " They terrify me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than have my people united at such a cost . " J. H. HANFORD . Chapel Hill , N. C. D'ANNUNZIO AS AN ORATOR . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The latest book of Gabriele d'Annunzio* is a collection of some fifteen short speeches made in Genoa and Rome in May , 1915 , during the days that just preceded Italy 's declaration of war . They are all patriotic exhortations to the people to take arms and redeem the provinces of " Greater Italy " still under the tyrannic rule of Italy 's traditional enemy . The moment is one of unique historical importance ; the speaker is the most famous Italian writer of to-day ; what , then , is the result ? D'Annunzio made his literary debut as a poet , and it is as a poet , one may venture to say , that he will survive . His novels , noteworthy for their poetic diction , are chiefly interesting for their variedly pictorial digressions . In plot , in solid substance , they cantheir splendid Italian , but can not be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best he has to show , and many of them seem to have a beauty , a significance , that may make them permanent , if not popular . For d'Annunzio 's poetry is too elaborate , too learned , his subject-matter and treatment too often undesirable , to make for universal appeal . His style is all too often sonorously in- ? Per le plu Grande Italia. , Grecian ' e Message . di Gabriele D'Annunzio . Milano : Trevea. 1915. comprehensible  --  which is more a defect than a quality ! And exactly such defects mar the eloquence of d'Annunzio as an orator . Lengthy similes , taken from some obscure corner of classical history , involved sentences , the use of words so archaic or so new as to be totally unfamiliar to the average listener , an all-pervading affectation  --  these are the things that prevent d'Annunzio 's speeches from being the epoch-malting literary fragments one might have hoped for . One great advantage in these orations is , however , that the very subject naturally precludes anything like the decadent treatment to which we are unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly expect to find the supremely dignified restraint of a Lincoln , we do find that in these speeches ( the most wholesome writing he ever did ) . d'Annunzio is exceptionally chaste and restrained . Only in one place does he allow himself to descend to vulgar invective . The value , then , of this book , quite apart from the political influence of the author 's eloquence , lies entirely in his patriotism and in his diction . His patriotism , unquestionably sincere , is with him a passion  --  and passions were ever with him the chief interest in life . His diction , inspired by so noble an inner fire , reaches indeed a high degree of poetic eloquence . Characteristically elaborate imagery fills every paragraph , sometimes as a superfluous ornament to a perfectly simple thought ; there is , as usual , an almost sensual abuse of sonorous words ; as in all his works , the tone is often subjective . In fact , d'Annunzio felt a prophetic pride in inciting people to a war , then imminent , which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , " La Nave " ( 1908 ) , and in his war poems ( 1912 ) . Finally , it is in these speeches that we find , in fine poetic prose , the expression of what is the great underlying feeling of the Italy of today : the overwhelming consciousness that she is predestined to a glory which the glory of ancient Rome makes inevitable . It is interesting to note that , at the moment of national crisis , it was a poet who took the initiative , prodding people to war , and that this accepted prophet-orator of the time was d'Annunzio . RUDOLPH ALTROCCHI . The University of Chicago . ? Peace and Preparedness THE ARGUMENT FOR PEACE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The radical advocate of peace may perhaps at times feel impatient that the great mass of citizens are so slow to catch the inarguments advanced in support of the peace propaganda . In particular the following points invite attention : In the first place , it is contended that the way to secure peace is to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , unguarded boundary line between the United States and Canada  --  the inference being that our peaceful relations with Canada are due to the fact that there are no engines of war on the border . But is not this a case of confusing cause and effect , i. e. , is it notrather true that disarmament is here an effect of the increasing spirit of fraternity between the United States and Canada and the elimination of possible causes of serious dispute between the two countries ? The correctness of this analysis might be more evident , perhaps , if we should for the moment suppose the situation to be a very different one  --  that Canada was occupied by a nation diverse in stock , traditions , and ideals ; that both the United States and Canada were populated to a point where land hunger was developing ; and that a strip of country lay between which each coveted , and which each felt it a point of national honor to secure and hold . If these were the conditions , our present peaceful frontier would undoubtedly wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries are so much at one that thousands of immigrants yearly cross the border , hardly conscious that they are passing from one country to another , and the absence of any questions likely to lead to serious dispute renders it as unnecessary to garrison this border as it is for the individual States of the Union to fortify themselves against one another . If , therefore , the present condition of the boundary line between the United States and Canada has any lesson to teach , it is simply this : that mutual understanding and common interests and the elimination of possible causes of serious dispute lead the way naturally and almost automatically to disarmament . In the second place , it is argued that armament is , in and for Itself , the ultimate cause of war . This argument presupposes nations hying at peace until nation A builds a Dreadnought ; then nation B becomes suspicious regarding the intentions of nation A , and builds two Dreadnoughts ; this alarms nation A , which builds two additional Dreadnoughts , and so on ; finally the suspicion engendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to this argument is that it wholly disregards two fundamental facts : ( 1 ) that some among the nations of the earth entertain burning national or racial ambitions that can not be realized except by the USG of force ; and ( 2 ) that some preach openly , and freely adopt , as their guiding policy , the principle that might makes right . Given one nation of the first class stirred by such ambition and guided by such a philosophy , and rivalry in armament follows as a matter of course ; for the neighbors must either submit to aggression or prepare to defend themselves , and they naturally choose the second alternative . It is interesting to note that even some rather - uncompromising advocates of peace  --  though still demanding , somewhat illogically , immediate disarmament  --  are beginning to Incline to the view that war can not be eliminated finally except by a process of education that will uproot aggressive national and racial ambitions , establish the principle that right is might , and make every one content to submit to an award of arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to understand , however , how even the most ardent advocate of peace can hope for a consummation of this kind in the near future ; and , on the other hand , when one views the present turmoil in Europe , the plans of the League to Enforce Peace do not seem to offer any prospect of immediate relief . It certainly would require ' a large and effective world police force to cope with a situation like the present . In pushing the peace propaganda , two other very flimsy objections are raised against adequate preparation for national defence . One is the assertion that so large an army would be required that it would be necessary to resort to conscription . But those who advance this objection seem to forget the great difference between the situation in North America and conditions in Europe . For its inland borders the United States needs no considerable guard ; and nature interposes a fortification of some thousands of miles of water on east and west . The harbors of both coasts could certainly be made safe , and an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army that would drain the resources of the country or appear to neighbors across the sea to menace their respective countries . The other objection is based on financial considerations . We are informed that any adequate plan for national defence would cost too much money , and the prudent householder is warned that " taxes would go up . " Stated thus bluntly , this argument has a rather sordid look . It appears in a more respectable guise when we are told what good use could be made of the money that is now spent on military equipment and pensions  --  bow we might endow colleges , extirpate tuberculosis , etc . But this matter can be viewed from a very different angle . The Nation has recently Pointed out that the United States spends more money annually for chewing-gum than it does for school books . If we need a larger appropriation for education or sanitation , why not begin the retrenchment with chewing-gum rather than with the national defence ? H. C. Nurrigo . Berkeley , Cal . IS THERE DANGER OF A JAPANESE INVASION ? TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frequent and strong assertions that there is such a probability of a war between Japan and the United States that to prepare as speedily as possible for any emergency is an urgent necessity . Such an event is so utterly impossible that it is not worthy of serious consideration . And the reasons are these : There is no such disposition on the part of the Japanese people . Some irresponsible jingoes may try to stir up trouble , but they do not represent the thinking and ruling-classes . Writing on this subject , the editor of the Japan Mail ( who was an ex-officer in the British army ) said : " Before engaging in a war with America , Japan would have to divest herself of the strongest sentiments of friendship which are entertained towards any foreign country . " The Hon. Shimada Saburo , the editor of a leading daily paper in Tokio , and one of the most prominent men in the Diet and politics , writes : " These rumors that Japan may attack and occupy the Pacific Coast are absolutely without any foundation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such an attack would be suicidal . The United States is the greatest buyer of Japanese goods , and she does not propose to ruin all this trade by making a foolish attack that would be foredoomed to failure . " At a meeting of the leading American residents of all professions in the city of Yokohama , the American Ambassador said : " There is no cause under the sun why there should be distrust between the people of Japan and America . I think that the idea that Japan is a blood-thirsty nation , that wants territory and war with Umted States , is being gradually worn out , and the idea of suspecting our neighbors will be a thing of the past . " Resolutions condemning the rumors in question were unanimously adopted . The war between Japan and China , and also the one with Russia , were not brought about by Japan 's seeking .

No other country In the world is carrying so heavy a financial burden in proportion to its strength . The ordinary revenue of Japan , according to latest report , was $259,849,000 . The ordinary revenue of the United States was $734,673,000 . The total expenditure for army and navy in Japan for 1914-15 was less than $100,000,000 . The expenditure for the United States army alone was $94,000,000 . The .7Iokumin Shinthan ( a Tokio daily paper ) says : " The heavy debts of Japan are more than the nation can endure .

Esthetic " when Dr. Marshall 's most interesting review of them in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive and enjoyable as to check one 's own impression of an important book by the judgment of an acknowledged authority on the subject . But I was somewhat dismayed to find that the points in Dr. Bosanquet 's analysis of the issthetic experience which presented difficulties to me were not mentioned by Dr. Marshall at all , whereas in most of those points which Dr. Marshall criticises I was inclined to think Dr. Bosanquet right , or very nearly right . I have no claim to speak on .2zEsthetics with the authority either of Dr. Bosanquet or of his critic , but as a humble student , trying to learn from them both , and finding myself much more closely in agreement with Dr. Bosanquet on the points at issue , I should like to urge , for what they are worth , some considerations which appear to me to tell in favor of the position which Dr. Marshall attacks . I will summarize what I take to be the substance of Dr. Marshall 's argument , and I will do so in my own words rather than in quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far I have caught his meaning . Dr. Marshall , I should say , offers three criticisms of Dr. Bosanquet 's central formula for the esthetic experience , viz. , " Feeling expressed for expression 's sake . " Without keeping strictly to the order of Dr. Marshall 's review , I shall put his argument as follows : ( 1 . ) Dr. Bosanquet 's formula is too wide , because feeling expressed for expression 's sake is not necessarily beautiful ( consider the tyro 's failures ) . In other words , Dr. Bosanquet 's definition fails to hit off the specific quality of beauty , because it covers both good and bad art , and bad art is not beautiful . ( 2 . ) The formula is too narrow , because not everything that is beautiful is feeling expressed for expression 's sake . In other words , Dr. Bosanquet fails to account for the difference between beauty in art and beauty in nature , which can not both in the same sense be treated as " expressions " of " feeling . " For in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so far as there is some hidden meaning revealed there , the expression " can only appeal to one who assumes the attitude of observer , " whereas in art " expression " means that the artist puts his feeling , or rather his conception , into his work . It is the difference between man expressing his esthetic ideas in the things he makes , and the expression in nature of something which has not got its source in man and which man can only guess at . ( 3 . ) The third criticism continues the second in applying even to art the " radical distinction " between the artist who " creates " beauty and the observer who merely " perceives " it At bottom , the whole issue comes down , as Dr. Marshall by implication acknowledges , to a conflict between two opposing schools of e=sthetic theory concerning the proper scope of 2Esthetics . Dr. Marshall wants a theory of the " quality of beauty to which the average cultivated man refers when he uses the word aesthetic . " Dr. Bosanquet offers him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugliness and sublimity , nature and art , good and bad art , the spectator 's enjoyment and the artist 's creative rapture Dr. Bosanquet begins with an analysis of the experience of beauty , but he uses the insight so gained as a clue to the nature of esthetic quality in all its other forms and manifestations , and because he thus traces a single character throughout the whole field , he is accused of " failing " to make certain obvious distinctions . Dr. Marshall , pressing for the recognition of these distinctions , hardly makes it sufficiently clear that the whole importance of Dr. Bosanquet 's theory depends precisely on his going behind these distinctions in his search for the common character of all forms of esthetic experience . In this conflict I feel inclined to side with Dr. Bosanquet . Not that I write as Dr. Bosanquet 's prophet . I have no inside knowledge by which to interpret him . Whether he would accept my interpretation of him I do not know . I have nothing to go on except his words as tested by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can analyze my experience correctly , it seems to me that , if Dr. Bosanquet distinguishes too little , Dr. Marshall surely distinguishes too much . It is no service to lEsthetics to insist on the difference between spectator and maker to a point where their common occupation with beauty becomes unintelligible , or to contrast good and bad art so sharply that one almost forgets that bad art is still art . The case of beauty in nature and in art is especially instructive . It is easy to paint the difference between the making of beautiful objects by man and the finding of them in nature . But so far as they are both beautiful , what is the relevance of that distinction ? It has a right to enter into consideration only so far as it affects their beauty , e. 9. , in the sense in which Dr. Bosanquet argues that the beauty of art stands higher in the scale than the beauty of nature . Apart from that , what common ground is there , esthetically speaking , between natural objects and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and quality of the object , as experienced by us , evokes some degree and kind of the characteristic esthetic feeling ? The feeling , as the Einfithlungstheorie rightly appears to hold , fuses with the object in its concrete quality , so that in this sense it may be said to be " expressed " or " embodied " in the object . In so far as the whole experience of the object thus felt and " lived in " by me as an embodiment of my feeling is stable , complete in itself , and satisfying with a certain finality , we may speak of " expression for expression 's sake . " A good test-case for the justice of this view seems to me to be a painter inspired by his perception of a beautiful landscape , or a beautiful face , to embody them in a picture . Or , again , we might think of the way in which the story of Romeo and Juliet inspired Shakespeare . At what point here is the break between perception and creation , or between beauty of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to say that the work of art , compared with the original , evokes the same kind of experience only in an intenser and purer form , or that the painting and the drama are a continuation , through the manipulation of color and of language , of a creative activity of the imagination which entered already into the original perception ? Dr. Bosanquet 's remark ( p. 7 ) that " in creative art the production is as it were a form of perception ; it is subordinate to the full imagining , the complete looking or hearing , " seems to me entirely true to experience , even where the artist gets his first inspiration from nature , let alone the " non-imitative " arts , like music . The essential point is that " creation " does not begin only with the manual execution , after the conception is complete in the artist 's mind , but that it begins with the first impulse , whether received from perception or otherwise , and continues right through the elaboration which the " conception " undergoes in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the statement just quoted that I should interpret the further statement that " the spectator 's attitude is a faint analogue of the creative rapture of the artist . " The spectator is , so to speak , an artist at a lower level . Though his experience is determined by what the work of art offers him , it is yet creative . He owes his perception of esthetic quality to an activity of his imagination exercised on the materials offered . The differences between what two spectators will , as we rightly say , " make " of the same work of art are as great and as characteristic as the differences between what two artists will " make " of the same subject . Roughly speaking , what is given in a work of art or an object of nature , i. e. , what we all alike perceive , so far as we perceive non-esthetically , is much the same . The degrees of esthetic enjoyment , the amount of beauty seen , as between one man 's experience and another 's , depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given object , how much each can feel into it and receive back from it as its revelation . In conclusion , I will add two minor observations . First , it is not merely " probable , " as Dr. Marshall says , that Dr. Bosanquet would be " the first to acknowledge that his metaphysic can not be said to aid the artist " ? it is certain , for Dr. Bosanquet tells us so explicity himself . The function of 2Esthetics " is not to prescribe rules for the production of beauty or for the criticism of artists ' work " ( p. 2 ) . Dr. Bosanquet 's position here , whether right or wrong , is entirely consistent with that which he maintains in the analogous cases of ethics and logic . The aim is theory , not rule &; for practical application . Secondly , it is scarcely a happy suggestion on Dr. Marshall 's part that Dr. Bosanquet is inclined to look upon the critic 's attitude as a " higher synthesis " of the attitude of the spectator and that of the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dr. Marshall relies , do not seem to me to bear out his reading . Dr. Bosanquet 's point appears to be simply that you can not be a good critic unless you have yourself as full a range as possible of mstheths experience , for " the imagination itself is necessarily very sensitive to checks and failure* in its efforts after satisfactory form " ( p. 35 ) . This sensitiveness is at the root of all criticism . One might express this point by saying that the best artist is the best critic , provided he is capable of reflective analysis of his experience . R. F. ALFRED HOERNLS . Cambridge , Mass . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sin : Dr. Hoern16 's criticism of my study of Dr. Bosanquet 's . zEsthetics is welcomed by me as one of the " humble students " of this difficult subject . It appears to me that Dr. Hoernle 's attitude is affected by the current recrudescence of " romanticism , " and this may well lead us to pause . No one can complain that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Indeed , I have often feared that I might be thought to be a camp follower of Rousseau ; one of those amateurs du delire , of which French critics speak . But it seems to me that this is a time when we should use every endeavor to see straight in this regard ; and the theory presented by Dr. Bosanquet does not appear to me to aid us to this end . Dr. Hoern16 , indeed , would seem to accept the thoroughly romantic theory of Einfuhlung. which Dr. Bosanquet and I join in rejecting ; and I may add that , in my view , the grounds for this rejection are fundamentally the same that lead me to find Dr. Bosanquet 's theory unsatisfactory . The need of clarity of thought in this matter is made evident when we note that Dr. Hoernld asks us not to forget that " bad art is still art . " Yes ; it is art in the sense in which we speak of any work of skill as art  --  bootblacking may thus be called an art . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad art in my view is non-esthetic . So far as I can see , every form of self-conscious activity may be stated in terms of Dr. Bosanquet 's " feeling expressed for feeling 's sake " ; but only some of it involves the esthetic attitude of the artist , and only some of its resultants yield the sense of beauty to the observer . I find myself so thoroughly in sympathy with both Dr. Hoern16 and Dr. Bosanquet in their appreciations of beauty that I am led to ask whether there is no other theory which more satisfactorily " covers beauty and ugliness and sublimity , nature and art , good and bad art , the spectator 's enjoyment , and the artist 's creative rapture . " If " covers " is taken to mean " explains the relations between , " I think we have what we look for in the hedonic theory of .2Esthetics which I have defended elsewhere . Art is " higher " than nature , so far as it gives us a more permanent form of beauty . That it may do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection enables us to gain a concentration of interest . I , of course , agree that part of this interest may be due to a dim sympathetic appreciation of the artist 's attitude ; but I doubt the fundamental importance of this " empathy . " I can not believe that it can account for the very wide recognition of the beauty of certain works of , art among peoples whose appreciation of the artist 's creative attitude must be all but totally lacking . I do not think that such a " spectator is an artist at a lower level . " Perhaps we may hope to hear directly from Dr. Bosanquet in regard to the final point made by Dr. Hoernle , where he thinks I have misunderstood the author . HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL . New Yolk . Latin as a Living Tongue SIR GEORGE OTTO TREVELYAN ON THE CONSOLATIONS OF OLD AGE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sim : When reading your Educational Number of recent date I was much impressed by the sound and original views in the letter headed " A Suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom of introducing a boy to the Latin language through the medium of Caesar 's " Commentaries " and Virgil 's " - ZEneid " ; and expresses his own preference for selecting other authors , and notably Plautus . On this subject I can speak from the experience of a very long life , in which Latin and Greek have been a priceless , a permanent , and an increasingly valuable possession ; and I have the vicarious advantage of knowing the feelings of a relative who was perhaps the most ardent reader that the world has produced . On the question of Julius Caesar 1 write without prejudice . I eagerly read everything about him , whether in Cicero , Sallust , Catullus , or Suetonius ; and his brief letter , enclosed in the sixteenth epistle of the ninth book of the letters to Atticus ( commencing with the words " recte auguraris de me " ? ) I regard as among the most lofty of human compositions , on a level with Abraham Lincoln 's address at Gettysburg , and with Edmund Burke 's speech from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , when a boy , I found Caesar 's " Commentaries " dry and unattractive . It was quite otherwise with Livy 's History , which I read with delight , many pages , and at last whole books , ahead of our appointed task That in itself is not a certain proof that the love for a book will last , for I did the same with Fenelon 's " Tel  --  maque " ; but , in the case of Livy , I like him all the better for having liked him sixty-five years ago . In these terrible times I have read him with strange emotion , fortifying one 's mind with the memorable example of Rome 's most critical and glorious years , and sometimes even for a while distracting one 's thoughts from our own patriotic efforts and anxieties . It was the same with Macaulay . During the years 1837 and 1838 , when he was compiling the Indian Criminal Code and founding the Indian Educational System , he read Livy twice through at Calcutta . It was in the course of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lays of Ancient Rome . " On the margin of his Livy , opposite the story of Horatius , he writes : " This is the true Chevy Chase style . " Opposite the account of the Battle of Lake Regillus he writes : " This fine story of a battle comes , I have no doubt , from some old national Poem " ; and , at the death of Virginia in the Third Book , he says : " An incomparably beautiful and pathetic story . " His comments , as Livy 's book grows from legend into history , become more critical , frequent , and far longer and more detailed ; and they form at last something of a supplementary history of Rome by the side of Livy 's narrative . At the close of the decade relating the Second Punic War , he writes : " Here ends a finely written , though most careless and partial , narrative of the most extraordmary and interesting war in ancient history . My admiration for Hannibal has been prodigiously increased by this account of his actions , unfriendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of your correspondent 's letter refers to Plautus . The comedies of Plautus are a supremely good introduction to a knowledge of the Roman mind and of the Latin tongue . The style of Terrence  --  the favorite author of Julius Caesar  --  is exquisite ; but it is a vehicle for Attic manners and Attic feeling , perhaps as beautifully and purely expressed as in the original Greek . Plautus , on the other hand , is Roman to the core ; and a true reader of Plautus has it never absent from his thoughts that he is reading the Latin which was spoken at Rome in Rome 's heroic period ; that he is listening to plays which were acted with vast applause before audiences full of men who had fought under Marcellus and Claudius Nero in the Second Punic War , and that he is present at familiar conversations couched in the very talk of Lmlius , and Scipio , and the elder Cato . It is the same deep and almost mysterious fascination which we find m Chaucer and Herodotus  --  the English spoken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the men who remembered Plata , and Thermopylae . Macaulay went through Plautus , in India , five several times in three year : , disappointed with him on the first reading , as compared with his undergraduate recollections of him at Cambridge , but relishing him more and more at each successive perusal It is idle to canvass the respective merits of very great writers . They belong to a class where , thank heaven , there are no competitive examinations . But no man need be ashamed if he prefers Plautus to Ben Jonson or to Congreve ; and ( to come to one special performance ) , if he reads the " Menchmi " and the " Comedy of Errors " in close succession , without feeling that Plautus loses by the juxtaposition . On one point my own taste does not coincide with that of your correspondent . I can not set Petronius in this high company . To me there is something about him sickly , faded , fantastic , and unreal ; and I do not class his book with " Tristram Shandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " Gil Blas , " or " Gulliver 's Travels " ; and ( for that is more in his own line ) I regard him as a hundred miles below " Lavengro " and " The Romany Rye .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It is a well-known habit of us apologists of the classics to fly into a rage when we hear Greek and Latin called " dead languages " by the enemy . We rant and shout in a loud voice , or in italics , that they arenot dead , that they are just as alive as English , for instance , of which the modern form differs more from Chaucer 's English than does modern from ancient Greek , and that Latin also lives in its descendants , French , Italian , etc . Have we not here , in our zeal , gone a little too far and excited ourselves quite uselessly ? Have we not even , in. these arguments , descended to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if what we say is true , they are perfectly willing , a fortiori , to throw Chaucer 's English upon the junk pile too , and that the hveness of offspring allows us to draw no inference as to the deadness or the opposite of the parent . Of course , the argument that it is useless to study Greek and Latin because they are dead languages is a fallacy . But the fallacy does not lie in the validity of their major premise . Greek and Latin are undoubtedly dead , in the sense in which these people take the word . And why deny it ? They died long ago ? Greek , at least , for the western world  --  and were even buried and forgotten , but , like the mammoth found frozen and almost perfectly preserved , but dead nevertheless , in the icefields of Siberia , they have been exhumed and have given us a glimpse of bygone ages . Yet they are preserved by artificial means , and it is by no means inconceivable that , if the interest in this preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess would go the way that their fellows went a thousand or more years ago . The mistake that our opponents make is not that they call Greek and Latin " dead , " but " that , when they have done so , they think that they can rest their case . Greek and Latin are condemned by an epithet . The minor premise of the enemy , if they went to the trouble of formulating one , would be , I suppose , " All dead things are useless " ? a rash statement that any coal baron could refute , if the ultimate source of his wealth were pointed out to him , or any freshman of any medical school . To refute it in the case of Greek and Latin is not my province and has been ably done by others .

ERNEST RIEDER , . New Orleans . The Chinese Monarchy VIEWS OF A REPUBLICAN . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Putting on one side the question whether the republican form of government is fit for China or otherwise , I am going to point out some important events that happened in our country after the establishment of the republic , and try to show what President Yuen has done since then . The revolutionary movement in China has been greatly developed since the year 1900 . It was because of the corruption and the rottenness of the Manchu dynasty and the aggression of the foreign power that the Chinese people began to see their weak points in the political , economical , and industrial world . Our national heroes *died one after another , not only for the purpose of destroying the Manchu dynasty and selecting our own king , but for the establishment of the republican government and for the liberty of our four hundred million people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government when our provisional government was first established at Nanking on January 1 , 1912 . Dr. Sun Yet-San was then the Provisional President of our republic at Nanking , and Yuen Shi-Kai was the Premier of the Chin dynasty at Peking with the full power of taking charge of the peace negotiations between the two Governments . At first Yuen disagreed upon many points which were brought out by the representatives of the Provisional . Government , and the negotiation was almost broken off . But owing to the terrible bomb which was given to the Premier Yuen on January 16 , 1912 , when he was on his way to the royal palace , he , although not killed , began to realize the danger of his position and the popular inclination of the people . Therefore the negotiation was resumed . The final result was reached on February 12 , that the King of the Chin dynasty resigned from his throne ; that the Premier Yuen was intrusted to cooperate with the Provisional Government to establish the greatest republican government of China , including the five different races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provisional Government and expressed his deep appreciation of what the revolutionists and the Provisional Government had done , and said how he admired the principle of democracy and what great honor he had in cooperating with the Provisional Government for the greatest good of future China . On February 13 President Sun delivered his resignation to Tsang Chin Yuen , which was assembled on January 28 , and composed of representatives from different provinces , because he had sworn during his inauguration that he would resign from the Presidency when the monarchy was destroyed and the republican government was formed . He offered his resignation because he trusted Yuen 's power and ability of uniting the whole country . He went to Tsang Chin Yuen and delivered an address concerning the present condition of the country , and his recommendation for Yuen to be the next Provisional President . On February 15 Tsang Chin Yuen was assembled for the election of the President . Yuen was elected . His inauguration was held at Peking on March 6 . Since then the Provisional Government has removed to Peking , and Tsang Chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Tong Shou-Yee was first appointed by President Yuen as the Premier of the Provisional Government . According to the Provisional Constitution , which was drawn and verified by Tsang Chin Yuen , the Premier was responsible to the President . It follows , therefore , that every order issued by the President must be signed by the Premier . Yuen never got accustomed to such restriction , he began to dislike it . Therefore there were a good many disputes between the President and the Preniier . Finally , Tong Shou-Yee resigned from his office owing to the fact that the President Yuen appointed a man . to be the head of a commission to investigate the condition of the army in the South without the approval of the Premier . Since then , till the opening of the National Assembly , the Premier has been changed three times and the pokey and administration were by no means carried out . Mr. Tong Shou-Yee , the first Premier , was an influential member of Kong Min Dong , which was a political party , and the majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Manchu dynasty . Dr. Sun . was the leader . and several provincial Governors belonged to that party then . After Mr. Tong Shou-Yee had resigned from his office , realizing the approaching danger of the republic , Kong Min Dong began to work its influence through the people , expecting its majority in the coming National Assembly . Fortunately the result of the election gave Kong Min Doug its majority in both Tsang Yee Yuen ( the Senate ) and Chung Yee Yuen ( House of Representatives ) . Immediately after the opening of the National Assembly there was a great and unfortunate happening which aroused the suspicion between our Government and the people . It was the assassination of Mr. Sung Chao-Yin . Mr. Sung Chao-Yin , was a man who was active in the revolutionary movement , was an able and practical politician , was a strong believer in party government and in responsible Cabinet system , and , above all , he was an influential member of Kong Min Dong . He explained his belief in the provinces along the Young-tsee River . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people , owing to the fact that Kong Min Dong had its majority in the Assembly , began to be lieve that Mr. Sung Chao-Yin was going to be the next Premier , and he was going to organize a strong , responsible , and party Cabinet . On March 20 , of the year 1913 , he was shot at the Shanghai and Nanking . Railway station at Shanghai on his way to Peking . The whole country was aroused and most believed that it was due to the political struggle The murderer was arrested , but died in the jail shortly after . After a careful investigation , the witness told us that the murderer had close connection with the Premier at that time , Chou Pin-Cheung , and his secretary . The District Court at Shanghai wanted the Premier and his secretary to come to Shanghai , but they did not , and they were still working in their office . Shortly after the assassination of Sung Chao-Yin there was an unconstitutional action taken . by our Government . It was the Five-Powers loan . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a treaty with a foreign country we must have the consent of Tsang Yee Yuen . The assassination of Sung Chao-Yin made the people , or at least Kong ' Mm Dong , think that the murderer had connection not only with the Premier and his secretary , but also with President Yuen Shi-Kai . The Five-Powers loan was not justified by the National Assembly and the majority of the people . Therefore the three Governors who belonged to Kong Mm Dong began to show disobedience to the Government ; they were Governors of Kiang-si , of Ngang-whai , and of Kwong-tung . President Yuen removed them , and they submitted . But Yuen still suspected the soldiers of Kiang-si , so he sent continually his trusted soldiers there . The result was the conflict between two sides ofsoldiers , and the so-called Second Revolution broke out . The majority of the people , being tired of war and being not recovered to the normal economical , social , and industrial condition after the first revolution , were not in favor of this revolution , so the trouble was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election for the first President had been raised . The question whether the adoption of the Constitution should precede the election of the President or the election of the President should precede the adoption of the Constitution had been discussed for a long time in the National Assembly . The final agreement was reached that the Constitutional Committee , whose members were elected from the members of the National Assembly by majority vote , should first make out the method of electing the President ; that the election should take place after it was ratified ; that the adoption of the Constitution should be after the election . On October 6 , 1913 , Yuen Shi-Kai was elected as the first President of the Chinese Republic . The election was held in Chung Yee Yuen ( House of Representatives ) from eight o'clock in the morning until nine at night . There were thousands of soldiers lined up around the ' House . They did not go until Yuen was elected . One of the Japanese newspapers said that it was the first time in the history of the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soldiers . After the President was elected , there were serious disputes between the President and the members of the Constitutional Committee . Logically , the President has no power over the making of the Constitution , but Yuen sent eight persons to attend the meeting of the Committee . At first they were refused , but finally they were admitted . The first important point the Constitutional Committee was going to emphasize was to limit the power of the President by the adoption of a responsible Cabinet system . The persons who were sent by Yuen to attend the meeting wanted to express their opinion concerning this point , but they were refused . The following day , October 25 , President Yuen telegraphed to the Governors of different provinces expressing the impossibilities of the new Constitution and wanting their opinions . Then the Governors , Generals , and Captains began to discuss the question of the Constitution . Most of them could not point out how the new Constitution was going to do harm to our country , but they favored the dissolution of the National Assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , and the rejection of the Constitution by the President . Most people would , I think , wonder why the Governors , Generals , and Captains favored such a violent action to be taken by the President . To understand this , I must mention that since the Second Revolution has been crushed out , Yuen 's supporters have filled up these places . They did not care what the country did , but they did care about the prospect of their master and of their own future . On November 4 , President Yuen issued an order dismissing the members of Kong Min Dong in the National Assembly ; even those who did not belong to Kong Min Dong then , but belonged to that party before the Second Revolution , were also dismissed . Since then our National Assembly could not meet because of lack of a quorum . Since then even the form of the republic has disappeared . Yuen could do what he wanted to do . A State Council , which is composed of Ministers and representatives from the President , is what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would realize that this body can not represent our people . People who are not well informed on China will say that China has been a monarchical government for thousands of years ; that the Chinese people are peaceful and obedient : therefore it is better for China to return to her monarchical government , for there will be no dispute over the election of the President Do the Chinese ignore the development of modern democracy ? Do the Chinese obey the unjustifiable order ? If the Chinese do , how could we start a revolutionary movement , how could we succeed In destroying the Manchu dynasty , and how could we succeed in establishing a republican government ? People say that the republican form of government is not fit for China . How could they know ? We never had time enough to try it . Our government has been no longer a republic since Yuen became our President . If Yuen is going to make himself Emperor , I believe that China will never quiet down .

TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION ; SIR : The great outstanding fact about Honolulu  --  the fact without reference to which no visitor 's dinner speech or tourist 's letter to home would be complete  --  is that of all cities of the Pacific , perhaps of the world , not one is more cosmopolitan . Almost before the malshini ( newcomer ) has stepped from the gangplank he is impressed by the variety of complexions , features , tongues , and costumes which are to be noted . It is merely a matter of hours until he will have employed the rather hackneyed but indispensable phrase , " the melting-pot , " in reference to life at the cross-roads of the Pacific .

Perhaps , had he remained , he , too , might have fallen victim to the influences which enable white , black , brown , and yellow men partially to lose sight of their racial characteristics and to live harmoniously and , to a degree , sympathetically in the " Isles of Peace . " Only the tinge of red is lacking in the island color scheme . It is said that only a few Indians , of the Siwash tribe , live in the vicinity . There is no reason to believe that Utopia has been attained in Honolulu . No one need accept any opinion that this community has proved conclusively the possibility or desirability of the general intermingling and association of races . For aught one may know forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of harmony . The melting process has not as yet been sufficiently long-continued to permit conclusions . But it is true that the instruments and the materials essential to Nature 's experiments in racial association have for a considerable period been present here , and that no results distressful to a broad-minded observer are as yet apparent . And in the present time of universal unrest many persons may find satisfaction in contemplating the fact that in one neighborhood many races live without undue strife . The fact is especially significant when it is considered that the community embraces such widely different peoples as the Hawaiians , the Portuguese , the Chinese , the Japanese , the Koreans , the Filipinos , the Porto Ricans , the Negroes , and various Caucasian nationalities ; all of which are represented in considerable numbers among the approximately 60,000 residents of Honolulu . Many factors are involved in the fusion of these heterogeneous elements . The schools , the churches , the press , various industrial and commercial interests , Social and fraternal organizations , and the police court are , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals . But in addition to these , there are at work three agencies , easily to be overlooked , but not on that account to be underestimated , towards like ends Moreover , they insure an American bent of mind for the rising generation . They are : Baseball , moving pictures , and popular music . The general popularity of baseball as a sport , and its widespread appeal to non-participants as a spectacle , are nowhere more apparent than in Honolulu . The game is said to have been introduced in the islands by Major Thurston in 1885 , and it may be supposed that cocoanuts were at first used for balls . There were during the last summer Japanese , Chinese , Hawaiian , Portuguese , and Filipino teams in the field , besides the various American civilian and army clubs There is also a crack organization representing a negro regiment . The Chinese Travellers . a Honolulu team , recently returned from a long and successful tour of the mainland , a tour which terminated at faraway Havana  --  another insular stronghold of the national pastime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to participate in an International League schedule last autumn . About the same time representatives of the Japanese Athletic Club of Honolulu were playing baseball in the Flowery Kingdom . College teams from California , Stanford , Chicago , have played on local fields during the last two summers , all finding first-class competition . " Pat " Page , the celebrated coach , after his stop here with the Chicago University team en route to the Orient , wrote : " The entire community of Honolulu back their teams with more enthusiasm than any Place in the world . . . . Honolulu is just like Chicago Every sandlot is filled with ' Skinnays ' learning the game " Interest in the world 's series reports is quite as intense as in many mainland cities Large crowds representing all nationalities assembled each morning at nine to read the bulletins . An instance of the deep interest is provided in the fact that a Chinaman , in response , to a general invitation from the star-Bulletin sporting editor , correctly guessed the batteries to be employed in the opening game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert failed . Perhaps even wider in its appeal locally , in that both men and women are interested , is the moving picture . It is in the picture theatres that one literally " rubs elbows " with all nationalities . The " movie fan " may turn during a lighted intermission to find that he is seated beside a Hawaiian lady in a belt-less , loose-flowing " holoku , " as the characteristic native dress is called ; or shining coat and pantaloons may indicate a Chinese neighbor . Perhaps the neighbor is a Japanese , kimono-clad , sandal-shod , with the picturesque " ohm " on her back , or her husband with a Toyo Panama in his hand . For in the numerous picture theatres of the city all congregate to watch the " Perils " ' or the " Exploits " or the " Adventures " or the " Hazards " or whatever else the lurid posters outside may have announced . And the philosophically inclined should rejoice that the same little ladies of the screen who crowd the theatres in the most sophisticated mainland communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and isolated a place as this . Many of the three dozen theatres here are of the tin-wall , open-roof type , so that the moon , stars , and clouds play parts of their own in the " Island nights entertainment . " A recent contributor to the Photo-Play Magazine enthusiastically writes : " If you can call Honolulu , as they do , the ' melting-pot of the races , ' then surely it is the moving picture that stirs it . In all this intermingling of races , nationalities , civilizations , and centuries the one plane where they all meet , the one thing that crosses all lines , is the naoving picture . It is the only thing that they all share , the only thing they all enjoy . " The real " joy of life " here is to be found in the park on moonlight nights , when , the landscape properly swabbed with light , the royal or cocoanut palm fronds appropriately silvered and barely aflutter in the tropical breeze , one lounges about while the native Hawaiian Band is at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , and surely there will be children tumbling on the grass . The syncopated efforts of American song-writers are much in vogue In the band programmes , and a lonely one may feel the gentle pangs of " home , sweet home " as he hears the tunes which are inevitably associated with lyrics about corn fields , cotton fields , midnight choochoos , ragtime bands , dear ole Broadway , or other peculiarly American Institutions . Another evening the band is not playing . A stranger sits alone beneath a banyan tree . After a while a group of Hawaiian boys  --  perhaps a Portuguese among them  --  strolls by . Some of them carry guitars , others ukuleles . They are singing native songs well known on the mainland , and popular songs of the " States " better known here . Or there may be an even queerer association of music and musician . Perchance , as happened once , a little Chinese boy , native-born , will again pass by chanting of a " Girl In the Heart of Maryland . " Such an incident gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inspires a feeling of patriotism which he hopes is shared by all the odd folk of the " Paradise of the Pacific . " It is the glow from the crucible ! HARRY W. FRANTZ . Honolulu , T H. Educational Topics THE EFFECT ON A UNIVERSITY FAC-ULTY OF ARBITRARY DISMISSALS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sin : The reaction of myself and my colleagues to a case of sudden dismissal that we regard as absolutely unjustifiable suggests the query as to whether such action contributes in any way to the efficiency of a university . A man who had brought his department from notorious feebleness to a model state , who was most highly regarded in every respect by all of his fellows , was suddenly at the summer meeting of the board given a Year 's leave , told that his services were no longer required , and his successor appointed . No warning was given and no hearing permitted . The first occasion , so far as is known and suspected , was the jealousy of a colleague , better known for belittling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference in the control of the department in question had been checked by the man dismissed . The second more openly alleged reason was a vigorous expression of opinion on matters connected with his department to the governing board . These were particularly resented by one man who has assumed a dominant position on the board . One must expect to suffer much while the method of choice puts absolute control pf universities into the hands of men who can have little knowledge of educational matters and no academic ideals . In this respect , our board is probably better than the average . Nevertheless , a word from the inside on the effect of government by whim for the personal satisfaction of members of the board may guide other bodies in similar cases . I felt the matter as a personal blow . I lost a night 's sleep , and for the rest of the summer , whenever any university matter was mentioned , I at once thought of the dismissal with a feeling of depression , followed by bitterness that continued for a longer period than I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place or that there might be some way of removing the cause or even getting even played an unethically large part , and I am not an intimate of the victim and am in no way directly affected . The effect was universal . Men remarked that we had fallen upon a comic-opera regime , in which any difference of opinion was to be settled by " off with his head . " There was talk of spies , an intimation that one might be struck from the dark without warning , and that no one knew who would go next , and repeated wonder if one had by any chance given offence to the supreme power . The atmosphere was that of Russia . As men returned this autumn they were greeted with . " You were lucky to escape the emotional strain of the summer , " or , " I did not write you about Y as I did not care to spoil your summer . " Similar expressions , coupled with violent condemnation of the men responsible , were heard on all sides . Obviously , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution must be bad . The actual loss of time and the decrease in capacity for work are considerable . Respect for the men in authority is lost , and enthusiasm for work and loyalty to the institution greatly diminished . Worst of all is the growing belief , often subconscious , that advancement and even retention depend upon truckling and wire-pulling rather than upon actual merit and accomplishment . Here , as in so many institutions , there is no open way in which faculty opinion may be expressed upon . appointments and promotions , and many of the essentials of policy . Occasional private conferences , some even more questionable influences . give the board what little light they get on the attitude of the members of the teaching staff . Punishment of the kind inflicted encourages toadying Much more than honest expression of opinion . As the men of standing and ideals are less likely to resort to these methods than the Politicians , the influence of that class , whom we have always with us , is bound to increase . Opposed to these disadvantages , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that he has taught the man his place and that he will no longer be irritated by having a man about who will not instantly agree with him . He may also be gratified at his success in getting even . In this case the method was less humane , even physically , than the conventional bludgeon or sawed-off shotgun of the Black Hand . Against this must be put the discouragement and mental depression , not to mention the curses , of scores of the men upon whom , after all , the strength and reputation of the university depend . X. A HINT FROM TUSKEGEE . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In connection with the revelations in " A Bombardment of Unfortified Brains " in your issue of December 9 , the following may be of interest : In Booker Washington 's school for negroes at Tuskegee there is a blackboard in the hall , which all the students pass constantly , and the latest news is written on it so that all can read at a glance . In addition , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their various classes . half an hour is given for current events , each class in turn having a morning on which any member may be called on to report some important recent occurrence . Half the time is given to the reporting : the other half to criticism from any student . of the accuracy of the reporting , and of the English in which it was given . The pupils read the news when they can , one little boy pleading in excuse for a slight inaccuracy that " the big boys had all the papers . " The reporter is expected to tell the situation of any place mentioned , the Position of any person . etc . The half-hour is most interesting and informing . When a visitor on one occasion was shown through the printing office , a slip was taken from the press as a specimen of the printing . Reading it , the conductor said : " Ah ! I did not know of this ! To-night is one of the rare free evenings for the class , and their Lite-rary Society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " The visitor was amazed that evening . The Russo-Japanese War was going on . Papers for each side were read by a boy and a girl , and then discussed . Surprising appreciation of the situation of both belligerents was shown . All was intelligent and graphic . " It is wonderful , " said the amazed visitor . " Encyclopaedia , " said the host , with a twinkle . " But all was so up to date . " " The papers  --  but they have very little time for reading . " Our " superior race " must bestir itself energetically if it is to keep ahead , and might not the Current Events blackboard and half-hour be introduced into our schools and colleges with advantage ? Surely current events touch one 's " life work " more closely than the sporting news . S. H. Philadelphia . DAILY THEMES AND COLLEGE DEBAT-ING . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : When Mr. Foster and " An Undergraduate " make their complaint about vicarious thinking in our institutions of higher learning , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing an unbiassed mind or a retentive memory of their own undergraduate days who would venture to defend the intellectual standards of our undergraduates . The cult of vacuity in academic halls is too brazen to be overlooked . The dangers of originality are too great to be faced by any young man at the outset of his " college career . " But the causes for this ailing are not to be found solely in luxurious fraternity houses , or professionalized athletics , or even in stupid and unsympathetic instructors here and there . Modern educational methods have done more harm even than modern plumbing to the undergraduate mind . I recall at least one New England college where not so very long ago men dwelt together - for the most part in the most unexceptionable discomfort , and yet political conviction , religious faith , and intellectual standards were as unusual as if every man had had his own . motor car and shower bath . It is not fair to blame the plumber and the steamfitter and the subsidized quarterback for what is more the fault of deliberate systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the whole field of iniquities wrought by the so-called elective system . But I should like to comment on two forms of abuse common in , and peculiar to , the modern American college . I refer to them because Mr. Foster appears to take them as matter of course . The first is the writing of themes . The second is debating . These evils are best studied in their most virulent forms  --  daily themes and intercollegiate debating . Mr. Foster complains of the college girl who , " when asked to write a description of a sunset , applied to the librarian at once for a book on sunsets . " But he does not criticise the instructor who made the requirement . It ought to be an insult to any high-spirited man or woman between eighteen and twenty-two years of age to be required to write a description of a sunset . And yet college instructors go on exacting daily themes in this same stupid way . The daily-theme course in our colleges compels men to turn out day after day all sorts of themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach style and command of language . The American university has not yet comprehended that style is simply the apt expression of an idea As such it is obviously a by-product of the idea . Wespend infinite labor in our theme courses on style , but none on ideas . We expect the mill to produce fine meal and forget that no good grist has gone in at the other end . We permit our undergraduates to feed their minds on the lowest forms of current periodical literature and then expect them to write like Addison or Montaigne , by compelling them to compose daily essays on sunsets . The result of these courses is that people who are capable at their best of writing good spelling and punctuation and tolerable grammar indulge themselves in the grossest of literary vices , emotional insincerity . Can any one imagine a man in Oxford , or Gtittingen , or Grenoble being seriously invited to write a theme on sunsets , or oak trees , or campus buildings , or any one of the thousand things that are compulsory in our colleges ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitudes with the slightest tincture of personality ; and certainly very few do escape without a lasting hatred of literary composition in any form . But the college debate is , if anything , a more devitalizing and devastatingly pernicious influence . The interscholastic , interclass , or intercollegiate debate is unoriglnality made competitive . Debating is properly the alternate advocacy of two opinions . In college it is a game played by teams , like football . The teams are coached for the " big debate , " just as the football team is coached for the " big game . " The three most docile students " make the debating team . " When they have made the team , they go to work with redoubled energy under the coach . When their fleshly brothers become giants of physique on meat and prunes , they are strengthening the mental sinews on statistical almanacs and volumes of the Congressional Record . The evening of the big debate comes . There are three judges , generally two neutral professors and a lawyer . By a supreme effort they listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some arbitrary schedule . Ultimately they announce the victorious team to the accompaniment of well-modulated applause . The audience is generally exiguous . In small colleges , freshmen are frequently required to attend . Nobody in his right mind wants to listen . The unforgivable thing in a debate is to make an " unsupported assertion . " If a debater says , " I believe in high protection , " it is as bad as a fumble . The other team is sure to score five points . What the debater should say is , " We of the affirmative shall endeavor to show you that high protection is for the best interests of the nation . Senator So-and-So , in a speech which in fact was never made and never would have been listened to if it had been , at p. 922 of volume such-and such of the Congressional Record , said , etc. , etc . The statistics of Uruguay show that , etc , whereas the statistics of Portugal , etc. , etc . " It is easy to satirize , and it is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the affirmative was nothing out of the ordinary and would never be penalized in the game as it is played . It is precisely as though he had written to a reputable coach and said , " Send me six good skin-tackle plays for the championship game . " College debating is the worst possible training for public life . The college debater is playing for points to the judges . If he makes an " unsupported assertion , " all is lost . Woe be unto him if his adversary has been more thorough with Poole 's Index . " A recent writer in the which the gentlemen of the negative have overlooked , has observed , etc and the heads of the gentlemen on the negative droop with shame across their water tumblers . It may be true that all this is sometraining in logic , and that to lose two points from the judge for an undistributed middle or an illicit minor makes men more careful with their syllogisms . But is it not a thousandfold better that men should battle with their own good wits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should struggle for a judge 's points by the citation of the opinions of politicians or eminent experts ? In the famous Union Society of Oxford , which has been in some sense the mother of the Mother of Parliaments , every member has an opinion on the subject of debate and voices it either in a speech or by his position in the lobbies at the end of the speaking . In an American debate no auditor has any opinion except that it has all been an intolerable bore . At the Oxford Union you will hear crimes In the name of logic that might turn the hair of an American debating professor gray in one night . But you will also hear real conviction , sound unrhetorical sense , and manly purpose . These are things that the debating coach in America makes impossible . I do not believe any American with the forensic training of an American university ever achieved honorable success in public life without consciously rejecting all that he ever learned in these " debating teams . " Those who devise our curricula and form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mischief is not in the debater , but in the debate . The American undergraduate is undoubtedly satisfied with predigested food . But in the majority of cases it is because his instructors compel him to Partake of it and scold him for a nibble of ripe fruit . If our undergraduate is the victim of false contentments , let us shoulder the blame ourselves for fostering those very contentments . This is not the affair alone of college faculties . It is for the educated man whatever his profession . ROBERT HALE . Boston , Mass . The Eternal Feminine M. BOIS ON THE AMERICAN WOMAN . To THE : EDITOR OF THIll NATION : SIR : The American press was very friendly to me during my recent visit to the United States , and ably seconded me in my mission , which was to present the underlying reason which linked your grand republic with our own . I knew before I put foot on your soil that you Americans feel a sincere sympathy for us French , and my aim was to make it clear that this mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . In fact , I care so much for the good opinion of the American press that I have been considerably disturbed by frequent reports in your papers that in lay next novel , " The Woman Who Killed , " I declare that the American woman , especially the grande dame , is incapable of love . Now , as this book is not coming out until January , it seems to me that it would be rather out of place and above all premature for the author thus to pass judgment on the American woman . Indeed , presented in this bald form the statement would be simply a monstrosity , and what is more , would not be true . I have never said nor written any such thing . On the contrary , having proclaimed In my lectures and interviews that I consider the American woman to be " the hope of the future , " it would be absurd for me to hold that this woman was inept to manifest , in its noblest form , a sentiment which is the most beautiful of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far from pretending or even conjecturing that the American " super-lady " is unable to love , I will show in " The Woman Who Killed " that my heroine , an . American , attains to a love so complete and so profound that , in order to experience the sensation , it is not necessary that the beloved one be present and living : she is bound to him even more closely than is the widow to the dead husband , her affection is like the vows of the nun . I make it plain that there is no love comparable to her love , more elevated , purer , and more profound , though the road this exigent soul had to follow in order to attain her end was long . painful , and tragic  --  a road darkened with doubt and pride which rendered the victim , in spite of herself , shockingly cruel . The fact is that the grand American lady is placed in a very peculiar position by the circumstance that she enjoys a liberty , a prestige , a refinement of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exerted by beauty , physical and mental culture , travel , large acquaintanceship , contact with all that is of a high intelligence , and a knowledge of all that is interesting and beautiful . She is , in a word , a queen , an idol . In a lecture that I delivered in the drawing-room of Mrs. Charles B. Alexander , I said to the American woman : " You are an idol ; be a goddess ; that is to say , do not keep for yourself alone this splendor which ends in you . Be a benefactor and beware of the double trap of selfishness and pride by which a man in Your position would be sure to be caught " It is inevitable that such a personality , favored with every kind of gift , of birth and lot , would be apt to feel that she was a magnificent prey , and a cruel clairvoyance would be awakened in her which might become so acute that it would finally turn into a perpetual doubt  --  she would never believe herself loved for her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become blas ? , at least in appearance , for nothing is so baneful to love as an excessive refinement of the interior being , and that sort of intoxication caused by an atmosphere of flattery and perpetual homage . Whoever is so affected is lost . But this is much less the fault of the individual than of society , and of the much too courtesanesque character of the relations of men with women who possess everything to please . Incense was the Perdition of the despots of old , and it is the Poison which awaits the dominatrices of today and to-morrow . The grand ladies of America , who are already and will be still more so in the future almost an irresistible power , need to make the most intense and constant effort in order not to lose those qualities which are displayed more easily in the case of women of a more modest or of an average condition  --  devotion , lover of sacrifice , fruitful pity  --  without which there is no real complete love . I who am an admirer of the American woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States that the superwoman is to appear , that she is even now on the point of appearing ?

He met most of the crowned heads of his age and made friends of them , for as Master of Ceremonies he welcomed all distinguished visitors to the Papal Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of him that he loved good food , and especially good drink , and to this was due perhaps the gout that brought about his death , in 1506 . Burckard 's diary begins in 1483 . Sixtus IV was Pope , an old man of seventy , who died Just as the diary begins . Like other Popes , before and after , Sixtus was abandoned by all his favorites as soon as the breath had left his body , and so systematic had been their plundering that the only vessel Burckard could find in which to wash the body was a kitchen cauldron used for dishwashing , while for lack of a towel the poor Pope 's shirt had to be torn up to dry him . Next came the pacific Innocent VIII , during whose pontificate a strange visitor arrived in Rome . This was the Turkish Prince Djem , brother of Bajazet II , who , having escaped from the murderous emissaries of his brother , had fallen into the hands of the shrewd d'Aubusson , Master of the Knights of Rhodes , and had by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the Vatican far into the pontificate of the Borgia . He dressed always in Turkish costume , kept his eastern harem , received ambassadors from his royal brother , and grew marvellously fat in his captivity . Pope Innocent soon died , and Alexander VI came to the throne in 1492 . The diary takes on a new complexion with this year , becoming more anecdotic and hence more interesting . The many-sided Borgia , here appears as an authority on highly technical matters of ritual and cult  --  a phase of him which rather surprises one . At this time Burckard was sent upon a political mission to the Aragon Court at Naples , and he made an archwological pilgrimage to Agnano , the Solfatara , Baia , Pozzuoli , and other environs of Naples . Stormy days were approaching , with the descent of Charles VIII of France and his army .

It is a curious view of the great preacher , but one that merits attention . The death of the Duke of Gandia is related at length , with every circumstance known at the time , and yet , though the author treats this subject boldly and gives us chapter and verse for a certain Vatican orgy in 1501 , he is unprejudiced enough to give us also a picture showing the magnificent courage of Alexander VI when threatened by shipwreck . The Borgia , however , was nearing his end , and in midsummer of 1503 he died . Burckard performed the last rites for his black and bloated body , and the sodden mass that had been God 's Vicar was laid away in Saint Peter 's with the imposing ceremonial of the Roman Church .

EDITH ANDREWS . Capri . " ARMAGEDDON " AND " PARADISE LOST . " To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The admirers of " Paolo and Francesca " and " Herod " will probably derive little but disappointment and regret from Stephen Phillips 's latest effort , " Armageddon " ; yet to the student of literary history the work is by no means without interest . All readers will agree , however , that the Prologue and Epilogue , which are laid in Hell , are the most significant parts of the drama . The Prologue is patently imitated from the debate between Satan and his followers in the second book of " Paradise Lost . " There are similar demoniacal conferences in " Paradise Regained , " but these are briefer and less impressive . and it is possible that Mr. Phillips never read them . In the Prologue to " Armageddon , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan , whom each poet pictures as seated on a throne from which he rules with despotic sway , Beelzebub , Moloch , and Bella ! . The similarity is not merely a matter of names , however , for each of Mr. Phillips 's fallen angels preserves the character he had in the Puritan epic , and Belial even keeps his deferential , oily manner of speaking . As in " Paradise Lost , " the sentiments of this sensuous , ease-loving spirit are delivered immediately after those of Moloch , to which they are somewhat opposed . Belial 's address begins thus : 0 Lords , I scarcely know , if now I rise In order , to address this full conclave , I , Lord of Lies ; nor would I seem to alight The ancient , grand prerogative of Force . It is always illuminating to watch the suitors for literary fame attempt the bow of some earlier Ulysses , and accordingly " Armageddon " is worth reading simply for the heightened appreciation it gives of the greatness of its original . For Mr. Phillips 's pandemoniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton . There is no debate , no clash of opposing opinions ; Satan simply announces what is to be done , Moloch rejoices at the news , and Belial and Remorse speak apparently for the pleasure of speaking . Furthermore , Milton 's intensely real Satan has degenerated into a dull abstraction , and his subtle , imaginative , and poetic Belial receives such lines as : With deference I propose that I convey To Earth my swollen , bilious Bureau. ? . . Great Landlord , I complain not , but of late I feel through crevices a draught of truth . The thought provokes a spiritual sweat . . . Again then I submit , I play my part . There is little or nothing in this blank verse to indicate any influence from the style , diction , or prosody of " Paradise Lost " ; yet the following lines will show that " Armageddon " is not without the inversions , the appositives , the use of adjectives for adverbs , and traces of the organ tone which distinguish Milton 's work . Spirit , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread of mutiny . . . But the main field and region of grand war Disputed lies , an indecisive plain . . . Splendid is Force , but solitary falls And self-defeated , unrelieved by lies . The most surprising feature of Mr. Phillips 's drama , however , is its unconscious revival of a device once popular in narrative noetry . During the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries , the stereotyped formula for the " machinery " and plot of the epics which were then the vogue was to have Satan , finding things on earth going against him ( often because of the unexampled goodness and greatness of England 's rulers ) , summon a council of his angels to determine what was to be done . In these assemblies the speakers were almost invariably Beelzebub , Moloch , Belial , and Satan , one of whom usually suggested sending an evil spirit to earth to stir up the enemies of the good cause . This suggestion was adopted , the evil spirit dispatched , and , as a result of his activities , there ensued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . This is exactly the plan of " Armageddon . " Mr. Phillips , so far as I can recollect , is the first dramatist to make use of Milton 's pandemoniac council , but poets had borrowed it as early as 1695 . It furnished the machinery of Blackmore 's interminable epics , " Prince Arthur " ( 1695 ) , " King Arthur " ( 1697 ) , " Eliza " ( 1705 ) , " Alfred " ( 1723 ) , and at the same time was used by John Dennis in his elegy on Queen Mary , " The Count of Death " ( 1695 ) , and his heroic " Ramellies " ( 1706 ) . Cumberland revived it for his " Calvary " in 1792 , it was employed in Ogilvie 's " Britannia " and Thelwall 's " Edwin of Northumbria " in 1801 , in Hoyle 's " Exodus " in 1807 , in Herbert 's " Attila " in 1838 , and doubtless in a number of other poems which have not come to my attention . Though the use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert 's epic . Mr. Phillips probably knew none of these works which are so much like his own . Indeed , he may never have heard of any of them  --  a fact which it will be well for us who study sources and influences to bear in mind . RAYMOND D. H4VONS . Rochester . Old Saws and Modern In-stances ENGLISH LEVITY AND FRENCH SE-RIOUSNESS . To THS EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In an article in one of your recent issues on " England After Six Months of War , " Mr. James F. Muirhead makes an interesting comparison of the present attitudes of the English and French nations . These are his words : " It seems paradoxical to assert that our country is at this moment filing a new claim to the somewhat forgotten title of Merrie England , but in a sense this is almost literally true . Our French allies seem to have been immensely struck by the gaiete de cceur of Tommy Atkins in the field , just as we , too , have been struck by the somewhat unexpected gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The reputation of England for merrymaking is an old one , but the French have never been proverbially serious by comparison . It is therefore interesting to note that in the latter part of the twelfth century an observation somewhat similar to that of Mr. Muirhead was made by a French ecclesiastic . Petrus Cellensis , Bishop of Chartres , in writing to the monk Nicholas , of Saint Albans , says , " Nec indignetur Anglica levitas , si ea solidior sit Gallica maturitas , " and then , in a passage too long for quotation , he shows himself to be one of the pioneers in the study of the influence of environment on national temperament , for he holds that the frivolity of the English character is due to an aqueous atmosphere because England is an island , and that the seriousness of the French mind is a result of the sturdy mountains which are to be found in France .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I feel sure that during these last months , when all our papers have been so full of " frightfulness , " whether viewed as a distinct national policy or regarded simply as a necessary concomitant of modern warfare , with its amazing engines of destruction , some of your readers must have recalled the apt lines of Lucretius , V , 1305-7 : sic slid ex alio peperit discordia truth horribile bumanis ( mod aentibos asset in amnia , inque dies bells terroribus addicht augmen .

TO THE EDITOR OF , THE NATION : SIR : When the History of the Rise and Fall of Military Necessity shall have been written , Xenophon and the Ten Thousand will find a higher place in the estimation of the moral world than the recent invaders of Belgium . The latter , because the Belgians rightfully resisted the violation of their neutrality , laid waste the land , not to mention worse deeds .

TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Among the unique developments of the present war must be reckoned the proposal of certain self-appointed envoys to visit Europe , and to bring peace to the warring factions by pointing out a better way . Yet such a mission is not without parallel even in ancient times , as the following incident will show . When the victorious Flavians were closing in on Vitelhus , some regularly appointed envoys were sent out by the Emperor to see whether there was still any chance of malting terms . Speaking of this fact , Tacitus goes on to say ( Histories , Book III , Chap . 81 ) : To the envoys Musonius Rufus had attached himself .

H. C. NuTasim , Berkeley- , Cal . THE PLACE IN THE SUN . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : This phrase , like many other things which have been found useful in the present war , was not originated by Germans . Pascal seems to have first used it in the " Pensees " ( Article VI , 50 , ed . Havet ) : " Ce Chien est a mot , disorient ces pauvres enfants ; c'est ma place au soleil . Voila le commencement et l'image de l'usurpation de toute la terse. ? Possibly Pascal had in mind some recollection of Diogenes ; we do not know . But the fact that it was usurpation to assert absolute right to the " place in the sun " is striking . ' , Otto Ladendorf , " Historisches Sehlagwerterbuch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rousseau takes up the idea in his " Dlscours sur l'inegalltd , " le partie : " Le premier qui , ayant enclos un terrain , s'avisa de dire et trouva des gens assez simples pour le croire : Ceci est a moi , fut le vrai fondateur de la socidtd male . Que de crimes , de guesses , de meurtres , que de misfires et d'horreurs n'elit point dpargnds au genre humain celui qui , arrachant les pieux et comblant le fosse , eitt trio a ses semblables : Gardez-vous d'ecouter cet imposteur ; vous ales perdus et vous oubliez que les fruits sont a tons , et que la terre n'est a personnel " Here the expression itself is not used , but the influence and the attitude of mind are clear . Rousseau also speaks of a usurped right . It is interesting to quote here another of the Pensees , which does not contain the word " sun , " but does turn upon " place " : " Que l'on a bien fait de distinguer les hommes par l'extdrieur , plutOt que par les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadera la place a l'autre ? Le moins habile ? macs je suis aussi habile que lui ; 11 faudra se battre sur cela .

Nous voila en pair par ce moyen ; ce qui est le plus grand des biens . " ( " Pensdes , " article V , 6 . ) Later the expression " place au soleil " becomes quite common in French . Writers from Chateaubriand and Balzac to Marcelle Tinayre make use of it , the last , our contemporary , as the caption to her story , " Hello " : " J'ai mes droits a l'amour et ma place an soleil . " Littre defines : " Avoir sa place an soleil , recevoir comme les autres la chaleur et la lunaiare du soleil . " This is rather far from Pascal ! Larousse gives as a definition : Real estate . The expression seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl Hillebrand used it in 1882 , though Ladendorf thinks it was first used about twelve years earlier by Ludwig Bamberger , in a letter to a friend ( published in his Works , V , 51 , 1831 ) : " So lasset dem Anfang der Einheit , wie schlecht Ihr ihn immer haltet , seinen Spielraum and gbnnt ihni den Versuch , sich einen Platz an der Sonne zu verdienen . " It became popular in Germany after a speech by von Billow , December 6 , 1897 ? we here rely on Ladendorf . The most touching use of the expression is again French ?
