txt The first month of the new financial year is marked by the greatest imports in our history , ' $345,000,000 . In prewar years we were accustomed to import about one-third as much , more or less , and with greater difference in effect than - in - Formerly Imports signified ? that -- we were running in debt , and sometimes laying tipfuture trouble for ourselves . Often we imported largely after a panic , particularly gold . Now we are exporting gold , the . only nation able to export it , and are collecting debts instead of running up debts . We must wait for the details before It will be possible to say what changes there are- in ' the qwq that we are importing , from  - -  quarters Where our imports have been largest , and it - is to be . hoped that we have made new trade " connections on this continent . In any case , . it behooves. the gentlemen at Washington , who are talking about - tariff in the old-fashioned way , to ' take notice that conditions have changed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the old need for protection nu against pauper workers . It is as ab13urd now to protect many of ; our factory products as , it always was to protect our farm products . Also it is not good business to put difficulties in the way of - payment for goods sold . It tends ' to prevent future sales . It is less surprising that our exports have ceased to make new maximums . There ? have ? been difficUlties of transportation , we have stopped lending , and our chief customer has stopped borrowing . The result is - harrowing differences-in the value of the medium of payment during the time Of collection . Within less than a week exchange on London ha . fallen 14 cents and recovered 7 cents .

New York experience is understood to be little different . The remedy for Americans is to sell in dollars and buy in dollars until Washington finds a way to stabilize the exchange of goods , and as a corollary the exchange of currencies . The unbalancing of the goods trade is the cause , the disturbance in the relation of the pound to the dollar being merely the . effect . We can not export in billions and import in hundreds of millions without creating difficulties in payment for what we sell . There is no way of making the pound equal to the dollar at the par of exchange under such conditions . But if we are willing to trust our buyers they can , pay in either cash or goods at a more convenient time , and it then is not necessary to equalize the exchanges at the time of sale . The obscurity of the exchange shbject arises from thinking more of the currencies than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinery of the business , and it is not to be denied that it needs simplification . But if the thought is kept on the goods exchange , the matter is dearer , and the exchange of goods is the reality of the businesil.
