 | PRIOR to the dreadful war now raging in Europe , the whole of Christendom seemed to have gone mad on the subject of battleships ; even countries which our schoolboy geographies used to characterize as " semi-civilized " joining in the race for naval supremacy . The present hostilities have , to a certain extent , postponed the realization of these dreams for some of the minor Powers . The chief shipbuilding nations are doubtless too much engaged in increasing their own naval strength to supply the wants of others . The desire , however , exists practically everywhere , and everywhere the question is asked : What effect will this war have upon our own naval standing ? From this query the United States can not escape . Whether we approve or disapprove ; whether we desire that our fleet shall be , for example , second only to that of Great Britain , and are ready to make the sacrifices necessary to secure that place in the competition , the fact remains that we , too , are in the running ; and this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose confidence in a righteous cause makes them condemn what seems to them a wholly inexcusable waste of public funds . The object of this paper is not to discuss the wisdom of a policy upon which the nation has definitely embarked , but to help the layman in his efforts to reach a conclusion as to what a battleship really is or should be , and to a better understanding of the projects for new types which are brought forward with bewildering frequency . The term " battleship " is a modern abbreviation of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century " line of battleship , " a definition which is self-explanatory . Such a vessel was designed to be associated with others and to take her  | place in the line of battle , " in this respect differing from the frigate , for example , which usually acted alone or as scout and lookout for the fleet . To narrate the phases through which the battleship has passed since its first appearance as a floating battery at the siege of Sebastopol would require a lengthy volume , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain features in this evolution may with propriety ? indeed , must ? be briefly touched upon . These features embody the notion prevailing at any given period of how the ship should be handled in action . For example , after the battle of Lissa , the ram having achieved , and for a period retained , quite universal acceptance as a determining factor in naval engagements , ships were provided with spurs , and handiness in manoeuvring dictated their lines . The development of gun efficiency eventually showed that the chances of two such opposing vessels coming into contact were exceedingly small , and that one or the other would , in all probability , be put out of action before closing in to ramming distance . The ramshaped bow is still with us ; but no one ever expects to use it on an enemy . There are differing views and schools of thought as to the probable way a fleet action would be fought . One school , which believed that ships would engage in line abreast heading for the enemy , was for a time predominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to firing directly ahead and directly astern . All of these trends of naval thought can be traced by the curious through an examination of the various types that have been adopted from time to time , particularly in the British Navy ? which , by the way , possessed seagoing iron-clads thirty years before the first Texas ( our earliest modern battleship ) 1 came into being . The balance between gun-power and armor protection has , in its turn , presented a wonderful diversity . We see excessively thick armor associated with inadequate battery , or so concentrated that but a small portion of the ship 's vitals is really shot-proof ; or a stupendous battery carried by ships which are vulnerable to comparatively light projectiles . It is impossible to escape the conviction that , in such  | cases , the exact employment of vessels in battle has not been calmly and dispassionately thought out , and that too free a hand has been allowed the naval architect , who cares nothing about tactics , and whose only interest ( small blame to him ) is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier in gun-fire , of stouter sides , or all combined , than anything previously launched . The uncertainty in the professional mind as to how the battle would be waged is further reflected in what is known as the " battery distribution , " which has ranged over the whole gamut of possibilities . There are cases of the heaviest guns mounted aft and firing over the stern , as if escape from a pursuing enemy were the object ? a grotesque thought ; many more of the heaviest guns mounted forward , but capable also , of course , of discharge on either broadside . Gradually they became concentrated in two turrets , one towards the bow and one towards the stern ? delivering half their weight of projectiles ahead or astern and all on either hand . In the desire to secure a maximum fire , both ahead and astern , these turrets were not infrequently placed en echelon , the forward one being , let us say , on the starboard bow and the after one on the port quarter , each firing over the deck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became evident that this eccentric straining after an ideal defeated its own ends , and that , taking all things together , the best position for a turret was on the median line . While others had reached the same conclusion so far as the heaviest guns are concerned , we were the first to adopt this principle as absolutely governing the design , so that when , as in the Michigan and South Carolina ( completed in 1909 ) , we eliminated the intermediate battery of eight-inch and seven-inch guns carried by their predecessors , the Connecticut , Kansas , Rhode Island , etc. , concentrating the main battery into eight 12-inch guns in four turrets , we put the latter all on the median line , two forward and two aft , but the end ones a trifle lower than the others ( whose guns fire over them ) , so as to have four guns available ahead , four guns astern , and eight guns on the broadside . It is gratifying to know that our example in this respect has been followed by other nations without exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were turning out dreadnoughts and super-dreadnoughts , we felt compelled to meet and settle the question of the best placing  | of additional guns . Logically , if mounted on one ship , they should also have gone on the median line , but in a third horizontal plane higher than their neighbors . Doubtless for reasons of stability this latter condition was not fulfilled , and the extra turret in the North Dakota class was put on the lower plane , sacrificing that portion of its arc-of-fire which is blocked by the adjacent turret . The next step is perceived in the Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes with her twelve guns in six turrets . The Michigan 's disposition is adopted for the four at the extremities of the vessel ; the remaining two being placed en echelon , one on each side . On paper , at least , these last can fire ahead or astern and each on its own broadside direct , as well as across the deck , through a limited arc on the other broadside . As there are two of her class , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build three Michigans to carry these twenty-four 12-inch guns rather than the two Minas Geraes . In this respect , opinions differ , but I have no hesitation in stating that , in my opinion , Brazil made a grave mistake in putting all her guns into two rather than three hulls . The famous British Dreadnought , ' completed in October , 1906 , was a new departure in battleships . It was sought to embody in her design the maxima of battery power , protection and speed . She was given ten 12-inch guns in five turrets , ? none , however , firing over another , ? one forward and two aft on the median line , and two , abreast each other , at the sides . She can direct six of these guns ahead or astern and eight on either broadside . She has in an action " end on " ( something exceedingly improbable of occurrence ) , two more guns than the Michigan , the same number in broadside , and she can steam two and a half knots faster , ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trifling superiority she has had to pay a heavy price . Than the Michigan , she is seventy feet longer , nearly two thousand tons heavier , with main or belt armor an inch thinner and no such central casemate or superstructure for the welfare and comfort of her crew . I am not alone in believing the Michigan a more formidable vessel than the Dreadnought , possessing as she does equal weight of broadside fire , better  | protection , and probably greater handiness in manoeuvre . The advent of the Dreadnought was attended by a veritable panic in naval circles everywhere ; all previous ships were regarded as outclassed ; and to-day navies are compared solely by the number of dreadnoughts and superdreadnoughts they can muster . The new point of view , which dismisses former battleships as " obsolete , " may have been fostered by Great Britain for a political end , since she counts by the score excellent craft of the Lord Nelson , King Edward VII , Queen , Albemarle , Implacable classes , not to mention other types , of which the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any given number of minutes , and have in actual target practice made a vastly greater cumber of effective hits , than the Dreadnought ; but it may be that the advocates of the Dreadnought were sincere in considering her predecessors as thoroughly discredited . Of course , one hit by the Dreadnought 's 12-inch gun is more damaging than one from the Implacable 's 6-inch gun ( the Implacable carries four 12-inch guns as well ) ; but at ranges that enable armor to keep out 12-inch projectiles , an enormous pouring in of 9.2 , 8 , 7 and 6-inch shells must work havoc on unprotected parts of the vessel assailed , a fact abundantly demonstrated in the fight at Tsushima . I am not decrying the Dreadnought or arguing that older ships are better ; I am only pointing out that the latter constitute a reserve of immense value . Naval warfare , like nature , does not advance per saltum , and we must not be blinded by the glamor of any new proposition whose partisans find in it the all sufficient solution to a world-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Delaware , Utah , Arkansas and their twins ( for there are two vessels of each group ) , we sought to surpass the powers of the Dreadnought and her successors . Thus the Delaware and the Utah can bring ten 12-inch guns to bear on the broadside as against the Michigan 's eight , and they have from 2.2 to 2.5 knots more speed ; but again the price had to be paid . They are sixty feet longer , from 4,000 to 5,500 tons heavier , and their main armor belt one inch thinner . The Arkansas has available twelve 12-inch guns ( fifty per cent . more than the Michigan ) and two knots more speed , for which gain the inexorable laws of naval architecture demand their commensurate toll in 100 feet greater length , 10,000 tons more displacement , and the loss of an inch in the armor belt thick- ness . The New York and Texas are practically like the North Dakota in design , but their guns are of 14-inch calibre instead of twelve . The change in battery entails a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While other Powers have toyed with eccentric placing of turrets , we have held fast to basic principles and kept ours where they should be ? on the median line . The next pair of battleships , the Nevada and Oklahoma , are of the admirable Michigan type , while two of the turrets , the lower ones , contain three 14-inch guns each . The Pennsylvania and the Arizona carry twelve 14-inch guns in four triple gun turrets . Their displacement is 31,000 tons , 3,500 tons greater than the Nevada , which they closely resemble . The British seem indisposed to go to excessive size . The ships provided for in the estimates for 1915 are to displace less than 26,000 tons , except one of 27,500 tons , and are to carry eight 15-inch guns . Where we build two of a class , she builds from four to eight . It is interesting to note that only in her recent ships has she adopted the American scheme of all turrets on the median line , and that the five ships of the Queen Elizabeth type are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight 15-inch guns . The Iron Duke , flagship of her battle fleet , is of the New York and Texas type , but armed with 13.5 instead of 12-inch guns . Germany showed the same reluctance , but finally adopted it on her Markgraf and Ersatz Worth classes , the last of which , by the way , are supposed to carry eight 15-inch guns mounted as in the Michigan . The Italians and Austrians were quick to adopt the three-gun turret , while France is actually putting four guns into one turret . It seems proper at this point to call attention to facts which are but too generally overlooked by those who discuss this momentous problem : that the ship herself is nothing but a movable platform for the gun , and that her value depends primarily , I had almost said absolutely , upon the range , volume , and accuracy of her gun-fire . We talk about " obsolete ships " when in reality we mean obsolete guns . When Assistant Secretary Roosevelt asked a number of naval officers which they would prefer , one Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they would fight the one Wyoming against twenty Oregons . So everybody jumped at the conclusion that the Oregon is worthless .  | At present she can , with impunity , be engaged beyond range of her own battery by the new guns of the Wyoming , but replace her short 13-inch guns with modern weapons and a different story might be told . It should never be forgotten that it is the gun , and the gun alone , which has determined the issue in naval battles . If we lay down the principal characteristics which a battleship should present , we shall be in a position to test the variations manifested in recent constructions , especially abroad , and decide in a general way upon their value . The military traits of a battleship are offensive strength ( the ability to deliver hard blows ) , and defensive strength ( the ability to stand severe punishment ) . Second to these are speed , the capacity to cover long distances without recoaling ( for a ship that is engaged in replenishing her bunkers is a ship non-existent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last term are included berthing space , deck room for exercise , and the countless arrangements on board for taking care of the personnel in sickness and in health . It is only robust and well men who count ? every man laid up by illness is a man lost to the battle . The decisive engagement may not last thirty minutes , but the precedent campaign may be and has been of many months ' duration . During this period of strain it is imperatively necessary to keep the bodies strong and healthy , the spirits bright and cheerful , that officers and men may go into action fresh , hearty and confident in themselves . For this reason I regard habitability as an exceedingly important military quality . It was , in the old days , a maxim that " the ship is built to fight her fellow , " but an analysis of vessels actually constructed would seem to prove that the maxim has more often been honored in the breach than in the observance . Taking the thickness of the armor likely to be encountered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the penetration which may reasonably be expected at a distance regarded by naval experts as probable in coming wars , we can determine the calibre of the gun capable of piercing it under the assumed conditions . It will be perceived that there are three factors entering into the question : the thickness of the belt , the calibre of the gun attacking it , and the range or distance between the ships engaged , affecting , as it does , the velocity and therefore the striking force of the shot .  | Fix any two of these factors and the third can readily be determined . Until recently , 6,000 or 8,000 yards were considered the probable extreme limits of engagement , and the 12-inch gun large enough for all practical purposes , but actual battles have been fought at 18,000 yards . Profitably to engage at that range an Iron Duke carrying a 12-inch belt , we should mount guns whose projectiles can , not infrequently , perforate the belt at the incredible distance of nine nautical ( ten statute ) miles . Nothing now afloat can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance of penetrating unless the ships came within seven miles of each other . May we not thin this armor and put the weight saved into other armor or more battery power ? It should not be forgotten that the bigger the shell , the larger its explosive charge , the variation being as the cube of the calibre , or , as between a 15-inch and a 12-inch shell , nearly two to one . No wonder guns on board ship are growing ! We have seen that the Michigan type can carry eight 12-inch guns on a moderate displacement and moderate length . It may be well to state that merchant vessels are rated by their " tonnage " or cargo capacity , a form of measurement inapplicable to men-of-war for which the gauge of size is " displacement , " or the total weight of the ship and all her contents , animate and inanimate . Formerly , if we wanted more guns we had to have more turrets and a longer ship , resulting in a larger target for shells and torpedoes ; now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of lengthening the ship . The reversion to our Michigan type in our last designs is an encouraging symptom . The additional guns , being placed three in one turret , are economically mounted , and undue length of vessel is avoided . The massing of guns in the old three-deckers was due to a desire for concentration . Their guns had so short a range that concentration of projectiles on the target could be secured only by concentrating the guns themselves . To-day , with almost limitless range , the guns may be spread out to any desired extent without sacrifice of projectile concentration . It is by no means certain that fewer guns on board each ship , more ships , and a longer " line of battle , " may not be desirable . Involving , as it does , the question of " fire control , " this point can not here be satisfactorily discussed . To many laymen an armored vessel is like the knight of  | old encased in steel from head to foot . Nothing could be further from the fact . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so protected , but a large part of the ship is not protected at all . Against this part smaller guns are entirely effective . Damage here is dangerous through demoralization of the crew , through wrecking ventilators , air shafts and funnels , through causing fire . History tells us that ships are beaten by these agencies , and that very few are actually sunk by projectiles . Herein lies the value of the secondary battery of , say , 5-inch or 6-inch guns of the pre-Dreadnought type of vessel . Some careful students of naval warfare deprecate the elimination of the secondary battery with its great use as a protection , and prefer more such guns to heavier armor . Whether they are right it will be interesting to learn from events . It would seem as if , in attempting to rival other Powers in their development of the individual vessel , these essential facts have been almost universally ignored : that single-ship actions are a thing of the past ; that naval battles in the future will be settled by fleets ; that each ship should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one unit in harmony with the other units ; that general similarity of these units in tactical qualities ( turning power and speed ) and battery disposition are essential to effective handling and employment of the fleet as a whole ; that a couple of Leviathans , in spite of their great power , may hinder rather than help ; that even a fleet of Leviathans might not prevail over a fleet of smaller vessels of a well balanced type mounting a like number of guns ; that practically the same amount of money would buy more Michigans , for example , than Leviathans , both bringing an equal number of guns into the line of battle ; that a Michigan could be better spared from the fleet for coaling or repairs than a Leviathan ; that it is not always wise to put many eggs in one basket . In rather desultory fashion I have pointed out the relation which subsists between armor thickness and gun calibre , these , with the number and disposition of the guns , being the military characteristics presented by the battleship . Closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preponderance of naval opinion is , unquestionably , that speed is an important quality and that , roughly speaking , the more speed a ship has the better . I admit the advantage speed offers in the ability to get to the scene of action promptly ;  | but this advantage may not , in fact , be worth the price paid for it . Indeed , if your enemy gets away before you arrive he is already thrashed . To him , seeking to avoid action , superior speed is sine qua non . If he wants to fight he will wait for you , and then quick , hard hitting and the ability to withstand his return blows will determine the result ? not speed . It is possible that , through lack of speed , you may not get to the place until the enemy has gone there , carried out his own plan and sailed away , but this case is exceedingly rare if we may believe history . The true objective is , habitually , the enemy 's fleet . The combatant who loses sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are always two ends to a fleet 's line of battle . If you can not easily reach the head , then slow down and go for the tail . Your adversary must , as a rule , follow your motions and prove that it is the slower fleet and not the faster which sets the pace in a naval engagement . In battle , unless your superiority in speed is fifty per cent. , you will have no particular tactical advantage . Of all the qualities in a ship none is so fickle as speed ; at any moment a bearing may get hot or a pump break down or a boiler tube blow out , and stop or slow down she must and does . In the fight off Santiago , our newest and fastest ship , far from approaching her trial speed of 17.1 knots , could only limp along at , as I understand , about nine knots an hour . Had she done only fifteen knots , the Oregon would not have carried off the honors of that day . At Tsushima , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian fleet was not forthcoming . How gladly would the commander have welcomed , on that fatal day , the extra inches of armor or the heavier gun-fire which had been sacrificed for the twenty knots he wanted for escaping and never could obtain ! Off the Falklands last January , the 27-knot Invincible made but 24 knots according to unofficial accounts . It is the slowest vessel in the fleet which sets the pace . In the pre-Dreadnought days our later ships had a designed speed of about eighteen knots ; but the appearance on the scene of this remarkable 21-knot vessel was the signal for naval architects everywhere to design ships equally fast . On our side of the Atlantic , the Delaware was the reply , and her excess knots over those of her forerunners were paid for by thinner armor along the water line . It must be remem- bered that , having fixed upon the battery and the armor , you can have any speed you like , but the faster the ship the bigger she must be . A Leviathan of thirty knots is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tons . There is , of course , a natural and normal increase of speed with increase of size and especially in length , for the bigger the ship the less horsepower is required to propel a ton of displacement at any given rate . I mention that qualification lest it be objected that I have ignored the fact that , other things being equal , the larger ship is of necessity the faster . What gain comes legitimately I am ready to accept , but I deprecate the gain which is not legitimate . The actions off the Falkland Islands and in the North Sea during the present war throw no light upon the subject further than to show the value of speed in escape ? something never in question . The successes achieved there , and off Coronel , were due to the gun and the gunner . Until opposing battleships come into collision , it is wise to hold our judgment in suspense . We are in no position to laugh at others , however , for did we not , in blind imitation of foreign navies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students of naval affairs , continue to add armored cruisers to our fleet year after year ? Even when Cervera 's defeat off Santiago proved conclusively ( if proof were indeed needed ) that armored cruisers are no match for battleships , we kept gaily on in our false path and constructed the former when , at the same price , we could have had the latter . Had any attention been paid to the opposition , we should now have , instead of ten lightly-clad armored cruisers , as many battleships , nearly enough indeed to form a second battle fleet able to dominate the Pacific Ocean . We purged our system of this madness six or eight years ago , but the evil results of the seizure still linger . Events thus far during the war in Europe have largely diverted attention from the battleship towards the battlecruiser and the submarine . As to the first , it is legitimate to contend that if A has heavily armed and very swift vessels , B , his possible enemy , ought to have some of the same class with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a variety of tools in order to be able to undertake any work that may be brought to it , so a navy needs several types of craft that it may perform its various tasks  | promptly and efficiently . The battle-cruiser is not such a vessel as should ordinarily be called upon to " lie in the line of battle , " however useful on occasion and as a scout at all times . A few we may well covet , but not one at the expense of the real monarch of the seas , the battleship . In one sense , it may be said that , from the technical standpoint , this war is between the battleship and the submarine . However decided , the latter has certainly come to stay . Of that there can be no doubt . No close student of the present war can fail to observe that it has lately taken on the role of a gun vessel in addition to that of a torpedo vessel . I have long known confidentially that it has been extensively used as a scout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is announced in Brassey 's last issue of the Naval Annual . The submarine has brought new problems into naval tactics which must gravely influence the handling of the battleship . Its power of destruction is beyond estimate ? as it has proved already in many instances . Linked with that power is the twin quality of almost total invisibility ? a formidable combination , surely . It labors , however , under two disadvantages : its invisibility is not entirely complete ? it must at least lift its periscope above the water in order to recognize its target ; and it is extremely vulnerable . Any rupture of its skin spells ruin . I am not at liberty to state the number of German submarines already captured or destroyed . It is so large that one must unstintedly admire the courage of their officers and seamen . Tactically , its influence on the battleship has been to make the latter , when at rest , intimately dependent on external means of defense , such as nets , torpedo boats , etc. , and probably to hamper its free movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain had but his visible enemy to consider ; to-day , he must be on his guard against an unseen , under-water foe . That ships can ever be so built as to survive the successful planting by a submarine of even one modern torpedo seems unlikely , but a minuter subdivision of their hulls may well be expected in future constructions in the hope of minimizing the risk of complete destruction . To Americans , it must be an interesting reflection that the present battles for supremacy in the air and beneath the surface of the water are based upon the inventions of their countrymen ? Bushnell , Holland , and Wright .
