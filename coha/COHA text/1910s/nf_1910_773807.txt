But therewith came in a messenger from the rakshasa general calling Ravana to the battle , and he turned to the field of war ; and when he left , the head and bow immediately vanished , and Sita knew them to have been but counterfeits and vain illusions . Rama Wounded Now Vibhishana 's four rakshasa followers had spied on Lanka , and knew the disposition of Ravana 's forces ; and Rama laid siege to the four gates of Lanka accordingly , establishing the monkey Nila at the eastern gate , guarded by the rakshasa general Prahasta ; Angada at the western gate , guarded by Mahaparshwa ; Hanuman at the southern gate , guarded by Prince Indrajit ; and himself attacked the north gate , guarded by Ravana . Then Rama sent Angada as an envoy to Ravana , challenging him to the fight ; but Ravana , forgetting the respect due to an envoy , would have slain him ; and Angada sprang away and broke the palace roof , and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarmed about the walls , flooding the moat and striking terror into the hearts of the rakshasas ; scaling parties climbed the walls and battered down the gates with trees and stones , shouting " Victory for Rama and for Sugriva ! " The rakshasas sallied forth in turn with horrid trumpetings and joined in battle with the monkeys , and all the air was filled with the noise of fighting , and terrible confusion arose of friend and foe and man and beast , and the earth was strewn with flesh and wet with gore . Thus an equal battle raged till evening ; but the rakshasas waited for the night , and eagerly desired the setting of the sun , for night is the rakshasas ' time of strongest might . So night fell , and the demons ranged , devouring monkeys by thousands . 8o Rama Wounded Then those of Rama 's party rallied and for a time prevailed , and Indrajit was beaten back . But he , resorting to his magic , became invisible , and showered deadly wounding arrows upon Rama and Lakshman ; fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell helpless to the ground , covered with a thousand wounds . Sugriva , Hanuman , Vibhishana , and all the leaders of the monkeys stood round about those wounded heroes with tear-filled eyes ; but Indrajit , unseen of any save his uncle Vibhishana , rejoiced , and let fly many a shaft that wounded Hanuman and Nila and Jambavan . Then Indrajit returned to Lanka as a victor , and his father welcomed him ; and for a while the fighting ceased . Now Vibhishana rallied the frightened monkeys , and comforted Sugriva , saying : This is no time for giving way to grief . Rama is not dying . Do thou gather the forces and inspire them with fresh hope . " But the monkeys were panic-stricken , and if even a straw moved they deemed it to be a rakshasa . And Ravana meanwhile , taking Sita on his car , showed to her Rama and Lakshman lying on the field , senseless and pierced with many arrows , wounded and lying in the dust ; and she deemed them to be dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anka . Meanwhile Rama came to himself , and seeing Lakshman seeming to be dead , he made great lamentation , and praising what the monkeys had done , though unsuccessful , he gave them leave to go whither they would across the bridge and seek their homes . And Vibhishana , too , had no more taste for battle or desire for the throne of Lanka . But Sugriva comforted them and gave them fresh courage , and the monkey-chief Sushena told of a magic herb that grows by the Milky Ocean , and can restore the dead to // Myths of the Hindus Buddhists life , " and let the Wind-god 's son go thither for it , " he said . The Corning of Garuda But as he spoke a stormy wind arose , lashing the sea and shaking the very mountains , and suddenly the monkeys beheld Garuda sailing through the air like a flaming fire . As Garuda came nigh , the arrows fell from the wounded heroes like frightened serpents darting away ; and when he bent in salutation and touched their faces with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to their former strength and radiance , and more . Then Rama questioned Garuda who he was , and he answered : " I am thy friend , thy life free-ranging external to thyself , Garuda , and I have come to aid thee , hearing that thou wert bound by the magic shafts of Indrajit . Now thou shouldst take warning how the rakshasas fight with cunning and magic , and thou shouldst never trust them in the field . I take my way : thou needst not wonder how friendship came to be between us ; thou shalt know all after the battle is achieved . Surely thou shalt slay Ravana and win back Sita . " With this Garuda , embracing Rama and Lakshman , embracing , too , the monkey . chiefs , rose into the sky and sailed away upon the wind . Then the monkey-chiefs , seeing Rama and Lakshman restored to life and power , began to roar and frisked their tails ; drums and kettledrums were struck , and seizing trees , hundreds and thousands of monkeys advanced again upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth under Dhumraksha ( " Grey-eye " ) , and there was a deadly onset . The monkeys bit and tore and fought with trees and stones , and the rakshasas killed and wounded them with arrows and cleft them with their axes and crushed 82 Heavy Fighting them with their maces . Then seeing the monkeys hard beset , Hanuman , seizing a heavy rock , advanced on Dhumraksha , and , casting it down upon his car , crushed it to dust ; then Hanuman laid about him lustily , and armed with a mountain-top he rushed on Dhumraksha again . Rut the rakshasa brought down his mace on Hanuman 's head and wounded him sore ; then Hanuman , heedless of the wound , let fly the mountain-top at Dhumraksha , and crushed him to the ground like a falling hill . Seeing their leader slain , the rakshasas retired . Heavy Fighting Short was the peace ere Ravana sent out another leader of the rakshasas , the deadly Thunder-tooth ; him Angada met as he drove the monkey host before him , piercing five and nine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he severed the demon 's neck and laid him low . Then Ravana sent out Akampana ( " Unconquerable " ) , and he was slain by Hanuman , with all his host . Then Ravana was somewhat shaken and foreboded ill , but he sent for Prahasta ( " Long-hand " ) , his foremost general ; and he gathered another host , and sallied forth upon a splendid car by the eastern gate , accompanied by his counsellors , Man-slayer and Noisy-throat and Tall . That encounter was the death of many hundred rakshasas and monkeys , and the occasion of many a deed of heroism . Prahasta from his shining car sped thousands of monkeyslaying shafts , and a very river of blood flowed between the opposing hosts . Then Nila , Agni 's son , brandishing an uptorn tree , rushed on Prahasta ; but he wounded the monkey with showers of arrows . At last his bow was shattered in the conflict , and the twain fought hand to hand , with tooth and nail . Then Prahasta struck Nila a 83 Myths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nila flung a tall tree at Prahasta 's breast ; but he lightly avoided that and rushed on Nila . Then Nila flung a mighty crag at the rakshasa , shattering his head , so that he fell slain . The rakshasa host drew back ; like water rushing through a broken dyke , they melted away and entered Lanka , stricken with grief and fear . Ravana was inflamed with wrath to learn of Prahasta 's death , and his heart sank , but he boasted that he would himself destroy Rama and Lakshman with a thousand shafts , and mounted his own shining car and led a rakshasa host against the monkeys ; he seemed like the Destroyer himself , accompanied by ghosts and fleshdevouring monsters with burning eyes . Big-belly and Goblin and Man-destroyer and Three-heads , fighters with mountain-peaks and flaming maces , came with Ravana . But he , when they were face to face with the besiegers , dismissed the host to take their ease , and himself advanced to fight alone . Then first Sugriva hurled a mountain-top at him , but Ravana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell vainly to the earth , and he sped a deadly flaming shaft at the monkey-king that bore him to the ground groaning with pain . Then other monkey-chiefs together rushed at Ravana , but these in like fashion he destroyed , so that they cried to Rama for help . Lakshman prayed for that battle , and Rama granted him , and he took the field ; but already Hanuman was pressing Ravana hard , so that he cried : Well done , monkey ; thou art a foe in whom I may rejoice . " Therewith he struck the Wind-god 's son a heavy blow so that he shuddered and fell back , and Ravana turned to fight with Nila . But the Fire-god 's son , flaming with anger , sprang on to Ravana 's car and darted like fire from point to point ; and Ravana 's 84 Pot-ear Awakened heart sank , but he took a deadly shaft and aimed at Nila , and laid him low , at the very point of death . But then Iakshman took up the battle , and showers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sorely wounded ; and a flaming dart struck Rama 's brother down . Then Ravana seized him ; but he that could raise Himalaya could not lift Lakshman from the ground , for he remembered that he was a very part of Vishnu himself , and he stayed immovable . Then Hanuman returned and struck the rakshasa king a staggering blow so that he fell back , senseless and bleeding , on the platform of his car ; and Hanuman lifted Lakshman easily and bore him away to Rama . Nor was it long before both Ravana and Lakshman came to their senses ; and Rama , mounted upon Hanuman 's back , engaged in a dreadful battle with the king of Lanka . Rama destroyed his car , and wounded Ravana with bolts , and cut his crown atwain with a fiery disc , and struck him with an arrow , so that he grew weak and faint ; then , sparing his life , he sent him back to Lanka , saying : Thou hast accomplished deeds of heroism , and I see thee faint ; do thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in another battle . " So the generous Rama spared his foe , and all the gods and quarters and the seas and creatures of earth rejoiced to see the rakshasa king cast down . Pot-ear Awakened Now Ravana bethought him of his brother Kumbhakarna ( " Pot-ear " ) . He would ever sleep , now six , now eight , now ten months at a time , and would wake only to gorge , and then sleep again . But he was the hardest fighter and the very best of the rakshasas in battle ; and now he had already slept nine months , when Ravana sent 85 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists a host to waken him . They found him sleeping in his cave ; he lay like a mountain , drunk with sleep , and vast as Hell , his rank breath sweeping all before him , smelling of blood and fat . The rakshasas made ready for him heaps of deer and buffaloes , steaming rice and jars of blood , mountains of food piled up as high as Meru ; then set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat on drums , so that the very birds in the sky fell dead of fear ; but Pot-ear slept the harder , and the rakshasas could hardly stand against the tornado of his breath . Then they girded their cloths the tighter , and ten thousand of them yelled together , and struck heavy blows at him with logs of wood , and beat a thousand kettledrums at once . Then they waxed angrier , and set themselves to work in earnest ; some bit his ears , some poured a thousand pots of water in them , some wounded him with spears and maces , and some drove a thousand elephants against him . Therewith at last he woke , and yawned , and yawned again , so that a very storm was raging ; and the pangs of hunger assailed him , and he looked about for food . Then he beheld the feast , and fell to heartily , and ate and drank ; and when the rakshasas thought him filled , they stood around him and bowed , and informed him of all that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already half asleep again , roused himself , and boasted that he would regale the rakshasas with an abundant feast of monkey flesh and blood ; " and myself shall swill the blood of Rama and Lakshman , " said he . So Pot-ear bathed , and , going to his brother , bade him take heart . He drank two thousand flasks of wine , and marched out like a moving mountain , clad in golden mail , to attack the monkeys . The monkeys fled in terror , but Pot-ear caught them and rushed about devouring them 86 Rakshasa Successes by handfuls , so that the blood and fat dripped from his mouth . Then Rama , with Hanuman and Angada and other brave monkeys , fell on him with trees and mountaintops , swarming round him like clouds about a mountain ; and Pot-ear , half asleep as yet , began to rouse himself and fight in earnest . Hanuman , from the sky , cast down the mountain-peaks on him ; but he swallowed twenty and thirty monkeys at a mouthful , and slew them by hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side to side . Pot-ear Slain Then Pot-ear sped a second deadly shaft at Hanuman ; but he caught it and broke it with his hands , and all the monkeys shouted , so that the rakshasa was daunted and turned away . But therewith Pot-ear flung a mountain-top and struck Sugriva down , and he lifted him and carried him away . The monkeys were scattered and their king a prisoner . But Sugriva roused himself and turned on Pot-ear and wounded him and got away ; and the battle was joined again , and Lakshman fought against the rakshasa . Then Rama took up the battle , and wounded his foe with many shafts , and shot away an arm , destroying a hundred monkeys in its fall . Then with a second shaft he cut away the other arm , and with two keen-edged discs he cut away the demon 's legs , and with a shaft of Indra he struck away his head ; and he fell like a great hill and crashed down into the sea , and the gods and heroes rejoiced . Rakshasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Prince Indrajit came to his father and vowed to slay Rama and 87 Myths of the Hindus Y Buddhists Lakshman that day , and he sallied forth . But first he offered libations unto Fire , and sacrificed a goat ; and the bright , smokeless Fire-god , with his flickering tongue , rose up to take the offering , and he bestowed a Brahma weapon on Indrajit , and blessed his bow and car with charms . Armed with that weapon , Indrajit slew countless hosts of monkeys , and laid low Sugriva and Angada and Jambavan and Nila and other chiefs , but himself remained invisible . Then Rama , seeing him thus weaponed and unassailable , counselled a semblance of defeat . And Indrajit returned victorious to Lanka . Hanuman fetches Healing Herbs Then Vibhishana and Hanuman ranged the field , beholding thousands of slain and wounded , a horrid sight and grim ; and they came nigh to the king of bears , Jambavan , and asked if he yet lived . He answered faintly , recognizing Vibhishana 's voice , and asked if I-Ianuman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Jambavan rejoiced , and despite his wounds he spoke to the Wind-god 's son : Do thou labour for this host of bears and monkeys , for only thou canst save them . Thou shalt bound over the sea , and reach Himalaya , king of mountains , and bring thence the four life-giving herbs that grow on him , and return forthwith with healing for the monkey host . " Then Hanuman roared and sprang ; and he passed across the sea and over hills and woods and rivers and cities till he came to Himalaya and beheld its hermitages . He ranged the mountain , but the herbs were hidden from him ; and angered and impatient , Hanuman rooted up the whole mountain and sprang with it into the air and 88 Ravana 's Son is Killed returned to Lanka , welcomed by all the host . And the slain and wounded monkeys rose up whole , as if from restful sleep , healed by the savour of the four medicinal herbs . But all the slain rakshasas had been cast into the sea . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka . Now Sugriva , perceiving that few rakshasas lived to guard the city , stormed the gates , and a host of monkeys bearing flaming brands entered and burnt and ravaged her . The second night had now come on , and the burning city glowed in the darkness , like a mountain blazing with forest fires . But Ravana sent out a host against the monkeys time and again . First Kumbha and Nikumbha led the rakshasas , and were slain in deadly battle ; then Maharaksha , son of Khara , in turn was slain , and Indrajit went out again . He fought invisible as ever , and sorely wounded Rama and Lakshman . Then Indrajit retired , and came forth again , riding on a car with an illusory magic figure of Sita ; and he rode up and down the field , holding her by the hair and striking her , and he cut her down in the sight of all the monkey host . Hanuman , believing in the false show , stayed the battle and brought the news to Rama ; and Rama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root . But while they grieved , Indrajit went to the altar at Nikhumbila to make sacrifices to the god of Fire . Rdvana 's Son is Killed Meanwhile Vibhishana came to Rama and found him overwhelmed with grief , and Lakshman told him that Sita had been slain by Indrajit . But Vibhishana guessed this to have been a vain show , less possible than for the ocean to be dried up . " It is a device , " he said , to delay the monkey army till Indrajit shall have completed 89 Myths of the Hindus e Buddhists a sacrifice to Fire and have won as a boon to be invincible in battle . Therefore grieve not , but hasten to prevent his offerings , lest the very gods be in danger if he complete them . " Then Rama rose , and with Lakshman and Vibhishana pursued the son of Ravana ; and they overtook him ere he reached Nikhumbila , mounted on a fiery car . Then befell the worst and fiercest of conflicts that had yet been : Lakshman bore the brunt of that battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the birds and snakes , protected Lakshman from the deadly shafts . And this was at last the manner of Indrajit 's death : Lakshman took an Indra shaft , and making an act of truth , he prayed its indwelling deity : " If Rama be righteous and truthful , the first of all men in heroism , then slay this son of Ravana " ; and drawing the straight-speeding arrow to his ear , he loosed it , and it severed the rakshasa 's neck , that head and trunk fell to the ground , and all the rakshasas , seeing their leader slain , cast down their arms and fled . And all the monkeys rejoiced , for no rakshasa hero remained alive save Ravana himself . Then Rama welcomed the wounded Lakshman with great affection , and ordered Sushena to administer medicines to him and to the wounded monkeys ; and the monkey-chief applied a potent drug to Lakshman 's nose , and , smelling it , the outward-going of his life was stayed , and he was healed . Bitterly Ravana grieved for his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its forests , seem to me vacant , " he cried , " since thou , my hero , hast gone to the abode of Yama , who shouldst have performed my funeral rites , not I thine " ; and he burned with rage and sorrow . Then he determined to slay Sita in revenge , but his good counsellor Suparshwa held him back , saying : Thou mayst not slay a woman ; but when Rama is slain thou shalt possess her . " 90 Ravana 's Fury All Lanka was resounding with the lamentations of the rakshasas for the rakshasas slain in battle , and Ravana sat in fury , devising means to conquer Rama : he gnashed his teeth and bit his lips and laughed , and went with Bigbelly and Squint-eye and Great-flank to the field of battle , followed by the last of the demon army , and boasting : " I shall make an end of Rama and Lakshman to-day . " Ravana 's Fury Nor could the monkeys stand before him , but were destroyed like flies in fire ; but Sugriva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ; and therewith both armies joined again , and there was deadly slaughter on either hand , and either army shrank like a pond in summer . Next Big-belly was slain by Sugriva , and Angada was the death of Great-flank , so that the monkeys roared with triumph . But now Ravana came on , bearing a Brahma weapon , and scattering the monkeys right and left . I le stayed not ere he came to the sons of Dasharatha : he took his way where Rama stood aside , with great eyes like the petals of a lotus , long of arm , unconquerable , holding a bow so huge it seemed to be painted on the sky . Rama set arrows to the bow and drew the string , so that a thousand rakshasas died of terror when they heard it twang ; and there began a deadly battle between the heroes . Those arrows pierced the king of Lanka like five-hooded serpents , and fell hissing to the ground ; but Ravana lifted up a dreadful asura weapon , and let fly at Rama a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gaping mouths like wolves . Rama answered these with shafts faced like the sun and stars , like meteors or lightning flashes , destroying the shafts of Ravana . Then Ravana 91 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists fought with other celestial weapons , and he lifted a Rudra shaft , irresistible and flaming , hung with eight noisy bells , and hurled it at Vibhishana ; but Lakshman came before it , saving Vibhishana from death . Rama , seeing that weapon falling upon Lakshman , prayed it : " Peace be to Lakshman ! Be thou frustrated , and let thy energy depart " ; but the blazing dart struck Lakshman 's breast and laid him low , nor could any monkey draw the shaft out of him . Rama stooped and drew it forth and broke it in twain , and then , albeit grieved out of measure for Lakshman and angered by his grief , Rama called to Hanuman and Sugriva , saying : " Now is the time appointed come at last . To-day I shall accomplish a deed of which all men and gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports a living creature . To-day my sorrow shall have an end , and all that for which I have laboured shall come to pass . " Then Rama set his mind upon the battle , but Hanuman went again to Himalaya and brought the mount of healing herbs for Lakshman , and Sushena took the life-giving plant and made Lakshman to smell its savour , so that he rose up whole and well ; and Lakshman embraced his brother , and urged him to achieve his promise that very day . Sakra sent down from Heaven his car and his charioteer , named Matali , to aid the son of Dasharatha in his fight , and Rama went about and greeted it , and , mounting upon it , seemed to light the whole world with his splendour . But Ravana loosed at him a rakshasa weapon , and its golden shafts , with fiery faces vomiting flames , poured over Rama from every side and changed to venomous serpents . But Rama took a Garuda weapon and loosed a flight of golden arrows , changing at will to birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92 Ravana Slain Then the presiding deities of all the weapons came to stand by Rama , and what with this auspicious omen and other happy signs , Rama began to harass Ravana sorely , and wounded him , so that his charioteer , beholding him as if at the point of death , turned away from the field of battle . " Then the revered Agastya , come thither with the gods to witness the defeat of Ravana , drew near to Rama and taught him : Rama , Rama , great-armed hero , my child , hearken to the eternal secret , the Heart of the Sun , whereby thou mayst overcome every foe . Do thou worship Sun , lord of the world , in whom dwells the spirit of all the gods . Hail ! Hail ! 0 thousand-rayed , hail to Aditya ! Thou wakener of the lotus ! Thou source of life and death , destroyer of all darkness , light of the soul , who wakest when all sleep , and dwellest in every heart 1 Thou art the gods and every sacrifice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lord of the universe , and thou shalt conquer Ravana to-day . " Rdvana Slain Then Rama hymned the Sun , and purified himself with water-sippings , and was glad ; and he turned to deal with Ravana , for the rakshasa had come to himself again and was eager for the battle . Each like a flaming lion fought the other ; head after head of the Ten-necked One did Rama cut away with his deadly arrows , but new heads ever rose in place of those cut off , and Ravana 's death seemed nowise nearer than before ? the arrows that had slain Mancha and Khara and Vali could not take the king of Lanka 's life away . Then Rama took up the Brahma weapon given to him by Agastya : the Wind lay in its wings , the Sun and Fire in its head , in its mass the weight of Meru and Mandara . Blessing that shaft with 93 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists Vedic mantras , Rama set it on his bow and loosed it , and it sped to its appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed in blood , returned and entered Rama 's quiver humbly . Thus was the lord of the rakshasas slain , and the gods rained flowers on Rama 's car and chanted hymns of praise , for their desired end was now accomplished ? that end for which alone Vishnu had taken human form . The heavens were at peace , the air grew clear and bright , and the sun shone cloudless on the field of battle . Ravana Mourned But Vibhishana lamented for his brother sadly , and Rama comforted him , saying : " A hero slain in battle should not be mourned . Success in battle is not for ever : why shouldst thou grieve that one who put to flight Indra himself should fall at last ? Do thou rather perform his funeral rites . Take comfort , too , at this : with death our enmity is ended , and Ravana is as dear to me as thee . " Then there issued out of Lanka a host of weeping rakshasis , seeking their lord and wailing bitterly ; and Mandodari made this lament : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could stand before thee ? Gods and rishis thou hast daunted ; not to be borne is it that a man , fighting on foot , hath slain thee now 1 But thy death has come to pass because of Sita , and I am a widow . Thou didst not heed my words , nor didst thou think how many fairer damsels thou hadst than her . Alas ! how fair thou wert and how kind thy smile : now thou art bathed in blood and pierced with shafts 1 Thou wert wont to sleep on a couch of gold ; but now thou liest in the dust . Why dost thou fare away and leave me alone ? Why dost thou not welcome me ? " But 94 Sita brought to Rama the other wives of Ravana consoled her and lifted her up , saying : " Life is uncertain for all , and all things change . " Meanwhile Vibhishana made ready the funeral pyre , and Ravana was taken to the burning-ground and burnt with every rite and honour due to heroes . Ravana 's wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own place . Then Lakshman , taking water brought from the ocean by Sugriva in a golden jar , anointed Vibhishana as lord of the city of Lanka and king of the rakshasas , and thereat the monkeys and rakshasas both rejoiced . Std brought to Rama But now Rama called Hanuman to him , and sent him to search for Sita and inform her of all that had befallen ; and he found her still by the Asoka tree , guarded by rakshasas . Hanuman stood before her humbly and told his tale , and she gave him the message : " I desire to behold my lord . " Then the radiant monkey came to Rama and gave him Sita 's message . Rama wept thereat and was plunged in thought , and with a heavy sigh he said to Vibhishana : " Do thou bring Slid hither quickly , bathed and fitly adorned with sandal-paste and jewels . " He repaired to her and gave her Rama 's command ; she would have gone to him unbathed . " But thou shouldst do according to thy lord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she replied , and when she had made her ready , worthy bearers brought her on a palanquin to Rama . Rama , beholding her who had long been the prisoner of Ravana , and overcome with sorrow , was stricken at once with fury , joy , and grief . " 0 lord of rakshasas , 0 gentle king , " said he to Vibhishana , " do thou bring Sita near to me . " Then Vibhishana drove away the crowd of monkeys , bears , and rakshasas , and the attendants with canes and drums roughly hustled the assembled 95 Myths of the Hindus CD ' Buddhists host . But Rama bade them desist , and ordered that Sita should leave her palanquin and come to him on foot , saying to Vibhishana : " Thou shouldst rather comfort than harass these our own folk . No sin is there when women are seen abroad in time of war or danger , at an own-choice , 1 or at marriage . Sita is in danger now , and there can be no wrong in seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Vibhishana , cast down at that rebuke , brought Sita humbly up to Rama ; and she stood shamefast , hiding as it were her true self in her outward shape , beholding Rama 's face with wonder , joy , and love . At the sight of him her sorrow vanished , and she shone radiant like the moon . But Rama , seeing her stand humbly near him , could no more hold back his speech , and cried : " 0 gentle one , I have subdued thy foe and wiped away the stain upon my honour . The work of Hanuman , in crossing the deep and harrying Lanka ; of Sugriva , with his army and his counsel ; and of Vibhishana , bath borne its fruit , and I have fulfilled my promise , by my own might accomplishing the duty of a man . " Then Sita looked on Rama sadly , like a deer , with tear-filled eyes ; and Rama , seeing her so near , but be-thinking him of honour in the sight of men , was torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family and to myself , " said he , " but thou art stained by dwelling with another than myself .

Do thou choose what home thou wilt , whether with Lakshman , or Bharata , or Sugriva , or with Vibhishana . " Then Sita , hearing that cruel speech of Rama , little like his wonted words , trembled like a swaying vine , and wept with heavy tears , and she was ashamed before that great assembly . But she wiped the tears from her face , and answered him : " Ah , why dost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other women , thou wilt trust in none !

Then would I have given up my life , and thou needst not have undertaken all thy labour , nor laid a burden on thy friends . Thou art angered ; like a common man thou seest naught in me but womanhood . I am called the daughter of Janaka , but , in sooth , I was born of Earth ; thou knowest not my true self . " Then Sita turned to Lakshman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , build me a funeral pyre ; therein is my only refuge . Branded with an undeserved stigma , I will not live . " Lakshman , wrought with grief and anger , turned to Rama , and in obedience to his gesture he prepared the funeral pyre . Sid 's Ordeal Then Sita , circumambulating Rama , standing with downcast eyes , approached the fire ; with folded hands she // Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists stood and prayed : " Inasmuch as my heart has never turned from Rama , do thou , 0 Fire , all men 's witness , guard me ; since Rama casts me away as stained , who in sooth am stainless , do thou be my refuge . " Then Sita went about the pyre and entered the burning flames , so that all , both young and old , assembled there were overcome with grief , and the noise of uttermost wailing and lamentation arose on every hand . Rama stayed immovable and rapt ; but the gods came down to Lanka in their shining cars and , folding their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the worlds , why dost thou renounce the daughter of Janaka , leaving her to choose the death by fire ?

Why dost thou treat Sita after the fashion of a mere man ? " said they . To whom Rama replied : I know myself only as a man , Rama , the son of Dasharatha ; now let the grandsire tell me who I am and whence I came . " Then Brahma answered : " Hearken , thou whose virtue lies in truth 1 0 Lord , thou art Narayana , bearing disc and mace ; thou art the one-tusked boar ; thou goest beyond the past , the present , and the future ; thine is the bow of Time ; thou art creation and destruction ; thou art the slayer of all enemies , thou the forgiveness and control of passions ; thou art the refuge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , in cows and Brahmans , in every quarter , in sky and river and mountain-peak ; a thousand limbs , a thousand eyes , a thousand heads are thine ; thy heart am I , thy tongue Sarasvati ; the closing of thy eye is night , its opening day : Sit ' is Lakshmi and thou Vishnu and Krishna . And , 0 Rama , now Ravana is 98 Visions of the Gods slain , do thou ascend to Heaven , thy work accomplished . Naught shall they lack whose hearts are set on thee , nor fail who chant thy lay . " Then Fire , hearing those happy words , rose up with Sita on his lap , radiant as the morning sun , with golden jewels and black curling hair , and he gave her back to Rama , saying : " 0 Rama , here is thy Sita , whom no stain has touched . Not in word or thought or look has Sita turned aside from thee . Albeit tempted every way , she did not think of Ravana even in her inmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back . " Rama , staying silent for a while , with shining eyes pondered the speech of Agni ; then he answered : " Because this fair one dwelt long time in Ravana 's house , she needed vindication before the assembled folk . Had I taken her unproved , the people would complain that Rama , son of King Dasharatha , was moved by desire , and set at naught social law . I know well that Sita 's heart is set on me alone , and that her own virtue was her sufficient refuge from the assaults of Ravana ; she is mine as the sun 's rays are the sun 's . I can no more renounce her , but rather it behoves me to obey your happy words . " Thus the glorious son of Dasharatha regained his bride , and his heart was glad . Visions of the Gods But now Shiva took up the word , and revealed to Rama his father Dasharatha stationed on a shining car amongst the gods , and Rama and Lakshman bowed to him ; and he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spake : " Even in heaven amongst the gods I am not happy , lacking thee . I call to mind even now Kaikeyi 's word , and thou hast redeemed my pledge and freed me from every debt . Now I have heard . that thou art the primal 99 Myths of the Hindus ' Buddhists male incarnate for the compassing of Ravana 's death . Kaushalya shall be glad to see thee return victorious . Blessed are those that shall behold thee installed as Lord of Ayodhya ! Thy term of exile is ended . Do thou rule with thy brothers now in Ayodhya and have long life ! " Then Rama prayed his father : " Do thou now forgive Kaikeyl , and take back thy dreadful curse wherewith thou didst renounce her and her son . " Then Dasharatha said : " So be it " ; and to Lakshman : " May good befall thee , thou truth and honour , and thou shalt attain a lofty place in heaven . Do thou attend on Rama , whom all the gods adore with folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thou shouldst not feel resentment forasmuch as Rama renounced thee ; for thy welfare it was done . Now hast thou attained a glory hard to be won by women ! Thou knowest well the duty of a wife . It needs not for me to tell thee that thy husband is thy very god , " Then Dasharatha in his car returned to Indra 's heaven . Next Indra , standing before Rama , with folded hands addressed him , saying : " 0 Rama , first of men , it may not be for naught that we are come to thee . Do thou pray for such a boon as thou desirest . " Then Rama spoke , delighted : " 0 Lord of Heaven and foremost of the eloquent , do thou grant me this , that all the monkeys slain in battle return to life and see again their wives and children . Do thou restore those bears and monkeys that fought for me and laboured hard and recked nothing of death . And let there be flowers and fruits and roots for them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever they may go . " And Indra granted that great boon , so that a host of monkeys rose up , asking like wakened sleepers : " What has happened ? " Then the gods , once more addressing Rama , said : " Do thou return to Ayodhya , sending the Ioo Rama 's Return monkeys on their way . Comfort Sita , seek out thy brother Bharata , and , being installed as king , do thou bestow good fortune on every citizen . " Therewith the gods departed , and the happy army made their camp . Rama 's Return When morning dawned , Rama , taking the car Pushpaka , given to him by Vibhishana , stood ready to depart . Selfmoving was that car , and it was very fairly painted and large ; two stories it had , and windows and flags and banners and many chambers , and it gave forth a melodious sound as it coursed along the airy way . Then said Vibhishana : What more may I do ? " and Rama answered : Do thou content these bears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth ; then shall they fare to their homes . And do thou rule as one who is righteous , self-controlled , compassionate , a just collector of revenues , that all may be attached to thee . " Then Vibhishana bestowed wealth on all the host , and Rama was taking leave of all the bears and monkeys and of Vibhishana ; but they cried out : " We wish to go with thee to Ayodhya . " Then Rama invited them gladly , and Sugriva and Vibhtshana and all the host mounted the mighty car ; and the car rose up into the sky , drawn by golden geese , and sailed on its airy way , while the monkeys , bears , and rakshasas took their ease . But when they passed by the city of Kishkindha , Sugriva 's capital , Sita prayed Rama to take with him to Ayodhya Tara , the wife of Sugriva , and the wives of other monkeychiefs ; and he stayed the car while Sugriva brought Tara and the wives of other monkeys . And they mounted and set forth towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ganges where it divides in three , 1o1 Myths of the Hindus e Buddhists and at last beheld Ayodhya , and bowed to her ; and all the bears and monkeys and Vibhishana rose up in delight to see her , shining fair as Amaravati , the capital of Indra . It was the fifth day after the last of fourteen years of exile when Rama greeted the hermit Bharadwaja , and from him learnt that Bharata awaited his return , leading a hermit 's life and honouring the sandals . And Bharadwaja gave him a boon , that the trees along the road to Ayodhya should bear flowers and fruit as he went , even though out of season . And so it was that for three leagues , from Bharadwaja 's hermitage to Ayodhya 's gate , the trees bore flowers and fruits , and the monkeys thought themselves in heaven . But Hanuman was sent in advance to bring back tidings from Ayodhya and Bharata , and speedily he went , in human form . He came to Bharata in his hermitage garbed as a yogi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage , and ruling the earth as viceroy of the sandals . Then Hanuman related to him all that had befallen Rama since the brothers parted in Chitrakuta , and Bharata 's heart was filled with gladness , and he gave orders to prepare the city and to worship all the gods with music and flowers , and that all the people should come forth to welcome Rama . The roads were watered and the flags hoisted , and the city was filled with the sound of cavalry and cars and elephants . Then Rama came , and Bharata worshipped him and bathed his feet and humbly greeted him ; but Rama lifted him up and took him in his arms . Then Bharata bowed to Sita , and welcomed Lakshman , and embraced the monkey-chiefs , naming Sugriva " our fifth brother " ; and he praised Vibhishana . Then Rama came to his mother and humbly touched her feet , and he made salutation to the priests . Next Bharata brought the sandals and laid them at Rama 's Picture Caption Rama installed with Sita feet , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom , that thou didst entrust to me , I now return : behold , thy wealth of treasure , palace , and army is tenfold multiplied . " Then placing his brother on his lap , Rama fared on to Bharata 's hermitage , and there descending , Rama spake to the good car : " Do thou return to Vaishravan ? I grant thee leave . " For that self-coursing car had been taken by Ravana from his elder brother ; but now at Rama 's word it returned to the God of Wealth . Rama installed with Sata Then Bharata restored the kingdom to his brother , saying : " Let the world behold thee to-day installed , like the radiant midday sun . None but thou can bear the heavy burden of an empire such as ours . Do thou no more dwell in lonely places , but sleep and rise to the sound of music and the tinkle of women 's anklets . Do thou rule the people as long as the sun endures and as far as earth extends . " And Rama said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Rama and Lakshman bathed and were shorn of their matted locks and dressed in shining robes ; and Dasharatha 's queens attended Sita and decked her in splendid jewels , while Kaushalya decked the monkeys ' wives , and the priests gave orders for the coronation . Then Rama mounted a car driven by Bharata , and Satrughna held the umbrella , and Lakshman waved a chowrl and Vibhishana another . Sugriva rode on an elephant , and the other monkeys followed riding on elephants to the number of nine thousand , and with music and the noise of conchs the lord of men entered his own city . Four golden jars were given to Hanuman and Jambavan and Vegadarshi and Rishabha to fetch pure water from the four oceans , and they rose into the sky and 103 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists brought the holy water from the utmost bounds of ocean , north and south and east and west . Then Vashishtha , setting Rama and Sita upon their golden throne , sprinkled that first of men and consecrated him as king of Ayodhya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apsaras danced ; the earth was filled with crops , the trees bore fruit and flowers , and all men were glad and merry . And Rama conferred upon the Brahmans gifts of gold and ornaments , and cows and horses ; to Angada he gave a golden jewelled chain such as are worn by the gods , and to Sita a necklace of matchless pearls and other ornaments and splendid robes . But she , holding the pearls in her hand , glanced at her lord , and from him to Hanuman , remembering his goodly service ; and Rama , reading her wish , granted her leave , and she gave the necklace to Hanuman . And the Windgod 's son , exemplar of energy , renown , capacity , humility , and courage , wearing that garland , shone like a mountain illumined by the moon and fleecy clouds . And to every other hero Rama gave due gifts of jewels and wealth . Then Sugriva and Hanuman and Jambavan , with all the host , returned to their own homes , and Vibhishana repaired to Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men lived for a thousand years , and due rains fell , and the winds were ever favourable , and there was no distress from sickness or from wild beasts or from invasion , but all men were glad and merry . Rama Reigns Then , while Rama sat on the throne , all the great hermits came to visit him who had regained his kingdom . They came from east and west and north and south , led by Agastya , and Rama worshipped them and appointed for them 104 Hanuman Rewarded splendid seats of sacrificial grass and gold-embroidered deer-skin Then the sages praised Rama 's fortune , especially inasmuch as he had slain Ravana 's son , mightier than Ravana himself , and had delivered men and gods from fear . Then Rama questioned the sages about the former history of Ravana and Ravana 's son , and they related to him at length the story of the rakshasas ' origin ? how they had come to Lanka ; how Ravana , Kumbhakarna , and Vibhishana had won each a boon from the grandsire ; what evil deeds had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Vishnu to take human form to achieve his death . Likewise they told of the origin and deeds of the monkeys Vali and Sugriva and Hanuman . And , O Rama I " they said , " in the golden age the demon sought to fight with thee ; for those whom the gods destroy go to the heaven of the gods till they are born again on earth ; those whom Vishnu slays go to Vishnu 's heaven , so that his very wrath is a blessing . And it was for this that Ravana stole Sita away and thou didst assume a human form for his destruction , 0 great one , know that thou art Narayana : do thou recollect thyself . Thou art the eternal Vishnu , and Sita is Lakshmi . " Rama himself and all the assembled folk ? Rama 's brothers , the monkey-chiefs , the rakshasas under Vibhishana , the vassal kings , and the Brahmans , Kshatriyas , Vaishyas , and Shudras of Ayodhya ? marvelled at the words of the great sages ; and Agastya took leave of Rama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt at Ayodhya more than a month , feast . ing on honey and well-cooked meats and fruits and roots , though it seemed to them but a moment , because of their io5 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists devotion toward Rama . Then the time came for them to go to their own city , and Rama embraced them all with affection and gave them goodly gifts . But Hanuman bowed and begged this boon , that he might ever be devoted to Rama alone , and that he might live on earth so long as the story of Rama 's deeds was told of amongst men ; and Rama granted it , and took from his own neck a jewelled chain and put it upon Hanuman . One by one the monkeys came and touched the feet of Rama , and then went their way ; but they wept for sorrow of leaving him . Sitd 's Second Trial Then Rama governed Ayodhya for ten thousand years ; and at length it came to pass that Sita had conceived . Then Rama asked her if she had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hermitages of the sages by the Ganges ; and Rama said : " So be it " ; and the visit was fixed for the morrow . The same night it happened that Rama was engaged in converse with his counsellors and friends , and he asked them : " What do the citizens and countrymen say of Sita and my brothers and Kaikeyi ? " And one replied that they spoke often of Rama 's great conquest of Ravana . But Rama pressed for more definite reports , and a counsellor replied : The people do indeed speak of thy great deeds and thy alliance with the bears and monkeys and rakshasas ; but they murmur inasmuch as thou hast taken Sita back , albeit she was touched by Ravana and dwelt long time in his city of Lanka . For all that , they say , thou dost still acknowledge her . Now we , too , will pass over the misdoings of our wives , for subjects always follow the customs of their king . ' Such , 0 king , is the talk . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sent away the counsellors and sent for his brothers , and they came and stood by him with folded hands and touched his feet . But they saw that he was heavy-hearted and that his eyes were full of tears , and waited anxiously for him to speak . Then Rama told them what he had learnt . I am crushed by these slanders , " he said , " for I am of an illustrious family , and Sita is no less nobly born . And Sita , to prove her innocence , submitted to ordeal by fire before you all , and Fire and Wind and all the gods declared her stainless . Even now my heart knows her to be blameless . But the censure of the folk has pierced me : ill is ill-fame for such as I , and preferable were death than this disgrace . Do thou , therefore , Lakshman , make no question , but take Sita with thee to-morrow to Valmiki 's hermitage beside the Ganges , as if fulfilling the desire she spoke of even now ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move me from this , lest I deem you to be my foes . " And Rama 's eyes were full of tears , and he went to his own apartment sighing like a wounded elephant . The next morning Lakshman brought a goodly car and came to Sita , saying : Rama hath commanded me to take thee to the hermitages by the Ganges in accordance with thy wish . " Then Sita , taking costly gifts with her , mounted the car most eagerly . On the second day they came to the Ganges bank , whose water takes away all sin ; but Lakshman stood and wept aloud . Then Sita asked him why he wept . " For , " she said , " it is but two days since thou didst see Rama : he is dearer to me than life , but I am not so sad as thou . Do thou take me across the river to visit the hermits there and present my gifts , and then shall we return ; and , indeed , I am eager to see my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists lotus , the lion-breast , the first of men . " So Lakshman sent for boatmen , and they went across . When they were come to the other side , Lakshman stood by Sita with folded hands and prayed her to forgive him and not deem him at fault , saying : " This is a matter too sore for words , so I but tell thee openly that Rama now renounces thee , inasmuch as the citizens have spoken against thee ; he has commanded me to leave thee here , as if in satisfaction of thy own desire . But do not grieve , for well I know that thou art guiltless , and thou mayst dwell with Valmiki , our father 's friend . Do thou remember Rama always and serve the gods , so mayst thou be blest ! " Then Sita fell down fainting ; but she came to herself and complained bitterly : Alas ! I must have greatly sinned in a past life to be thus divided from my lord , though blameless . 0 Lakshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest , for I was able to be Rama 's servant . But how can I live there all alone now , and what reply can I make to those who ask what sin I have committed to be banished thus P I would fain be drowned in these waters , but I may not bring about the destruction of my lord 's race . Do thou as Rama has ordered , but take this message from me to him : ' Thou knowest , 0 Rama , that I am unstained and devoted utterly to thee . I understand that it is for the avoiding of ill-fame that thou dost renounce me , and it is my duty to serve thee even in this . A husband is a woman 's god , her friend and guru . I do not grieve for what befalls me , but because the people have spoken ill of me . ' Do thou go and tell these things to Rama . " Then Lakshman crossed the river again and came to Ayodhya ; but Sita went to and fro without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons found her there , and Valmiki came to the Io8 Sita 's Second Trial river-side and comforted her , and brought her to the hermitage and gave her to the hermits ' wives to cherish with affection . Lakshman found his brother sunk in grief and with his eyes filled with tears , and he was sorry , and touched his feet and stood with folded hands , and said : 0 sire , I have done all that thou didst command , and have left that peerless lady at Valmiki 's hermitage . Thou shouldst not grieve therefor ; for such is the work of time , whereat the wise grieve not . Where there is growth there is decay ; where there is prosperity there is also ruin ; where there is birth there must be also death . Therefore , attachment to wife , or sons , or friends , or wealth is wrong , for separation is certain . Nor shouldst thou give way to grief before the folk , lest they blame thee again . " Then Rama was comforted , and praised the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests and counsellors who waited , and occupied himself again with the affairs of state . But none had come that day for any affair , for in Rama 's time there was no disease or poverty , and none sought redress . But as Lakshman went away he saw a dog , that waited by the gate and barked , and he asked it what was its affair . Then the dog replied : " I wish to tell it to Rama himself , who is the refuge of all creatures , and proclaims ' Fear nothing ' to them all . " So Lakshman returned to Rama and informed him , and Rama sent for the dog to come to him . But the dog would not go in , saying : We are the vilest born , and we may not enter the houses of gods or kings or Brahmans . " Then Lakshman took this message also to Rarna ; but he sent again for the dog and gave him leave to enter , who waited at the gate . I09 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Rama , and praised his truth and asked his pardon ; and Rama inquired : " What shall I do for thee ? Do thou speak without fear . " Then the dog related how a certain Brahman mendicant had beaten him without cause , and Rama sent for the Brahman , and he came , and asked what Rama required of him . Then Rama reasoned with him , saying : " 0 twice-born one , thou hast hurt this dog , who hurt thee not . Lo , anger is the worst of passions , like a sharp dagger , and steals away all virtue . Greater is the evil that may be wrought by lack of self-control than by the sword , or a serpent , or a foe implacable . " The Brahman answered : I had been seeking alms and was tired and hungry , and this dog would not move away , although I asked him , so I struck him . But , 0 king , I am guilty of error , and thou shouldst punish me , that I may escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitting punishment ; but the dog requested : " Do thou appoint this Brahman head of a family . " So Rama honoured him and sent him away riding on an elephant ; but the counsellors were astonished . To them Rama said : You do not understand this matter ; but the dog knows what it signifies . " Then the dog , addressed by Rama , explained : " I was once the head of a family , and I served the gods and Brahmans , and fed the very servants before I took my food , and I was gentle and benevolent ; yet I have fallen into this sorry state . 0 king , this Brahman is cruel and impatient in his nature , and he will fail to discharge the duties of the head of a family , and will fall into Hell . " Then Rama wondered at the dog 's words , but the dog went away and betook himself to penance in Benares . I10 Rama 's justice Another time there came a Brahman to the palace gate bearing the dead body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , thou art but fourteen years of age , and I know not for what sin of mine it is that thou hast died ; never have I lied , or hurt an animal , or done any other sin . It must be for some other reason that thou hast gone to Yama 's realm . Indeed , it must be that the king has sinned , for else such things may not befall . Therefore , 0 king , do thou confer life again upon him ; or , if not , my wife and I will die here at thy gate , like those that have no king . " Then Rama summoned a council of eight chief Brahmans , and Narada took up the word and explained to Rama what had been the cause of the boy 's premature death . He told him of the four ages . And now , 0 king , the Kali age begins already , for a Shudra has begun to practise penances in thy kingdom , and for this cause the boy has died . Do thou search the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtue of thy subjects may increase and this boy may be restored to life . " So Rama ordered the body of the boy to be preserved in sweet oil , and he bethought him of the self-coursing car Pushpaka , and it knew his mind and came to him straightway . Then Rama mounted the car and sought through every quarter ; but he found no sin in the west nor in the north , and the east was crystal clear . Only in the south , beside a sacred pool , he found a yogi standing on his head practising the most severe disciplines , and Rama asked him : " O thou blest and self-devoted , who art thou , and what thy colour , and what dost thou seek to win , whether Heaven or aught else ? " And the yogi answered : " O great Rama , I am of the Shudras , and it is for Heaven that I do this penance . " Then Rama drew his sword and cut off the III Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists yogi 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed ; but the Shudra yogi attained to the abode of the heavenly ones . Now Rama prayed to the gods : If ye are pleased with me , do ye restore to life the Brahman 's son and so fulfil my promise " ; and they granted it , and Rama returned to Ayodhya . Meanwhile Sita , dwelling at Valmiki 's hermitage , gave birth to sons , and they were named Kusha and Lava ; and they grew up in the forest hermitage , and Valmiki taught them wisdom , and he made this book of the Ramayana in sklokas , and gave them skill in recitation . Rama 's Sons In those days Rama prepared a horse-sacrifice , setting free a jet-black horse with lucky marks to wander where it would , and Lakshman followed it . Then he invited all the bears and monkeys , and Vibhishana and foreign kings , and the rishis and others of the hermits from far and near , to be present at the final ceremony . Countless wealth he gave away throughout the year while the horse wandered , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before was such an Ashwamedha in the world ! Kusha and Lava came with Valmiki to the ceremony , and Valmiki told them to recite the Ramayana everywhere , and if any questioned them , to name themselves as Valmiki 's disciples . So they went about and sang of Rama 's deeds ; and Rama heard of it , and he called a great assembly of the Brahmans and all kinds of grammarians and artists and musicians , and the hermit children sang before them all . Wondrous and delightful was their song , and none could hear enough of it ; but all men drank up the children with their eyes , and murmured : They are as like to Rama as one bubble is like another 1 " When Rama II2 Rama 's Sons would have given them wealth , they answered : " We are dwellers in the forest : what use would money be to us P And when he asked who had composed that song , they answered : " Valmiki , who is our teacher . And , 0 king , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all at leisure . " So Rama hearkened to the story day by day , and from it he learnt that Kusha and Lava were the sons of Sita . Then Rama mentioned Sita 's name before the assembly , and sent a messenger to inquire from the hermits if they would vouch for her faithfulness and to ask herself if she were willing to give proof of her innocence again . " Ask her , " he said , " if she will swear before the people to estab-lish her own purity and mine . " The hermits sent back the message that she would come , and Rama was glad thereof , and appointed the next day for the taking of the oath . When the appointed time had come , and all were seated in the assembly , immovable as mountains , Valmiki came forward , and Sita followed him with downcast glance and folded hands and falling tears ; and there rose a cry of welcome and a murmuring in the assembly when they saw Sita following Valmiki thus , like the Vedas following I3rahma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " 0 son of Dasharatha , albeit Sita is pure and doth follow the path of righteousness , thou didst renounce her near my hermitage because of the people 's censure . Do thou now permit her to give testimony of her purity . And , 0 Rama , I myself , who follow truth , tell thee that these twin children are thy sons . Also I swear before thee that if any sin be found in Sita I will forgo the fruit of all austerities I have practised for many thousand years . " Then Rama , seeing Sita standing before the assembly like a goddess , with folded hands , replied : " 0 great one , H I13 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists thou art ever virtuous , and thy words convince me of the purity of Sites . I recognize these brothers Kusha and Lava as my sons . Yet Sita shall give testimony herself , for the sake of those that have come here to witness her avowal . " Slid taken Home by Earth Then there blew a sweet , cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow only in the golden age , and folk were astonished that that air should blow also in the second age . But Sita , with downcast looks and folded palms , said : " I have never thought of anyone but Rama even in my heart : as this is true , may the goddess of the earth be my protection . I have always with mind and body and words prayed for Rama 's welfare , and by this I pray Vasundhara to receive me . " Then a heavenly throne rose up from within the earth , borne on the heads of mighty nac as , l decked in shining jewels ; and the Earth stretched out her arms and welcomed Sites and placed her on the throne , and the throne sank down again . Thereat the gods cried out in praise of Sites , and all beings on earth and in the sky were filled with wonder and astonishment , so that one mood for a single moment swayed all the universe at once . But Rama sat him down stricken with sorrow and with hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sita had disappeared before his very eyes , and he would have destroyed the very Earth if she would not give Sites back . But Brahma said : " 0 Rama of firm vows , thou shouldst not grieve ; rather remember thy essential godhead , and bethink thee thou art Vishnu . Sita is blameless and pure , and for her virtue she has gone to the abode of nag-as ; I14 The Last Days of Rama but thou shalt be with her in Heaven . Hearken now to the ending of Valmiki 's story , and thou shalt know thy future history " ; and therewith Brahma with the gods returned to his own place , and Rama appointed the morrow for the hearing of the Uttara Kanda . The Last Days of Rama But now Rama was heavy-hearted , and the whole world seemed empty without Sita , and he knew no peace . He gave the monkeys and the kings and hermits gifts , and sent them back to their own homes , and he made a golden image , f Sita to share with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years passed , while all things prospered in the kingdom of Ayodhya . Then Kaushalya and Kaikeyi died , and were united with King Dasharatha in Heaven . Bharata reigned in Kekaya , and Satrughna was king of Madhu , while the sons of Lakshman founded kingdoms of their own . At length there came to Rama 's palace the mighty yogi Time , and Rama honoured him . He named himself Time , begotten by Narayana on Maya , and he reminded Rama of his godly self and all that he had achieved in Heaven and on earth . " 0 Lord of the World , " he said , " thou vast born on earth for the destruction of the Tennecked rakshasa , and thou didst undertake to dwell on earth for eleven thousand years . Now that time is ripe and the grandsire sendeth me to tell thee : now wilt thou reign yet longer over men , or wilt thou return to the lordship of the gods ? " Then Rama praised the yogi and said he had spoken truth , and for himself he would return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home and gone to the banks of Sarayu to practise great austerities , and there I15 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists the gods rained flowers upon him , and Indra lifted him from the earth and returned to his own city , so that all the gods , seeing the fourth part of Vishnu come back to them , were gladdened and began to worship him . Then Rama would follow the same path , and he sought to crown his brother Bharata as king of Ayodhya , but he refused and would have the king 's sons Kusha and Lava set over North and South Kosala ; and Rama granted it , and they were installed upon the throne and ruled over the new cities of Kushavati and Sravanti ; but Ayodhya was altogether emptied of people , for the folk would all follow after Rama when he went away . News of these matters was brought to Satrughna also , and he set his two sons on the throne of Mathura and hastened to return to Rama . Hearing that Rama was going away , the monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld him ; and Sugriva said : " I have set Angada upon the throne of Kishkindha , and I will follow thee . " Then Rama granted the desire of all the monkeys to follow him ; but to Hanuman he said : " It is determined already that thou shalt live for ever : do thou be glad on earth so long as the tale of me endures . " To Jambavan and some others Rama appointed life till the end of the Kali age , and other bears and monkeys he gave leave to follow him . To Vibhishana he gave good counsel regarding government , and ever to worship Jagannatha , Lord of the World . The next day Vashishtha prepared all due rites for those who go to the other world , and all men following Rama and the Brahmans set out for Sarayu . There went Bharata and Lakshman and Satrughna and their wives , and the counsellors and servants ; and all the people of Ayodhya , with the beasts and birds and the least of 116 The Last Days of Rama breathing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with happy hearts . When they came to Sarayu , Brahma , the grandsire , came thither with the godly folk and a hundred thousand goodly cars , and the wind of Heaven blew and flowers rained down from Heaven upon earth . Then Brahma said to Rama : " Hail , 0 Vishnu ! Do thou , with thy brothers , enter in again in whatsoever form thou wilt , who art the refuge of all creatures , and beyond the range of thought or speech , unknown of any save thy Maya . " Then Vishnu entered Heaven in his own form , with his brothers , and all the gods bowed down to him and rejoiced . Then said Vishnu to the grandsire : " It behoveth thee to allot their due place to all these people who have followed me for love , renouncing self for my sake . " Then Brahmappointed places in the heavens for all those who had come after Rama , and the bears and monkeys assumed their godly forms , after the likeness of those who had begotten them . Thus did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attain to the heavenly state , and Brahma and the gods returned to their own abode . Thus ends Ramayana , revered by Brahma and made by Valmiki . He that hath no sons shall attain a son by reading even a single verse of Rama 's lay . All sin is washed away from those who read or hear it read . He who recites Ramayana should have rich gifts of cows and gold . Long shall he live who reads Ramayana , and shall be honoured , with his sons and grandsons , in this world and in Heaven . I17 CHAPTER III : THE MAHABHARATA RELATED IN FIFTEEN EPISODES Introduction to the Mahabharata THE Indian national saga , beyond all dispute , is the Mahabharata . This is to the Indian village and the Indian home what the Iliad was to the Greek , and , to a certain extent also , what the Scriptures and Gospels are to ourselves . It is the most popular of all the sacred books . It contains , as an interlude , the I3hagavad Gita , the national gospel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of a divine incarnation , Krishna , as he is called , has been wrought into and upon an immense ballad and military epic of unknown antiquity . Of this epic the main theme is a great battle waged between two families of cousins , the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarashtra ? or the Pandavas and the Kauravas , or Kurus ? by name . And although , after the fashion of ancient literature , a thousand other tales , some more and some less ancient , have been embedded in its interstices , yet this great drama moves on , full of swiftness and colour , from one end of the poem to the other . It is marked by extraordinary vividness and richness of imagination . But perhaps most of us , remembering that the work is ancient , will be still more impressed by the subtlety and modernness of the social intercourse which it portrays . Here and there we may find an anomalous custom or a curious belief , but in delicacy of characterpainting , in the play of personality , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society we find ourselves , in the Mahabharata , fully on a level with the novels and dramas of modern Europe . The fortitude of Karna when his mother embraces him ; the low voice in which I18 How the Princes learned to Shoot Yudhishthira says elephant " as a concession to his conscience ; the laugh of Bhishma in battle , contenting himself with the slightly emphasized " Shikhandini ? " ? these , amongst many others , will occur to the reader as typical instances . The outstanding fact to be realized about the epic , however , is that from end to end its main interest is held and centred on character . We are witnessing the law that , as the oyster makes its own shell , so the mind of man creates and necessitates his own life and fate . The whole philosophy of India is implicit in this romance , just as it is in the coma ' on household life . The Mahabharata constitutes , and is intended to constitute , a supreme appeal to the heart and conscience of every generation . Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality . In this fact lies the great difference between it and the Greek epics , in which the dominant passion is the conscious quest of ideal beauty . I. HOW THE PRINCES LEARNED TO SHOOT Now Bhishma , the royal grandsire , became eager to find for the princes of the two imperial houses a teacher who might train them thoroughly in the use of arms . And it happened one day about this time that the boys , all in a company , were playing at ball in the forests outside Hastinapura , when their ball rolled away frDm them and fell into an old well . Try as they would , there was not one of them who could get it back . All kinds of efforts were made by each in turn , but without avail . It seemed as if the ball would never be recovered . Just when their boyish anxiety and vexation were at their height , their glances fell , with one accord , on a Brahman sitting near , whom they had not at II9 Myths of the Hindus ee Buddhists first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appeared to be resting after the performance of his daily worship . " 0 Brahman ! " cried the lads , surrounding him in a body , " can you show us how to recover our ball ? " The Brahman smiled a little and said : " What ? what ? Scions of the royal house , and you do n't shoot well enough for that ! If you 'll only promise me my dinner , I will bring up not only your ball but also this ring , which I now throw down , by means of a few blades of grass . " And suiting the action to the word , he took a ring off his own finger and threw it into the well . " Why , Brahman-ji , we 'll make you rich for life , " cried one of the lads , if you can really do as you say . " " Is it so ? " said the Brahman . " Then look at this grass , " and he plucked a handful of long grass growing near . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtue that weapons might not have . Behold , here I throw " ; and as he spoke he took aim and threw a single blade of grass with such deftness and precision that it pierced the ball that lay in the well as if it had been a needle . Then throwing another blade , he pierced the first , and so on and so on , till he had a chain of grass , by which it was easy to draw up the ball . By this time the interest of the boys was centred more on the skill of the Brahman than on the recovery of their plaything , and they exclaimed with one accord : " The ring , too , 0 Brahman ! Show us how you can recover the ring ! " The Recovery of the Ring Then Drona ? for that was the name of the Brahman ? took up his bow , which had been lying beside him , and selecting an arrow from the quiver that he wore , he shot 120 The Recovery of the Ring it into the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up the ring . Taking the jewel , he handed it to the princes , whose astonishment and delight knew no bounds . " What can we do for you ? What can we do ? " they cried . The Brahman 's face had grown grave again . Tell Bhishma , your guardian , that Drona is here , " he answered briefly , and relapsed again into the depths of thought . The lads trooped off , with their enthusiasm fresh upon them , to describe to Bhishma , the Protector , the extraordinary experience of the morning ; and he , struck by the thought that Drona was the very teacher he was seeking , hastened in person to see him and bring him to the palace . Bhishma had known of Drona formerly as the son of the great sage Bharadwaja , whose ashrama in the mountains , near the source of the Ganges , had been a centre of great learning . To that hermitage had come many illustrious students , who had been playmates and comrades to Drona during childhood and youth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period that Drona , after his father 's death , had performed great austerities and gone through a very determined course of study , in consequence of which he had been mysteriously gifted with divine weapons and the knowledge of how to use them . It was now the object of the royal grandsire , therefore , to learn how and why the Brahman should be seeking attention in the capital , and a few adroit questions quickly told him all that he required to know . Drona had married and had a son born to him , Ashvatthaman by name . Moved by the needs of his child , he had for the first time realized his own poverty , and had set out to renew the brilliant friendships of his boyhood . Chief amongst these I2I Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists had been his intimacy with Drupada , now king of the Panchalas , one of the greatest of the minor kingdoms . When Drupada , as a prince , had been a student like himself , they had been inseparable , vowing to each other lifelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now a sovereign in his own right , should be the first of those to whom in his bitter need he thought of repairing . But when he had appeared before him the king of the Panchalas had laughed him to scorn and repudiated all their ancient friendship . To him it seemed sheer impertinence that the poor Brahman , in the position of a beggar , though he was the son of a famous scholar , should claim equality and intimacy with one seated on a throne . And then in the heart of Drona had risen a great wrath and wounded pride . The bitterness of his poverty was not now so great as the heat of his resentment . He would do what he would do . But in order to do it he must find pupils of the best . He was desirous , therefore , of placing himself at the disposal of Bhishma . The old Protector smiled as he heard the climax of this story . He was far too discreet to inquire as to the purposes of Drona . Instead of this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy bow , 0 Brahman , and make the princes of my house accomplished in the use of arms . All that we have is at thy disposal . We are indeed fortunate to have obtained thy services 1 " The Promise to Drona One day , soon after Drona had taken the princes as his pupils , he called them together and made them prostrate themselves before him , and having done so he required from them a promise that when they should become skilled in arms they would carry out for him a certain purpose 122 Picture Caption Ekalavya that was in his heart . At this demand all the princes fell silent ; but one of them , Arjuna , the third of the Pandavas , vowed eagerly that whatever it might be he would promise to accomplish it . Then Drona embraced Arjuna repeatedly , and from this moment there was a special attachment between the two , and Arjuna was always with his master , with his whole mind bent on the science of arms . And princes came from the neighbouring kingdoms to learn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sons of the great nobles were his pupils . And amongst them came that strange and melancholy youth who went by the name of Karna , and was reputed to be the adopted son of a royal charioteer , his actual birth being unknown , though some held , from his auspicious characteristics , that he must be of exalted rank . And young Karna and Arjuna thus early became rivals , each trying to outdo the other in the use of the bow . And Karna tended to mix rather with Duryodhana and his brothers than with the Pandavas . Meanwhile Arjuna took every opportunity of learning , and in lightness and skill outdid all his fellows . One evening when he was eating , his lamp went out , and observing that even in the dark his hand carried the food to the mouth , his mind was set on the power of habit , and he began to practise shooting also in the night . And Drona , hearing the twang of the bowstring , came and embraced him , declaring that in the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And amongst those who came to Drona was a low-caste prince of non-Aryan birth known as Ekalavya . But Drona would not accept him as a pupil , lest , as one of the leaders 123 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists of the lower races , he should come in time to excel all the Aryan princes , and should learn all the secrets of their military science . Then Ekalavya , retiring to the forest , made a clay image of Drona , and bowed down before it , worshipping it as his teacher . And by reason of his great reverence and devotion to his purpose , it soon came about that there were few archers in the land equal to Ekalavya . And one day , when all the princes were hunting in the forest , a dog ran off alone and found himself suddenly face to face with a man of dark hue wearing matted locks besmeared with mud and with his one piece of raiment black in colour . The dog , in his astonishment at this strange sight , began to bark aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shot into it no less than seven arrows , aiming by the sound alone . The dog , thus pierced with seven arrows and unable to close his mouth , ran back to the princes , and they , fired with jealousy and admiration , began to seek everywhere for the unknown archer . It was not long before they found him , ceaselessly discharging arrows from the bow , and when they asked who and what he was , he replied : " I am the son of the king of the Nishadas . Know me also as a pupil of Drona , struggling for the acquisition of skill in arms ! " But when Drona heard of it he took Arjuna with him and sought out the archer Ekalavya . And when the low-caste prince saw Drona approaching , he prostrated himself and then stood with folded hands awaiting his commands . And Drona said : If , 0 hero , thou art really my pupil , give me , then , the teacher 's fee ! " Master , " said Ekalavya in his delight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing I would not joyfully give you . " 124 The Triumph of Arjuna " If you really mean it , Ekalavya , " answered Drona coldly , " I should like to have the thumb of your right hand . " And the low-born prince , allowing no look of sadness to cross his face , turned without ado and cut off the thumb of his own right hand to lay it at the feet of Drona . But when the Brahman had gone and he turned again to his archery , he found that his marvellous lightness of hand was for ever vanished . Thus were the royal princes left without rivals in the use of arms . And two of them , Bhima , the second of the Pandavas , and Duryodhana , his cousin , became highly accomplished in the use of the mace . Ashvatthaman , the son of Drona himself , knew most of the theory of warfare . The Pandava twins , Nakula and Sahadeva , excelled every one in horsemanship and in handling the sword . Yudhishthira , the eldest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Arjuna excelled all in every respect . He could use all the weapons , and his intelligence , resourcefulness , strength , and perseverance were admitted on every side . Moreover , he alone amongst the princes became fitted for a general command , being capable of fighting from his chariot with sixty thousand foes at once . The Triumj5h of Arjuna And Drona one day was desirous of testing by open competition the relative excellence of the young men he had trained . So he caused an artificial bird to be made and placed , as their target , on the top of a tree . Then , assembling all his pupils , he said : Take up your bows and stand practising your aim . When I give the order you will cut off the head of the bird . I shall take you one by one in turn . " I25 Myths of the Hindus f Buddhists Then he called Yudhishthira to him alone . Now be ready , " he said , to shoot with your arrow when I give the order . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , and stood ready at a word to let fly . " Do you see the bird on the top of that tree ? " asked Drona . I do , " answered Yudhishthira . " What do you see ? " said Drona quickly . Myself , or your brothers , or the tree ? " " I see yourself , sir , " answered Yudhishthira carefully , my brothers , the tree , and the bird . " Three times Drona repeated his question , and three times Yudhishthira gave the same reply . Then with great sorrow Drona ordered him to one side . It was not by him that the arrow would be shot . One by one , princes and nobles , the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kurus , were all called up , and in each case Yudhishthira 's answer was given : " We behold the tree , yourself , our fellow-pupils , and the bird . " One man only remained untried , and Drona made no effort to conceal his disappointment . Now , however , he turned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his favourite pupil . " By you , if any , must the bolt be sped . So much is clear , 0 Arjuna 1 " he said . Now tell me , with bow bent , what do you see ? the bird , the tree , myself , and your friends ? " " No , " said Arjuna promptly ; " I see the bird alone , neither yourself , sir , nor the tree 1 " " Describe the bird to me , " said Drona briefly . " I see only a bird 's head , " replied Arjuna . " Then shoot ! " said his master with frank delight , and in an instant the bird stood headless on the tree , and Drona , embracing Arjuna , thought of that great tourna-I26 The Trial of the Princes ment in which he would yet see Drupada vanquished before him . II . THE TRIAL OF THE PRINCES Then Drona , seeing that his pupils had now completed their education , applied to Dhritarashtra the king for permission to hold a tournament , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The request was at once granted , and preparations began for the great occasion . Land was chosen , and the citizens assembled by proclamation to be present at the offering of sacrifices for its consecration on an auspicious day . The lists were levelled and equipped , and a great hall built for the queens and their ladies , while tents and galleries were placed at every advantageous point for the use of the spectators . And when the day appointed for the tournament arrived the king took his place , surrounded by his ministers and preceded by BhIshma and the early tutors of the princes . Then Gandhari , the mother of Duryodhana , and Kunti , the mother of the Pandavas , richly robed and jewelled and attended by their retinues , took the places that had been reserved for them . And nobles , Brahmans , and citizens left the city and came hastening to the spot , till , with the sound of drums and trumpets and the clamour of voices , that great assembly became like the agitated ocean . At last the white-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the moon itself had appeared in an unclouded sky , while beside him his son Ashvatthaman looked like some attendant star . Ceremonies of propitiation were next performed , and then , as the chanting of the Vedic hymns died away , arms were carried in , the blare of trumpets was heard , and 127 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists the princes entered in procession with Yudhishthira at their head . Now began the most marvellous display of skill . The shower of arrows was so thick and constant that few of the spectators could hold their heads up unflinchingly , yet the aim of the knightly archers was so sure that not a single arrow missed its mark . Each , engraved with the name of its owner , was found in that precise spot at which it had been shot . Then they leapt on the backs of spirited horses , and vaulting and careering , turning this way and that , went on shooting at the marks . Then the horses were abandoned for chariots , and driving in and out , racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as occasion might demand , the combatants continued to display their agility , their precision , and their resource . Now leaping from the chariots , and seizing each man his sword and shield , the princes began to fence and exhibit sword-play . Then , like two great mountains and thirsting for battle , Bhima and Duryodhana entered the arena , clubs in hand , for single combat . Bracing themselves up , and summoning to their own aid their utmost energy , the two warriors gave a mighty roar , and began c reering in due form , right and left , circling the lists , till the moment came for the rush and the mimic onslaught , in which each would strive to defeat his antagonist by right of his superior skill . And so great was the lust of battle in the two princes that the vast assembly caught the infection and became divided in its sympathies , some for Bhima , some for Duryodhana , till Drona saw that it was necessary to stop the contest if he would not have it degenerate into an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , silencing the music for a moment , in a voice like that I28 Picture Caption The Entry of Karna of the thunderstorm , introduced Arjuna , the most beloved of his pupils . The royal Kunti , mother of the Pandavas , was transported with delight at the acclamation which she now saw her son receive , and not until it had died down a little could he begin to display his skill in arms . But such were the power and lightness of Arjuna that it seemed as if with one weapon he created fire , with another water , with a third mountains , and as if with a fourth all these were made to disappear . Now he appeared tall and again short . Now he appeared fighting with sword or mace , standing on the pole or the yoke of his chariot ; then in a flash he would be seen on the car itself , and in yet another instant he was fighting on the field . And with his arrows he hit all kinds of marks . Now , as if by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of a revolving iron boar . Again he discharged twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow 's horn swaying to and fro from the rope on which it hung . Thus he showed his skill in the use of sword , bow , and mace , walking about the lists in circles . The Entry of Karna Just as Arjuna 's display was ending a great noise was heard in the direction of the gate , as if some new com-batant were about to make his way into the lists . The whole assembly turned as one man , and Duryodhana with his hundred brothers rose hastily and stood with uplifted weapons , while Drona stood in the midst of the five Pandava princes like the moon in a five-starred constel-lation . Then , the centre of all eyes , the hero Karna entered , magnificent in arms and manhood . And far away in the gallery of queens the royal Kunti trembled to see again the son whom she had long ago abandoned , fearing to 1 I29 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists own his divine birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself had been the father of Karna , and Kunti ? in future to become the mother of the Pandavas ? had been his mother . And now was he goodly indeed to look upon . Was he not in truth an emanation from the hot-beamed sun P His proportions made him like unto some great cliff . Handsome of feature , he was possessed of innumerable accomplishments . He was tall in stature , like a golden palmtree , and endued with the vigour of youth , he was capable even of slaying a lion . Bowing quietly to his teacher , he now turned himself towards Arjuna , and in the tones of one challenging declared that he had come to outdo the performance that had just been given . A thrill of excitement passed over the great audience , and Duryodhana openly showed his delight . But , alas ! the princely Arjuna flushed crimson with anger and contempt . Then , with the permission of Drona , the mighty Karna , delighting in battle , made good his word and did all that Arjuna had done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was embraced and welcomed by all the sons of Dhritarashtra , and Duryodhana asked him what he could do for him . " 0 prince , " said Karna in reply , " I have but one wish , and that is to engage in single combat with Arjuna ! " Arjuna , meanwhile , hot with resentment at what he deemed the insult put upon him , said quietly to Karna : " The day will yet come , 0 Karna , when I shall kill you ! " Speak thou in arrows , " answered Karna loudly , that with arrows I may this very day strike off thy head before our master himself ! " 130 Karna and Arjuna Karna and Arjuna Thus challenged d outr ante , Arjuna advanced and took his place for single combat . And Karna like wise advanced and stood facing him . Now Arjuna was the son of Indra , even as Karna had been born of the sun , and as the heroes confronted one another the spectators were aware that Arjuna was covered by the shadow of the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indra , and that rows of wild geese , flying overhead , gave a look of laughter to the sky . But Karna stood illumined by the rays of the sun . And Duryodhana ranged himself near Karna , while Bhishma and Drona stood close to Arjuna . And up in the royal gallery a woman was heard to moan and fall . Then the master of the ceremonies advanced and cried out the style and titles of Arjuna , a style and titles that were known to all . And having done this , he waited , and called upon the rival knight to show equal lineage , for sons of kings could not fight with men of inferior birth . At these words Karna turned pale , and his face was torn with contending emotions . But Duryodhana , eager to see Arjuna defeated , cried out : " If Arjuna desires to fight only with a king , let me at once install Karna king of Anga 1 " As if by magic , the priests came forward chanting ; a throne of gold was brought forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , and over Karna 's head was raised the royal umbrella , while yak-tails waved about him on every side . Then , amidst the cheers of the multitude , Karna and Duryodhana embraced each other and pledged each other their eternal friendship . At that very moment , bent and trembling with age and 131 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists weakness , poorly clad , and supporting himself on a staff , an old man was seen to enter the lists . And all present knew him for Adhiratha , one of the charioteers of the royal household . But when the glance of Karna fell upon him he hurriedly left his throne and came and bent himself down before the old man leaning on his staff , and touched his feet with that head that was still wet with the sacred water of coronation . And Adhiratha embraced Karna , and wept for pride that he had been made a king , calling him his son . And Bhima , standing amongst the Pandava heroes , laughed aloud in derision . What ! What hero is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whip is your true weapon . Flow can he be a king who is the son of a charioteer ? " Karna 's lip quivered , but for sole reply he folded his arms and looked upward to the sun . But Duryodhana sprang up in wrath , and said : " The lineage of heroes is ever unknown ! What does it matter where a brave man comes from ? Who asks for the source of a river ? Was a tiger like this ever born of servants ? But even if it were so , he is my friend , and well deserves to be king of the whole world . Let him who has any objection to offer bend the how that Karna bends ! " Loud cheers of approval broke out amongst the spectators , but the sun went down . Then Duryodhana , taking Karna by the hand , led him away from the lamp-lit arena . And the Pandava brothers , accompanied by Bhishma and Drona , went back to their own place . Only Yudhishthira carried away the thought that none could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized her son , cherished the thought that after all he was king of Anga. 132 The Teacher 's Fee TH . THE TEA CHER ' S FEE The time had now come when Drona thought he should demand the offering due to the teacher from those he had trained . He therefore assembled together all his pupils , and said : " Seize Drupada , king of Panchala , in battle , and bring him bound unto me . This is the only return I desire as your master and preceptor . " The enterprise was wholly agreeable to the high-spirited youths , and with light hearts they got together an imposing array of chariots , arms , and followers , and set out for the capital of Drupada , not neglecting to strike at the Panchalas on their way . For it was the delight of the princes and nobles who went forth on this raid to display their prowess and skill as they went . And never did they make this more noticeable than when they entered the gates and clattered up the streets of Drupada 's capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verandahs of his palace to look down at the sight . But the knights , uttering their war-cry , shot at him a shower of arrows . Then Drupada , accompanied by his brothers , issued from his palace gates in due form on his white chariot , and set himself to encounter the raiding force . But Arjuna held back his brothers and himself from participation in what seemed to him a mere mere . He realized that the Panchala king , fighting in his own capital , would not be overcome by tactics of this order . But they would have the effect of wearying him , and then would be the opportunity for the Pandavas to act . Even as he had predicted , the white chariot of the king was seen , now here , now there , always driving forward , and always hastening toward that point where danger was greatest and the gathering of the raiders thickest , and X33 m Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists during these rapid movements he kept pouring into their ranks such a quick and constant shower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to assume that they were fighting not one , but many Drupadas . By this time the alarm had spread throughout the city , and drums and trumpets began to sound from every house , while the men poured out , ready armed , to the assistance of their king . Now there arose from the great host of the Panchalas a terrible roar , while the twang of their bowstrings seemed to rend the very heavens . A new and answering fierceness blazed up for a moment amongst the invading warriors , but wherever an arrow was shot , there it seemed stood Drupada in person to answer it . He was here , there , and everywhere , and careering over the field of battle like a fiery wheel , he attacked Duryodhana , and even Karna , wounded them , and slaked in right earnest their thirst for battle , till , seeing the host of the citizens to which they were opposed , the Kurus broke and fled with a wail of defeat back to where the Pandavas were waiting . The Might of Arjuna Hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariots . To Arjuna fell the leadership , as if by instinct , and he , forbidding Yudhishthira to fight or expose himself , quickly appointed the twins , his youngest brothers , protectors of his chariot-wheels , while Bhima , ever fighting in the van , ran forward , mace in hand , to lead the attack . Thus , like the figure of Death , Arjuna entered the host of the Panchalas . And Bhima with his club began to slay the elephants that covered them . And the battle became fierce and terrible to behold . Arjuna singled out the king and his general for his personal 134 The Vengeance of Drona attack . Then he succeeded in cutting down the flagstaff , and when that had fallen he leapt from his chariot , and casting aside his bow for his sword , he seized Drupada the king with as much ease as a huge bird seizes a water-snake . Having thus exhibited his own might in the presence of both hosts , Arjuna gave a loud shout and came forth from amongst the Panchalas , carrying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddened and would have made to devastate the whole capital of the Panchalas , but Arjuna in a loud voice restrained them . " Drupada , " he said , " is our friend and ally . To yield him up personally will satisfy Drona . On no account let us slay his people ! " Then all the princes together , bringing with them their captives , turned to Drona and laid before him Drupada together with many of his ministers and friends . The Vengeance of Drona Drona smiled quietly at the king who had once been his friend . Fear not , 0 king , " he said ; your life shall be spared . But would you not care to cultivate my friendship ? " Then he was silent for a moment . Again opening his lips , he said : In truth , Drupada , I love you no less to-day than of old in our boyhood . And I still desire your friendship . You told me , alas ! that only a king could be the friend of a king , and for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , in order that , being a king myself , I may enjoy your affection on equal terms . You shall be king of all your lands that lie on the south of the river Ganges , and I shall reign over those on the north . And now , Drupada , will it bemean you to grant me your friendship ? " 135 Myths of the Hindus ee Buddhists With these words Drona released Drupada , and bestowed on him the sovereignty of half his own kingdom , being those territories that lay south of the Ganges . And Drupada , with many compliments , assured him of his profound admiration and regard . But in his own mind the lesson that the mortified king laid to heart was that of his old friend 's superior resources , and from this time forth he in his turn wandered in all directions , even as Drona had wandered to Hastinapura , in the hope of discovering some charm or other means , by devotion or otherwise , to obtain a son who might work out his revenge on the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this enmity to Drona grew in time to be one of the main motives in the life of Drupada , king of the Panchalas . IV . THE HOUSE OF LA C It was about a year after the invasion of Drupada 's city that Dhritarashtra , moved by a sense of what was due , and having regard also to the welfare of his subjects , decided to crown Yudhishthira in public as heir-apparent of the empire . For Pandu , the father of Yudhishthira and his brothers , had been the monarch of the realm , and not Dhritarashtra , whose blindness had been considered to render him incompetent . It was now incumbent upon the blind king , therefore , to nominate Yudhishthira and his brothers as his successors , instead of any of his own children . And this , after the exhibition of knightly prowess that had introduced them to the world , he could no longer refuse to do . But the Pandava princes took their new position more seriously than anyone had foreseen . Never contented with mere enjoyment , they went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of the suzerainty , and constantly sent back to the royal treasury immense spoils . Duryodhana had been jealous of his cousins from his very childhood , but now , seeing their great superiority and their growing popularity , even his father , Dhritarashtra , began to be anxious , and at last he , too , could not sleep for jealousy . Feeling in this way , it was easy enough for a king to summon to his side councillors who would give him the advice he craved , and he was assured in due course that the extermination of his enemies was the first duty of a sovereign . But the Pandavas also had a watchful friend and adviser in a certain uncle named Vidura , who , though of inferior birth , was a veritable incarnation of the god of justice . Vidura had the gift of reading men 's thoughts from their faces , and easily at this juncture did he understand the mind of Dhritarashtra and his family . But he warned the Pandavas that while they ought to be on their guard , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power by allowing it to be seen that they understood their feelings . Rather must they accept everything that was done with an air of cheerfulness , and apparently without suspicion . About this time Duryodhana openly approached his father , begging him to banish his cousins to the town of Benares , and during their absence confer on himself the sovereignty of the kingdom . The timid Dhritarashtra could only acknowledge that the suggestion marched well with his own secret wishes , and this being so , his stronger-minded son quickly reassured him as to the difficulties that he foresaw . Theirs was at present , he pointed out , the command of the treasury . Having that , they could buy the popular allegiance , and no critic of their conduct would be strong enough 137 Myths of the Hindus &; Buddhists to oppose them . From this time Duryodhana began to win over the people by lavish distribution of wealth and honours .

Suddenly , at the word , the blind Dhritarashtra turned towards them with apparent kindness . " Then go , my children , " he said , you five brothers together , and satisfy your desire by living for some time in the city of Benares , and you shall take with you from the royal treasury largess for distribution . " There was no mistaking the fact that the words which sounded so friendly were really a sentence of banishment . But Yudhishthira , with his fixed policy , had sufficient presence of mind to bow cheerfully and signify pleasure at the opportunity given him . A day or two later the greyhaired Kunti set out with her five sons from Hastinapura . Purochanna , the friend and minister of Duryodhana , had , however , left still earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And especially he was instructed to build a house for them of highly inflammable materials and fitted with all the costliest furniture and equipments as close to the public arsenal as possible , that there he might live , as warden of the city , and watch for a suitable opportunity of setting fire to it , as if by accident .

On reaching the house he inspected it closely , and , indeed , the smell of lac , tar , and oil was strongly perceptible in the new building .
