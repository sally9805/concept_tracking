txt Of the plans formed in Washington for the defense of the country by air , land , and sea there is ' nothing disparaging to say . They have been well thought out , and while disputes have arisen regarding types of guns and of propelling machinery for battleShips , it is fair to assume that the selections have been made with good judgment . But , generally speaking , we have acquired little in the way of defense except the plans . With all the urgent appeals of naval and Military . experts , of *newspapers and speechmakers , for two years past . we ire still in a state of unpreparedness . The first batch of the new submarine chasers is to be ready in three months . In that time many disasters may occur . And the building of those small boats Is the slightest operation the Navy Department has in view . Supplies and equipment for soldiers are not ready , in spite of all the warnings . " Full equipment can be " obtained long before the men are " trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive from the Washington dispatches . The universal military training bills are to be brought forward In both houses of Congress early in . the extra session . That is as it . should be , and in both branches serious attention is to be paid to the General Staff 's plan , the chief features of which should be embodied in whatever bill is accepted . lint universal training and service plans are preparation for the future . and we are lacing present peril . The army system we have must be made the most of . Granting that about 300.000 men can be quickly placed under-arms after a fresh mobilization of the National Guard . the equipment of even that comparatively small force will be beset with difficulties . The question as to whether we may eventually send troops abroad , therefore , seems for the present purely academic . It is not worth while now to compute the number of warnings of danger to come unheeded by Congress . But It can scarcely be forgotten that in 1011 Secretary STimsox in his annual report pointed out the deplorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very little has since been done to provide that important branch of the military service with arms and ammunition . There is still only one field gun larger than six inches . We have no large siege guns . In the provision of airplanes for defense and scoutieg there have been needless delays . The disposition t &; correct these errors is commendable ; we are at least no longer dwelling in a fool 's paradise , but there is a great deal pf practical work to be done before we can effectively defend ourselves . There is encouragement in the manPer in which the citizen members of the Council of National Defense and the Naval Consulting Board have taken up their difficult tasks . : Men of action , who have had large experience lit business . they have succeeded in beginning the processes of industrial rind transportation mobilization . The railroads and the manufacturers in all parts of the country are co-operating with them , and so are the bankers . The appointment by the War Department of a Munition Standards Board of experts is a good move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . Our need of munitions is as great as our need of trained men . The regular army is not yet up to its authorized strength . The National Guard needs many recruits . The navy laCks , many men . The amount of work to be done is pro'digious . There will be no lack of " money . There will be no lack of patriotic spirit . But co-ordination of . energy in the departments ; rapidity . of work in shipyards and munition . factories , the manufacture of airplanes and seaplanes , the making of " tents and blankets and the thousands ? : : Of other things included in military . equipment arc the pressing needs , of the hour .

That is the size of the army , the . regulars , militia , and 40 : volunteers , which the Administration now intends raising with the consent of Congress . Its wouldl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in the event of a protracted war . We can train , arm , and mil ; such a body of men in all thc branches as quickly as any other nation . If we set bravely to work about it . But there is no time to lose .
