SUB-TITLE  --  DISSOLVE IN Since the world opened its baby eyes in the cradle of God , the Three Fates Endlessly have woven the skein of life . DISSOLVE OUT . Int . The Hall of the Three Fates  --  DISSOLVE IN . A filtered golden light from above ( amber tint ) falls upon the figures of the Three Fates weaving the skein of life . A black drop hangs in the rear . The floor is straw covered . All is indistinct a few feet away from the figures . To get the light effect from above , it is suggested that the diffuser is placed in front of two or three Klieg lights and about four feet away , and smoke is passed between lights and diffuser . Light from above will seem to come as mellowed streams which waver and fall across the figures below . From a corner of the room a brilliant shaft of light comes to the figure which sorts the threads . It is the golden thread of Love . FADE OUT . SUB-TITLE  --  In the beginning , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God saw that it was good . From the Infinite comes the golden thread of love to the weavers on the Loom of Destiny . SCENE 2 : Int . Hall of the Three Fates  --  SEMI-CLOSEUP  --  of the sorter of the threads of Life It is impossible to picture light with a thread . It must be left to the imagination of the audience that the light is a supernatural presence which sanctifies and strengthens the threads of life being woven by the Fates . Love can never be pictured any more than the threads of Life can be pictured , but it is possible because of its allegorical treatment to conceive of the threads of Life as a woolen skein . If we do this we have all the more license for considering the spiritual radiance or glow of the love of God being but a shaft of light , being God Himself . We are made in the image of God , and as the source of God 's love is inexhaustible , we can conceive of it being a part of every life woven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the camera should not be brought too close to this shaft of light . ( Perhaps it will require only the changing of the angle to take in the figure sorting . ) Pan the camera up as though tracing the source of the light from the infinite to its heavenly origin . Thus we plant securely the thread of life which after all is but God 's love mingling with all the other strands of life 's motives . Through this love some are able to quell ambition when it is false , but the love never having mingled with the thread in another life , or the human never having allowed it to mingle is unable to stifle the unworthy impulses . This is figurative , but in view of the development of the story from this point on it will become increasingly plain and when this same scene is repeated at the proper moments in the photoplay , the same symbolism will be caught and held .
