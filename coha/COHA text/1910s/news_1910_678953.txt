txt This was a hard day for the Administration Railroad bill . In both houses it was subjected to vigorous attacks . In the House a combination of insur ' gents and Democrats made several import tant amendments , the effect of which will be to limit the power of the proposed court of commerce and to take from the President and give to the Supreme Court the authority to designate the commerce Judges . The provision for the court itself , on which President Taft has insist , ed , was almost eliminated from the bill , the vote of the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole , Mr. Bennet of New York , being required to make a tie that killed a motion to strike out the section providing for the tribunal . On this pro ' posal the insurgents split . It was made amply evident , however , that the insurgent-Democratic coalition had the strength to put through important amendments at I any stage . ' .. In the Senate criticism came freely from the insurgents and Democrats . Senator Heyburn of Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was over Senator Aldrich was compelled to enter the fray . The fun began in the House as soon as ! the bill was taken up under the fiveminute rule . The first paragraph confers on the proposed commerce court the jurisdiction " now possessed by Circuit Courts . " In the twenty-fourth line of the bill were the words . " nothing hereinbefore contained Rif this act shall be construed as enlarging the jurisdiction now possessed by the Circuit Courts . " Mr. Lenroot of Wisconsin moved to strike out - hercinbefore. ' 1-lis theory was that that word left all the remainder of the bill free to enlarge the jurisdiction of the courts as much as it could . His action demonstrated , as hardly anything - else could , the suspicion of the insurgents re : garding the entire measure . His motion was adopted by a vote of 129 to 90 , the Democrats voting solidly . A little further along the bill provided for the designation by the Chief Justice tClikilitiBbituttideridi ? to serve as member 's of the new court , except that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the five new Judges to be appointed by the President . Mr. Lenroot moved to make the designating power a majority of ethe Justices of the Supreme Court . That was adopted by a vote of 143 to 11S . Then Mr. Lenroot moved to strike out the provision under which the five new Judges would at first constitute the court . Some of the insurgents bolted on that , not wishing to appear to criticise the President , but the motion was carried . 135 to 131 . When all this had been done . Judge Hubbard of Iowa , a member of the insurgent Steering Committee , moved to strike out the entire section . On a rising vote . Mr. Bennet of New York , who was in the chair , counted deliberately , and made this announcement : " On this vote the ayes are 130 and the nays are 129 . The chair votes in the negative , and the nays are 1 ? .0 , and the motion is lest . " Instantly there was a clamor for tellers . Mr. Fitzgerald of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could vote to break a tie , but not b make one . Mr. Bennet dodged a ruling by ordering a vote by tellers . When the tellers announced their count it was 140 in the affirmative and 130 in the pegative . Thereupon Mr. Bennet said : " Following the precedents the chair will vote . He votes in the negative , and on this question the yeas are 140 and the nays are 140 , and the motion is lost . " Mr. Fitzgerald did not renew his point of order , and the motion was lost for good , so far as the Committee of the Whole is concerned . But when the bill comets into the House there will be a record vote which may make a change . There were about 100 absentees of all factions to-day . Judge ** lost selely through the refusal re ' some of his insurgent colleagues to support him . He also tried to strike out section 2. and was beaten by 111 to 134 . This is the section which provides for appeals from the Commerce Court . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from interlocutory decrees of the Commerce Court setting , aside orders of the InterState Commerce Commission . He argued for it stoutly , but it was beaten , 134 to 135 : In the third section Judge Madison of Kansas put through an amendment . That election provided that the Commerce Court or one of its Judges- might allow a stay or suspension of an order of the InterState Commerce Commission for " not more than sixty days . " Mr. Madison moved to make it not more than seven days : On the rising vote there was again a tie at 126 , but the tellers found 13S for the amendment to 124-against it , and It was carried . Two notable speeches were made in the Senate . In one Senator Clapp objected to the fashion in which the railroad bill had been drafted by the Administration and presented to Congss for ratification . Ile also paid his respects to Attorney General Wickersham for trying to read the insurgents out of the party . Ott the Democratic side criticism of the bill came from Senator Hughes of Colorado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill . but technical as his speech necessarily was , the chamber remained well filled on both sides of the aisle until he concluded . The insurgents and his Democratic colleagues then crowded up with congratulations .
