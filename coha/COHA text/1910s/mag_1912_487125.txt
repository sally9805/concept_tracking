The reviewer at down before these three thick volumes with a determination to do his duty , yet with a distinct apprehension that he should be overtaken by fatigue before he emerged from the **27;938;TOOLONG chapter and- plunged into the twenty-four appendices . He was thinking of Mark Twain as an author of books , and his mind was still irritated by memories of the extravagant admirers who saluted the veteran of a thousand ovations as a superlative artist , a profound moralist , and a grave philosopher . He knew Mark Twain 's works tolerably well , greatly admired three or four of them  --  the others much less  --  and wished them all shorter . He remembered that Twain had been writing autobiography in one form or another for fifty years , and that the later instalments in the Noith American Review had affected him as painful and terribly prolix . He reflected on the fact that Mr. Paine was a man of Western education and sympathies , that Twain was his literary idol , and that this biography was the fruit of six years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for study and had dictated volumes of recollections He suspected that these 1,719 pages would constitute a last disproportionate monument under which the old humorist would be buried . Then he opened the book and began to read . When he left off reading two or three days later , he felt as if he had just returned from an exploration of the world , and were rounding out in tranquillity a restless life that had extended over three-quarters of a century He looked back over a stream of experience of historical breadth and national significance , in which the writing of books had been only an incident . He had been carried back to the days of Andrew Jackson , and , with the hope and hunger of the westward migration , had drifted as the slave-holding John Clemens out of Kentucky into Tennessee and ' on to Missouri , and there had died , dreaming in poverty of his 75,000 acres of Tennessee land unsalable at 25 cents an acre He had been born again in the son , half-educated , mischievous , and eager , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , ten years before the Civil War , and has made his first sensation by printing in ms brother s paper a poem inscribed " to Mary in H-1 Hannibal " He had taken one end of a Testament , his mother the other , and had promised not to " throw a card or drink a drop of liquor , " ' - and had set out to see the world , tstill as printer , in St. Louis , New York , Philadelphia , Keokuk , and Cmcuanat4 . But then he heard the call of the river , and for four years was a pilot , and studied the intricate mysteries , of the Mississippi , and laughed and jested with rivermen from St. Louis to New Orleans , till a shell from the Union batteries exploded in front of his pilothouse and ended that chapter Then for a few days as s6con.d lieutenant of an extemporized militia company , he rode a small yellow mule to the aid of the Confederacy . Next , the golden flare in the far , West caught his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he swapped yarns across seventeen hundred miles of plains till he reached Carson City , and became a miner , and suffered the quotidian fever of the prospector daily anticipating the yellow nuggets in the bottom of the pan , and filled his trunk with wild-cat stock , and knew the fierce life of frontier saloons and gara , bling hells From the unfruitful pick and shovel he passed on into the boisterous , bowie-knife journalism of the Enterprise , and thence to vitriolic humor on the Morning Call in San Francisco , and he sent his name to the Atlantic Coast with the " Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , " and lined his pockets with gold by a great news " scoop " in the Sandwich Islands . It was 1866 , he was thirty-one years old , and his career had just begun He now entered upon a forty-year engagement as a public lecturer , ' and competed successfully with Fanny Kemble and P T. Barnina , and made himself known personally to hundreds of thousands , and convulsed them with laughter . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his native land , plundered the vineyards of Greece ? presented an address to the Czar , visited Jerhsalem with the Innocents , sojourned in England and gossiped with the Prince of Wales , in Germany and dined with the Emperor , in India and was entertained by a native prince in Bombay , interceded with President Krueger for the prisoners of the Jameson Raid , captured the cities of Australia and New Zealand , and exauieu tribute from the whole world Three or four years after the Civil War he began to throw off books as a comet throws off meteors . Then he took up the burdens of a publisher , bargained with Gen Grant for his memoirs , and sold a quarter of a Million copies where the ' other bidder had planned for a sale of five or ten thousand His imagination took fire at a dream of magnificent wealth , and he became a great speculator , and in one year invested $100,000 in projects , and sunk a fortune in an unperfected type-setting machine , and went into bankruptcy .

Then the University of Oxford summoned the printer , pilot , miner , reporter , traveller , lecturer , author , publisher , capitalist across the sea , and robed him in scarlet , and made him a Doctor of Letters , and he retired into unofficial public life till the call came to set his course towards the sinking sun . . This is not the biography of an author ; it is the prose Odyssey of the American people ; and it will continue to be read when half of Mark Twain 's writings are forgotten . It will continue to be read because it conveys in relatively brief compass the total effect which he spent a lifetime in producing ? with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Paine loiters a little , it is true , through the mild Indian summer of Mark Twain 's final prosperity , but that was the period of his personal relations with his hero , and we must forgive him if , like an artist infatuated with his subject , he paints us several portraits differing only slightly in attitude and shading . His first two volumes are really marvels of compression ; he disposes , for example , of the trip to Palestine in twenty-odd pages , and of the voyage around the world in less ; yet we venture to predict that he tells about as much of those famous expeditions as after the lapse of a hundred years a more sophisticated posterity will stay to hear . From first to last he rejects tempting opportunities to digress into history and overflow into description ; he supplies only so much setting as serves to bring the actor into higher relief . He is under an illusion , we believe , as to the value of Mark Twain 's theology and philosophy and literature  --  notably in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but his sense of what we may call biographical value is admirable . His book is full of animated and characteristic phrase , gesture , and attitude . He has extenuated nothing of his hero 's weakness or his strength , and has set forth with all possible veracity the processes through which the man of the frontier became , without losing his es sence and his tang , quite literally the man of the world . No one recognized more frankly than Mark Twain himself that in a sense he was a raider from the Border . He never pretended to be the thing that he was not , and , on the other hand , he was never ashamed of the thing that he was . He planted himself , according to the Emersonian injunction , squarely upon his instincts , accepted the " society of his contemporaries , the connection of events , " and , with a happy faculty for turning everything to account , , capitalized his , very limitations . It was one of the secrets of his immense personal effect that he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , but rather like a man of affairs  --  erect , handsome , healthy , debonair  --  in his earlier years like prosperous ranchman , later like a financier , a retired field-marshal , an ambassador , or , as his friends would have it , like a king . It was an . iron constitution , tempered in the ' Mississippi and tested in the mining camps of the West , that enabled him to endure the stupendous fatigues of his great lecturing tours , to throw off 100,000 words of a novel in six weeks , to toil  --  without exercise and smoking heavily  --  all day and half the night , and , when he was past seventy , to talk copyright for hours with a hundred and fifty different Congressmen and radiate superfluous energy at a dinner in the evening , or to play billiards with his biographer till four o'clock in. the morning . If a kind of unconscious frontier impudence persuaded him of his competency as a Biblical critic , and carried him into the realm of abstract ethics , and led him late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the followers of Delia Bacon , it was a kindred and valuable mental innocence that made the first fifty years of his life a perpetual voyage of discovery , sharpened his observation and his appetite for experience , and preserved the vernacular vigor of his speech . Had he undergone in his formative period the discipline of an older and firmly stratified society , he would have been saved from some lapses in taste , but he would have lacked that splendid self-confidence which is born of living among an homogeneous folk , and which in the long run explained his unrivalled power , on the platform and in print , of getting in touch with his public . As pilot , miner , and Nevada journalist he found his most profitable associates among men rather than among women , and there he formed the habit of addressing himself to a robust masculine audience  --  a habit which gives him an almost unique distinction in American literature , and marks him clearly as belonging to the heroic age . It is a significant fact that he was introduced to his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of his on the voyage of the Innocents . It is an equally significant fact that the friendship terminated and the brother departed on a journey when he learned that the humorist intended to marry his sister . If Mark Twain ever became a lion among the ladies , it was because they liked lions , not because he accepted their conventions . He detested Jane Austen , her works , and her world ; and unabashed he accounted for his antipathy : " When I take up one of Jane Austen 's books , such as ' Pride and Prejudice , ' I feel like a barkeeper entering the kingdom ' of heaven . " What he thought of the " kingdom of heaven " he has set forth in another place . His religious ideas he had from Tom Paine and Robert Ingersoll  --  another mark of the spiritual frontier ; his finer moral feelings , from his wife and from his mother . In his rather heavy-handed attack upon Bourget , Mark Twain declared that there is nothing " characteristically American " except drinking ice-water . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , " It is characteristically American  --  always trying to get along short-handed and save wages . " If the eulogists of Mark Twain 's humor could hold themselves to a strict inquisition , they would find themselves praising sometimes his legitimate triumphs and sometimes  --  with an admiration for success that is characteristically American  --  his colossal crimes . His humor has many phases , but in the main it depends upon the absolutely reckless release of that speculative temperament and imagination which ruined the pioneers in Tennessee and squandered a fortune in unprofitable inventions . Mark Twain 's typical " good story " is something like a Western " good proposition " ; it is a magnificent lie with an insignificant kernel of truth . If the truth evaporates entirely , the result may be painful burlesque  --  such as we find in the low spots of " Huckleberry Finn " and the " Connecticut Yankee . " This Western humor depends also upon a perfectly fearless revelation of the reaction of the pioneer upon an unfamiliar environment . This is the prevailing humor of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential communications : " Whenever I enjoy anything in art , it means that it is mighty poor . The private knowledge of this fact has saved me from going to pieces with enthusiasm in front of many and many a chromo . " Nothing could be more delightful of its kind , unless it is the confession of a mistake that he made at Oxford after he had received his degree At a dinner given at one of the colleges he wore evening dress , but found the assembled company clad in their scarlet academic costume . " When I arrived the place was just a conflagration  --  a kind of human prairie-fire . I looked as out of place as a Presbyterian in hell . " But this humor sometimes depends also-upon a disregard of the proprieties , and on occasion it consists in nothing but this disregard of the proprieties . An example that pretty well illustrates this type may be found in the **28;967;TOOLONG chapter of the biography . The humor on this occasion consisted in reminding Gen. Grant and his veterans of the Army of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn banquet that once upon a time their grim commander-in-chief was wholly occupied in trying to get his big toe into his mouth ? " and if the child is but the father of the man , there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded . " The house , we are informed , came down with a crash , and Sherman exclaimed , " I do n't know how you do it ! " But that was what , in the present state of civilization , should be called a crime . It - is a crime against taste , colossal and barbaric . It is humor befitting the - bronzed revellers in Carson City or the Welsh giants of the " Mabinogion . " Mr. Paine , like some other recent critics , dwells with a kind of retaliatory gusto upon certain Brahminical reservations in the welcome accorded to Mark - Twain by members of the older New England inner circle ; he is sure that the world is now having its laugh at the Brahmins . He reminds us also that , while Twain was still on a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unrestrained delight in England . But the right explanation of the hesitation on this side of the water does not seem to have occurred to him . The fact is that Twain was hailed with jubilation by Englishmen because he answered perfectly to their preconceptions of the American character . They - could enjoy him , furthermore , with the same detached curiosity and glee that their ancestors at the Court of James I felt in the presence of Pocaliontas  --  antither typical American who , as we read , received marked attention from the Queen , and accompanied her to the Twelfth Night revels . We imagine that some gentlemen in Virginia were a little worried lest it should be - thought in England that all their wives were Indians  --  without deeming it at all necessary to apologize for Pocahontas ; she was a lovely barbarian , to be sure , but she was truly representative only of the dusky background of their civilization The Brahmins with some justice looked upon Mark Twain , and will continue to look upon him , as a robust frontiersman , produced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings the broad laughter of the plains , and only representing adequately an America that is already historical - and almost fabulous . We would no - more condescend to this Herculean humorist than to any other epic hero ; we - accept him heartily as we accept Robin Hood and Charlemagne , the wily Odysseus and Dick Whittington , thrice Lord Mayor of London . But , surely , in this day , when we are all exalting the primitive , it should be thought no diminution of his greatness to say that he would be out of place in the " Divine Comedy " or " Paradise Lost " ? to reaffirm that he is the hero of what our ballad enthusiasts call a " folk " epic , and that he wins upon us by the savory earthiness , the naive impudence , the lucky undisciplined strength of the folk hero .
