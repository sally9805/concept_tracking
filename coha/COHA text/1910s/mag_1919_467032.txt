NAZARETH and Damascus are IN wonderful names ; and apart from historical values each , with the country around it , stands for exceptional beauty . A journey from Nazareth to Damascus , therefore , gives " of the most finest pleasure , " as the Greek guard of a Turkish train assured us in his " most finest " English . But if you wish to see Syria at its best , travel otherwise than as a prisoner of war , sitting in a dirty cattle-truck and surrounded by Turkish guards , whose natural odor gives by no means of the most finest pleasure . Such were the conditions under which we ? four Australian officers and I ? came to Damascus . All the way from Nazareth we were guarded as closely ? as a secret meeting of the Peace Conference . Only three weeks earlier a British officer had escaped from Afuleh , and walked forty miles before he was recaptured ; so that in our case more than ordinary precautions were taken . We drove down the steep hill from Nazareth in three rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prisoners , and a pair of guards with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets ; but H. , whose giant height and strength the Turks respected , had a cart and two guards all to himself . At Afuleh we sat until nightfall in a mud hut , with the local population gazing and chattering through the open door , as if we had been strange animals . We welcomed the change to a covered cattle-truck on the railway , away from prying Turks and Arabs . In this truck , with coats serving as pillows , we lay on the filthy floor throughout the night , while the train jolted eastward over the badly kept track . Whenever I looked at the half-open shutter I met the eyes of a guard whose business it was to prevent us from jumping into the darkness . The next day we passed in playing cards , in looking at the wild hill country of Samaria , and , by juggling with the few French words he could understand , in trying to tell the Arab officer in charge of us just how contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesopotamia occupied by the British . This man , like most of the Syrian Arabs , showed himself anxious to help us . He gave us bread and hard-boiled eggs bought with his own money , and absolutely refused to take payment . As always , no food had been provided by the military authorities . So we jogged on , with many a halt , across the Jordan and round and up the steep , winding tracks in the hill country beyond it . We stopped for an hour at Deraa , where a Turkish doctor with pleasant manners and a dirty hypodermic-needle visited the truck . Having assured us that cholera was very prevalent in the British army , he proceeded to inoculate us , so that we might have no chance of taking the disease to Damascus . As a matter of fact , the British army in Palestine was entirely free from cholera ; while Damascus , as we afterward learned , was full of it . Fortunately , nothing worse than sore chests resulted from the use of his rusty , unsterilized needle . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a hill and came upon Damascus ; and , forgetful of captivity and cattle-trucks and guards and their attendant smells , I held my breath for the beauty of it . Away to the north stretched a belt of grainland , in vivid browns and greens . Beyond was a wooded area , reaching to the lower slopes of the mountain range that extends from Lebanon to Damascus . Down the lower slopes of the most easterly mountain flow the sources of Pharpar and Abana , the twin rivers . The streams twist downward until they lose themselves in a detached part of the old town , perched several hundred feet above the rest of the city . Farther below is Damascus itself ? a maze of flat buildings , squat mosques , and minaret spires , all in a uniform gray-white , as if sprinkled with the powder of time . The gray was now smudged with faint rose by the sinking sunlight . Eastward and southeastward stretches the great desert that leads to the sites of Babylon and Nineveh , to Bagdad , to Persia , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew from intelligence officers of the Palestine army , were many friends of the British . Nearly all the population , in fact , was antiTurk and anti-German . Could we make use of these sentiments in planning an escape ? What experiences and adventures awaited us in this oldest city of the world , that was famous in the days of Abraham , very famous in the days of Haroun-al-Rashid , and still famous in the days of Woodrow Wilson ? The first few of these experiences were by no means pleasant . Surrounded by the gleaming bayonets and eyes of the guards , who were clearly anxious lest we should disappear with the fading light , we were hustled from the railway to the police station and locked in a tiny room for four hours . Finally , just before midnight , the police led us to Baranki barracks , a large building used as a prison for military criminals . Tired , hungry , and disconsolate , we fell asleep on the bare bedsteads of the room as-. signed to us . But not for long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke , tingling all over and vaguely uncomfortable . To my surprise , I saw that C. was standing by his bed and , by the light of a candle , was stabbing at it . M. sat up suddenly , scratched himself , and swore softly in a series of magnificent Australian oaths . R. , who had not undressed , still slumbered . Ouch ! More sharp stingings came from my legs and arms . Bugs , and swarms of them ! In the prison at Nazareth I had lived with scores of the little red brutes so common in the Near East ; but here there were hundreds . They were crawling down the wall , falling on the floor , and biting every bit of flesh left exposed . lit a candle and found dozens on my bed . Lying on the floor was as impossible as lying on the mattress . I went to the window and looked into the night , thinking of the one matter that interested me in those days ? escape . Across the road was a large camp , bordered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the seven streams of Damascus . Straight ahead , weirdly colossal in the moonlight , were two great mountains . Beyond them , I knew , the great desert stretched through hundreds of miles to Mesopotamia . I was aware just how far the British Mesopotamian army had arrived on the way from Bagdad to Samarrah ; but , even if we were lucky enough to find a guide who could smuggle us into an eastwardmoving caravan , it would be almost impossible to make a detour around the Turkish army ; and in any case we should be dependent on the help of Kurds or Mesopotamian Arabs , who are much less estimable than the Arabs of Syria and Arabia . No , that plan was not feasible . I considered the suggestion of C. ? that we should make our way to the coast , hiding in the daytime and walking only at nights ; and then , arrived at Acre or Tyre , or some such seaport , commandeer a sailing-boat and make for Cyprus or Jaffa . For this plan . also , the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion the Turks had laid all Syrian fishing-craft on the beaches , with holes knocked in their sides , so that they might not be floated . This I had noticed at Haifa , when taken there for a day 's outing by German aviators . To be sure , a certain number of boats were kept for officers and officials to go fishing in , but these would be well guarded , and , even if we managed to steal one of them , it would have to be towed into deep water by swimmers , which was scarcely practicable in the darkness . In any ease , a walk to the coast from Damascus must cover many nights . A guide would be essential , as otherwise we could not buy bread on the journey , since none of us spoke Arabic . And a guide would cost a deal of money , of which we had little . My scheme of getting into touch with the secret caravans by means of which Arabs and Armenians were slipping southward , from Damascus to Akaba , still seemed the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides a reliable intermediary . Money we might obtain by smuggling a letter to the Spanish consul , who had charge of British interests in Damascus . As for an intermediary , we should have to trust the gods to give us one from among the guards . Whatever we did would have to be done quickly , for we should not be long in Damascus . By the time I had reached this conclusion I was tired enough to fall asleep despite the bugs . The morning toilet included a ceremony that every prisoner in Turkey found it necessary to perform after traveling on the railway ? a careful hunt for lice in our clothes . The search was very productive , and led to talk of the plague of typhus which was being spread all over Turkey by these vermin . For the rest of the morning all that happened was a short visit from the commandant . By now , having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours , we were irritable with hunger . I made known this fact to the commandant , who promised that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , withbent shoulders , a. greasy face , and a fantastically long nose . Here , I thought , is a possible intermediary . I asked him to return later . During the afternoon he entered softly and announced : " I am George , interpreter of English . I am friend of English , honest to God . " George was a native of Beirut , half Syrian . part Greek , part Jew , and wholly scoundrel . I will not mention his family name , in case this should be read by some Syrian who knows him ; and I bear the little brute no malice . Were I writing fiction I should call George a SyroPhenician , which is an impressive term , but means nothing ; but as he really happened I can only describe him as a Levantine mongrel . Some time or other in his checkered life he spent three months in America , where he learned to say " Honest to God " quite well , and to speak a queer jargon of English quite badly . By reason of this accomplishment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he spoke French much better than he tried to speak English , conversation with him was possible . He had the teva.ntine habit of using mon cher in every other sentence when talking French ; and this he applied to his English by saying " my dear " on the least provocation . M. , who could speak no French , asked him to smuggle a letter to the Spanish consul . " My dear , " he replied , " I take it with lots of happiness . My officer shall not know the letter , I guess . " The Spanish consul replied by return , and next day we were each presented with twenty Turkish pounds ? about sixty dollars at the then rate of exchange . This rather annoyed the Turkish commandant , who had himself given each of UN seven Turkish pounds , being our first month 's pay as captive officers . With four hundred dollars between us we were now in a much better position to prepare a scheme of escape . I decided to plumb the depths of George 's " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should have to take him with us , if possible . If we left him behind he would be suspected , and the Turks might frighten him into betraying us . An opportunity came that same evening . George had been telling of the starvation in Damascus , of the death from destitution of forty per cent . of the Lebanon population , of the hangings without trial , of the general discontent all over Syria , of the terrible conditions of his own imprisonment for sixty days because he had been suspected of spying for the King of the Hedjaz . " Would n't you like , " said M. , " to be away from this nightmare of a life and in a peaceful country like Egypt ? " " I guess yes , my dear , " said George . " But I wish to quit the East and live among English . " " Well , " said C. , " I could find you a comfortable job in Australia . " " ' Very obliged . I take your address and write when the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of us may be alive when the war 's over . How would you like to take the job now ? " " What can you desire to say , my dear ? " There was an awkward pause . We were shy of carrying the matter farther , for chance-met Levantines , like politicians , do not as a rule inspire confidence . Yet it had to be done . I continued the conversation in French , George 's weird English being a bad medium for the discussion of secrets . " If , " I promised , " you help us to escape and come with us , we will give you not only money , but a job for life in Australia . " George 's face whitened suddenly , and for the rest of that evening his hands shook with excitement . " There is nothing I wish so much , mon cher , " he said , " as to escape to the British . But it is very difficult and would need much money . Also I have so little courage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed suspicions . But the sentry ? a black Sudanese ? was sitting on the floor , gazing at and thinking of nothing , after his usual stupid fashion . George returned , and for half an hour we discussed and rediscussed possibilities . .11e pronounced the scheme of walking to the coast in a series of night marches , and then stealing a boat , to be impossible . The idea of joining a caravan to Akaba he judged more hopeful , but that would mean hiding in Damascus until the next party was ready to start ; and hiding in Damascus would he not only highly dangerous , but highly expensive . Anyhow , the Armenians who organized the secret caravans must be shy of adding immensely to their risks by taking British officers ; and if they did take such risks they would expect to receive more ready money than we possessed . Also , it would be very difficult to get into touch with them . George was silent for several moments , then announced that he would try to find an Arab , from among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence through the mountains to the Dead Sea regions . For this also , be pointed out , money would be necessary ? and gold , not paper . We could only change our paper notes at the rate of four and a half paper pounds for one in gold ; and the slim obtained by this means would be too little . " But , " I pointed out , " if we go south below the Dead Sea , to the country occupied by the Hedjaz army , we can get gold enough . Have n't you heard of the treasure at ' X , ' of a certain Arab emir , of certain British officers ? " " Mon cher , I have heard a lot of this treasure , and so have many of the Bedouins around here . But perhaps I shall not be able to convince my Arab friend that you could obtaingold from it . " I gave George arguments enough to convince his Arab friend , and made him swear by his professed Christianity that he would keep secret our conversation . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thrilled by renewed hope , I looked out of the window into the Eastern evening , and speculated on what the god of chance might do for us . To he effective he would have to do a lot . There was , for example , the Austrian sentry whom I could see below , leaning against 4 motor-lorry . If he were active on whatever night we fixed for our escape , how could we climb down to the ground unobserved ? The window itself offered no difficulties , for it was above the street and on the first floor , so that a few bedclothes tied together would suffice to lower a man out of the barracks . Then , while I was still watching the sentry , a different god intervened . A hooded girl sidled up to him . After looking round to see that nobody was watching , he crossed the road and disappeared with her into the meadow to the left of the camp . An omen , I thought . If , on escape-night , chance spirited away obstacles as easily as that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses whitened in the lightof the young moon , and the river Pharpar radiated soft shimmerings . In this respect , also , chance should favor us . From seven to ten days later ; when we hoped to leave , the moon would not rise until after midnight , so that darkness would help us to slip from the barracks , and moonlight would help us as we moved across open country . Just then my meditations were chased away by a fantastic , faraway sound . Somewhere in the maze of streets a wheezy barrel-organ Was playing ? and playing " Funiculi funicula " ! How a barrel-organ found itself in Damascus , and in war-time Damascus , I did not try to guess . All I knew or wanted to know was that across the warm , sensitive night air floated the lively tune : and if you are away from Europe and old enough to remember the famous ditty , take it from me that nothing will bring you to the back streets of London , of Paris , of Naples as quickly as a barrel-organ playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song 's words came as a matter of course , and with them memories of the good days they stood for . For long after the barrel-organ had become silent , and only the moonlight and the stillness remained , I was back in England . Late next morning George burst into the room with a beaming face and a palpable desire for news-telling . " Mon cher , " he said to me , " I have found a Druse who will guide you . He knows about the gold , and , although not quite sure , he thinks he can trust you , as ' British officers , to see that he gets paid . He demands two hundred pounds in gold when you reach ' X , ' and fifty pounds in paper now , for the hire of horses . " I was overjoyed at this new prospect of a road to liberty ; but when I had translated George 's French for the benefit of the Australians , M. counseled caution . " I do n't like the sound of that fifty pounds down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay anything till we 're outside Damascus and have the horses . " We decided that unless we conformed to the Oriental custom of always beating down an adversary in a bargain the Arab would think we could be blackmailed for any amount of money . He might even regard too ready an acceptance of his terms as evidence that we did not mean to pay on arrival at " X. " Finally we told George to place the following terms before the Druse : one hundred pounds in gold on arrival , and fifty pounds paper when we were on horseback and away from Damascus . For the present , nothing . As for George himself , he should receive fifty English pounds when we reached safety , and his job in Australia . Next day George returned from the bazaar with the reply that the Druse would be satisfied with one hundred and twenty-five pounds in gold at " X , " and had agreed to leave the question of ready money for the horses until we were out of Damascus . He demanded another twenty pounds paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the horses after we had ridden to the mountains at Deraa . To these terms we agreed , as the withdrawal of the demand for money in advance evidenced the genuine intentions of the Arab . " The Druse desires to remark you , " said George , breaking into English . " To-morrow an officer will lead you to public baths in the city . When I say to pay attention , observe an Arab who will carry a yellow burnous and robe . " And so it happened . We had our bath , and , escorted by a Greek doctor in the Turkish army , with several guards and George the Inevitable , we walked through the hot streets toward the bazaar . " Honest to God ! " said George , suddenly , for it had been agreed that this phrase should signal the presence of the Druse . I searched the crowd of Arabs gathered in the road at the corner of a narrow turning , and had no difficulty in picking out , right in the foreground , a tall , fierce-mustached man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone butt of a long pistol , stuck through his sash , and with the other he fingered the two rings round his burnous . He looked at us long and intently , especially at H. , with his six feet four inches of magnificent physique ; then backed into the growing crowd and disappeared . ' " Do n't look to behind you , my dear , " said George , whose inability to control himself had again blanched his face , " or my officer will observe . " That walk to and from the big haulmam ( Turkish bath ) in the center of Damascus is perhaps the most vivid of my memories of the city . Wherever we passed , a mass of Arabs , Syrians , and nondescripts surged around us , until the road was blocked and our guards had to clear the way forcibly . Bargaining at the stalls was suspended as we moved Months afterward , after I had escaped from Constantinople and was back in Damascus , I discovered that the street at the corner of which we had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be The Street called Straight , " whither one Ananias was sent to land St. Paul , stricken blind by his vision on the road to Damascus . VOL . CXXXIX. ? No. 831. - 45through the Long , covered-in bazaar , with its carpets and prayer-rugs , its bloodsausages , its necklaces in amber , turquoise , and jade , its beautiful silks and tawdry cottons , its copper-work , its old swords and pistols , and its dirty , second-hand clothes ? all laid out haphazard for inspection . Once , when we entered a shop , the crowd that collected before it was so large that the guards took us outside by a back door . Yet one sensed that this interest was for the most part friendly . The Arabs expected the British army sooner or later , and wanted the British army . Meanwhile they were anxious to see what manner of men were the British officers . We were not a very impressive group , with our bare heads and our much-creased uniforms . What saved us , from the point of view of display , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. , at whom every one gazed in open admiration . As we passed through the gardens on the way home an inium , from the ground below his mosque , was chanting something to a small gathering . On investigation we found a large map of Gallipoli and the Dardanelles , marked out in the soil fronting the mosque , with hills and trenches and guns and battle-ships shown on it . The imam was telling the Faithful just how the unbelievers had been driven off the peninsula by the invincible Turkish army . This he did each afternoon , we were assured . Everywhere was evidence of destitution , starvation , and squalor . The streets were utterly filthy , as if they had not been cleaned for months or years ; which , indeed , was probably the case . Disused tram-lines reared up two or three feet above the worn road , so that camels , donkeys , and pedestrians constantly tripped over them . Along the principal streets one had to turn aside , every dozen yards or so , to avoid enormous holes . Half-crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The magnificent old mosque which is one of the beauties of Damascus was decaying into decrepitude , without any attempt at support or restoration . As for the population , most were in rags , very few had boots , about one-half wore sandals , and the remainder went about barefooted . Yet even the destitute Arabs were more attractive than the wellto-do Levantines with their frock-coats and brown boots and straw hats . All the poorer Arabs and Syrians looked half starved , and we must have passed hundreds of gaunt beggars ? men , women , and children . Worst of all were the little babies huddled against the walls and doorways . Ribs and bones showed through their wasted bodies , which were indescribably thin except where the stomach , swollen out by the moistened grain which had been their only sustenance , seemed abnormally fat by contrast . So weak were they that they could scarcely cry their hunger or bold out a hand in supplication . Arab mothers , themselves on the verge of starvation , had left them , in the vain hope that Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least notice , until they were dead . The police then removed their small bodies for burial ; and more starving mothers left more starving babies by the roadside . The Greek doctor told me that forty such babies died in Damascus each day . The next few days were buoyant with expectancy . We collected raisins and other foodstuffs , while George went backward and forward into the city to communicate with the Druse . We now hoped to leave the barracks without especial difficulty . The Austrian sentry below , we discovered , remained inside the doorway after midnight , so that it would be possible to slip down from the window without being seen or heard by him . One night we half hitched our blankets together as a test , and found that they would be fully strong enough to bear even the weight of H. , if tied to an iron bedpost . A more difficult problem was that of the guard outside our room . There were three blacks who performed this sentry duty in turn , two Sudanese and one Senegalese ? Sambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jumbo and Hobo were intensely stupid and lazy . They spent their night watches in dozing on the floor of the corridor . Our door was closed each night , so that conditions would be ideal if either of them were on guard on escape-evening . Sambo was more alert . He had been a postal messenger at Khartoum , and as such spoke a certain amount of English . When Turkey entered the war , he told us , he had been traveling to Mecca for a pilgrimage , and the Turks conscripted him . Twice he had been in prison ? once because he attempted to desert and once because an Arab prisoner whom he was guarding escaped . Apparently he had learned a lesson from this latter misfortune , for he never dozed when on sentry duty . Obviously , if he were outside our door on the evening , we should have to find some means of dealing with him . We sent George to buy chloro-form , . but he returned with the news that none could be found in Damascus . Thereupon we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rubber , to be used on Sambo if necessary . Then , with these preliminary arrangements settled , they tumbled down like a house of cards . We were moved to a room on the north side of the building , so that a number of arrested Turkish officers might be put into our larger apartment . Our first thought , on entering the new quarters , was for the window . Ten thousand curses ! It looked on to an open courtyard . Two sentries promenaded the yard , which was surrounded by a brick wall . " My dear , " said George when he next visited us , " the business is lost . It is by all means impossible to leave this window without observation from Turks . " For hours the Australians and I sought a way out of the new difficulty , and sought vainly , for it was George whose cunning rescued our plan from the blind alley . He would leave his rifle at the top of the back stairway , he said , then come to our room and usher us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was taking us to an officer 's room ( as often happened in the evening ) . Next he would recover his rifle , slip down the stairway to the Austrian section of the barracks and , with bayonet fixed , lead us out of the side door guarded by an Austrian sentry . The advantage of the Austrian door was that the sentry , seeing a Turkish soldier walking out with prisoners , would think he was taking them to the railway station , or not think about the matter at all ; whereas the Turkish guard at the main door would have recognized George and known that something was wrong . George could not take more than three of us , as a larger number with only one guard must make even the Austrian suspicious . He refused point-blank to return to the barracks and repeat the performance so that four of us might go . C. could not come , for personal reasons that would not allow him to let his fate remain unknown for several months . The party , however , was still one too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate problem of who was to stay behind . M. cut lowest , to his bitter disappointment and my regret , for he was very plucky and resourceful . Once more with a definite plan in view ? and apparently a better one than the last ? H. , R. , and I fixed a date for the escape . Having calculated the times of the rising and setting of the moon , and communicated with the Druse , we chose the third evening from the day of our removal to the new room . Meanwhile we had been treated by no means badly . A few nights of irritation accustomed us to the plague of bugs , and constant searching and washing kept our clothes fairly free from more repulsive vermin . For the rest , we passed the days with poker , bridge , and perfecting our plans . We could not grumble at the food , for we messed with the Turkish officers , who , while not feeding as well as German privates , never actually went hungry . Indeed , we met with much kindness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers and guards took their cue from the commandant . If , as at Afion-kara-Hissar during the reign of one Muslim Bey , the commandant were a murderer , a thief , and a degenerate , unspeakable outrages were committed . If , as at Baranki barracks , Damascus , in the days of Mahmoud Ali Bey , the commandant were good-natured , conditions were passable . Some of the Turks , in fact , wanted to be too friendly . The deputy-corn mandant invited us into his room one evening , and with his friends sitting around and George acting as interpreter , asked for an exposition of England 's reasons for taking part in the war . For two hours I delivered myself of anti-German propaganda , though I could not tell what force remained in my arguments after they had passed through the filter of George 's curious translation . Meanwhile the deputycommandant looked at his finger-nails and occasionally smiled . He was noncommittal in expressing his own views ; but afterward , when coffee was handed round , he declared that the talk had been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon to the beautiful spot , on a high slope outside the city , where the sources of the seven rivers are gathered within a space of fifty yards . In the scorching heat we undressed and bathed in the river Abana . We had ample evidence of the widespread hatred of the Germans throughout Syria , both among civilians and soldiers . Turkish soldiers expressed the greatest dislike and envy of the Germans , and German soldiers expressed the greatest contempt for the Turks . As for the Arab officers , they were wholeheartedly pro-British . Nahed Effendi Malek , the young Arab adjutant , often visited us , with his friend the quartermaster , when no Turkish officers were near . The pair talked the most violent sedition . The quartermaster wanted to be with his brother , a prisoner at Alexandria . The Turks knew this , and once . when in prison for several weeks as a suspect , he had been freed only by a - liberal distribution of baksheesh among the military autWorities . Both he and Nahed were kept separate from their families , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relatives or friends would pay forfeit for any breach of loyalty . Like all officers of their race , they were now kept expressly from the fighting front because so many Arabs had deserted to the British . This very barracks , declared Nahed , was full of imprisoned officers whose loyalty the Turks suspected . Unless they could bribe their way to a release they might be shut up in one small room for months ? unpaid , forgotten , and living on such food as their friends provided . Then , if their prayers - and petitions brought about a trial , they would probably be acquitted and graciously released ; but neither reparation for the months of captivity nor military pay for the period of it would be given . Our own room had lately been occupied by a Turkish colonel who shot dead a fellow-officer . Assassination being a less serious crime than dislike of oppression , and the colonel having been an expert juggler with military supplies and funds ( like so many Turkish colonels , who bought the command of their units as an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he delivered sealed envelops to various high officers - and officials , and within a week was free . Nahed and his friend talked savagely of the hunger and misery that ravaged Syria , of the killing and imprisonment of Arab sheikhs , of their hopes of an independent Arab kingdom , of their galling helplessness against the Turks and Germans until the British arrived . " But once let the British reach Deraa , " said Nahed Effendi , " and you will hear of such an uprising as Syria has never known " ? a prediction that was to be fulfilled during General Allenby 's - whirlwind ' advance . Sometimes , instead of confiding their wrongs and hatreds , they would chant Arabian songs of love and war , or order George to translate stories and epigrams of Haroun-al-Rashid and other Arabian notabilities . Once George substituted a sentence of his own for the tale he should have retailed for our benefit : " My dear , I must go to the city to see ray friend . Soon it is too late and my officer say no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " M. laughed , as if in enjoyment at a translated story , and H. , turning to Nahed , said , " Kweis kaleer " ( " Very good " ? two of the very few Arabic words that he knew . A little later I asked for and received permission to send George to buy wine for us in the bazaar ; and the mongrel interpreter , with a " mills fois merci , mon cher , " shambled off to see the Druse . We realized that it would be very unfortunate for little Nahed if we escaped ; and we should be sorry to think of him in prison on our account . But it was obvious that , even if he would , he could not come with us , and we certainly dared not confide in him . As I lay half awake , early on the morning of May 15th , I was conscious that an exceptional day had dawned ; but my drowsy faculties could not recall what it was that was imminent . Then the door opened , and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch , there entered the Syrian milkman , with his tin pan slung over his shoulder . I was alert in an instant . Why , of course , we had reached escapeday , and we must buy a stock of biscuits for the journey from this dairyman whose privilege it was to make us pay five piastres for each glass of goat 's milk that he sold us for breakfast . But today he had brought no biscuits ? and that was the first of a heartbreaking sequence of mischances . Throughout the day H. , R. , and I remained in a state of high tension . Yet my principal concern was for the lack of self-control shown by George , who walked about with shaking knees and unsteady hands and anxious face . " For God 's sake do n't show yourself like that to the Turkish officers ! " said H. " My dear , I am not brave , and fortune never visits me . " His fear was pitiful . " Pray for it , then . " And George prayed , melodramatically and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take us quickly to Arab with horses . " The thermometer of hope quicksilvered up and down every few minutes , throughout the pregnant hours of afternoon . For the ninety-ninth time I examined the packets of raisins , the bread , and the water-bottles ; for the hundredth time I reviewed the details of our plan . Between ten o'clock and midnight the Druse was to wait by the station , with long head-dresses that should be disguise enough for the moment , because in the darkness a passer-by could only see us as silhouetted outlines . Soon after ten George was to take H. , R. , and me through the side door , according to plan , and lead us to the Druse . Then we would slip out of Damascus to the spot where another Arab was waiting with the horses . We must ride over the plain all night and hide the next day in a certain Druse village , where a but had been prepared for us . We could buy arms in the village . We would travel without rest throughout the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deraa , whence the second Arab was to take back the horses . Once in the mountains , an army could scarcely retrieve us . We should run more than a little danger from Arab nomads , but these might be friendly , and in any case the Druse - would be our protector and mouthpiece among his fellows .. For weeks we should be trekking over the mountains and desert east of the Turkish lines in the Jordan Valley , and the hardships would be very great . Eventually we should arrive among our allies of the Hedjaz . Having reached " X " and paid off the Druse , we could be taken on hoard one of the British war-ships in the Red Sea . We might well meet a raiding party ofthe Emir Feisul 's Bedouins near Amman , in which case safety would come much sooner and we could travel by aeroplane to the British army in Palestine . After dinner the signal officer invited us to his room for . eoffee . Having no legitimate excuse for declining , we chafed under his small talk until nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again we were forced to sit still and deliver , from time to time , in response to the translations of George , a fretful " Yes , " or " No , " or " Good , " or " Thank you . " Ten o'clock came and went , but two suggestions that we should retire to bed were brushed aside by the Arabs . By now the Druse would be waiting for us outside the railway station . Eleven o'clock arrived and still Nahed continued to draw from his endless store of tales and similes . " My officer say , " announced George , " an Arabian poet compare the breasts of a fellow 's beloved to ? Please , my dear , say you must go to bed . I shake and feel I must give np . Soon it is too late to leave , honest to God . " Ourselves almost desperate with annoyance , we performed a series of lifelike yawns and declared ourselves to he very tired . Thereupon , to my great relief , the Arab officers withdrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spoke to George when the officers had entered their own room . " In three minutes you must come back . " " I will try , but I have so little couraze. , , " Think of Australia and of the money . " " Mon cher , I have thought of them all day , but my heart says , Boum ! Bourn ! ' and a voice tells to me ' Quittez cal ' But I will come back . " He did not come back . Before George had left me evil chance sent the deputycommandant ? a Turk ? along the passage for one of his rare visits of inspection . While he was looking at us George 's overwrought nerves snapped and he broke down . " A ? ee.1 " he groaned , and grabbed instinctively at my arm . Shaking visibly , he lowered his head and waited . I backed into the doorway , while the deputy-commandant took George to Nahed 's room . What followed we could deduce from the noises that swept the corridor . George was bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted orders , and the unmistakable sound of blows with the bare hand . Nahed ran to our room and counted us feverishly . Then came the corporal of the guard , puzzled and scowling . Finally , six Turkish soldiers replaced Jumbo outside the door , which Nahed locked from the outside . Disgusted with George , disgusted with ourselves , and , above all , disgusted with fate , R. and 1 paced up and down , or lay sleepless on the bedstead. through hours of utter despair . H. , the only one of us to make a show of indifference , took a pack of cards and played patience on his bed , and said not a word . The door remained locked until the following midday , when the commandant arrived with Nahed and George , both of whom showed reluctance to enter . " My officer knows , " declared George , with eyes averted . " You are to collect the clothes and go to railway . They send you to Aleppo , 1 guess . " I noticed that one of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully , but confiscated nothing . Next he demanded why we had wanted to escape and who had been helping us . " Tell him we refuse to say anything , " M. answered . And with that he had to be content . Surrounded by no less than twelve guards , we carried our few belongings to the railway station and entrucked for Aleppo . A Turkish officer , with the interpreter , stayed until the train left . All of us took care not to look at George ; but I could sense his misery and shamefaced discomfort . At length ,
