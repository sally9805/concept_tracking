These are Presidential prediction days , and they are giving us a flood of forecasts that would be perfectly conclusive if they did not destroy one another . Each campaign manager sees rosy . He confesses , if you press him , that six weeks ago the prospect was troubled , but now every cloud has been s iept from the horizon , and " unless all signs fail , " a sweeping and glorious victory is to perch upon his banner . But t-o it is on all other banners . Dixon and Perkins are not carrying New York for Roosevelt any more positively and solemnly than Barnes and Koenig are for Taft Senator Dixon is really splendid . He has the Roosevelt ' vote , both popular and in the Electoral College , figured out to a nicety , and has put out his statement without the flicker of an eyelid Not less enthusiastic is Mr. Perkins , but he has not the full aplomb of Dixon Stating that his confidential reports show that Roosevelt is going to carry several Southern States , he adds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms correspondents " may be stuffing " him . This is a momentary weakness in Perkins . The true election prophet must not admit that by any possibility can he be mistaken . He should say with calm authority , as does a Roosevelt organ , that all " unbiassed polls " show the Colonel'far in the lead . One such unbiassed poll was printed last week by a Roosevelt paper in New York , showing that the employees in a certain establishment in this city stood : Roosevelt , 29 , Taft , 8 , and Wilson 7 . But the head of that firm has since written to the Tribune to say that he employs only eight men , two of whom are under age . Thus is doubt cast upon a sure word of - prophecy . One hears wonder expressed why campaign managers should think it necessary or desirable to don the prophet 's robes which so ill become them . Do they expect people to believe that they know as much as they pretend to know ? Are they not fully aware that their loud predictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage up ? Well , all this is one of the pleasing little arts of their profession which they feel that they can not afford to neglect . By stoutly claiming everything , they may get something . If not the whole silk gown , at least a sleeve of it . The fact that previous forecastsof theirs have turned out ludicrously astray , they do not permit to deter them . They feel a kind of fatality upon them . They alter Descartes 's phrase , and say , " I predict , therefore I am . " What are they there for except to make prophecies ? Students of these matters have noted one invariable rule : the more hopeless the chances of any given party , the shriller become its advance cries of victory . In 1892 the Republican party met a smashing defeat , but Chairman Carter would hardly grant , before the election , a single State to Cleveland . As Republican prospects declined , Carter 's claims rose . So it has been again and again ; and Senator Dixon is but following venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when the general conviction has become established that their situation is desperate . Along with these official auguries go a vast number of " straw votes . " Of these we do not hold so low an opinion as Mr. Dooley . He assured Hennessy that nothing so strong as American politics could be taken through a straw . There are straw votes and straw votes ; some of them obviously worthless , but some highly significant . If we could get enough of them , fairly typical of sentiment in various parts of the country , impartially taken and honestly reported , we should have a very trustworthy indication how the election would go The trouble with most straw votes and " postal-card votes " is that we have no means of knowing how accurately they represent the real preferences of the section or class which they profess to canvass . They may , indeed , give us an inkling of what the decided and clamorous voters mean to do , but the uncommitted vote , the silent vote , may escape them altogether . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changed vote . It is the shifting of party allegiance that is the crucial thing ; and the ordinary straw vote tells us little or nothing about that . It is of no use to set forth polls showing that Roosevelt or Straus , as the case may be , is going to receive such and such numbers of votes , unless information is at the same time given how many of those votes are to come from Democrats : Every man of sense knows that , unless there is a marked Democratic defection this year , the sharp division onthe other side will make Wilson 's triumph easy and certain . It needs no one t-isen from the dead to tell us this . Nor is any remarkable mathematical ability or skill in divining the future necessary . All that one has to do is to take a pencil and paper and sit down with the figures of previous elections . But no one has produced evidence that any large body of Democrats will cease voting for their party . Mr. Don M. Dickinson , of Michigan , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention of supporting Roosevelt ; and the effusiveness with which the Colonel greeted him last Sunday implies that he has had few occasions of that kind to hold out his hand . Even if as many as 10 per cent . of the Democrats were to vote for Roosevelt  --  and there is no proof whatever that the number will be near that  --  the remainder would mean a comfortable plurality ovei any division of the Republican vote between Roosevelt and Taft that is at all conceivable . It is the hard-headed perception of this truth , we suppose , that holds the betting odds firmly at 4 to 1 on Wilson , despite the best that Dixon and Perkins can do . We have no thought of taking a turn at prophecy ourselves . Do n't , onless ye know . But we are confident that every man can be his own prophet as wisely as he can put faith in the vatminations of Barnes or Perkins or McCombs . He can look about him . He can sound his friends and acquaintances He can study the signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can put aside his own hopes or fears as irrelevant , take the main facts of the party situation as they stand out clearly , and make as good a guess as the next man . When it is beyond question that some , at least , of our political forecasters are lying prophets , there is no , reason for believing that any of them are divinely inspired . THE BECKER VERDICT . It is obvious that the verdict of the Jury in the Becker case came as a surprise to most people . A disagreement was the common and confident prediction . This did not mean that Becker was not generally believed guilty . We suppose that the details of the murder of Rosenthal , as they were little by little made public , left no doubt at all in the minds of intelligent men that Becker had a direct connection with that - crime which startled a city even as hardened to such things as New York . It was not his guilt , but the legal proof of it , that was called in question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the abhorrent character of so many of the witnesses , would result , at best , in a hung jury . Hence the general astonishment  --  which is also an unmistakable feeling of relief  --  at the verdict of murder in the first degree . This must be regarded as a most tonic event . It shows , for one thing , that justice in New York need not always move on leaden feet The bold assassination of Rosenthal was done on July 16 . In less than three months Becker was brought to trial . All the involved processes of first detecting his hidden responsibility for the crime , next of marshalling the evidence on which he was indicted , and then of getting his case before a jury with skill and force sufficient to cause his conviction , were got through successfully with great speed . The sword of the law was not allowed to rust in the scabbard . People had not forgotten what the crime was before judgment had been pronounced upon it . The net - result can not fail to restore confidence in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in all large cities . Even more important is it to have the demonstration that the weapons of the law are sharp and strong enough to cut through the network of police collusion with crime It has been the boast of tl- e " system " that it could snap its fingers at the criminal code and defy prosecutors and the courts . Nothing would happen . Everything would soon blow over . Even if any man was caught , he ould be got off . That was the burden of the talk , as sworn to , between Becker and his hired assassins . The confederation between the police and favored criminals was represented as too powerful , with too many ramifications , for the District Attorney to break into . But Mr. Whitman has knocked all that into a heap . He has shown that the resources of criminal investigation and the agencies of the law are adequate to cope with the vilest conspiracies and the most intricate crimes that the " system " can devise . The strong arm of the law has grappled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight to all the cor rupt and conniving members of the police force by the news that Becker had been found guilty . They must have looked at one another with startled eyes , as if asking , " Who next ? " Viewed from any angle , the verdict of this jury is the most terrible blow that the wicked ane , flaunting alliance between the guardians of the law and the violators of it has ever received . For achieving this , District Attorney Whitman deserves the thanks of New York city , and so do he and his assistant , Mr. Moss , for the very great labor of preparing the evidence against Becker and presenting it in such a way as to obtain a conviction . And we think that Mr. Whitman had the true instinct for the demands of the situation when he arraigned Becker first of all . The wretched tools who actually did the shooting of Rosenthal might well be passed over for the time , in order to bring their principal to the bar . It was necessary to strike high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow which Mr. Whitman has dealt we can see how sagacious he was in choosing where first to aim it . Some other order of prosecution might have seemed logically better , or even more sure legally , but the moral impression caused by success in going straight at the most heinous offender , proves that no mistake was made by the District Attorney . Becker 's counsel will appeal . There will necessarily be a review of the trial by a higher court . The blackest criminal is entitled to all his legal rights , and Becker must have his . If able and conscientious judges hold that errors were committed in the course of the trial sufficient to vitiate the verdict of the jury , it will be their duty so to decide , and it will be the duty of the public to respect their decision . But it is much to be hoped that nothing of the kind will be necessary . The reviewing judges will doubtless be impressed , as everybody else must be , by the fact that a carefully chosen and exceptionally intelligent jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These jurymen not only heard all the evidence , but had the opportunity of studying all the witnesses face to face . They must naturally have had their suspicions of Rose and Webber and the other refugees of the darkness who had to be called upon to testify , if any evi deuce at all was to be had ; yet they scrutinized these wretches as they told their story and observed them under cross-examination , and must have made up their , minds that the testimony was credible . At least , it was not broken down at any vital point . It is this broad consideration of the findings of the jury which must weigh most with the public , and will doubtless have due weight with judges . As the matter stands , there has . been a signal and heartening vindication of justice . All must hope that nothing in the future disposal of the case will lessen its deep impressiveness . SUPERVISING iIL4NKIND . Dr. Lewellys Barker 's letter on " Preventing Czolgoszes and Schranks , " printed in the New York Times , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminence of its writer . All that part of it which relates to the care and treatment of the insane , and much of what is said in it about the feeble-minded and similar classes , is not only highly important but wholly unexceptionable . But in some of its aspects , the proposed " national campaign for mental hygiene " raises questions which can not be properly approached without consideration of the most far-reaching consequences , questions which go to the very core of life . " Provision must be made , " we are told , " for the birth of children whose brains shall , so far as possible , be innately of good quality ; this means the denial of the privilege of parenthood to those likely to transmit bad nervous systems to their offspring . " It is quite possible that Dr. Barker does not fully mean what he here says , though no qualification of it appears in the context ; but , . however much allowance we may make for intended qualification , it is clear that the social policy he has in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degenerates or imbeciles . And this is all the more certain for the reason that such a programme has already attained considerable currency . Moreover , it is an indispensable programme if we set forth to achieve the object of " preventing Czolgoszes and Schranks . " We would by no means be understood to admit that it would be sufficient for the accomplishment of that object , but surely nothing less would suffice . The question , then , is , What does the execution of this eugenic programme involve ? What forces would be brought into play by it ? How would it affect not only the lives of those directly or indii.ectly concerned , but the very feelings and ideals of life , of all mankind ? By whatever instrumentalities it may be proposed to carry any such scheme into effect , one thing is essentially involved in it  --  the making of a vital distinction between individuals upon the basis of a scientific , or quasi-scientific , estimate of their physical endowments . How serious the danger of error in the diagnosis , how grave the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the dread or the blighting uncertainty which would oppress those whose peculiarities made them more or less suspect  --  into these things we do not intend to enter . For in this proposal to mark out as derelicts such men and women as fail to come up to a desired standard of fitness , there is something which cuts still deeper into the texture of life and society . The criminal , the insane , the imbecile , clearly marked out to be set apart from the mass of normal human beings , we habitually ignore in the daily course of life ; this is hard , cruel perhaps , but it leaves all the rest of mankind on the solid ground of equality in the things that are vital  --  not only equality in rights , but equality in self-respect , in the fundamentals of human dignity . In the relation of parent and child , of brother and sister , of friend and friend , all men , rich and poor , strong and weak , gifted and dull , stand on an equal footing Each feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it be , he has earned the right to self-respect , and to the unpatronizing and unforced regard of those with whom he has to do . He asks for no other man 's certificate that he is himself a man ; he walks erect among his fellows . He may be deficient in mental power ; he may have a less perfect nervous system than is to be desired ; but he neither abdicates the rights , nor asks to be absolved from the responsibility , which he understands to attach to all the children of men . Take away this feeling , and can you presume to measure the awful gap that will be left ? Can you estimate the value , the potency , of the simple and unquestioned doctrine that a man 's a man ? It is the safeguard of human dignity , it strengthens the weak to bear themselves worthily , it incites the strong to feel true consideration for the v.eak , it runs through the whole warp and woof of the web of life . Before we disturb it , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without it will more truly serve mankind . There are other grave aspects of the " campaign for mental hygiene " on which it might be profitable to dwell . But it may be more to the purpose to make a remark that bears equally upon many other current proposals of radical innovation . The argument for these proposals almost always rests upon a postulate tacitly taken for granted by their advocates . This postulate is that , in the particular matter that interests them , perfection should be attempted at any cost ; and when we say " attempted , " we do not mean striven for as an ideal , or as an ultimate goal , but directly sought by whatever means may be at hand . None of us want Schranks or Czolgoszes ; but before we determine to prevent their birth , or even to prevent their growing up without special supervision , we instinctively ask whether it is worth while to make that sacrifice of the general freedom , and simplicity , and unconsciousness of the daily lives of men which such prevention would necessitate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very poor ; but before we condemn the existing structure of society to demolition in order to abolish poverty , we wish to have some assurance that the things that make for the building up of character , and for the zest of life in almost all classes , will not be sacrificed in the process . Human society is far from perfect . But such advance as we have made from conditions infinitely worse than those that now exist has been bound up with the growth of certain fundamental ideas and institutions ; and to pursue perfection in one particular respect without regard to the injury that those ideas and institutions may suffer is to run the risk of burning down your house for the sake of smoking out the rats EFFICIENCY TESTS FOR CLERGY-MEN . As the modern efficiency expert pursues his devastating way , the troubled question is more and more frequently heard : " Who of us is safe ? " The old immunity of the college professor is soon to vanish . He has been asked to punch a time-clock as he teaches , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he is or is not an unprofitable servant . And now it would appear that clergymen will have to submit to like tests . If we may judge by the address to the Presbyterian ministers by the Moderator of the General Assembly , the time is drawing near when efficiency machinery will be set up in every pulpit . As reported in the press , Dr. Matthews was especially severe upon the clergy for their shocking waste of time and energy . They seem to make as many unnecessary motions as the old-style bricklayer . The speaker was very emphatic in his warnings that all this must cease if the church is not to fall behind the times . The pastor must be a driving man of business . He must have full authority to appoint his chuich-officers , and to engage and dismiss his assistants . They must be ready , with him , to work sixteen hours a day year in and year out , and to be able to account for every moment of their time ; if they did n't in Dr. Matthews 's church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without holding him literally to every word put in his mouth by the reporters , it seems pretty clear that he is a great believer in what is called " the institutional church , " and would have all of its manifold activities managed in the spirit of the most scientific industry . There must be no dawdling . Nobody in the church must look for leisure to invite his soul . All must go at high tension . The Apostle 's injunction about " redeeming the time " is to be taken in the severest terms of the current doctrine of efficiency . For example , an assistant pastor should be expected , at the end of a day 's work in the parish , to submit a precise and detailed record of all that he had done or attempted . He should turn in a time-card , filled out something like this : 9 30 to 10.27 , visited the widow and the fatherless in their affliction. 10 27 to 11 03 , bound up three broken-hearted 11 03 to 12 15 , at the hospital Spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Offered three prayers . Recited four hymns . 12 15 to 12 32 , lunch . 12 22 to 3 10 , made a round of the classes in sewing , cooking , athletics , and inspected two companies of boy scouts . 3.10 to 5:20 , kept office hours , seeing five book-agents , three applicants for charity , two clerical impostors , a delegation from the Daughters of the Revolution , and six persons with suggestions about enriching the church services and improving the sermons . Summing up the whole day : I humbly reckon my efficiency percentage at 97 3 . We would not be thought to decry , least of all , to burlesque , the multifarious activities of a large church in a city . They are undoubtedly of great usefulness , and it is needful to conduct them in a business way . Whatever the impulse behind them , or their ultimate aim , the actual details have to be attended to by careful administrators . This is the reason why it is sometimes said that the pastor of a great institutional church must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big factory , a tactful manager of all sorts and conditions of men , a skilled financier , a profound student , a good writer , and an acceptable speaker . The combination is , of course , impossible ; and that is the explanation of the division of labor in so many large parishes of the present day . A man can not spend six-sevenths of his time serving tables and then on Sunday be a flaming prophet of the soul . Efficiency tests where they may rightly be applied , say we , but beware of attempting to measure the subtle things of personal and spiritual influence by reducing all to percentages . There is something here too deep for the mechanical probe to reach . The truly great teacher is not so known because somebody has timed his lectures , or applied the yardstick to him , but because the hearts of the young are stirred within them as they listen to him , and from him they get guiding motives for their whole lives . And still more absurd would it be to attempt to classify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impudent enough to think to express in figures the spiritual value of the goodness and benignity inch beam from a man who has been minister of one village church for thirty years , and whose face itself has become a benediction ? What way is there of making an arithmetical estimate of the services of Father Damien , or of any clergyman who goes fearlessly where infection or plague is raging ? Can any statistics express the worth of a truly prophetic message from the pulpit ? As well imagine that the most moving passages in the Bible can be explained by showing that they are an artful arrangement of vowels and consonants . Great is efficiency , but there are some things off which it must keep its hands ; and the spirit that bloweth where it listeth is one of them . NEW REPUTATIONS FOR OLD . When Hamlet asserted that there was ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark but he was an arrant knave , he reckoned without the alchemy of modern historical criticism . The problem today would be to find a villain in Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aright , was not seen to be in reality a much abused man . There is Aaron Burr , for example . How old-fashioned it seems now to talk as if the slayer of Hamilton had been aught but a model citizen and statesman ! To go still further back , the time-honored notion of Cleon as a demagogue received a body-blow when some one suggested that the witnesses against him were prejudiced . Aristophanes owed him a grudge because Cleon had pointed out the unpatriotic character of one of his plays , a play , moreover , that had been witnessed by foreigners ; and Thucydides thirsted for revenge for the exile into which Cleon had once thrown him . We have even heard of a teacher who aroused sympathy for Henry VIII by tender allusions to the series of domestic sorrows that befell him . Unfortunately for the rehabilitator of evil reputations , the supply of famous sinners is not unlimited , and , accordingly , the industry has apparently been threatened with extinction . In the very nick of time , however , a new field has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be whitewashed , and no good word said for Lothario ? Is not one as real to us as the other ? So it seems to Otis Skinner at least , who is just getting his breath after the exertion of lifting Shylock upon a pedestal . That this immortal figure has long been invested with a dignity and pathos that no one in Shakespeare 's audiences would have granted him , is well enough as far as it goes , but it is still short of the truth . The long-concealed fact is that Shylock was the only gentleman in Venice . He merely " made an honest contract " with Antonio , who was a liar and a profligate , and then tried to prevent him " from crawling out of it . " The stipulated pound of flesh was " a thingof no value to Shylock " ? as , indeed , the only gentleman in Venice was the first to point out  --  whatever may have been its importance to Antonio . Shylock , in a word , was simply the original representative of " big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of fame from that which has clung to him . What if Tennyson did say , in an unguarded moment , something about one 's being all fault who has no fault at all ? He had not heard of the true Shylock , beside whom Cordelia and Desdemona appear frail specimens of humanity . Thus the way is now open for a general revision of the repttations of literary personages . The Advocatus Diaboli is no longer to read his indictment unopposed . The virtues of the blackest are to be called upon to plead like angels , trumpet-tongued , against the deep damnation of their exclusion from the isles of the blessed . We would not anticipate the exact results of this refurbishing . Whether Iago will emerge wearing the white flower of a blameless life , or only as a nobler Horatio , it would be rash to predict . That Othello grievously , perhaps designedly , mistook him , we regard as already settled . Indeed , may there not be an unexplored and rich field for the distracted seeker of new literary worlds to exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the types of villain which they put into their pages ? Can we accept Chaucer 's account of the Pardoner at its face value , when we have no means of knowing what the Pardoner might have said against Chaucer ? Dante 's lit. tle way of consigning his personal enemies to a very real Perdition should put us upon our guard . It is not impossible that we shall sooner or later discover that there has never been such a thing as a villain at all . From so dire a calamity we may well call upon all the saints to defend us . How many of the most interesting pages of history and fiction would be left , if all those that are besmirched with the doings of the world 's rascals , from Paris and Xerxes down to Falstaff and Becky Sharp , were torn out ? Here , as luck will have it , a law of nature comes to our aid . For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction ; not otherwise is the action possible . Mr. Skinner can elevate Shylock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give up our old villains , those to whom we are accustomed , but in return we are furnished with a new set . We are far from saying that there is no loss in the exchange . The rascals we get may be as fascinating as the rascals we lose , but this takes no account of sentimental values . It is asking a good deal of one to part with a scoundrel whom long association has endeared to him , and accept in. his place a wretch whom a mere expert has decided to be the better scoundrel of the two . Suppose that one has taken a fancy to one of the Borgias . Does it not savor of cruelty to destroy one 's faith in the malign possibilities of one 's chosen villain , and is it , not rather impertinent to bid one be content with , say , Jack Cade ? It may yet become necessary to organize a society for the preservation of evil reputations .
