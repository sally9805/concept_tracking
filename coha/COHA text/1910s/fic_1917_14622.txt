SCENE : The apartment of HARRY RICHARDSON and CLAY COLLUM , New York City . A large living-room and dining-room of a type found in the small apartment of the most modern style . To the left , in back , is a door , showing a square vestibule with a hallway leading off left , presumably to the front door . To the right and also in back , there is a swinging door opening into the butler 's pantry ; a door at the back of the pantry is supposed to open into the kitchen . The two upper corners of the room are cut off in angles ; the one at the right being occupied by a studio window that looks out over the street and roof tops . There is a dainty awning outside . A doorway into the boys ' bedroom is on the left side near the footlights . ' A baby-grand piano at the right beside the wall has its keyboard toward the window . There is a piano-bench back of this . A lamp with a shade of fancy ostrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the window . A cellarette is near the bedroom door . Beyond this there is a sofa . There are comfortable armchairs about the room . On these are various samples of brocades and old " stuffs . " The entire room is furnished with exquisite taste , although the prevailing note is masculine comfort . Over everything broods the atmosphere of a stifling afternoon in late July . CLAY COLLUM is discovered at the telephone . He is an interior decorator about thirty ; a nice , clean-cut young fellow . CLAY COLLUM At phone . Ah , good afternoon , Mrs. Livingston . Yes . Frankly I do n't think the cerise you suggested would do at all . No  --  not with the curtains I have selected . Why not almond green ? That 's the new color . I 'm expecting a new consignment on the Rochambeau . I 'll come up myself  --  yes  --  thank you . Good afternoon . He hangs up the receiver and busies himself fixing the draperies on the chairs . HARRY RICHARDSON enters . He is a trifle older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen sense of humor , not averse to directing things and succeeding by sheer force of his excessive vitality. p. 3 HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , you 're at home , are you ? CLAY COLLUM No  --  I 'm fighting the waves at Northampton . HARRY RICHARDSON Please do n't remind me of Long Island and the ocean after the day I 've had . Takes off coat . CLAY COLLUM Why  --  was the Stock Exchange bad today ? HARRY RICHARDSON Bad ? The worst case of fits and starts on record . Every stock and bond had St. Vitus ' dance . I 'm through . I 'm going to give the market absent treatment until the middle of August . CLAY COLLUM Were you caught in the shower ? HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  I came up in the car . It did n't amount to much . Sits in chair on which is some drapery . CLAY COLLUM Do n't sit there . HARRY RICHARDSON What 's the matter with you ? Why not ? CLAY COLLUM That 's going to be Mrs. Van Zile 's new boudoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARDSON Pointing to another chair . Well , whose room is this now ? CLAY COLLUM That 's going to be Rex 's bedroom . p. 4 HARRY RICHARDSON Rex 's bedroom . Well , I can sit down there with perfect propriety . Sits . That 's what I get for sharing an apartment with one of our classiest interior decorators . Last year we were a symphony in brown . This spring I had to move out while you changed it to a harmony in blue . What 's it going to be next winter  --  a panorama in pink ? CLAY COLLUM If you 'll pardon the suggestion  --  you need a cold shower . HARRY RICHARDSON I 'm going to take it , too . I do n't suppose you want a gin fizz ? CLAY COLLUM Indicating almost empty gin bottle . I did , but I 've got over it . HARRY RICHARDSON Holds up bottle . Got over it ? Well , I should think you had . What did you do ? Take a bath in it ? Phone rings . CLAY COLLUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing in town ? Oh ! That 's it ? She 's coming here to see me ? Astonished . About a benefit ? But  --  oh  --  all right . You come on over and stay to dinner , too . Yes , we 're going to have dinner here to-night . HARRY RICHARDSON Ah  --  ho ! A lady coming to see you ! p. 5 CLAY COLLUM Not pleased . Myrtle Davis . HARRY RICHARDSON That 's bad . CLAY COLLUM And her mother . HARRY RICHARDSON Too bad . Indicating phone . Who was it warned you ? CLAY COLLUM Rex Van Zile . HARRY RICHARDSON Rex ? Did he come to town with Myrtle ? CLAY COLLUM No ; he wants to meet her here  --  accidentally . HARRY RICHARDSON Say , he must have it bad to leave the beach and follow her to town this sort of weather . CLAY COLLUM You forgot Rex finds Myrtle a cool proposition . HARRY RICHARDSON I certainly wonder what Rex sees in Myrtle . CLAY COLLUM With the grouch you 've got you 'd wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARDSON No , I should n't . A nice cool marble lady would appeal to me strongly just now . CLAY COLLUM Better hustle and take that shower . They 'll be around soon . I 'll send out for some gin . HARRY RICHARDSON Why do n't you get it yourself ? You need the exercise . You have n't stretched a muscle in a month . A faint roll of thunder is heard off. p. 6 CLAY COLLUM Oh , all right . What 's that  --  thunder ? HARRY RICHARDSON It looks as though it might rain again . Better take a parasol . CLAY COLLUM Oh , shut up ! HARRY RICHARDSON Bring in a paper  --  last edition . The score was 8 to 8 in the eleventh inning . CLAY COLLUM Casually . Are they playing baseball at the Polo Grounds to-day ? HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  checkers . HARRY exits into bedroom . CLAY puts on hat and goes out in back . Pause . Empty stage . POLLY SHANNON enters quietly from pantry . POLLY is a very pretty girl in her early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuated by her simple maid 's dress of some thin black material . There is a compelling charm about her that awakens interest . The easy deftness of her movements , and a certain steady purposeful look in her face , makes you feel that she can cope with far greater responsibilities than the charge of the Collum-Richardson apartment . She has a great fund of humor that is covered at present by a polite gravity . In her earlier scenes she is deferential without being humble . She somehow conveys the sense that she emphasizes the conventional deportment of the maid more as a protective barrier for herself , than through any feeling of the inferiority of her position . POLLY , who has a watering-can , goes to flowers in window and waters them , takes pot back into pantry , gets tray , puts chair beside table which she places near piano , takes magazines off and puts same on small stand near window . Then she notices a sheet of music and , after looking about and seeing no one , sits and plays , singing sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bunch of flowers in his hand . He comes down looking at her as she sings without seeing him . REX is a grown-up boy , ingenuous , simple , totally incapable of dissimulation . He does n't know it , but his clumsy helplessness is of the sort that appeals to the mother instinct of women very strongly , and he seems quite unconscious also of his good-looking manliness . He gives the effect of possessing social background , and he also shows in his dress and manner that he is accustomed to having money . At present he is dispirited and listless , with flashes of nervous anxiety showing through . He is obsessed with a fixed idea and shows but little interest in anything that does n't remind him in some way of the girl he loves . He is about twenty-seven years old. p. 7 POLLY SHANNON Turning half indignantly and seeing it is a stranger . Who are you ? Are n't you in the wrong apartment ? REX VAN ZILE Nervously . No  --  I  --  I do n't think so ? POLLY SHANNON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Mr. Richardson is staying here , too . I 'm a friend of theirs . Rex Van Zile is my name . POLLY SHANNON Relieved . Oh , yes , sir . The gentleman they go to visit on Sundays . REX VAN ZILE I met Mr. Collum going out and he gave me his key . POLLY SHANNON Oh ! Slight pause . Shall I take your flowers , sir ? REX VAN ZILE Surprised at his having them . Flowers ? Oh , yes . My mother thought the fellows would like them . POLLY SHANNON Thank you . I 'm sure the gentlemen will be very pleased , sir . REX VAN ZILE I 'm afraid they 're a bit wilted . I 've been carrying them around in the car all day . POLLY SHANNON Dahlias . Crossing to put them in vase and speaking half to herself . I have n't seen them since I left home . p. 8 REX VAN ZILE Our place is smothered in them . POLLY SHANNON It must be lovely in the country now . Putting flowers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind , sir , I 'll go on with my work . REX VAN ZILE Not at all . POLLY SHANNON They 're going to have dinner at home tonight . Pulls table into place to lay it . REX VAN ZILE Watch in hand , sitting in chair below piano . I suppose you do n't know if a lady phoned here before I came ? POLLY SHANNON Bringing in tray . A lady ? REX VAN ZILE Miss Davis is her name . She said she 'd be here at five and it 's almost half-past . POLLY SHANNON Perhaps that shower we had delayed her , sir . REX VAN ZILE Yes  --  that 's why I 'm so anxious . She may have been out in it . POLLY SHANNON I should n't worry . Gets plates off tray on chair . REX VAN ZILE But I 'm all on edge . POLLY SHANNON Yes  --  I know the way you feel . Behind table , fixing napkins. p. 9 REX VAN ZILE Do you ? I suppose it seems funny my talking this way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant 's a terrible lonely job . Sometimes I feel I must talk to someone  --  anyone  --  or I 'll go mad . REX VAN ZILE That 's the way I feel now . POLLY SHANNON If it 's any relief to talk , please do . REX VAN ZILE Thanks . POLLY SHANNON Casually . I could see you were in trouble when you came in . REX VAN ZILE Terrible trouble . I 'm in love . Sort of offhand . But I suppose you could see that , too . POLLY SHANNON Casually . Yes , sir . REX VAN ZILE Turning to her in surprise . You could ? POLLY SHANNON That 's the thing women notice first about any man . REX VAN ZILE Shaking his head . Guess I do n't know much about women . POLLY SHANNON Have n't you any sisters ? REX VAN ZILE Sadly . No. p. 10 POLLY SHANNON Fixing rolls in napkins . That 's a pit  --  but I suppose it 's too late to worry about that now . REX VAN ZILE Yes ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt and pepper off tray . Tell me , have you ever been in love ? Taking it seriously . POLLY SHANNON Not yet , sir . REX VAN ZILE Gosh ! You 're lucky . Really noticing her for the first time . Do you know , you do n't seem like a servant . POLLY SHANNON Enigmatically . Do n't I ? REX VAN ZILE Not a bit . What 's your name . POLLY SHANNON Polly , sir . REX VAN ZILE Polly . You 're quite sure I have n't bored you talking about my troubles , Polly ? POLLY SHANNON Not a bit , sir . But then you have n't mentioned any troubles . REX VAN ZILE Have n't I ? You see , I 'm always afraid I 'll be laughed at . POLLY SHANNON I would n't laugh . REX VAN ZILE A chap in love with a girl who does n't love him may be funny , but he does n't feel funny . p. 11 POLLY SHANNON Oh , that 's how it is . Getting bowl from sill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZILE I 'm not good enough for her  --  that 's the trouble . She 's interested in New Thought and New Art and the New Philanthropy  --  new all sorts of things . And when it comes to saving drunkards and dope fiends , she 'd make the Salvation Army look like a piker . POLLY SHANNON Pardon me , but do you drink ? REX VAN ZILE Startled by this unexpected question . No . Two drinks make me so ill I have to go to bed for a week . POLLY SHANNON That 's a pity . REX VAN ZILE Surprised . Eh ? POLLY SHANNON I was just thinking if you were a hard drinker a girl like that might enjoy saving you . REX VAN ZILE Saving me ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir ; lots of girls marry men to reform them . HARRY enters ; he is completely changed ; his hair is slicked , testifying to his shower , he wears cool flannels and looks thoroughly comfortable and cheerful . POLLY exits into pantry. p. 12 HARRY RICHARDSON Hello , Rex ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute or two ago . HARRY RICHARDSON Confidentially , half-joshing him . What time do you expect this sweet little ball-and-chain of yours ? REX VAN ZILE I suppose that 's awfully funny . Not laughing . Ha-ha ! HARRY RICHARDSON Got a grouch , have you ? It 's the weather . What you need is a cool shower . Goes to piano . REX VAN ZILE Thanks , but I was almost caught in one . I hope Myrtle was n't out in it . Looks at watch . I ca n't imagine what 's happened to her . HARRY RICHARDSON Maybe a raindrop fell on her and she melted . You 'd like her to melt a little , would n't you ? Doorbell rings . REX VAN ZILE Agitated . Sh ! There she is now . Busies fixing himself . POLLY goes to door from pantry door opening on vestibule . HARRY RICHARDSON What 's the idea of the flower in the buttonhole ? Think Myrtle will imagine you 're getting artistic ? POLLY enters from hall and admits CLAY , who gives her his umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE Is it ? HARRY RICHARDSON Mr. Collum , the interior decorator , with the interior decorations . CLAY COLLUM Holding up bottles . Gin , brandy , Scotch . HARRY RICHARDSON Now we 'll have a party . Polly , will you bring in some cracked ice and some sliced oranges ? POLLY exits with CLAY 'S umbrella . REX VAN ZILE To CLAY . Here 's your keys . HARRY RICHARDSON Did you bring the paper ? Who won the game ? CLAY COLLUM Did n't look . Hands him paper . HARRY RICHARDSON Did n't look ? With three teams tied for first place ! Looks eagerly at paper . Holy mackerel ! Noon edition ! Crumples paper savagely . CLAY COLLUM Takes it . Here ! Do n't tear that paper . I was just reading about Petrowski 's suicide . REX VAN ZILE Is Petrowski that great Polish pianist ? CLAY COLLUM Yes . REX VAN ZILE Proudly . Myrtle knew him . p. 14 HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , did she ? CLAY COLLUM Referring to newspaper . Petrowski 's been missing a month now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned himself on account of some mysterious woman who turned him down . HARRY RICHARDSON Lighting his pipe . Killed himself for the love of a woman , eh ? Do n't talk about that in front of Rex . We 'll have the police dragging the river for him next . POLLY enters with tray of bottles which HARRY takes and puts on small table . We do n't want to have to buy Mr. Van Zile flowers , do we , Polly ? POLLY SHANNON Mr. Van Zile is very thoughtful , sir  --  he brought some with him . POLLY indicates vase and flowers which she placed on the piano . All look towards it and REX smiles . HARRY RICHARDSON Dear little dahlias ! How sweet ! Doorbell rings . REX VAN ZILE Explosively . Myrtle ! CLAY COLLUM Wait  --  a little appropriate music . Dashing over to piano , throwing paper on chair , starts to play wedding march . POLLY goes to door. p. 15 REX VAN ZILE Cut it out , you idiot . POLLY returns with a letter . POLLY SHANNON Giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Collum . REX sinks into armchair below piano , with a deep sigh of disappointment . HARRY RICHARDSON Cheer up , funeral face . Going to mix cocktails in shaker , as POLLY starts to put tray back in hall . Oh , Polly ! Will you set a place for Mr. Van Zile ; he 's going to stay to dinner . POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir . Goes out in the hall , puts salver down and crosses back of screen and pours out two glasses of water . CLAY COLLUM Staring at letter . From France ! I know what that means : another two-hour translation job . POLLY SHANNON The boy said if it 's anything important , would you please call up the business manager . CLAY COLLUM Oh , they want it right away ? Oh , Lord  --  I 'm sunk . I left my French dictionary at the office . Do you read French , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE No . Rising . Say , fellows , do you think Myrtle could have forgotten the address ? p. 16 HARRY RICHARDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks to CLAY . Why do they give you the French correspondence if you do n't know French ? CLAY COLLUM Old Goujod , who buys for us in Paris , is away on his vacation . Rising . Well , I suppose I 've got to go over to the office for that dictionary . POLLY SHANNON Comes from behind screen , crosses to table with water on tray . Perhaps I can translate it for you , Mr. Collum . CLAY COLLUM All astonished . You ? HARRY RICHARDSON What ? You speak French ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir  --  more or less . CLAY gives POLLY letter . HARRY RICHARDSON Has shaker in hand . Eighth little wonder of the world ! Darns , sews on buttons , splendid manager  --  and now she can speak French . POLLY SHANNON Looks over letter . Oh , sir  --  I  --  I rather think there 's some mistake . CLAY COLLUM Who 's it from ? p. 17 POLLY SHANNON It 's signed Lucille Bady . HARRY RICHARDSON Code signature ? CLAY shakes head , puzzled . POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; REX is in back , obviously thinking of MYRTLE . I 'll translate it freely . " Mon petit Chou "  --  my little cabbage  --  They look at one another . " I am longing to see you and it is a cruel distress that you are going to spend the vacation with your wife at Ocean Grove . Have you forgotten those three glorious days at Dieppe ? When I  --   --  " HARRY RICHARDSON Eagerly . Go on  --  what happened at Dieppe ? POLLY SHANNON " When I  --   --  " Hesitates . CLAY COLLUM Do n't leave us in this suspense . POLLY SHANNON Reading it innocently , with perfect accent . " Quand j'avait mordu tes gentilles petites oreilles ! " HARRY RICHARDSON Blankly looking at CLAY , who does n't understand either . Well ? POLLY SHANNON I do n't think I 'd better , sir . It 's evidently a private letter for Mr. Goujod. p. 18 HARRY RICHARDSON Very private . CLAY COLLUM Takes letter and puts it on lower edge of piano . Thank you very much , Polly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHANNON Crossing up to pantry door , turning . What time would you like dinner served , Mr. Richardson ? CLAY COLLUM Well , let me see  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Wait one moment . To POLLY . You do n't mind if I ask you a few questions ? POLLY SHANNON Defensively . Questions ? HARRY RICHARDSON With sincere kindly interest throughout . You ca n't blame us for being a little curious : the way you look  --  the way you talk . And now you can speak French . REX VAN ZILE Coming down . And play the piano . CLAY COLLUM Play the piano ? REX VAN ZILE And sing . CLAY COLLUM And sing ? HARRY RICHARDSON And sing ? POLLY SHANNON A bit confused . I thought you would n't mind , sir . p. 19 HARRY RICHARDSON Of course , we do n't mind . But tell us , Polly , who are you ? CLAY COLLUM Yes  --  who are you ? POLLY SHANNON I hope I 'm giving you satisfaction , sir . CLAY COLLUM You certainly are . But you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle on her dignity . Surely , sir , whatever story I have is my own . HARRY RICHARDSON Seeing her hesitate . Of course ; of course ; and we do n't want to intrude . But you 're so far above what you are doing . POLLY SHANNON In a simple genuine manner , as she sees they are questioning her in kindness . When you 're " broke " you find you 're not above a lot of things you thought you were . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , you 're broke ? POLLY SHANNON I was pretty close to starving when I came here , sir . CLAY COLLUM Seriously . You never did any house-work before , did you ? POLLY SHANNON Smiling . Am I as bad as all that ? I worked for my father ; cooked and waited on his guests . p. 20 HARRY RICHARDSON Guests ? Was he a hotel keeper ? POLLY SHANNON At times it seemed that way . He was a minister . CLAY COLLUM All surprised . A minister 's daughter ! POLLY SHANNON Father had a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little place . He had a big heart and was always saving people . REX VAN ZILE Eagerly . Just like Myrtle . CLAY and HARRY squelch him and he sits quickly . HARRY RICHARDSON He saved everything except money ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir . And mother was n't much help to him  --  that way . Mother was French . With a touch of sentiment . I always think of her as a sort of caged butterfly that does n't know enough about the sunshine and freedom to be happy . CLAY COLLUM It was from your mother you learned French ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir ; we used to talk French together all the time . In fact , when I was a child , I spoke English with an accent and I did n't lose it till after she died . CLAY COLLUM M-m  --   --  p. 21 HARRY RICHARDSON Sympathetically . Your father is dead , too ? POLLY SHANNON Simply . Yes , sir . HARRY RICHARDSON After a slight pause , he suddenly brings down chair , CLAY making a vain effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly . She hesitates and does so . Tell me  --  what made you leave East Gilead ? POLLY SHANNON With a twinkle . Have you ever been there ? HARRY RICHARDSON Never . REX VAN ZILE Why did n't you marry ? HARRY again gives him a withering glance . POLLY SHANNON I see you 've never been in East Gilead , either . REX VAN ZILE Blankly . No . CLAY sits on edge of piano-bench . POLLY SHANNON And then I had an ambition . I suppose mother rather fostered it in me . I want to be a singer . CLAY COLLUM Rising . A singer ? Have you a voice ? POLLY SHANNON Humorously . I do n't think I 'm a Melba  --  yet . p. 22 HARRY RICHARDSON Consoling her . But you 're young . POLLY SHANNON Yes . And I 'm on my way to Paris now to have my voice trained . HARRY RICHARDSON Astonished . On your way to Paris ? CLAY COLLUM Paris ? POLLY SHANNON Smiling . You think I 've rather lost my sense of direction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first got here ; but that was no use . It was summer time . I could n't even get a companionship . And the woman at the employment bureau did n't seem able to suggest anything . I was very , very desperate . And then you two gentlemen walked in and Mr. Collum said , " I want a girl who can do light housekeeping . " CLAY COLLUM Recalling . " Three rooms and kitchenette  --  maid 's room on the top floor  --  cook breakfast  --  and dinner sometimes . " REX VAN ZILE Sentimentally at the picture suggested . Fine . POLLY SHANNON And so I thought  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON With great admiration . What pluck  --  eh , Clay ? p. 23 CLAY COLLUM You bet ! POLLY SHANNON Simply . Why ? I had to do something . And I realized it was only till I could get a better position . Rising . CLAY COLLUM Yes  --  of course  --  of course . HARRY RICHARDSON Polly , there 's something coming to you and I 'm going to try and see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should always pick the thoroughly worthless and give them assistance . REX VAN ZILE Rising . That 's just what I say to Myrtle . CLAY squelches REX ; he sits down again . HARRY RICHARDSON Thank Heaven , here 's a chance to give a hand to someone who deserves it . POLLY SHANNON I  --  I could n't accept any help , sir . CLAY COLLUM Do n't talk nonsense . HARRY RICHARDSON Mr. Collum will take you to a singing teacher to-morrow morning . Then if you make good we 'll get up a fund for you . CLAY COLLUM You can put me down for five . p. 24 HARRY RICHARDSON Disappointed . Five ? Five what ? CLAY COLLUM Five hundred . REX VAN ZILE Rising . I 'll come in , too . HARRY RICHARDSON Good . Now smiles approvingly at REX . POLLY SHANNON You  --  you 're very kind  --  all of you , but I ca n't accept any help . REX VAN ZILE Why not ? POLLY SHANNON Have you ever been a minister 's daughter ? REX VAN ZILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sinks down . POLLY SHANNON Ever since I can remember I 've known what it is to live on charity . When father died I made up my mind I 'd have one rule in my life  --  I would n't take anything I did n't earn . Making an emphatic point . HARRY RICHARDSON But you can pay us back . POLLY SHANNON Do n't think I 'm ungrateful . It 's splendid of you . Whatever I do  --  wherever I go to  --  I 'll always look back at the days I 've spent here among the very happiest times in my life . Only  --  only when it comes to money , that 's the way I feel . With a quiet determination . I 've got to earn all I get . p. 25 HARRY RICHARDSON You 're a damn fine sport , Polly . CLAY COLLUM Sh-h ! Minister 's daughter ! Makes a gesture as though praying . POLLY SHANNON Smiling . Please do n't hold it against me . HARRY RICHARDSON Polly , you 're made of the stuff that succeeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed . With sense of determination . I mean to and I think I shall . HARRY RICHARDSON We must have a good talk about this career of yours to-morrow , Polly . CLAY COLLUM We ? What do you know about music ? Waving him aside . I 'm the only one for you to consult . HARRY RICHARDSON Ah , is that so ? POLLY SHANNON Smiling . You 're both very good . But just at present my job is cooking your dinner , and I 'm afraid I sha n't be a success at that if I leave it any longer . Turning . What time shall I serve dinner ? CLAY COLLUM What do you think , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , I 'd forgotten that this is the cook 's night out . Deferentially to POLLY . You must n't trouble to get dinner for us. p. 26 CLAY COLLUM Same . No , do n't bother . POLLY SHANNON Why ? I 've gotten everything ready . I 've done the best I could . HARRY RICHARDSON We can go out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLLY SHANNON It 's all right , sir . HARRY RICHARDSON Deferentially . Well then , six-thirty . CLAY COLLUM Yes , six-thirty . HARRY RICHARDSON Same . If it 's all the same to you ? CLAY COLLUM Same . If you 're sure it wo n't inconvenience you ? POLLY endeavors to replace chair by table to its place against back wall . HARRY and CLAY graciously assist her with the chair ; they bow to her in their most courteous manner . POLLY SHANNON Going up as they follow . Six-thirty  --  yes , sir . Exits to kitchen , closing pantry door . CLAY and HARRY come down looking at each other . HARRY RICHARDSON Some girl ! p. 27 CLAY COLLUM I should say so . HARRY RICHARDSON Much as I hate to lose her she ca n't go on staying here . CLAY COLLUM No , I suppose not . It 's up to us to find her a job . REX VAN ZILE I 'll speak to mother ; maybe she 'll know of something . HARRY has gone to piano and begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the matter with you ? HARRY RICHARDSON I used to be able to play the damn thing when I was a kid . I might be able to pick it up again . Door bell rings . REX VAN ZILE Eagerly . Oh , this must be Myrtle at last ! As POLLY comes to pantry door to open other door , HARRY and CLAY go quickly to her , same business as before . HARRY RICHARDSON On one side of pantry door . We 'll attend to the door , Polly . CLAY COLLUM Other side of pantry door . Yes ; do n't bother . POLLY SHANNON Puzzled . But  --  ? p. 28 HARRY RICHARDSON It 's no trouble at all . CLAY COLLUM No . Bewildered , POLLY goes back as they close pantry door . HARRY opens hall door , MRS . DAVIS and MYRTLE enter . MYRTLE 'S good looks are sufficiently striking to explain , in some manner , Rex 's infatuation . Apparently she believes in her own sincerity , but it seems evident that an over-whelming egotism is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard so much . MRS . DAVIS , her mother , is a " fluffy " kittenish type of woman , completely under the domination of the more strong-minded daughter . They are both well-dressed . MYRTLE is twenty-three or - four and MRS . DAVIS under forty-five and looking rather younger . HARRY RICHARDSON Enter ! We thought you lost your way . CLAY COLLUM Good afternoon , Mrs. Davis  --  Miss Davis . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Hello , Rexey . I 'm sorry we were detained . Myrtle 's been doing some missionary work again . HARRY has put on his coat . MYRTLE DAVIS How do you do , Mr. Collum . I 've got a man here with me whom I 've just rescued from the gutter . p. 29 REX VAN ZILE O Lord . MYRTLE DAVIS Ah , are you here , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE Weakly . Just happened in . I got caught in the shower . MYRTLE DAVIS I 'm very much interested in him . I 'm taking him down to-night to Northampton . He 's a reformed drunkard . REX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Very interesting , that ! Attempting to conceal cellarette and the drinks with his body and the spread of his coat . MYRTLE DAVIS I thought perhaps he could wait in the kitchenette . HARRY RICHARDSON Looking at CLAY as he stands in front of door where POLLY is . I 'm  --  oh  --  I 'm afraid that 's not possible . MYRTLE DAVIS Not possible ? REX stands up at hall door , gazing at MYRTLE . HARRY RICHARDSON No . But we do n't mind having him here with us . CLEMENTINE DAVIS What do you mean ? CLAY COLLUM We think we 're more suitable companions for a reformed drunkard than  --  er  --  our  --   --  p. 30 HARRY RICHARDSON Than our  --   --  CLEMENTINE DAVIS Than your cook ? MYRTLE goes up stage to call STILES . HARRY RICHARDSON Absently . We 're not thinking of a cook . Instantly he apologizes . It 's the maid we 're thinking of . MYRTLE DAVIS In hall , calling down stairs . Stiles , you 'll have to wait on the stairs . HARRY RICHARDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right for him . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Oh , is this the new room , Mr. Collum ? Rising and walking about . CLAY COLLUM Yes HARRY RICHARDSON Yes  --  latest edition . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Oh  --  it 's lovely  --  lovely . I 'm going to order a screen like that . CLAY COLLUM Oh , thank you . HARRY RICHARDSON You 'll stay and have a bite with us ? CLAY COLLUM We 're very informal , you know . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , very informal . If one of his clients came we should all have to hide in the kitchenette . But never mind . p. 31 CLEMENTINE DAVIS How interesting ! So Bohemian . I should love to stay and  --   --  REX VAN ZILE Eagerly , to MYRTLE . Oh , yes , do . I 'm staying , too . HARRY RICHARDSON Yes , come on ; we 'll have a party . MYRTLE DAVIS Coming down . I 'm sorry , but we must catch the 6.30 . I 've got to send off a lot of circulars for the Life Savers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEMENTINE DAVIS Wonderful men  --  so brave and with such splendid physiques . When anyone is drowning , they never stop to think what may happen to themselves , but rush boldly into the water  --   --  REX VAN ZILE Interrupting savagely . With a rope tied around them and three men on the other end . MYRTLE DAVIS Gently reproving . Even if you have no interest in my work , Rex , you need n't make slighting remarks about the people I 'm trying to help . REX VAN ZILE Turning to MYRTLE . But why give them all your time , Myrtle ? MYRTLE DAVIS In her best platform manner . I give them all my time because I love to . Nothing compares with the thrill you get knowing you have saved some poor human derelict . p. 32 HARRY RICHARDSON Aside , to CLAY . She 's off . MYRTLE DAVIS If you could all realize the joy it is to watch , day by day , as the lost one grows stronger , better , nobler under your guiding hand . What 's that lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absently . " All is not gold that glitters . " Realizing mistake and correcting himself . " For I remember stopping by the way To watch a potter thumping his wet clay ! " MYRTLE DAVIS That is how I feel . I am a worker in the clay of humanity . CLEMENTINE DAVIS She gets that reforming instinct from me . You ought to have seen what her father was before I married him . I hardly thought he 'd live a year  --  but he surprised us all . HARRY RICHARDSON And now you 're helping the Life Savers . CLAY COLLUM Yes  --  helping the  --   --  MYRTLE DAVIS Yes . It 's about the Benefit Performance for the Life Savers that I came to see you , Mr. Collum . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Mr. Van Zile has promised to double all we raise . HARRY RICHARDSON What ? At REX , who is gazing fondly at MYRTLE . Are we entertaining a Carnegie unawares ? p. 33 REX VAN ZILE No  --  no  --  not me ; my uncle Prentice . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Rex 's uncle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIS . Yes  --  and so is Rex . MRS . DAVIS smiles knowingly . MYRTLE DAVIS Rex has told me you and Mr. Richardson are going to spend your vacation with him at Northampton . You will be sweet and play for us at the Benefit , wo n't you ? CLAY COLLUM Hesitating . Why , surely . MYRTLE DAVIS Quickly . Thank you , Mr. Collum . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Is n't Myrtle persuasive ? HARRY RICHARDSON It 's really wonderful how she wins people . CLAY COLLUM Let me see : a Life Savers ' Benefit ! What do you want me to play ? MYRTLE DAVIS Something sweet and appropriate . REX VAN ZILE Why do n't you play , " Throw Out the Life Line ! " MYRTLE DAVIS Looks at him , he rises . I suppose that 's meant to be humorous . p. 34 REX VAN ZILE Gives a faint smile . I 'm awfully sorry if I 've vexed you , Myrtle . I 'll subscribe for twenty seats now . Please forgive me . MYRTLE DAVIS I 'll think about forgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty seats . Makes memorandum . HARRY RICHARDSON You 're too good to him , Miss Davis . MYRTLE DAVIS Softening . If you really want to be forgiven you will take Stiles . REX VAN ZILE . Take Stiles where  --  to the concert ? MYRTLE DAVIS No  --  no  --  no . I mean take him on as valet or butler or something . REX VAN ZILE Aghast , pointing to door . You mean this fellow you picked out of the gutter ? MYRTLE DAVIS Yes . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Myrtle promised to find him a position . REX VAN ZILE Vaguely . I 'll ask mother  --   --  MYRTLE DAVIS He could drive your car while he 's looking around for something better . HARRY RICHARDSON Hope he wo n't do much looking around while I 'm in the car . p. 35 REX VAN ZILE Oh , I did n't know he was a chauffeur . MYRTLE DAVIS He is n't ; but he 's very willing . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Yes ; he told us he did n't care what he does . MYRTLE DAVIS Going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him the good news , Rex . Going out . He 'll be pleased . REX VAN ZILE Rising . Here ! Wait one moment , Myrtle . I did n't say  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON What a wonderful girl your daughter is ! Always doing something splendid  --  noble . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Yes , she ought to make some good man very happy  --  eventually . HARRY RICHARDSON Yes  --  eventually . MYRTLE DAVIS Come in , Stiles . STILES enters , a drab , middle-aged , weak-eyed man , in no sense a caricature . This is not the first time he has been " saved . " He alternates between spells of religious exaltation and the more obvious charm of comfortable backsliding . This is Mr. Van Zile , your new employer . STILES Aggressively . Employer ? What does he want me to do ? p. 36 REX VAN ZILE Floundering . Mrs. Davis says you 're very willing . STILES You bet I am ; but it must n't be hard work . CLAY COLLUM Oh , no ; they would n't expect that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sit in the kitchen and let the maid wait on you . STILES That 'll be all right , sir . I 'm willing to try the job . REX VAN ZILE Thank you , Stiles . STILES You 're welcome . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Explaining . He says he 's been laid up for two weeks . CLAY COLLUM What laid you up ? HARRY RICHARDSON Drink ? STILES No , sir . I tripped on the curb and a blamed auter-mo-bile ran into me . By Jiminy , if ever I get behind one of them sterrin ' wheels , I 'll get a little of my own back . HARRY RICHARDSON Not chauffeur , Rex . REX VAN ZILE I might put him on as gardener . STILES Gardener ! Well , long as it do n't mean I 've got to dig , nor lift nothing , nor stand around watering flowers . p. 37 CLEMENTINE DAVIS Do you know anything about gardening , Stiles ? STILES Me ? I was born on a buckwheat farm back in Ohio . HARRY RICHARDSON Raised to be a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raised to go into politics . Mother hoped she 'd see me President of the United States some day ; but I 've disappointed her  --  so far . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Well , do n't give up hope , Stiles . CLAY rises , goes up and gets flowers out of window . STILES No , I wo n't Ma'am . MYRTLE DAVIS Rising and mustering her forces . We must go now . Stiles will report at your house to-morrow , Rex . He can sleep over your garage to-night . Thank you , Mr. Collum . Good-bye , Mr. Richardson . Try to think up something atmospheric . Rex , you can mail the cheque for the seats to our treasurer , Commodore Barker . Come , Mother . CLAY gives flowers to ladies . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Yes , dear . Good night , boys . Do n't forget to come and take me for a spin in your new car , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Surely I will ; and I was hoping that Myrtle  --   --  p. 38 MYRTLE DAVIS Perhaps some day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . STILES , who has stood aside to let them pass , casts a look of lingering regret at the brandy flask on the cellarette , and sneaks a drink before they come down . HARRY RICHARDSON Rentering . Hey  --  hey  --  do you want a drink ? Takes off coat . STILES No , sir . If you knew what that awful stuff does to you , you 'd give me that bottle and tell me to empty it in the street . HARRY RICHARDSON I 'll bet you 'd empty it before you got to the street . STILES Just let Miss Davis talk to you about drink . She 'll save you . Look what she 's done for me , and she can make just as much out of you . Exits . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , can she ! He 's a brandied peach , all right . CLAY closes hall door . Phew ! They turn , become serious as they see REX sitting with his head in his hands . It seems a shame a beautiful girl like Myrtle wasting her time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she beautiful ? p. 39 HARRY RICHARDSON She 's a humdinger , all right . CLAY plays piano : sentimental tune . REX VAN ZILE Gazing raptly before him . That 's just what she is : a humdinger . CLAY COLLUM They 'd make a pretty pair , would n't they , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON They certainly would . REX VAN ZILE Huh ! What chance have I got ? She cares more about that specimen preserved in alcohol than she does about me . HARRY RICHARDSON Because she 's saved him . CLAY COLLUM If only you were some sort of a human wreck . REX VAN ZILE That 's what your maid , Polly , said . HARRY RICHARDSON Bursting out . Do n't tell me you started right in babbling about your unrequited love to her ! CLAY COLLUM Gosh ! You 're getting to be a public nuisance . REX VAN ZILE Getting up . Well , if that 's the way you feel , I 'll go  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Rising and stopping him ; CLAY rises too , affectionately . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE I suppose I am a nuisance . I ca n't talk about anything but Myrtle because she 's the only thing I can think of . You need n't tell me I 'm making a fool of myself . I know it . I go down at night and hang around outside her home and watch the light in her window , afraid to go in . CLAY COLLUM Sounds as though you were a married man already . HARRY RICHARDSON Do n't laugh at him , Clay  --  he 's pretty hard hit . CLAY COLLUM I do n't mean to laugh . Gosh ! If there were any way I could do to help you , Rex , I 'd do it . You know that . HARRY RICHARDSON Same here , Rex . You see , the girl I love is three thousand miles away  --  so I understand , old chap . I 'd do anything if it meant your happiness . REX VAN ZILE Thanks , fellows . HARRY RICHARDSON His arm around him . If you only had some nice human vices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrtle think you a rake . REX VAN ZILE Regretfully . Yes  --  she 's known me ever since I was a kid in a Lord Fauntleroy velvet suit and long curls . HARRY RICHARDSON With awe . A little halo on legs . p. 41 REX VAN ZILE Once she kept me waiting three hours to take her to a dancing class . And all the time she was around behind the barn getting a written promise from Tommy Bowles to quit smoking . POLLY enters unobserved , carrying plates , which she soon puts on dining-table . HARRY RICHARDSON Earnestly . I wish I could think of some way to help you . CLAY COLLUM Turning away . I wish we could . POLLY SHANNON Turning to them and thinking they are referring to her previous story . Thank you . You 're very kind , but I 'll manage all right . As they all look up she sees she has made a mistake . Oh , I beg your pardon , sir . I thought you were speaking to me . HARRY RICHARDSON No . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zile now . He also has an unfulfilled dream . She 's just been here . POLLY SHANNON Smiling . Ah , yes , sir ; the young lady who 's always redeeming people ? HARRY RICHARDSON As though to himself . We were trying to imagine some way we could get her to redeem him . p. 42 POLLY SHANNON Oh , I 've thought how that could be done . HARRY RICHARDSON Astounded . You have ? CLAY COLLUM Rising . Have you ? POLLY SHANNON Oh , I beg pardon . I really ought n't to presume . REX VAN ZILE You 've thought of some way you can get her to save me ? POLLY SHANNON It would be quite simple . CLAY COLLUM He ca n't drink , you know . POLLY SHANNON Smiling . It would n't be necessary . This is a woman . HARRY RICHARDSON Save him from a woman ? REX VAN ZILE Eagerly . Go on . Tell me what you mean . POLLY SHANNON Well , suppose there was a very beautiful and very wicked woman wanted to marry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? POLLY SHANNON Laughs . I 'm sure I do n't know . What I mean is , suppose you were suddenly to be caught in the toils of some famous siren . p. 43 REX VAN ZILE Me ? CLAY COLLUM Rex ? POLLY SHANNON Be seen dining with her in public ; then motor down to your country place and introduce her , as your fiance , at some social function . HARRY RICHARDSON Coming between REX and POLLY . I think I see what you mean . POLLY SHANNON Working it out . Of course , there would be no real harm . Only your friends would become alarmed , fear the enchantress was going to wreck your life and cause a dreadful scandal . HARRY RICHARDSON Eagerly . Why , yes ; and Myrtle would jump at the chance to rescue him from disgrace and destruction . REX VAN ZILE You mean to say you think Myrtle would begin to take an interest in me just because she thought I was going to the devil ? CLAY COLLUM Surest thing in the world . HARRY RICHARDSON Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy Bowles ! A rake ! ! REX VAN ZILE And do you really think she 'd try to take me away from another woman ? HARRY RICHARDSON Gosh ! You know a lot about women , do n't you . p. 44 POLLY SHANNON I 've no doubt you gentlemen can find a better way , but I thought that , being a girl , I might understand how a girl feels . HARRY RICHARDSON It 's a wonderful idea . REX VAN ZILE But what happens when the enchantress sues me for $50,000 , for breach of promise ? CLAY COLLUM His enthusiasm momentarily checked . That 's so , Polly . An up-to-date Cleopatra would be a dangerous plaything for an amateur . POLLY SHANNON Oh , of course you 'd have to choose a nice safe one . HARRY RICHARDSON Well , they may come nice , but they do n't come safe . Smiles knowingly . CLAY COLLUM You see , one of these local favorites with beaded eyelashes and chrome-yellow curls would n't do . HARRY RICHARDSON No . What you need is a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Siam willed her on his deathbed ! Has a rope of pearls long enough to skip with ! And a past that 's lost in prehistoric times ! POLLY SHANNON Looking at REX . Yes , Mr. Van Zile would need something spectacular . p. 45 HARRY RICHARDSON But the spectacular ladies only play for high stakes . POLLY SHANNON Doubtfully . I suppose you could n't engage someone to play the part ? HARRY RICHARDSON I had n't thought of that . POLLY SHANNON Get some pretty girl who could pretend she was that sort of woman . Of course she 'd have to be unknown so that when it was all over she could disappear . CLAY COLLUM And no one in Northampton would know where she 'd come from or where she 'd gone to . POLLY SHANNON You 'd have to make up a picturesque history . Then get her to go down to the hotel at Northampton . She knows no one  --  just walks up and down  --  heavily veiled  --  with her dog . HARRY RICHARDSON The Masked Marvel ! POLLY SHANNON Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do that part . POLLY SHANNON Then , then , one day , Mr. Van Zile meets her under romantic circumstances ; an acquaintance is struck up ; he pretends to be fascinated ; announces he 's going to marry her  --  and everybody thinks he is on the high road to ruin . p. 46 CLAY COLLUM And we let a minister 's daughter think of that ! POLLY SHANNON To CLAY . Oh , even a minister 's daughter may read French novels . HARRY RICHARDSON Holding picture . It would work ! It would , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Has been staring before him . But where could I find someone who 'd do it ? I ca n't start advertising for a girl who 'll come and wreck my life . POLLY goes about her work . HARRY RICHARDSON No , of course not . By Jiminy  --  I 've got it . REX VAN ZILE What ? HARRY RICHARDSON Polly ! POLLY SHANNON Coming down inquiringly between HARRY and REX from pantry , thinking she has been called . Yes , sir . CLAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Polly ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , sir . REX VAN ZILE You do n't mean  --  Polly ? POLLY SHANNON Faces about again , towards REX . Is it a game ? p. 47 HARRY RICHARDSON You 're the girl , Polly . You 're the girl to do it . POLLY SHANNON Do you mean I 'm the girl to play the rle of this international siren ? You must be joking . HARRY RICHARDSON No , I 'm not . Do n't you see ? That girl you described . She 's got to be a girl no one could possibly know . And then it must be someone with whom he 'd be quite safe . POLLY SHANNON Amused . Safe ? HARRY RICHARDSON I mean who would n't  --   --  CLAY COLLUM Sue him for breach of promise  --  or try to make him marry her . POLLY SHANNON I understand . HARRY RICHARDSON And then you disappear . CLAY COLLUM You want to go abroad and have your voice trained . HARRY RICHARDSON You could be French . It would be twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find out about her as they might if she were a domestic home-wrecker ! POLLY SHANNON Seeing the humor of it throughout . You think I look like an imported home-wrecker ? p. 48 HARRY RICHARDSON I think you could do it if you wanted to . POLLY SHANNON You heard my story . HARRY RICHARDSON The parsonage in East Gilead . I know . But no one in East Gilead would ever hear about it . CLAY COLLUM You could read up on the lives of the dead sirens and we 'll take you around to the theatre and show you a few live ones . POLLY SHANNON Putting chairs in place at table , which is now all set . Excuse me , sir , but it 's the wildest idea I ever heard of . HARRY RICHARDSON It 's your idea . POLLY SHANNON Dismissing it . Not that I should be the lady with the prehistoric past . HARRY RICHARDSON Now hold on ; we 'll fix you up . We 'll get you the most wonderful clothes . CLAY COLLUM Yes  --  I 'll buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . REX VAN ZILE Has been working it out himself . Eh ? HARRY RICHARDSON And the string of pearls . REX VAN ZILE Pearls ? p. 49 HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , they can be fake . REX VAN ZILE Thank you . HARRY RICHARDSON You 'd be willing to plunk out something to get Myrtle , would n't you ? REX VAN ZILE I 'd give every cent I 've got  --  but  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON That 's the way to talk . To POLLY . There , you see . And in three weeks you could earn enough to take you over to Europe and keep you there while you were having your voice trained . POLLY SHANNON You mean Mr. Van Zile would pay me ? HARRY RICHARDSON Of course . CLAY COLLUM You would n't choose to listen to his love sick ravings for fun , would you ? HARRY RICHARDSON And you say you would n't take any money unless you earned it . Looking at REX . Being engaged to a man in love with another girl would be earning it . POLLY SHANNON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . HARRY RICHARDSON Persistently . Yes , you can . POLLY SHANNON To REX . They do n't seem to be consulting you very much , Mr. Van Zile . REX smiles . After all , you ought to have something to say about who shall be engaged to ruin your reputation . p. 50 REX VAN ZILE Well , it seems crazy  --  but the way you described it it sounds plausible . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , she can go through with it all right . REX VAN ZILE But I 'm wondering now if I could . I 'm a pretty poor liar . HARRY RICHARDSON Hold on . I 'll take care of the scandal department and I 'll coach you carefully . REX VAN ZILE Starts up with resolution . And you 'll guarantee Myrtle will save me ? HARRY RICHARDSON Sure I will . REX VAN ZILE Then I 'm on if you are . Polly  --  will you ruin me ? HARRY RICHARDSON Pleading . Please , Polly . CLAY COLLUM Same . Please , Polly . HARRY RICHARDSON Think of Paris . POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fair to tempt me with a chance to fulfil my lifelong dream . Hesitates . I wonder if I could do it . HARRY RICHARDSON Of course you could . You 'd never meet the Northampton people again . p. 51 POLLY SHANNON REX stands with helpless hands out , POLLY argues with herself . All my life I 've been poor and I 've dreamed of being something , doing something with my voice . I could n't do anything because I was poor  --  poor . And now you 're offering me a chance to be something  --  to get what I want . I have nobody in the world who cares . Suddenly . Yes , Mr. Van Zile  --  I 'll do it . CLAY AND HARRY Bravo ! Splendid ! They all stand and look at each other laughing , and a bit overcome by what they have undertaken . CLAY and HARRY shake hands . HARRY RICHARDSON After a pause . Let 's see ; we 've got to have a name . CLAY COLLUM Yes ; something showy . POLLY SHANNON Polly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --   --  She sees Goujod 's letter on the piano . What was the name on the letter ? HARRY RICHARDSON Yes ; where 's the letter ? CLAY COLLUM Oh , I left it on the piano . Gets letter . Bady . POLLY SHANNON The letter  --   --  Bady . There 's a name  --  Paulette Bady ! That sounds naughty . p. 52 HARRY RICHARDSON Great ! Splendid ! POLLY SHANNON Oh ; but can I really look it ? REX VAN ZILE Yes , can she look it ? HARRY RICHARDSON Can she ? Just take off that cap , Polly . Get those curtains of yours , Clay . We 'll try how you look in fancy clothes . CLAY COLLUM That 's a great idea . Here , Polly , hold that a moment . Business with cloth . Now wait till I give you a pin  --   --  Takes scarfpin out of tie . Now pin it there at your waist . Now turn around . Turn around again  --   --  now over your shoulder  --  there ! Assists her in getting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror . HARRY RICHARDSON Gets lampshade . Now , give her something for her head . Puts on feather lampshade . Fine  --  splendid ! REX VAN ZILE Wonderful . CLAY COLLUM It 's great . POLLY SHANNON Turning to the boys . There ! Is this the way they look ? CLAY COLLUM Jiminy  --  you 're a stunner. p. 53 POLLY SHANNON Assisted by CLAY as she steps off bench , with a French accent , as she postures hand on hip . Monsieur  --  Merci . Ah  --  ce que je suis mchante ! Eet ees not my fault ! But when a man knows me  --  ' e ees ruined  --  just like zat ! Snapping fingers in REX 'S astonished face . HARRY AND CLAY Wonderful ! Great work ! REX VAN ZILE I wonder what mother will say . HARRY RICHARDSON She 'll be tickled to death when you 're safely married . REX VAN ZILE So Will I ! POLLY SHANNON Suddenly and dramatically . Ah-h ! Sacr bleu ! She holds up her hand dramatically . ALL What is it  --  what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning ! She drops the things and goes quickly to kitchen . HARRY RICHARDSON I knew she could do it . CLAY COLLUM Now we 've got to think up a past for her . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , never mind about her past . Let 's have a drink first . Goes towards cellarette , CLAY follows him. p. 54 REX VAN ZILE I think I 'll take a drink , too . HARRY RICHARDSON Hands glasses to REX and CLAY , pausing with glass in hand . I 've got it . REX VAN ZILE Yes ? HARRY RICHARDSON Picks up newspaper . Wait  --  I 've got an idea . We 'll say Paulette Bady is the mysterious woman for whom Petrowski killed himself ! CLAY COLLUM Great ! REX VAN ZILE Are you sure he would n't mind ? HARRY RICHARDSON We do n't care about him . We 'll drink to your coming wedding day  --  when the goldenrod is in bloom . CLAY COLLUM But first of all to M'lle Paulette Bady ! HARRY RICHARDSON Paulette ! The great adventuress ! The home-wrecker ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses at each sentence . REX imitates HARRY in glass motions . POLLY enters carrying steak on tray . POLLY SHANNON Very simple , the maid again . Dinner is served , sir . As she crosses to serve , the boys all drink with a gulp , then go to table  --  speaking following at random to suit action. p. 55 HARRY RICHARDSON Rex , you sit here . You 're the guest of honor . The best chair in the house for you . Any particular way you like your meat ? REX VAN ZILE No  --  any way . HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  I know you want it on your plate . Gives steak . Our decorator friend here is very particular about his meat . It must be very rare . I do n't know why  --  artistic temperament , I suppose  --   --  Pausing . Clay , bring another plate . POLLY SHANNON Surprised . I 've set the table for three , sir . HARRY RICHARDSON But we 're four . Holds chair . Sit down , Polly . POLLY SHANNON Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must . REX VAN ZILE Yes , we want to talk this over . POLLY SHANNON As she seats herself reluctantly . It 's awfully nice of you . Are you sure you do n't mind my apron ? HARRY RICHARDSON He takes plate from CLAY and puts steak on it , passing it to POLLY . He then puts on his coat and sits at table with others . There we are . POLLY says grace , REX goes to pass salt , HARRY motions him to stop until POLLY finishes , then : Wo n't you have some salt ? p. 56 POLLY SHANNON When shall I get my dresses ? They all laugh and talk excitedly. @x SCENE : The living room . The VAN ZILE summer home , Northampton , Long Island . Some weeks later . A wide , airy , comfortable room , suggesting by its furniture , light hangings and flowers , a charming summery effect . At the back there are two large French windows , the one at left of center opening on to the hallway that leads to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch , which flanks the right side of the room as well . The right wall is also composed of two French windows . Left of the doorway , in back , there is a stairway ascending to the floor above . At the left there is a fireplace ; below it stands a chaise-longue , and above , a settee formed by the angle of the stairs . There is also a sofa at the right , with appropriate chairs about . The wall at the extreme back of the hall-way shows one door which leads to the music room . Through the windows can be seen a garden with trees and , beyond , the white dunes and the blue stretch of the ocean . It is a fine afternoon early in August . Three ladies are seated about the tea table : MRS . DAVIS , her daughter , MYRTLE , and MRS . VAN ZILE . They use fans throughout to suggest heat . MRS . VAN ZILE is a sweet , amiable , highly bred lady nearly sixty . She is given to breathless fluttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays her ineffectualness and a captivating lunacy bred of her total lack of conscious humor . She is a widow with an only son ; needless to say she adores him . He is very fond of her , too . As the curtain rises PARKER , the maid , dressed in conventional black gown and lace apron , enters from hall on to veranda , straightening chairs and then back into hall and then off . CLAY is faintly heard practising a piano , off in the music room in back . MYRTLE DAVIS Placing down her teacup and knitting . I can only tell you this : she 's a notorious woman . p. 58 MARTHA VAN ZILE A foreigner , of course . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Yes ; a French woman . MYRTLE DAVIS They say she wrecked a throne . MARTHA VAN ZILE She must be a very violent person . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Oh , you do n't understand ; she did n't wreck it with a bomb ; she wrecked it with a string of pearls . MARTHA VAN ZILE A string of pearls  --  dear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite shameless it seems . MARTHA VAN ZILE You know , I ca n't understand what is the matter with Queen mothers . Most of them appear to be very good women , but their boys are so badly brought up . MYRTLE DAVIS No one seems to be quite clear just which king it was . MARTHA VAN ZILE It 's no wonder  --  so many of them have been getting into trouble lately . CLEMENTINE DAVIS She created a tremendous scandal in South America , too . The Prime Minister of Uruguay fought a duel with his own brother . MYRTLE DAVIS Paraguay , mother . CLEMENTINE DAVIS No  --  no , dear ; I 'm sure Mr. Collum said Uruguay . I always remember Uruguay because it sounds as if they were calling you some name . p. 59 MYRTLE DAVIS The thing I do n't understand is , what is she doing in Northampton . MARTHA VAN ZILE No . If all this is true it must seem dreadfully dull to her . CLEMENTINE DAVIS She keeps entirely to herself  --  just walks up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . MARTHA VAN ZILE Is it ? Dear , dear , it seems too bad  --  the poor thing !  --  I suppose she 's very pretty ? CLEMENTINE DAVIS My dear , they always are  --  that sort . MARTHA VAN ZILE I should rather like to see her  --  at a distance  --  you know . MYRTLE DAVIS If you 'll pardon me , Mrs. Van Zile , I do n't think such a woman should be encouraged by any show of interest whatever . CLEMENTINE DAVIS I do n't see any harm in being interested , my dear . MYRTLE DAVIS But this woman is dangerous . MARTHA VAN ZILE I am glad my boy does n't care for women . MYRTLE DAVIS Ah , if they were all as safe as Rex . MARTHA VAN ZILE Dear me  --  there , I dropped a stitch . Enter STILES , carrying a pair of gardener shears . He is cleaned up a bit and wears a gardener 's blue apron. p. 60 STILES Excuse me , Mrs. Van Zile  --  To others . Oh , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIS Good afternoon , Stiles . I 'm glad to see you 're getting along . STILES Crossing . Thank you , Miss . Approaching and lowering his voice confidentially to MYRTLE . And I 've lost the craving . I have n't so much as thought of a glass of beer in three days . MYRTLE DAVIS Of course not . Your mind is on higher things . STILES No , ma'am , I ai n't thought of the fifteen-cent drinks neither . MYRTLE DAVIS I mean higher in a spiritual , not a monetary sense , Stiles . STILES Abashed . Oh , yes 'm . I guess now I 'm started , I 'm in for it . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Vivaciously . Yes ; it 's like walking a tight-rope across Niagara : you 've got to keep straight and keep going . STILES Shaking head mournfully . Gee , to think even if I fell off I 'd only strike water . MARTHA VAN ZILE Did you wish to speak to me , Stiles ? p. 61 STILES Taking a step towards MRS . VAN ZILE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygeraniums to get ready . MARTHA VAN ZILE Correcting him . Hydrangeas , Stiles . Oh , yes , Myrtle , I 'm sending over some hydrangeas to decorate the platform for the concert to-night . MYRTLE DAVIS That 's very kind of you . MARTHA VAN ZILE Stiles , Miss Davis and I will come and select them after we 've had tea . STILES All right , ma'am . I 'll be out back digging potatoes . MARTHA VAN ZILE Be very careful , Stiles ; I do n't want to find myself eating tulip-bulbs as I did last night . STILES We do n't grow them fancy vegetables back in East Gilead . MYRTLE DAVIS East Gilead ? STILES That 's where I come from . MARTHA VAN ZILE Ah , yes  --  " Balm of Gilead "  --  the name mentioned in the Bible . STILES The way the Gilead folks talk you 'd think they was each mentioned in it . Exits off into garden . CLEMENTINE DAVIS To MYRTLE . Have you asked Rex if he will be an usher at the concert ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsympathetic toward the Life Savers . COMMODORE BOB starts humming off . MARTHA VAN ZILE Protesting . Oh , I 'm sure you 're mistaken  --   --  COMMODORE BOB appears in hallway carrying a newspaper . He is a genial , sportive gentleman of fifty-odd , with plenty of money , and of an easy-going , good-natured temperament . He is the style that rises to eminence in local yacht clubs and honorary military organizations . In spite of his sex he is the most confirmed gossip in Northampton . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Good afternoon , ladies . Hello , Martha . MARTHA VAN ZILE Hello , Robert . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Have you told them the news ? MARTHA VAN ZILE News ? COMMODORE BOB BARKER You do n't mean to say that he has kept it a secret for nearly a week ? It has been the talk of the club all afternoon and you have n't heard ? Sitting by tea table . MARTHA VAN ZILE Half rising . I  --  I do n't understand . Nothing has happened to Rex ? p. 63 COMMODORE BOB BARKER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero ! A life-saver ! MRS . VAN ZILE sits again . MYRTLE DAVIS A life-saver ? Whom did he save ? COMMODORE BOB BARKER That charming French actress ! CLEMENTINE DAVIS What ? All together . MARTHA VAN ZILE Not that dreadful woman ? All together . MYRTLE DAVIS A life-saver ? All together . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Who told you ? All together . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Opening paper . Northampton Courier . Just out this afternoon . Listen  --  Reads . " A Modest Hero "  --  that 's the headline . MARTHA VAN ZILE My boy ! COMMODORE BOB BARKER " The Northampton Cottage Colony boasts a hero in the person of Mr. Rex Van Zile , who , with his mother , is summering in our midst . It appears that at dawn on Wednesday morning he rescued from drowning  --   --  " p. 64 MYRTLE DAVIS Drowning ! COMMODORE BOB BARKER  --  " M'lle Paulette Bady , the celebrated French actress , who was taking her matutinal dip . Mr. Van Zile was walking along the beach when he heard her cry for help  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up his French ; you never can tell when it will be useful . Yes , go on , cousin . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Continuing.  --  " and without hesitating for a moment he plunged gallantly into the water  --   --  Pauses as he turns over paper . MARTHA VAN ZILE Breathless . Please  --  please  --   --  COMMODORE BOB BARKER  --  " We regret to say that further particulars are lacking owing to the inaccessibility of the lady , who chooses to clothe herself in an air of mystery ! " Pause.  --  " We understand , however , that a friendship has resulted from this romantic introduction ! " He looks at them and smiles broadly . MARTHA VAN ZILE What ! MYRTLE DAVIS Confidently . Rex and that woman ! Oh , no ! Turning and resuming knitting. p. 65 COMMODORE BOB BARKER Why not ? Why not ? She 's a nectarine ! I 'd just like to have a corner on the opera-glass market if she ever comes down to the beach in one of those French bathing suits . MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Van Zile ? MRS . VAN ZILE is pouring out tea for COMMODORE . She 's a positive menace to the moral welfare of the community . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Turning to MRS . DAVIS , who turns to him . I admit her past is a bit patchy ; but a pretty , fascinatin ' woman ought to be allowed some leeway , I say . MARTHA VAN ZILE Some tea ? Offering him the cup of tea . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Taking it . Thank you . MYRTLE DAVIS I do n't approve of such loose views , Commodore . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Loose nothing . Broad . That 's all . These foreigners have standards of their own . I know . There 's some French in me , too . MYRTLE DAVIS Dryly . Yes , I 've no doubt . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Well , Rex is a lucky young beggar . Wish I 'd rescued her , that 's all . HARRY and CLAY come out of library into hall . HARRY pantomimes to CLAY to go down the hall to get REX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY RICHARDSON Having heard last sentence of COMMODORE . Oh , you 've heard about Rex ? COMMODORE BOB BARKER Yes . HARRY RICHARDSON The Courier is out then ? COMMODORE BOB BARKER Sure . Did you know it was going to be in the Courier ? HARRY RICHARDSON Floundering . Why  --  er  --  no  --  of course not . Music heard off , again . I  --  er  --  I saw you were reading it . MARTHA VAN ZILE Cup of tea , Harry ? Will you please ring the bell ? Do you know where Rex is , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON Why , has n't he been about here  --  upstairs or something ? Takes cup and goes to stairway . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Perhaps you can tell us some things about M'lle Bady , Mr. Richardson . HARRY RICHARDSON I could  --  of course ; but I do n't think I 'd better . COMMODORE BOB BARKER That 's right ; remember , there are ladies present . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Rising . Oh , Mr. Richardson , do go on ; we widows hear so few good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maid , enters for hot-water jug . CLEMENTINE DAVIS You can go in the music room , dear . I hear Mr. Collum in there practising for your concert . Sitting again . MRS . VAN ZILE gives maid hot-water pitcher to replenish , PARKER exits . MYRTLE DAVIS I think you are all displaying entirely too much levity regarding this woman . Have none of you any social conscience ? Surely you know enough about her now , mother , to see that she is a positive danger to weak-minded , unprincipled men . Looks at COMMODORE . CLEMENTINE DAVIS I know , Myrtle ; but if it were n't for women like this how would we know some men are weak ? MARTHA VAN ZILE I really wish next time Rex saves someone 's life , he 'd be a little more careful who it is . Enter REX ; he carries Salom under one arm . Salom is a toy dog and wears a large ribbon to match POLLY 'S gown . REX VAN ZILE Standing on threshold , overwhelmed at seeing everyone there . Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rex . p. 68 REX VAN ZILE I did n't know there were people here . I 'll come back later . Starts off , HARRY stops him . HARRY RICHARDSON Stay here ! REX VAN ZILE Aside . Not now . HARRY RICHARDSON Same . Now ! MARTHA VAN ZILE Rising and crossing to him . My boy ! My hero ! COMMODORE BOB BARKER Rising , applauding , crossing to REX . Bravo , my boy , bravo ! REX VAN ZILE Turns , not understanding . Mother , I have brought a  --  a very charming lady who is anxious to meet you . MARTHA VAN ZILE Sweetly . Oh , how nice ! Who is she ? REX VAN ZILE M'lle Paulette Bady . HARRY punches REX ; an admonition to be strong . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Holy  --  jumping Moses ! MRS . VAN ZILE gets to her feet , opens her mouth as if she were going to speak , struggles to articulate , but fails . MRS . DAVIS and MYRTLE gasp . POLLY enters , ravishingly dressed in the most ultra French mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . She comes down and speaks with a delicious French accent. p. 69 POLLY SHANNON Bon soir . I ' ope I am not de trop ? You must pardon ze familiarity , but I so desire to meet Madame Von Zeel . Advancing to MRS . DAVIS . Rex , ees zees your mama ? CLEMENTINE DAVIS Rising , backing away . Not yet  --  I  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE Rising . No  --  I  --  I  --   --  REX VAN ZILE This is my mama  --   --  Correcting himself . Mother , Paulette . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Murmuring . Paulette ! MYRTLE rises , pushing back her chair . POLLY SHANNON Oh ! What a lovely mama ! Ze grande dame ! Only so sweet ! You are out of ze picture book . MARTHA VAN ZILE Flattered and then flabbergasted . How  --  how do you do . POLLY SHANNON Shakes MRS . VAN ZILE 'S hand . Rex , ' e tell me ' ow wondairful a mozair ' e ' ave . MARTHA VAN ZILE Pleased in spite of herself . Did he ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid volley of French . Elle est charmante ! Exquise ! D'une beaut ! Je n'aurais jamais cru qu'elle est si belle ! REX VAN ZILE Shows in his manner he has n't understood one word . Yes . MAID enters with pitcher of hot water . MARTHA VAN ZILE Completely flustered . Yes  --  yes , of course . Wo n't you sit down ? POLLY SHANNON Merci ! Oh , my little babee ! Gives dog to MAID , who has in the meantime deposited the pitcher on the tea wagon . Will you please take Salom for a run in ze Park ? PARKER takes dog and exits off to porch . REX VAN ZILE This is Mrs. Davis , M'lle Bady  --  and Miss Davis . MYRTLE merely inclines her head . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Good afternoon . POLLY SHANNON ' Ow do you do . REX VAN ZILE And my chum  --  Harry Richardson . POLLY SHANNON What ees eet  --  chom ? REX VAN ZILE Pals  --  friends . p. 71 POLLY SHANNON Ah-h  --  trs bien ! With gesture from herself to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiles to note the effect , then holds out hand to HARRY , crosses to him . So charm to meet you . Holding HARRY 'S hand . Such a fine vireel man ! HARRY smiles knowingly and puffs up . HARRY RICHARDSON We must be chums , too , Mademoiselle . POLLY SHANNON Mais oui ! Certainment ! Speaks frankly to the women , who are shocked . I like  --  ze men . Shows her back to audience ; her gown is very low cut and covered with lace . CLEMENTINE DAVIS You need n't have told us that . MYRTLE DAVIS I think mother and I are out of place here , Mrs. Van Zile . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Aside to MYRTLE . Please , Myrtle . POLLY SHANNON Oh , no  --  no ! I like ze women , too  --  sometimes . COMMODORE coughs vigorously to draw attention to himself . May I came and sit by you , Mrs. Von Zeel ? Merci ! Catching sight of COMMODORE . Ah , who ees ze other young man ? COMMODORE beams with pleasure at the flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barker . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Crossing in front of tea table , to POLLY , he bows graciously , as she extends her hand he kisses it . Ah  --  I was afraid you were going to leave me out . MRS . VAN ZILE taps him from behind with her fan . POLLY SHANNON Pairhaps Rex ' e was afraid you waire a leetle too gay for me to know . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Too gay ? Smiling broadly . Gosh ! You flatter me ! POLLY SHANNON Ees eet so , monsieur ? ' E look like a naughty boy  --  hein ? ' E ' ave ze same weecked eye as zat bad man in Uruguay . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Triumphantly to MRS . VAN ZILE . It was Uruguay . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Making conversation . We were  --  we were  --  we were just talking about you when you came in . The ladies show their embarrassment ; they try to stop the COMMODORE ; but as POLLY turns , they all start to fan themselves . POLLY SHANNON About me ? Turning to REX . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . p. 73 COMMODORE BOB BARKER Indicating chaise-longue , putting pillows from settee . Wo n't you sit here ? POLLY SHANNON No ; no . You say bad zings about me . COMMODORE BOB BARKER No such thing . I was just telling them about Rex saving your life . Looks at REX , who likewise knows nothing . POLLY SHANNON Saving my life ? HARRY RICHARDSON Trying to create a diversion as POLLY looks at HARRY in amazement . Perhaps you will have some cake , Mademoiselle ? MARTHA VAN ZILE I think you ought to have told me about this , Rex . REX VAN ZILE . Absolutely at a loss . About what ? MARTHA VAN ZILE About your rescuing Mademoiselle . REX VAN ZILE Yes  --  ah  --  perhaps I should , mother . HARRY RICHARDSON Shows newspaper . Have n't you seen this , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE No . HARRY RICHARDSON Giving it to him . Look at it . p. 74 CLEMENTINE DAVIS We are so anxious to hear some of the details . Please tell us about it , Mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Eet  --  eet was such a dreadful expairience . I can not bear to zeenk of eet . Evair seence I am a small child , I ' ave such a ' orror of fire ! ALL Fire ? Fire ? I beg your pardon , did you say fire ? POLLY SHANNON Confidently , in spite of HARRY 'S warning gesture . But your brave boy , ' e ees not afraid of ze flames . They look at each other puzzled . MARTHA VAN ZILE Flames ? CLEMENTINE DAVIS Rex does n't seem afraid of anything . HARRY RICHARDSON Pointedly to POLLY so she will get it . Mrs. Davis is n't speaking about the fire . Melodramatically . She means the time he saved you from drowning , a week ago , when you cried for help and he came running along the beach at dawn . POLLY SHANNON Understanding . Oh-h ! Oui  --  oui  --  zat time ? COMMODORE sits on edge of chaise-longue. p. 75 HARRY RICHARDSON Agreeing . Yes , that time . MARTHA VAN ZILE Good gracious ! Have you saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other time was nothing . POLLY SHANNON Breaking in . No  --  no . I drop my cigarette on my skirt  --  zat ees all . COMMODORE BOB BARKER But the drowning  --  that was real Carnegie medal stuff , eh ? POLLY SHANNON Mais oui , ' e should have a medal . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Go on tell us about it . I 'll see if I can get him one . POLLY SHANNON Seeing she must go on , after looking helplessly at REX . Imagine to yourself : I am alone . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Why do you go in alone ? POLLY SHANNON I go alone because I do n't like to be stared at by everybody . You see , my bathing suit  --  eet ees just a trifle  --  a trifle  --   --  COMMODORE BOB BARKER It 's just a trifle , eh ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Robert ! CLEMENTINE DAVIS Please go on , Mademoiselle . p. 76 POLLY SHANNON Rising . I am out of my depth . Ze waves are beeg like mountains . Ze undairtow eet ees terrible . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come !

Just as ' e reach me a great wave sweep ovair ' im  --   --  REX gazes incredulously , wondering what will happen . ' E sink  --  I sink  --  down  --  down  --  down through ze green watair ! MARTHA VAN ZILE And did your sins all rush through your mind like they describe in books ? POLLY SHANNON My sins ? Mon Dieu  --  ' ow many hours do you zink I am down zaire ? MYRTLE DAVIS To MRS . DAVIS . Did you ever hear anything so shameless ? POLLY SHANNON Zen all go black . Zen somezing grabs me by ze leg . MYRTLE DAVIS By the leg ? Women shocked . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Oh , Rex , how could you ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 'm surprised at you , Rex . POLLY SHANNON Oh , ' e did not see what ' e was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE Trying to help it out . Yes . A drowning man will clutch at a straw . Imitating business . POLLY SHANNON Quickly drawing herself up indignantly . I beg your pardon . REX VAN ZILE Overcome . Oh  --  ah  --  what I mean  --   --  MYRTLE DAVIS Why , Rex ! POLLY SHANNON ' E zink eet was my arm ' e ' ave ' old of . Zen ' e see ' is meestake and because ' e ees a gentleman ' e let go .

She kisses him on cheek , which leaves a red mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her leg on knee , and uses a lipstick as the others eye her with varied emotions . HARRY RICHARDSON To MYRTLE . You little thought , Miss Davis , the day that Rex annoyed you by making fun of the Life Savers , he would so soon become one . p. 78 MYRTLE DAVIS Rising . I 've certainly learned a great deal about Rex this afternoon that amazes me . REX VAN ZILE Upset . Why , Myr  --  please do n't think  --   --  She turns away from him . HARRY RICHARDSON MRS . VAN ZILE rises and rings bell . HARRY grabs his arm and speaks to REX between his teeth . Stay here , you bone-head . POLLY SHANNON Rising to MYRTLE . Oh , you are not going yet , Mees  --  Mees Davis ? We ' ave as yet no chance to become  --   --  Turns to REX . What ees zat word I like ?  --  ah  --  choms ! PARKER crosses from hall to veranda and then enters and takes off tea wagon . MYRTLE DAVIS Icily . I think you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , mother . POLLY sits again , giving HARRY a look . REX VAN ZILE Crossing up to door , following MYRTLE . I  --  I ca n't be of any help about the concert , can I , Myrtle ? p. 79 MYRTLE DAVIS None whatever , thank you . Come , mother . CLEMENTINE DAVIS Reluctantly . I do n't see why you drag me away . Exits after MYRTLE . MARTHA VAN ZILE Following her guests to the hall and speaking as she goes . You 'll excuse me , wo n't you ? I must go with my friend Mrs. Davis  --  I  --   --  She goes out , overcome by it all . POLLY SHANNON Coming to HARRY and thinking she is alone with the boys , drops her French accent . How did I do it ? REX indicates COMMODORE , who is half reclining on sofa . He smiles broadly as she looks at him . Look at little Kewpie . HARRY RICHARDSON Indicating COMMODORE to her . Kootchy  --  kootch ! Sh ! Get rid of that fellow . POLLY SHANNON Crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zay about me . I 'm afraid my poor ear she start to burn again . Speaks in conspiratorial whisper to COMMODORE ; COMMODORE crosses to POLLY . Be a good boy  --  go out and defend my poor charactair . I should ' ate Mrs. Van Zile to zink bad zings about me. p. 80 COMMODORE BOB BARKER Taking her hand and kissing it . Lady , you have but to command me . HARRY rises . REX VAN ZILE Protesting involuntarily . Here ! COMMODORE BOB BARKER Flirting . What about a little supper at the inn  --  just you and me . POLLY SHANNON Embarrassed . Sank you  --  but  --  I am afraid I can not . I am down ' ere for a rest  --  and I maike no engagement . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Ah , come along . I never take " no " from a pretty girl . I want to introduce you to my own special cocktail : the Lulu Ballulo . It 's a bird . POLLY SHANNON A bird ? HARRY RICHARDSON Yes , I hear it calling you . Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? Are you young fellows afraid I 'll cut you out ? I 'll phone you tonight ; perhaps you 'll change your mind . At door . What time do you go in bathing ? POLLY SHANNON Seex  --  in ze morning . COMMODORE BOB BARKER Gosh ! Pretty early . Gaily . But I 've got an alarm clock . Exits . They close door after him in back. p. 81 POLLY SHANNON Without accent . Oh , that was terrible . HARRY RICHARDSON I guess he wants to go into the life-saving corps , too . REX VAN ZILE To HARRY . Why on earth did n't you tell us that you were publishing that rescue story ? POLLY SHANNON Rises . Yes , I almost sank beneath that green wave . HARRY RICHARDSON You certainly are a wonder . I have to keep on saying " minister 's daughter , minister 's daughter "  --  or I 'll be offering you fancy cocktails myself . POLLY SHANNON Referring to COMMODORE . Was n't he persistent ? REX VAN ZILE I 'd like to kick him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every minute I was going to blush . Would n't it be awful ? REX VAN ZILE Why ? POLLY SHANNON Why ? A woman with my past blushing ! Can you imagine it ? HARRY RICHARDSON No , that 's right . If you 're going to be a bad woman you ought to be a good one . POLLY SHANNON I hope the Commodore wo n't keep on bothering me . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have a lot of trouble with him . Crossing over to sofa. p. 82 HARRY RICHARDSON He 'll stop bothering you as soon as your engagement is announced . CLAY enters in back , closing door . REX VAN ZILE You 're going to announce it ? HARRY RICHARDSON No ; you are . REX VAN ZILE But not yet . HARRY RICHARDSON Right away  --  this afternoon . Clay , we 're going to announce the engagement . REX VAN ZILE But wait  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Wait nothing . Did n't we agree to say you and Polly were engaged ? CLAY COLLUM That will start Myrtle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone far enough . POLLY SHANNON Not far enough ? REX VAN ZILE Now , listen . I 've been thinking a lot about this engagement part of our scheme and there are difficulties . POLLY SHANNON Rising . Difficulties ? REX VAN ZILE Yes ! What sort of a cad am I going to look when I throw her over ? HARRY RICHARDSON You need n't throw her over . p. 83 REX VAN ZILE Bewildered . Why , you just said  --   --  POLLY SHANNON Crossing to REX . Do n't be frightened . I shall discover that you were merely dazzled by me ; that you really love Myrtle . And I shall do what that French actress in Camille did . I shall join your two hands and say  --   --  In French accent " Maike ' im ' appy , as only a good woman can maike a good man ' appy . And when people say bad zings about me , try not to judge me too ' arshly ! " She does this with great feeling , and all except REX burst out laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it 's the right thing to do  --   --  CLAY COLLUM Of course , it is . HARRY RICHARDSON So now that 's settled . We 'll clear out and give Rex a chance to tell his mother . REX VAN ZILE His jaw dropping . I 've  --  got  --  to  --  tell  --  mother ? HARRY RICHARDSON Of course , you have . REX VAN ZILE Yes , I know . How  --  how would you do it ? I do n't want to be too sudden about it . p. 84 HARRY RICHARDSON Go tell her you love the girl and that you want to marry her . Clay , come over here and sit down .  --  Just pretend you 're his mother . CLAY COLLUM And you 're Rex . HARRY RICHARDSON Getting chair and fixing it for CLAY . Sit in this chair , Mama . CLAY sits . He pulls out a large silk handkerchief and puts it over his knees . HARRY lays his hand on CLAY 'S shoulder . Mother , dear , I have something to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you know I would n't willingly do anything to hurt you , do n't you ? CLAY COLLUM To HARRY , pretending he is REX 'S mother . You do n't need to go any further , Rex . His voice breaks . I can guess what you are going to tell me . Wipes a tear from his eye . HARRY RICHARDSON To CLAY . She 's a good woman at heart , mother , and I love her . Kisses his hand , which he places on CLAY 'S forehead . Then he turns to REX . Perfectly easy , is n't it ? REX VAN ZILE Not so sure . Yes  --  er  --   --  p. 85 CLAY COLLUM I 'll go tell your mother you want to speak to her here . Exits . HARRY RICHARDSON We 'll go out into the garden and inspect the havoc Stiles has been making in the last three days . They start to go . POLLY SHANNON Looking up inquiringly . Stiles ? HARRY RICHARDSON The new gardener . REX VAN ZILE Then  --  shall I call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in a few minutes . POLLY SHANNON I 'll just hold out my arms and say " Mother ! " Looking out . Oh , how lovely it is out here with the blue sky , and the beach , and the rolling dunes . And to think , that two weeks ago , I was in a hot kitchen cooking your dinner . HARRY and POLLY exit into garden . REX looks anxiously at watch , then replacing it he crosses to chair on which CLAY was sitting and leaning over places hand on back exactly in the manner shown by HARRY . His lips move and he gesticulates as he re-hearses the announcement and follows business . As he stoops over to kiss , MRS . VAN ZILE comes in , looks around in rather a frightened fashion , sees the siren has disappeared and breathes a sigh of relief. p. 86 MARTHA VAN ZILE Mr. Collum said you wanted to speak to me , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Turning abruptly , overcome . Yes . MARTHA VAN ZILE Looking around and lowering her voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's in the garden . With a slight crack in his voice . You 'd better sit down , mother . He indicates the rehearsal chair , but his mother chooses another one . Take this chair , wo n't you ? MARTHA VAN ZILE This one is very comfortable , thank you , Rex . Sitting in chair by sofa . He hesitates a moment , then crosses so as to approach the chair she is sitting in from the same side as HARRY indicated in the rehearsal . He ca n't do this so he comes back to the other side ; the change in attitude bothers him . REX VAN ZILE Mother , dear , I have something to tell you . As though recalling HARRY 'S words . I 'm afraid it might be a shock to you , but you know I would n't willingly do anything to hurt you , do n't you ? MARTHA VAN ZILE What on earth are you talking about ? p. 87 REX VAN ZILE This is awful . Having nerved himself up to the speech , he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  Stretches his neck and runs a finger inside his collar band . MARTHA VAN ZILE Rex , have you been out in the hot sun lately without your hat ? REX VAN ZILE No  --  why ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Rising and crossing . You 're behaving very strangely , dear . I know , of course , what a sweet , innocent unsuspecting nature you have and how easily a clever woman could get around you . REX VAN ZILE If you mean Miss Bady  --  she  --  she 's not as  --  as wicked as they say , mother . MARTHA VAN ZILE I do n't think any one woman could be . REX VAN ZILE No  --  yes . I mean  --  you 're mistaken , mother . And she 's all alone . MARTHA VAN ZILE Judging from what I hear , it 's the first time she ever has been . REX VAN ZILE Dabbing his brow with handkerchief . And I need a friend  --  that is to say , she needs a friend  --   --  p. 88 MARTHA VAN ZILE Rex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for her . Sits in rehearsal chair . REX VAN ZILE Seeing her sit in this chair , new courage comes to him ; he smiles , and he goes over eagerly and begins again . Mother , dear , I told you I have something to tell you . I 'm afraid it might be a shock  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE I must say , Rex , your behavior in bringing that woman into my house was thought-less  --   --  REX VAN ZILE As I was saying  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE You probably do n't know it , but she is a very dreadful person . REX VAN ZILE It may be a shock  --   --  MYRTLE enters and comes down . MYRTLE DAVIS Rex , I 've been thinking it over  --   --  REX VAN ZILE Yes ? MYRTLE DAVIS I 've decided to let you help me with the platform arrangements . POLLY enters followed by HARRY . POLLY SHANNON Advancing with outstretched arms , as prearranged , with French accent throughout . Mama ! p. 89 MARTHA VAN ZILE Looking over her shoulder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turns back ; REX follows her gaze and is rooted in horror to the spot . MRS . VAN ZILE rises . What ! What did you say ? POLLY SHANNON Eet ees so  --  so long since I ' ave said zat beautiful word , mama ! MARTHA VAN ZILE I  --  I do n't understand . Turning to HARRY . HARRY RICHARDSON Whispering to POLLY . The idiot has n't told her . POLLY SHANNON Surely ' e  --  Rex . You have n't told your mama ? REX VAN ZILE No ; not exactly  --  but  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE Told me what ? POLLY SHANNON Crossing to MRS . VAN ZILE . Zat we are engage . MARTHA VAN ZILE Engaged ? POLLY SHANNON Oui . MARTHA VAN ZILE Engaged to be married ? POLLY SHANNON Oui . Taking REX by his arm . REX VAN ZILE As HARRY nudges him . Oui . p. 90 MARTHA VAN ZILE Sinking into armchair . Rex ! REX VAN ZILE It 's true , mother . MYRTLE DAVIS Oh , you 're joking , Rex . POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in doorway . MARTHA VAN ZILE Robert  --  Robert  --  they 're engaged . COMMODORE BOB BARKER MRS . VAN ZILE makes an effectual gesture towards REX and POLLY . Engaged ? With a note of deep regret . Oh ! POLLY SHANNON What ees ze matter ? Turns swiftly , clutching REX 'S arm . I see ! Eet ees a meestake zey zink you are making . MARTHA VAN ZILE With a feeble effort at emphasis . A mistake ! POLLY SHANNON At last I ' ave found a good man ; a man who will protect me ; who ees strong and noble . HARRY RICHARDSON Boosts up REX , who is standing weak-kneed . Look strong and noble . REX VAN ZILE Yes . CLAY enters from library . COMMODORE , in pantomime , says to CLAY as he comes in , " CLAY  --  CLAY  --  they 're engaged ! " Then CLAY goes over below sofa. p. 91 POLLY SHANNON To boys . ' As no one anyzing to say to me ? To women . Ah , you zink I want ' im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You zink a pure love eet ees impossible to me , because you ' ave ' eard I am a weecked woman . Well , eet ees true I ' ave not always been good . You do not know ' ow difficult life ees when you are poor and alone and all ze time among bad man . COMMODORE turns quietly and sneaks off as she looks pointedly at him . HARRY continues to boost REX . She turns to boys . I see now why Rex ' e ' as not told you we are engage . REX wilts as she turns on him and HARRY . ' E was ashame  --  ashame of me . REX VAN ZILE Yes  --  no . POLLY SHANNON I weel not marry a man who ees ashame of me . I weel go  --  where ees my child ? Crosses to window-door . MARTHA VAN ZILE Horrified . Your child !

A man may live two lives , but a woman can live only one . As she goes out into garden . Eet ees n't fair , eet ees n't fair ! p. 92 HARRY RICHARDSON To REX . Play up  --  play up . REX VAN ZILE Same mock tragedy . I can not let her go like that . Paulette , Paulette ! It is n't fair !  --  REX has been half sinking ; CLAY and HARRY are beside him ; they , aside , half lift him up and shove him after POLLY . He goes out with short little steps . The others sit down , completely overcome . MYRTLE DAVIS Rex ! MARTHA VAN ZILE Crossing to HARRY . Oh , what shall we do ? Do you think he means to forgive her ? HARRY RICHARDSON Yes , I think so . MARTHA VAN ZILE Then  --  then he must love her ! MYRTLE DAVIS Crossing down to MRS . VAN ZILE . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a glamour about such women . MARTHA VAN ZILE Yes , I suppose there is . I felt it myself . Sitting in armchair . HARRY RICHARDSON Yes ; Rex is under the same spell that cost poor Petrowski his life . MARTHA VAN ZILE What ? p. 93 MYRTLE DAVIS Petrowski ? HARRY RICHARDSON Working it up . It 's rumored that Paulette Bady is the mysterious woman who won the heart of the world famous musician , Vladimir Petrowski . CLAY COLLUM It was after he found out that she had tricked him and flouted him that he went out and took his life . MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh  --  terrible ! MYRTLE DAVIS Think what a dreadful danger this is to Rex ! MARTHA VAN ZILE What shall I do ? MYRTLE sits on chaise-longue , thinking . CLAY COLLUM What is there to do ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 'm afraid he 's lost . MYRTLE DAVIS No  --  no ! Rising and coming back of MRS . VAN ZILE . He 's not lost ! We must not despair ! We must save him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swells out his chest and turns to CLAY ; they shake hands , aside , at the promised success of their scheme . MARTHA VAN ZILE Save him ! Yes , but how ? MYRTLE DAVIS Well , I have a plan . They gather around . First , you must be very nice to her . p. 94 MARTHA VAN ZILE I must  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Agreeing with MYRTLE throughout . Yes , we all must . MYRTLE DAVIS We must throw them together all we can so he will sicken of her . HARRY RICHARDSON To MRS . VAN ZILE . I think it would help things if you asked her to come and stay here . MARTHA VAN ZILE Overcome . Ask her to stay here ? CLAY COLLUM Yes . We must n't seem to oppose them yet . HARRY RICHARDSON True . MARTHA VAN ZILE But if we have them living in the same house , wo n't it seem as if I am countenancing this engagement ? MYRTLE DAVIS Even that 's better than having them elope , is n't it ? MARTHA VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that . MYRTLE DAVIS I know ! I 'll telephone to his uncle . CLAY COLLUM Halted . Rex 's uncle ? MYRTLE DAVIS If anyone can advise us he can . I 'll get him on the long distance myself now . Starts up. p. 95 HARRY RICHARDSON Realizing this may be a serious complication . Hold on , you 'd better go slow about this . MYRTLE DAVIS What is his number ? MARTHA VAN ZILE He 's always at the Metropolitan Club in the afternoon . MYRTLE DAVIS I 'll tell him you said he must come down at once . HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  no . You should n't do that . MYRTLE DAVIS Eloquently . Why not ? Do you want to see your best friend ruin his life ? HARRY RICHARDSON No ; but Clay and I can help you handle this . MYRTLE DAVIS I think we 'd better have someone who 's had more experience with women . Exits off back into music room . HARRY RICHARDSON More experience ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Yes . Prentice will know how to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his younger days . CLAY COLLUM Sees POLLY coming in . Ssh  --  ssh ! POLLY enters followed by REX . POLLY SHANNON Crossing down to HARRY , then to MRS . VAN ZILE . I am all right again . Giving dog to CLAY , who gives it to PARKER , who has entered in back and then goes off . You weel forgive me , Mrs. Van Zeele ? I ' ave ze temperament ; eet carry me away . p. 96 MARTHA VAN ZILE Yes  --  yes , of course . POLLY SHANNON Rex , ' e ' as calm me . ' E say ' e forgive all zat I do in ze long ago days . MARTHA VAN ZILE Does he ? That 's nice . He 's so forgiving . Wo n't you sit down ? POLLY SHANNON Merci . She and REX sit on the same chair close to MRS . VAN ZILE , who sits and looks behind her for support to MYRTLE , but sees she is not there . HARRY , however , comes to the rescue . MARTHA VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything rash . You wo n't elope  --  or  --  or  --   --  POLLY SHANNON No , nozing like that . I promise . Laughing at REX . HARRY RICHARDSON Aside to MRS . VAN ZILE . Invite her  --  invite her . MARTHA VAN ZILE I was thinking it might be well if  --  if you were to move over here . POLLY SHANNON Surprised . You mean , come and leeve wiz you ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Nervously , confused . Oui .  --  I mean a hotel is so public . p. 97 REX VAN ZILE What ? POLLY SHANNON What do you zink , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE I do n't know what to think . Looks at HARRY . HARRY nods over MRS . VAN ZILE 'S head for her to consent . POLLY SHANNON Rising , to MRS . VAN ZILE , with a burst of affection . You want zat we should be choms , too ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Rising . Yes  --  ! POLLY SHANNON C'est bien ! You should know somezing more about me . MARTHA VAN ZILE Aghast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? POLLY SHANNON Oui .  --  Oh , zanks , you are very kind . With a smile . I weel come . STILES enters from garden . STILES Beg pardon  --  the flowers for the concert , ma'am  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE Glad of interruption . Oh , yes . STILES They 've sent the wagon for them . He sees POLLY and stares at her. p. 98 MARTHA VAN ZILE You 'll excuse me . Let them select whatever they want . Attend to it at once , Stiles . Goes out in back , glad of escape . POLLY SHANNON Having recognized STILES ; aside to HARRY . He knows me . STILES Polly Shannon ! They all turn and look at him . Polly Shannon here ! POLLY SHANNON Crossing towards STILES , with accent . You make some meestake . I am M'lle Paulette Bady . STILES That French actress they 're all telling those awful tales about ? Why , you 're the living image of  --   --  Crossing to her . No , you are Polly Shannon . Dominie Shannon 's girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between STILES and POLLY . No , no ; this is M'lle Bady , Stiles . I know her . REX VAN ZILE Certainly . We know her , too . CLAY COLLUM We 've know her for years . POLLY SHANNON Oui . STILES So do I know her . Why , many 's the meal she 's given me after her Paw saved me from sin . p. 99 CLAY COLLUM Are you crazy , Stiles ? HARRY RICHARDSON Aside to CLAY . Myrtle 's telephoning . Lock the door ; she must n't hear this . CLAY goes back and locks MYRTLE in . REX VAN ZILE Horrified . Myrtle ! STILES Crossing to POLLY again . If you was to hear the stories they 're telling about you . They 're saying things I know you never done . Aroused . I 'm not going to let them go on . Starts off . I 'm going to tell them you 're a good woman . POLLY SHANNON Stopping him . Now without accent . Not that ! Stiles  --  anything but that ! STILES But ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mysteriously . Yes ; but no one must suspect it . STILES Not suspect it ? Did you say no one must suspect you are good ? POLLY SHANNON Yes , you see  --   --  Very mysteriously . There 's a rea  --   --  Breaks off , looks hopelessly at HARRY . MYRTLE has now begun to rattle on the inside of the door. p. 100 STILES Why ? But why ? POLLY SHANNON You  --  You would n't understand . Looks again at HARRY for help , MYRTLE raps on door . STILES Hearing the knocking . What 's that knocking ? HARRY RICHARDSON Making out to hear nothing . Knocking ? What knocking ? MYRTLE knocks again . STILES Why , that  --  do n't you hear it ? Begins to doubt his sensations more and more . HARRY RICHARDSON No . POLLY SHANNON Stiles , you must promise not to tell anyone . Pretend you do n't know who I am . HARRY RICHARDSON Impressively . Polly Shannon  --  the Polly Shannon you know  --  is dead . STILES Dead ? REX VAN ZILE That 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she 's dead . HARRY RICHARDSON You used to lay daisies on her tomb-stone . STILES Daisies ? p. 101 ALL Yes . STILES Well , if you say so , sir . But I hate to let ' em go on thinkin ' you 're bad . POLLY SHANNON But you will ? Oh , thank you . I 'll do as much for you , Stiles , any time I can . STILES Much obliged . Knocking . There 's that knocking again . Do n't you hear it now ? HARRY RICHARDSON Stiles , you 've been drinking . STILES I have n't ; not a drop . Dubiously , on again hearing knocking . Do n't you hear it ? CLAY COLLUM It 's in your mind , Stiles . HARRY RICHARDSON Yes , drink does that to you . CLAY COLLUM Do n't you see spots dancing in front of your eyes ? HARRY RICHARDSON Run along now , Stiles ; get out in the fresh air . STILES I wonder if I have been drinkin ' . Exits with just the suggestion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shave . POLLY SHANNON Oh , do you think he 'll tell ? Looking after him . REX goes up and unlocks door . MYRTLE appears , furious beyond words , revealing her unsuspected temper. p. 102 MYRTLE DAVIS What do you mean by locking me in that room , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE Myrtle ! HARRY RICHARDSON Why , were you inside ? MYRTLE DAVIS You heard me . I knocked till my knuckles were sore . Who played this stupid trick ? To CLAY . You ? Then to HARRY . You , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  no . MYRTLE DAVIS To REX . Or was it you ? Ca n't you find better use for your brains ? Or did you lock me in because you did n't want your respectable friends to see the way you were carrying on ? You 're a poor deluded fool ! Exits in back . REX stands gazing after her , CLAY stands in music room door . HARRY RICHARDSON Happily . The great scheme is working . POLLY SHANNON She 's started in to save you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLAY COLLUM You 're going to get her . Exits into music room . REX VAN ZILE Did n't she lose her temper when she came out of that room ! p. 103 POLLY SHANNON Sympathetically . You must n't feel badly about that , Mr. Van Zile . She 'll get over that if only you go and ask her forgiveness . REX VAN ZILE You really think so ? POLLY SHANNON Yes ; we women are all alike ; we love to forgive . REX VAN ZILE Hesitating . Perhaps you are right . HARRY RICHARDSON Has gone up to hallway looking after MYRTLE , comes down . She 's thinking it over . Slapping him on the back . She 's waiting for you , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Still hesitating . I ought n't to say too much to her  --  not at first , had I ? HARRY RICHARDSON No  --  only enough to let her feel she 's having an influence . REX VAN ZILE Ye-yes  --  did n't she lose her temper ! Exits rather reluctantly after MYRTLE . POLLY SHANNON As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to POLLY , who is standing thoughtfully . Well , what 's the matter , Polly ? p. 104 POLLY SHANNON Mr. Richardson , I 'm afraid I ca n't go through with this . HARRY RICHARDSON Why , you were wonderful . POLLY SHANNON But there 's something inside tells me I 'd better leave here right now  --  before it 's too late . HARRY RICHARDSON Leave Northampton ? POLLY SHANNON Yes . I seem all of a sudden to have lost my courage . HARRY RICHARDSON But you must n't lose your courage or Rex will lose Myrtle . Another day or two will see them tied together for life . POLLY SHANNON Slowly . I suppose Mr. Van Zile would feel very badly if I deserted him now . I would n't want that . HARRY RICHARDSON Of course , you would n't . But we 've got to work quick with Stiles on the job and uncle on the way . So come , I 'll take you over to your hotel and have your trunks sent over . POLLY SHANNON Crosses back of table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be getting used to all these pretty clothes and things . I 'll miss them terribly when I ca n't have them any more . HARRY RICHARDSON Nonsense ! Think of Paris . p. 105 POLLY SHANNON Oh , yes , Paris ! Funny how seeing Stiles again brought back East Gilead  --  father and mother  --  and all those girlish dreams . As she sees REX returning . But it was n't that that made me feel I ought to leave here . REX has entered and comes down subdued and silent . HARRY RICHARDSON Chuckling . Did you see her , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE Yes . HARRY RICHARDSON And she forgave you ? REX VAN ZILE She said she 'd think it over . HARRY RICHARDSON She will ! Come along , Polly . He goes out laughing . POLLY SHANNON Yes , you should be very happy , Mr. Van Zile . Pinning flowers in his coat . You should smile about it . Well , if you wo n't smile for Polly  --  With accent . Zen smile for Paulette . Just one leetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REX smiles . Zere !  --  zat ees better ! Au revoir , mon cher fianc . REX VAN ZILE Halting her . Polly . p. 106 POLLY SHANNON Like the maid , without accent . Yes , sir . REX VAN ZILE I think you 're a brick to do all this for me . You 're so sympathetic . POLLY SHANNON Oh , yes , sir . I understand how you feel . REX VAN ZILE Strange the way we first met . POLLY SHANNON Oh , yes , sir  --  I was singing . She starts to sing a few bars of same song as when he first met her . I 'm doing my best to help you win Miss Myrtle . REX VAN ZILE Thank you . POLLY SHANNON Good luck ! She goes out . REX stands looking after her , hands in pockets . He smiles broadly and shows he 's fallen in love with her. @x SCENE : Same as ACT Two . Late afternoon some days later . Curtain rises on empty stage . PARKER comes out of library and crosses off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag over shoulder . REX VAN ZILE Calls back . Polly ! Polly ! Nobody 's here ! POLLY , in a charming sport suit , enters with golf club ; REX places golf bag by stairs . POLLY SHANNON Not using accent . Ah ! it 's nice to get some place where I can talk without having to shrug and wave my arms  --  Goes into accent . And play I am ze French actress . REX VAN ZILE Is n't it wonderful the way everybody is falling over themselves to be nice to you ? POLLY SHANNON By staircase . We did n't allow for the alluring quality of wickedness . Half the married men in Northampton have told me their wives do n't understand them . I 'm afraid you 'll have a lot of trouble living down to your reputation after I 've left the house . REX VAN ZILE Leaning against railing , looking at her . I suppose you 're awfully keen to go to Paris and commence studying ? p. 108 POLLY SHANNON I 'll be doing the thing I 've always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  success . POLLY SHANNON And you 'll have yours  --  Myrtle . REX VAN ZILE Taking a brace . I 've been thinking a lot about Myrtle in the last few days . POLLY SHANNON Shyly . Why limit it ? REX VAN ZILE Close to POLLY , his elbow on railing . Do you know , Polly , I do n't honestly believe she 'd want me , if she knew the game we were playing . POLLY SHANNON Hands REX her golf club . But she never will know . REX VAN ZILE It does n't seem fair to her . I mean I ought n't to trick a girl into caring for me . POLLY SHANNON But Mr. Richardson told me that Miss Davis is just waiting to throw you the life-line . REX VAN ZILE That 's it . Look how disappointed she 'd be when she found I was n't a moral wreck ! Why , it  --  it 'd be like marrying under false pretenses . POLLY SHANNON I see . You want to go to her , make a frank confession , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ! No ! I do n't want to take any chances . What I mean is  --  telling her would n't be fair to you . POLLY SHANNON Is n't it a little late to be so sensitive ? REX VAN ZILE With a sickly laugh . Well , better late than never . POLLY SHANNON But if you wo n't tell her the truth about our scheme , and you wo n't marry her without telling her , what are you going to do ? REX VAN ZILE Cheerfully . It  --  it looks as if I 'd have to give her up , does n't it ? POLLY SHANNON Not knowing what to make of it . Give her up ? REX VAN ZILE Patting her hand . Do n't worry about me . " Men have died , " etc . You know that Shakespeare stuff . POLLY SHANNON You 're only nervous as the hour approaches . REX VAN ZILE I 'm nervous , all right . POLLY ascends slowly , turns to find REX looking at her . Enter MRS . VAN ZILE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've been waiting for you to come in. p. 110 POLLY SHANNON With accent again . You want zat I should go ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh , no , no . I have something I want to show Rex . Will you come ? REX VAN ZILE Certainly . Smiling . Did n't Paulette look wonderful at the concert last night ? MARTHA VAN ZILE Yes , yes ; quite wonderful . POLLY SHANNON I ought to ; eet took some time to do eet . Oh , Madame , I weesh zat you would really like me . MARTHA VAN ZILE Why , I do . Of course , I mean  --  Come , Rex  --   --  Starts to exit . STILES enters from porch , seeing Polly . STILES Oh , Miss Polly  --   --  POLLY SHANNON Motioning him . Ssh ! MARTHA VAN ZILE Not understanding . What ? MRS . VAN ZILE half hears this , but REX takes her off to cover the situation . POLLY SHANNON Seeing they have gone . You must be careful , Stiles . STILES Producing letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 111 POLLY SHANNON Oh , have you ? STILES What do you think ! Birdie Meech is married . POLLY SHANNON Really ? To Sammy Springer ? STILES Yes . Sammy 's mother died finally and gave Birdie her chance at last . Gosh , but things have changed at home . They 're holding the Straw-berry Festival in August this year , and they 're laying a water main down Center Avenue . POLLY SHANNON Going to foot of stairs . Do n't , Stiles ; you 're making me feel homesick and lonely . STILES Guess you 'll go back there some day and marry and settle down ? POLLY SHANNON No ; I 'm not that lonely . STILES You ought to have a husband . A woman naturally needs one of us to look up to . Ai n't you never been in love ? POLLY SHANNON Yes . STILES Then why do n't you get married ? POLLY SHANNON The man I care about loves another girl , Stiles . STILES Ca n't you cut her out ? POLLY SHANNON No . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STILES That 's tough . POLLY SHANNON I do n't know ; perhaps it 's the best way . If you put away your romance in lavender nothing can ever spoil it . And even if there is n't much to make you happy , there wo n't be much to make you sad . STILES I guess you 're right not to expect too much . I wish I had n't . MYRTLE enters from porch . MYRTLE DAVIS Oh , Stiles , have you seen Mr. Rex ? POLLY SHANNON With accent again . ' E go out wiz ' ees mama . MYRTLE DAVIS Coldly to her . Oh . To STILES . I hear you 've started drinking again , Stiles . STILES No , ma'am . I 've been taking a little something to keep the rheumatism away . A man needs a tonic this time of year . Exits off porch . MYRTLE DAVIS I hope you will not object , Miss Bady , if I take Rex away from you for a few minutes . POLLY SHANNON Only for a few minutes . MYRTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you can have him . POLLY SHANNON Eet sounds as if you thought I could not ' ave ' im always . p. 113 MYRTLE DAVIS Does it ? POLLY SHANNON If I lose ' im I lose my reputation . MYRTLE DAVIS Have you one ? POLLY SHANNON Mademoiselle , zere are two kinds of women : zose who win men  --  and zose who lose zem . Crossing up . MYRTLE DAVIS Bowing slightly . Indeed ! REX enters cheerfully ; but is flabbergasted on seeing MYRTLE . Ah , Rex , are you busy just now ? I 'd like you to drive over to the Clubhouse with me and go over the concert accounts . I 'm just going . POLLY SHANNON You ' ad better go , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Trying desperately to get out of it . I 'd like to , of course ; but I 've got an engagement to play tennis with Harry . Pulls out watch , looks at it , as MYRTLE turns away . Five-thirty was the time  --  blandly  --  and it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release you . REX VAN ZILE I should n't like to ask him ; his vacation is nearly up . POLLY SHANNON Oh , Mees Davis , I ' ave take up all ' is time . Enter HARRY from porch with tennis racquet , excitedly coming down. p. 114 HARRY RICHARDSON Hello ! Sees MYRTLE . Oh , good afternoon , Miss Davis . REX VAN ZILE Significantly . Harry , here I am . HARRY RICHARDSON Yes  --  there you are . POLLY SHANNON Reclining on chaise-longue . Mees Davis ' as been trin ' to get Rex to go to the Club wiz ' er , but ' e say ' e ' ave an engagement wiz you . REX tries to stop her . HARRY RICHARDSON With me ? Why , he has n't had an engagement with me since he met you . REX VAN ZILE Desperately . I remember now  --  it was Clay . Enter CLAY with tennis racquet . CLAY COLLUM What was Clay ? Throwing tennis racquet to HARRY , who catches it . REX VAN ZILE Eagerly . Are you ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tall glass and a palm leaf fan . MYRTLE DAVIS Well , Rex ? REX VAN ZILE Making further excuses . I 'm really afraid I ca n't go , Myrtle . Mother just told me that Uncle Prentice was coming down on the six-forty. p. 115 HARRY RICHARDSON Anxiously . To-night ? REX VAN ZILE Yes . MYRTLE DAVIS Splendid . We can drive down after-wards and meet him . REX VAN ZILE Oh  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON What 's the matter ? REX VAN ZILE Hand to head , pretending to be dizzy . The sun  --  the hot sun  --  dizzy . I feel funny . HARRY RICHARDSON You look it . REX VAN ZILE You know  --  I mean  --  Excuse me , please . MYRTLE DAVIS Coldly . I 'll be waiting for you in the car , Rex . REX VAN ZILE All right  --  oh  --  oh  --   --  Exits in back . HARRY RICHARDSON What 's the matter with him ? MYRTLE DAVIS Oh , Harry , please tell Rex I 'll be waiting for him . POLLY SHANNON Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ees coming . I can ' ardly wait to meet ' im . MYRTLE DAVIS Significantly . I do n't think you 'll be so enthusiastic when he gets here .  --  Do n't forget , Harry . Exits off porch. p. 116 HARRY RICHARDSON All now show they are upset . Great Scott ! Uncle coming here to-night ? POLLY SHANNON They 're moving up the heavy artillery . HARRY RICHARDSON Something must be done . Prentice Van Zile is a very different proposition from these Northampton people . He 's met a siren or two in his day . POLLY SHANNON I must meet uncle ? HARRY RICHARDSON You certainly must . Myrtle 's got to think you 're a real siren and you 've got to fool uncle until she and Rex are engaged , or the game is up . POLLY SHANNON That 's so . HARRY RICHARDSON You 'll have to convince him that , compared to your history , Sappho sounds like one of the Elsie books . Do you think that you can do it ? POLLY SHANNON Well , I 'll try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see why Rex hangs back so . CLAY COLLUM He 's only trying to register indifference . POLLY SHANNON He wants to drop the whole business . HARRY RICHARDSON What ? POLLY SHANNON He does n't want to trick her into loving him . p. 117 HARRY RICHARDSON Well , of all the  --   --  POLLY SHANNON Feels it is n't honest to impose on her . It 's fine of him . He 's a dear boy . HARRY RICHARDSON He 's a dear boob ! CLAY COLLUM Sitting down . Do you mean to say he 's going to renig after the way he urged us to help him ? HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , nonsense ; he 's a little bit diffident and backward just now . But we ca n't give up just when victory is in sight . CLAY COLLUM Looks off . I suppose it would take nerve to propose to Myrtle . HARRY RICHARDSON With quick determination . Yes ? Then you 'd better get your nerve up . CLAY COLLUM Why ? HARRY RICHARDSON Because you 've got to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARDSON You 've got to propose to Myrtle for Rex , right now . CLAY COLLUM Trying to escape . I do n't want to propose to Myrtle. p. 118 HARRY RICHARDSON It 's all right . I 'll help you . If Rex is once sure she cares for him , all his ridiculous scruples will vanish . POLLY SHANNON Somehow , I do n't know  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Turning . Well , do n't you want Rex to get tied up with Myrtle so you can leave ? POLLY SHANNON I want him to be happy . CLAY COLLUM Sh ! Myrtle 's coming back . HARRY RICHARDSON Eh  --  wait ! Is she coming in here ? Good . This will give us our chance to tell her that Rex loves her . To POLLY . You go put on your war-paint for uncle ; but if we can fix this between Rex and Myrtle I 'll get you away so you wo n't have to meet uncle . POLLY goes up stairs , and off as MYRTLE comes in . MYRTLE DAVIS I beg your pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY RICHARDSON Yes . He 'll be here in a moment . MYRTLE puts hat on sofa . Wo n't you sit down , Miss Davis . I have something very important to say to you . Indicates chair . CLAY COLLUM Stiffly . Yes ; so have I. p. 119 HARRY RICHARDSON It 's rather a delicate and private matter . CLAY COLLUM Would you prefer to have me go , Harry ? Starting for door . HARRY RICHARDSON Bitingly . No . No . I prefer to have you stay . CLAY COLLUM I was afraid you would . HARRY and CLAY bring down chairs and sit facing her . HARRY RICHARDSON Miss Davis , I do n't know if you 've ever thought very much about love . MYRTLE DAVIS Has looked from one to the other , very much perplexed . I beg pardon , Mr. Richardson . CLAY COLLUM Quickly . Of course , any girl with imagination has thought about love . HARRY RICHARDSON Coldly to CLAY . Pardon me . Are you going to ask Miss Davis or am I ? CLAY COLLUM As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You ! Excuse me . HARRY RICHARDSON Resuming eloquently . There are different sorts of love , Miss Davis : calf love , temporary fascination , deep passion , and the steady , slow-burning devotion that may comfortably illuminate a long stretch of life 's pathway ! p. 120 CLAY COLLUM Moving his chair towards HARRY a little . In the case of Miss Bady it is temporary fascination , while in the case of yourself  --   --  Catches HARRY 'S eye , breaks off , falters . HARRY RICHARDSON Sternly to him . Yes ? Go on . CLAY COLLUM Repeating the gesture of handing it to him . No . No . You . You tell her !  --  Pardon me . HARRY RICHARDSON Leaning close to her . Miss Davis , your plans have worked . MYRTLE DAVIS My plans ? HARRY RICHARDSON I mean your plans regarding Rex . MYRTLE DAVIS Oh , you 're talking about Rex ? CLAY COLLUM Your scheme of throwing them together so as to sicken him of her . HARRY RICHARDSON To put it plainly , he is tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! But are you sure ? HARRY RICHARDSON Absolutely . MYRTLE DAVIS You do n't mean you think his love for this woman is completely dead ? p. 121 HARRY RICHARDSON He never had any love for her . CLAY COLLUM No real love ! HARRY RICHARDSON He was dazzled ! CLAY COLLUM But he really loves someone else ! MYRTLE DAVIS Coldly . What ! Is there actually some new woman ? HARRY RICHARDSON No . It 's an old one . I mean  --   --  CLAY COLLUM He means you . Fanning himself with his handkerchief . MYRTLE DAVIS Me ? CLAY COLLUM Backing away after being annihilated by a glance from HARRY . I  --  I 'm afraid I 've blurted it out rather clumsily . HARRY RICHARDSON Sarcastically . Oh , no , not at all . Very gracefully done . CLAY repeats gesture of " you " but HARRY holds up hand , shaking head . No . No . You go on now . MYRTLE DAVIS Please go on . CLAY COLLUM Rex loves you with the slow-burning devotion Harry spoke of so eloquently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 122 HARRY RICHARDSON I should say not . Miss Davis , Rex 's whole life lies here in the hollow of your hand . It is for you to say whether stimulated , inspired , he shall make his way to a position of trust and honor , or , with hope removed , he shall plunge into an abyss of degradation and debauchery ! MYRTLE DAVIS Ecstatically . Oh , Mr. Richardson . CLAY COLLUM Rising , carried away . What a wonderful power ! A human destiny to do with as you will ! MYRTLE DAVIS Rising and crossing toward porch . But what can I do ? Rex seems to be making no effort to free himself . HARRY RICHARDSON Rising , quickly , same tone . Let him feel he has cause to hope for you , and he will shake off his lethargy . MYRTLE DAVIS Are you sure ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 'll guarantee it . MYRTLE DAVIS You think I can make him understand ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 'm sure you can . CLAY COLLUM Yes . HARRY RICHARDSON Make him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , you can lead him up to spiritual heights . p. 123 MYRTLE DAVIS Meditatively . Yes  --   --  Thinking ; boys put chairs back . Yes , you are right . It 's no time to think of pride ; it 's a question of duty . HARRY RICHARDSON Leading her to door . You go and wait in the car . I 'll find Rex and bring him to you . MYRTLE exits , the boys sink into chairs and burst out laughing as soon as she goes . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Splendid . We 've done it ! CLAY COLLUM She 's landed . HARRY RICHARDSON Rising . Yes , I think I know how to handle women . I 've made a study of them . CLAY COLLUM I must admit you 've engineered it magnificently . HARRY RICHARDSON It 's nothing , old boy . Perfectly easy if you understand love as I do . REX enters , smiling guiltily at his previous deception . REX VAN ZILE Hello , boys . I hope Myrtle did n't get tired waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . REX VAN ZILE What 's all right ? HARRY RICHARDSON To CLAY , both hardly able to talk because they are so tickled at what they have done . Shall I tell him ? p. 124 CLAY COLLUM Yes ; go on . HARRY RICHARDSON CLAY and HARRY slap REX on the back . We just proposed to Myrtle for you ! REX VAN ZILE Indignant . You did n't ! Why ! But surely ! You do n't mean ! HARRY RICHARDSON Embracing REX as he struggles to speak . No . No . Do n't try to thank me ! But if ever there should be twins in the Van Zile family  --  boys  --  Clay and Harry . Do n't forget , old boy . REX VAN ZILE Breaking away . You 've gone and told Myrtle that I love her ? HARRY RICHARDSON Of course , we have . REX VAN ZILE Flaring up for first time . What did you do that for ? Ca n't you mind your own business ? CLAY COLLUM What ! HARRY RICHARDSON Can you beat that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her himself . We 've destroyed all the romance of the proposal . REX VAN ZILE Now thoroughly aroused . I mean that there is no romance . I mean I 'm not going to propose . I mean I do n't love Myrtle. p. 125 CLAY COLLUM You do n't love her ? REX VAN ZILE No , I never loved her . CLAY COLLUM What ? Never loved her ? HARRY RICHARDSON Why , you used to moon around all day looking at Myrtle 's picture and sighing like a punctured tire . REX VAN ZILE That was n't real love . HARRY RICHARDSON No ? Well , you 've got damned high standards . REX VAN ZILE It 's all your fault . HARRY RICHARDSON Our fault ? REX VAN ZILE Trying to get me tied up to a girl with a temper like she 's got . CLAY COLLUM There 's gratitude for you ! REX VAN ZILE What did you want to keep on interfering for ? Always butting in and calling me helpless , just as I was planning to fix things with Uncle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix things . What are you going to say to Myrtle ? REX VAN ZILE Blandly , with a gesture offering them the problem . I 'm not going to explain anything to Myrtle . That 's up to you ! Exits in back , running and closing door after him. p. 126 HARRY RICHARDSON Chasing him . CLAY sinks on sofa . Well , if that 's not the absolute limit ! The next time a hopeless lover appeals to me , I 'll go out and help him find a tree and a bit of rope . CLAY COLLUM He does n't love Myrtle ! HARRY RICHARDSON I ca n't believe it even yet . CLAY COLLUM Sounds as if you do n't know quite so much about love as you thought you did . HARRY RICHARDSON I 'll have to go and tell Polly . You go and explain to Myrtle . CLAY COLLUM Rising , startled . Explain to Myrtle ? I guess not ! I 'm going to hold my head under the cold water tap . HARRY RICHARDSON Grabs him . No , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for a long drive . CLAY COLLUM But I do n't want a long drive with Myrtle . HARRY RICHARDSON You 've simply got to keep her away from Rex till  --   --  CLAY COLLUM But what am I going to say to her ? HARRY RICHARDSON I do n't care what you say to her . Tell her Rex does n't love her . p. 127 CLAY COLLUM Oh , no ! No . Never ! HARRY RICHARDSON Then tell her that you love her yourself  --  anything . Pushes CLAY out on porch , crosses and starts up stairs as UNCLE PRENTICE VAN ZILE enters in back . PRENTICE VAN ZILE is a charming , well-bred , middle-aged man of the world , who is quite sure of himself and his opinion of women . He is dressed in a very smart tailored suit . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Hello , Harry . HARRY RICHARDSON On stairs , blandly . Good evening , Mr. Van Zile . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Here , Harry . What are you hurrying upstairs for ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 'm not hurrying . PRENTICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARRY RICHARDSON I was just going to dress , that 's all . Coming down a step . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Let me have a minute of your valuable time . What 's all this they phoned me about Rex ? Now , look here , if Rex had to make a fool of himself , why did n't you persuade him to do it quietly ? HARRY RICHARDSON Comes down stairs to him . Me ? p. 128 PRENTICE VAN ZILE Well , it wo n't take me long to size her up . HARRY RICHARDSON I do n't think you ought to do anything rash until you see Rex . He said he wanted a chance to fix things ; here 's where he gets it . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , he does  --  does he ? Where is he ? Enter MRS . VAN ZILE . Hello , Martha . MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh , Prentice . I 'm so glad you 're here . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I was just going to send for Rex . MARTHA VAN ZILE Goes up and pushes button . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I did n't know things were as bad as she said , until those newspaper reporters dropped in this morning and asked me for the true story of the Bady pearls . HARRY RICHARDSON Great Scott ! Have the reporters come to you ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Smiling . Several of them thought that I was the merry little lamb who was about to be fleeced . MARTHA VAN ZILE I wish it were you . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Come , come , Martha . Do n't put such ideas into my young head . p. 129 MARTHA VAN ZILE I mean you 've had so much more experience than Rex . PRENTICE VAN ZILE That 's the only thing that worries me . A chap without experience comes an awful cropper when he does slip . Look at Adam . Sitting in chair . I suppose you 've tried arguing with Rex ? MARTHA VAN ZILE It 's no use , is it , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON Behind sofa . Not a bit . I 've tried it myself . PARKER enters . MARTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTICE VAN ZILE No , no , Martha ; I believe I 'd better see Miss Bady first . MARTHA VAN ZILE Then tell Miss Bady to come down . Say I sent for her . PARKER exits upstairs . PRENTICE VAN ZILE All this romantic nonsense about Royalties and Prime Ministers has taken hold of his imagination . A boy loves to be seen about with a lady who says she has a king or two in her past , eh , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON Wondering what 's going to happen next . Why  --  yes  --  yes . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Why , when I was Rex 's age I fell in love with a plump beauty in Nice , who told me she was an escaped wife of the Sultan of Turkey . p. 130 MARTHA VAN ZILE At least you did n't want to marry her . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , did n't I ? But I found out just in time that she was a snake charmer from the Jardin de Plaisir ! She did n't have so good a press agent as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Miss Bady has a pretty good press agent , eh ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE And that story that Miss Bady was the woman for whom Petrowski killed himself  --  was  --   --  HARRY RICHARDSON Flabbergasted . Petrowski ? You do n't mean to say that story has reached New York ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Rising and taking paper out of pocket . Reached New York ? Why , it pushed the President 's Message off the first page of the Evening Post . HARRY reads it with horror at the thought . MARTHA VAN ZILE Terrible ! Then , Prentice , you simply must get rid of Miss Bady before the reporters start flocking here . PRENTICE VAN ZILE They 'll be flocking here , all right . POLLY has now appeared at head of stairs , gorgeously dressed . She overhears the following , but is not seen by UNCLE and MRS . VAN ZILE as she comes down the stairs . I do n't believe she ever saw Vladimir Petrowski. p. 131 POLLY SHANNON With a sigh . Oh , mon pauvre Petrowski ! They turn and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her appearance . MRS . VAN ZILE observes effect on UNCLE . HARRY is looking for an opportunity to speak aside to POLLY . HARRY RICHARDSON Miss Bady , may I present Mr. Prentice Van Zile , Rex 's uncle . POLLY SHANNON Holding out her hand and playing in her most alluring manner at UNCLE . ' Ow do you do ? I am sorry I am remind of poor Vladimir at zis time . Eet always make me triste  --  sad . Ah  --  and I would ' ave my smile very bright for you . She smiles up into his face ; he shows he is impressed , but recovers quickly . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Crossing to MRS . VAN ZILE . Perhaps , Martha , if you do n't mind  --   --  Turning in time to prevent HARRY from warning POLLY . MARTHA VAN ZILE Anxiously . Do you think I 'd better leave you alone with her ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Looks at POLLY . I 'd like to have a quiet little heart-to-heart talk with Miss Bady. p. 132 POLLY SHANNON Coquettishly . ' Eart-to-'eart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA VAN ZILE Starting up and coming down again . Do be careful , Prentice . Goes up shocked , exits . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Harry , I do n't want to drive you out of here , but I think I understand Miss Bady better than the rest of you . POLLY SHANNON Naughty boy ! UNCLE waves POLLY aside again . HARRY RICHARDSON Unable to speak aside to her , he walks around POLLY singing , hands in pockets , gazing before him in feigned absorption . We 're all mixed up , But play the game , I 'll see you then , I 'll send him , too , He will explain  --   --  Repeating till he circles about to back door . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Are you ill ? HARRY RICHARDSON I 've become so musical . Sing all the time . It 's Clay 's new composition . Singing . POLLY nods to him , shows she understands . Up and away , my love , Make ready for flight ; Up and away  --   --  HARRY exits singing. p. 133 PRENTICE VAN ZILE Goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , he comes to her , eyeing her . Now , Miss Bady . POLLY SHANNON Toying with fan , coquettishly . At last I see where Rex ' e got ' ees beautiful smile and ze nose  --  ' e ' ave ze Van Zeele nose . Leaning towards him . Such a ' andsome boy , n'est-ce pas ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE No , no , none of that . That wo n't do . I admit you 're very charming and it may have worked before  --   --  POLLY SHANNON Oh , I want to forget my past  --  to leave it behind . PRENTICE VAN ZILE But I suppose it 's so rapid it catches up with you . She nods . Sarcastically . Poor girl ! POLLY SHANNON Quickly . Oh , you are so sympazetic . You ' ave such a winning way wiz women . PRENTICE VAN ZILE It 's cost me a lot of money at times . POLLY SHANNON Brightly . Oh , you are what ze Americans call a good zing  --  ah ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Limits ? What limits ? I know no limit . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Well , had n't you better sit down ? POLLY SHANNON Eef eet weel make you feel more comfortable . She sits on sofa . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Gets chair and sits near her . The only thing I do n't understand is , why you choose Rex for your latest victim ? With the hand you 've dealt yourself , you ought to be playing for higher stakes . POLLY SHANNON You zink I live only for ze money ? I am not really weecked . PRENTICE VAN ZILE But you would n't be much at home in a Sunday-school , would you ? POLLY SHANNON No ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE No ! You realize Rex is heir to all this . And Van Zile  --  there is n't a finer name in the country . POLLY SHANNON Madame Rex Van Zeele . Yes , eet weel sound respectable . PRENTICE VAN ZILE If you really loved him and wanted to marry and settle down , you would n't have let all your sensational past performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wise for that . POLLY SHANNON Do you mean because of these newspaper stories you weel try to stop me from marrying Rex ? p. 135 PRENTICE VAN ZILE I believe in the same international policy as George Washington . POLLY SHANNON Yes ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE No entangling alliances . POLLY SHANNON But ' e seem very glad when ze French came to ' elp ' im fight . Vous n'avez pas lu l'histoire de ma patrie , La Belle France ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Mm  --  I do n't think the prospect of marrying him would be quite so pleasant if you knew that it meant to live in a small flat in New York and cook a man 's dinner . POLLY SHANNON Smiling at what it recalls . Oh , but you are funny . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes , I imagine you 'd be funny talking down the dumb-waiter to the iceman . POLLY SHANNON Calling over back of chair . " ' Allo  --  yes  --  yes  --  yes . Twenty pounds . Zat ees right . A leetle ' ighair , please ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some experience ? POLLY SHANNON Mais oui ! I ' ave know icemen an ' coal-men  --  an ' all sorts of men . I am , what you call , a man 's woman , eh ? Showing her ankle , which he discreetly admires. p. 136 PRENTICE VAN ZILE Drawing back his chair . I have n't the slightest doubt about it . But I think you understand what I mean . POLLY SHANNON Oui . You are very easy to see through . Crossing , fixing her slipper at stairway . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Look here , how much do you want to quit without fireworks ? POLLY SHANNON You are offering me money to give up Rex ? Laughs . PRENTICE VAN ZILE There 's only one language you ladies understand , and I 've brought the dictionary with me . He takes out check book and crosses to table . She gives a look around as though wondering when REX is coming . I was hoping I would n't have to consult it ; but I think I owe you an apology . I 'll confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were true . I thought you were probably a little schemer with a large imagination . POLLY SHANNON Hurt tone . Oh , Monsieur ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Quickly . It 's all right . Do n't feel hurt . I apologize . You 've convinced me you 're no Jitney Jezebel ! Shakes his head. p. 137 POLLY SHANNON Yes ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , no . POLLY SHANNON No ? Both laughing for different reasons . PRENTICE VAN ZILE And so I am willing to pay accordingly . I 'll give you ten thousand dollars . POLLY SHANNON Overcome . What ! What deed you say ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Gallantly . No one will lose anything by this transaction but me . And I consider it an honor to be included in the distinguished company of your victims . POLLY SHANNON No , no . I can not take eet . You do n't know what love ees . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , do n't I ? I could write a book about it . POLLY SHANNON Yes ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes . Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE You wo n't take fifteen ? POLLY SHANNON No . You are insulting me . PRENTICE VAN ZILE How much do you want ? Suppose we say twenty-five . I 'm no piker ! And it must cost money to live up to those pearls . Takes out fountain pen. p. 138 POLLY SHANNON No  --  non ! I do not want ze money . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I see . You still think there 's more in it if you could marry him . POLLY SHANNON Eef I could marry ' im  --  perhaps . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Let me give you some fatherly advice . POLLY SHANNON Yes ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes  --  fatherly ! A month ago Rex was writing love sonnets to Myrtle Davis . And then you came down with your frills and feathers , and he fell for you . But he does n't love you ; he ca n't , no matter how much he says it . I suppose he felt sorry for you  --  all alone in the world . Seriously . But once you pack your trunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl his mother wants him to marry , the girl in his own set , the girl he really loves . And he 'll forget all about you . POLLY SHANNON With hidden significance . Perhaps you are right . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I 'm sure I 'm right . And if you take this check and show him what you 're really after , he 'll want to forget you . And that 's the best way out for you and Rex . There  --  I 've made it out to " Cash . " He holds it out to her , she refuses to take it , he folds it in his pocket . Think it over . p. 139 POLLY SHANNON I weel zink eet ovair . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Good . Enter REX . Hello , Rex . REX VAN ZILE Hello , uncle . I 'm glad you 're here . There 's something I want to discuss with you . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I think Miss Bady has something she wants to say to you first . I find her a most reasonable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make your farewells as brief as possible . REX VAN ZILE Farewells ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes . And I suggest an exchange of letters , if either of you have been foolish enough to write any . Taking REX a few steps with him . Well , lad , how did you do it ? You 're more of a boy than I thought you were . Exits in back . REX VAN ZILE Not having understood . What did he mean about farewell ? POLLY SHANNON Without accent now . It means the siren is peacefully disposed of , and now I must go away from Northampton . REX VAN ZILE You 're not leaving now ? POLLY SHANNON Yes . Mr. Harry said I should make ready for flight . I did n't understand what he meant ; but if it 's all right between you and Miss Davis  --  send me a piece of your wedding cake when I 'm in Paris , will you , Rex ? p. 140 REX VAN ZILE I have n't seen her . POLLY SHANNON Then she has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saved . Yes , I do . I want you to save me . Save me from Myrtle . POLLY SHANNON Rex , but do n't you love her ? REX VAN ZILE No  --  I love you ! POLLY SHANNON Astonishment . Love me ! REX VAN ZILE I know now what love is . It 's having a pal , a comrade , and that 's what you are . I love you . POLLY SHANNON Incredulously . Why  --  we did all this to get Miss Davis for you and you 've kept on playing up  --   --  REX VAN ZILE I kept on playing up because " Playing up " meant being near you . POLLY SHANNON Ah , yes , being near me . Recalling . But once I pack my trunk and leave , in less than three weeks , you 'll be writing love sonnets to some other girl in your own set . REX VAN ZILE No , no , I love you . POLLY SHANNON You do n't love me  --  Polly ; it 's Paulette you love . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cap and apron ; but you never noticed me then . Now you see me in this . It was Paulette you first smiled on . p. 141 REX VAN ZILE It 's not Paulette , it 's you , Polly . Wo n't you try and love me , Polly ? Wo n't you marry me ? POLLY SHANNON Bewildered . But I 'm  --  I 'm a notorious woman . REX VAN ZILE Nonsense ! POLLY SHANNON Holding him back . No  --  no  --  listen , Boy . Think  --  think what you 're doing . When I came down here I thought I 'd never see any of these people again . I thought Paulette would just dis-appear and I 'd go back to being myself and no one would know . But now , do you think your mother and her friends would accept me as your wife ? REX VAN ZILE You 're as good as they are . POLLY SHANNON Yes , I know . But , no , no ; it ca n't be , Rex . It 's just a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a passing fancy . If you care for me , nothing else matters . You 're going to love me , Polly . You 're going to marry me . POLLY SHANNON Am I ? Enter MRS . VAN ZILE followed by UNCLE . MARTHA VAN ZILE Rex ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Are you two still at it ? I 'm glad you 've decided to go away . p. 142 REX VAN ZILE She is n't . She 's going to stay here and marry me . MARTHA VAN ZILE Rex ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Turning to POLLY . So you 're not going to follow my advice , Miss Bady ? REX VAN ZILE Before POLLY can answer . That 's it . She is n't Miss Bady . There is no such person as Paulette Bady . She 's not an adventuress . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Dryly . No ? Who is she ? REX VAN ZILE She 's a minister 's daughter ! ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , my G  --   --  ! Going up in back and pushing open glass doors . POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE It 's true . It 's been all a game . She is n't a bad woman at all . PRENTICE VAN ZILE With a wave of his hand to REX . You poor fool ! REX VAN ZILE Yes , I 've been a fool  --  an awful fool . But she understands  --  and she 's going to forget my past . MARTHA VAN ZILE Forget his past ! Is that what he said ? p. 143 PRENTICE VAN ZILE Sarcastically throughout . Yes , that 's what he said . Has she explained about Petrowski 's suicide ? REX VAN ZILE That was just a joke . MARTHA VAN ZILE A joke ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes , Martha ; a very good joke  --  on Petrowski . REX VAN ZILE Petrowski 's suicide was just a part of the plan to save me . MARTHA VAN ZILE Petrowski committed suicide to save you ? REX VAN ZILE Petrowski was just one part of it . The king and the pearls and the Prime Minister of Uruguay  --  it was all done for me ! MARTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king 's pearls . REX VAN ZILE The king 's pearls . I 'm the king ! ! MARTHA VAN ZILE I think I must be losing my mind . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Losing his patience . I do n't know what you 're trying to do , but  --   --  REX VAN ZILE Interrupting him . I 'm trying to show you Miss Bady is n't Miss Bady . She 's Polly Shannon ; and I can prove it . p. 144 PRENTICE VAN ZILE It would n't make any difference to me if you prove her to be little Eva . Crossing . A woman who has shouldered such a past as hers ca n't be respectable . REX VAN ZILE That is n't true . MARTHA VAN ZILE You ca n't expect me to introduce her as my daughter-in-law , can you ? REX VAN ZILE All right , if that 's the way you feel about it , I promise you wo n't be troubled with either of us . I can work and , thank God , Polly can cook . MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done . You 've come between me and my boy . REX VAN ZILE Now , mother  --   --  MARTHA VAN ZILE And I had such hopes for him . HARRY enters . REX VAN ZILE You really think Myrtle cares for me , mother ? MARTHA VAN ZILE At least I thought you 'd marry a girl of your own class . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Besides , remember you 're a Van Zile . REX VAN ZILE I love her and I wo n't give her up . HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , that 's it . You love her ! p. 145 REX VAN ZILE Yes . Could n't you see it from the start ? HARRY RICHARDSON Swallowing hard . Oh , yes  --  yes . MARTHA VAN ZILE Oh , Harry ! PRENTICE VAN ZILE Taking check from pocket and holding it out . Mademoiselle Bady  --   --  POLLY looks at him . Do n't you think you 'd better reconsider ? POLLY SHANNON Oui , Monsieur . You are right . Crosses to him and takes check . REX VAN ZILE But  --   --  POLLY SHANNON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I ruin so many men  --  hein ? Non  --  non  --  mon petit , I am not going to ruin you .

Au revoir , Madame  --  au revoir , mon cher fianc  --   --  Turning to UNCLE and in a very low tone . Au revoir , you vairy clevair man , who knows so much about women . Exits quietly up stairs . MARTHA VAN ZILE Touched . Oh , Prentice , we 've been too harsh . PRENTICE VAN ZILE A beautiful grand-stand play , Martha . HARRY RICHARDSON Laughing . Ah , this is too good . This is the best ever . So she fooled you out of twenty-five thousand dollars ! Roars . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , no ; she did n't fool me . She 'll want it back before she leaves . Goes to HARRY , intending to take check from him . In the meantime , you 'd better let me keep it . p. 147 HARRY RICHARDSON Oh , no ; she gave it to the Life Savers , and I 'm the new treasurer . Puts check in pocket . REX VAN ZILE Harry , tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to explain . REX VAN ZILE I 've tried to make them understand , but they wo n't believe me . HARRY RICHARDSON Did you tell them she was Polly Shannon ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Yes ,  --  he 's told me . HARRY RICHARDSON Well , she is . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Oh , so he 's got you fixed , too ? HARRY RICHARDSON But , Mr. Van Zile , you said yourself you did n't believe Miss Bady was the spectacular adventures the papers described . Well , you were right . MARTHA VAN ZILE What ? PRENTICE VAN ZILE Very clever . But , unfortunately , Miss Bady herself has convinced me I was not right . HARRY RICHARDSON We got her down here to pretend to entrap Rex . MARTHA VAN ZILE What for ? HARRY RICHARDSON Well , it was this way  --   --  STILES enters in back with bag. p. 148 STILES Mr. Van Zile 's bag . HARRY RICHARDSON Wait !  --  Stiles !  --  Stiles ! STILES What is it ? REX VAN ZILE Of course , Stiles ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stiles knew her in Ohio . He 's known her ever since she was a child . Now , Stiles , tell the truth . You knew a girl named Polly Shannon back in East Gilead , did n't you ? STILES Ma'am ? HARRY RICHARDSON I say , you knew a girl in East Gilead named Polly Shannon . STILES Yes , ma'am . She 's dead ! HARRY RICHARDSON  --  Coming down beside STILES . No  --  no . Stiles , we want the truth . STILES That 's what he 's getting . I could n't tell a lie . I do n't know how . Polly Shannon is dead . I used to go and lay daisies on her tombstone . Exits through porch . PRENTICE VAN ZILE Laughs at boys . You chaps ought to have rehearsed that fellow . HARRY RICHARDSON We did . Now , if you sit down quietly and listen to me  --   --  p. 149 REX VAN ZILE Never mind , Harry . If Polly 's going , I 'm going , too . Starts up . PRENTICE VAN ZILE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to get a job . He goes out . MARTHA VAN ZILE Do n't let him go , Prentice . I ca n't bear it . PRENTICE VAN ZILE I ca n't afford to lose a set of Van Zile brains , even if they are addled . HARRY RICHARDSON Starting to explain , at door beside UNCLE . Listen . Three weeks ago this girl was a maid employed by Clay and me . She wanted to have her voice trained . She was broke  --   --  PRENTICE VAN ZILE So that 's your story . That 's even better than Rex 's . Exits after REX . HARRY comes down , PARKER has passed UNCLE in hall and comes in . MARTHA VAN ZILE Harry , what are we to do ? PARKER Mrs. Van Zile , a gentleman is outside asking for Miss Bady . MARTHA VAN ZILE A reporter ! I knew it ! Oh ! HARRY RICHARDSON Yes , this is the first of them . p. 150 MARTHA VAN ZILE Will you talk to him , Harry ? HARRY RICHARDSON Certainly . Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN ZILE I 'm not equal to it , really . Tell him Miss Bady ca n't see him . You 're so good at explaining things . I must get some air . Exits out on porch . HARRY RICHARDSON I think I 'll get some air , too . CLAY enters from porch , drops on sofa exhausted . CLAY COLLUM That was a nice job you gave me . HARRY RICHARDSON Did you explain it to Myrtle ? CLAY COLLUM I drove around and around till the gas gave out . HARRY RICHARDSON I do n't care what you said , but did she believe you ? CLAY COLLUM No  --  not a word . HARRY RICHARDSON What 's the matter with you ? Could n't you make her understand ? CLAY COLLUM No . But after dinner she 's coming over to have you explain . HARRY RICHARDSON But did n't you even tell her that Rex really loves Polly ? p. 151 CLAY COLLUM No  --  does he ? HARRY RICHARDSON Yes . Go back and tell her that . CLAY COLLUM Never again . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a foreigner , of distinguished appearance . He speaks with an accent . PETROWSKI Excuse me , I want to see the woman for whom Petrowski killed himself . HARRY RICHARDSON Wait a moment . To CLAY . A reporter . PETROWSKI I must see dis Miss Bady at once . My time it iss worth very much . HARRY RICHARDSON Miss Bady has n't time to talk to reporters , now . PETROWSKI I am not a reporter . HARRY RICHARDSON You 're not ? Then who the devil are you ? PETROWSKI I am Petrowski . CLAY COLLUM What ? HARRY RICHARDSON Equally astonished . Once more , please . CLAY COLLUM You ca n't be . Petrowski 's dead ! PETROWSKI I am Vladimir Petrowski , undt I haf come to see the woman for who I kill meinself. p. 152 HARRY RICHARDSON Bewildered . Mr. Petrowski , if you were n't dead , where have you been all these weeks ? PETROWSKI I go away to escape from all the vimmin . CLAY COLLUM Why ? PETROWSKI I have to be alone .

HARRY RICHARDSON I did n't know you had a wife . PETROWSKI I tell you I know I have a wife . She has not yet stopped talking . Excited . Undt you must make me to understand why Miss Bady goes about saying I kill meinself for luf of her . p. 153 HARRY AND CLAY Trying to explain . It was very simple . Well , you see , Mr. Petrowski . I 'll explain it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off  --  pause . PETROWSKI I understand . You think you can advertise her name by maligning mine . Explosively . But I will make trouble . I will sue . I will have you arrested for slander . HARRY RICHARDSON This speech of his suggests an idea to HARRY , which he grasps quickly as a way out of the difficulty . It was not done for Miss Bady , Mr. Petrowski . It was all done for your sake . PETROWSKI Astonished . For my sake ? What do you mean ? Eagerly . Go on . HARRY RICHARDSON Slowly at first , then quite glibly to CLAY 'S astonishment and then to his admiration . Mr. Petrowski , to your most ardent admirers  --  of which I am one  --  it has always seemed a crying shame that you had not received larger rewards . So , when the story of your disappearance came , the thought struck us that we might inaugurate the most magnificent press campaign that any artist has ever had . p. 154 CLAY COLLUM Entering into the spirit of it . We felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes  --   --  CLAY COLLUM All through the long , anxious weeks our faith in that never wavered . HARRY RICHARDSON Dramatically . Mr. Petrowski , we are making you the most talked-of man in America ! Your face and story will be known in every city , town and village in the country ! The story that jumped into the headlines of the papers will sweep over Canada , Europe , South America ! CLAY COLLUM And then around the world ! HARRY RICHARDSON You will be hailed by the multitude , as you are now by the elect , as Petrowski , the world 's greatest pianist ! PETROWSKI Gasping . It  --  it  --  it beats the Dutch ! HARRY RICHARDSON Quickly . That was my intention ! POLLY enters , dressed simply for traveling ; she carries her little handbag . PETROWSKI Realizing . Ah , you are right ! Eagerly .
