BEGIN at last to appredate the fact of the Southern Confecteracy , and that I am in and of it ? though , as I look around upon this beautiful city , I hope it may escape its share of the consequences . Already , however , there is some talk of making it the capital , and a large party is in favor of it , while the residents of the city make strong objections , some fearing one thing , some another , dreading the influx of " people no one knows , " while outside barbarians hint that a little piquant demoralization is the one thing needed to make Richmond society perfect . Just now , adorned with the " pomp , pride , and circumstance " of war , without its honors , it is one of the most attractive places I have ever seen . Col. Robert E. Lee is here in command of the state forces , looking calm and cool , but much more grave than I have ever seen him , and has already impressed himself upon people as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of Virginia 's distinguished sons from whom much is expected ; with the dashing Colonel Magruder , who accepts the war as philosophically as he does everything else , and will undoubtedly win renown . Already he is at work with his accustomed energy and will speak in loud tones when next heard from . I see a great deal of Mrs. Johnston , our conversations ranging from grave to gay , from lively to severe , in the most Impartial manner . She is altogether the most agreeable woman I have ever met . To-day a Marylander and an old friend of my husband 's came to see me , and , in the most delicate manner , begged that I would call upon him for any pecuniary assistance I mighti need before the return of E. the writer s husband . This relieves me much , as , owing to the United States Government refusing to give E.in the Confederacy MRS . EUGENE MCLEAN the pay that was due him . T arrived here with only ten dollars . Since that was an inadequate sum to commence life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means to invest in lemonades and sherry-cobblers for the benefit of myself and friends . The Northern papers received to-day are filled with details of warlike preparations , broken roads , and burned bridges , all of which makes me feel quite uneasy about E. , nor do I at all fancy the pos-sible contingency of being launched on the revolutionary stream in my own frail hark , without rudder , without anchor , and without convoy . R ICHMOND . I have passed the last three days in walking , driving , visiting . Troops are hurrying in from all directions , and as rapidly hurrying away again , though it is not proper to ask why or wherefore , and I suppose none but spies and officers in command have any accurate information . Conversation turns on " strategic points , " " bases of operations , " " lines of defense , " and glorious plans for the capture of Washington City , while men of all ages and sizes are " deploying " about the hotels and " skirmishing " up and down the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill-ground for a South Carolina company , and it is one of my occupations to see how naturally these polka-dancing young men take to the " double-quick . " This company represents the flower of South Carolina chivalry , and numbers in its ranks Prestons , Hamptons , Mannings , Rublidges , Middletons , etc. , certainly a very handsome body of men , though my old associations will forever prevent my comprehending or appreciating the status of these high privates . Last evening a Sergeant Somebody was introduced , and I received him with that sort of mental " gulp " with which I receive everything nowadays ; but I soon discovered that he wanted only ten minutes ' start to prove himself a most charming man , with a fund of conversation that never once trenched on war or politics . It seems a great waste of material to put such men in the ranks , but it 's encouraging to know that they are willing to go ; and indeed there is no sacrifice ? whether of life , money , tastes , habits , or associations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned yesterday after encountering annoyances of all kinds , but feels himself quite fortunate in running the gantlet wit bout serious detention . He describes the same scenes that we are surrounded bv , and says the Northern people are in earnest , but feel quite secure behind their seventy-five thousand volunteers and the Seventh New York regiment . The wise ones here predict that Mr. Lincoln will have to treble and quadruple his call before long , and we hear that General Scott is of the same opinion , and is consequently looked upon as an old fogy by the " Veni , Gidi , eici " kind . E. has decided to offer his services to the Confederacy , though many of his friends advise him to take an appointment under the " Sic temper tyrannis . " If one must be in a revolution , I think , myself , that the center is more desirable than the circumference . I shall write you from our new capital , if I 'm not completely demoralized in passing through the Cotton States . Till then , good-by . MONTGOMERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlivened only by military manoeuvers of awkward squads and patriotic speeches in every town , large and small , we arrived here about dark , and without warning were ushered into the crowded parlor of the Exchange Hotel . There sat all the world and his wife , in full evening toilette , and before I could make my escape I was recognized through the incog. of a thin brown veil and several layers of dust . We afterward ascertained that the house was so full that every available spot was covered with cots , and nothing of the reception-room left but the name over the door . Accordingly , E. left me to seek accommodations , and my observations led me to the conclusion that , though the scene was changed , the actors were not . I had not more than time to take a general survey of the small fry before E. came in with Major B. , to say that he had secured a room at the Washington Hall , of which we took immediate possession , and in which I am now writing as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will permit . Yesterday I drove over the town with Mrs. Jefferson Davis , and was delighted with our new capital . There are some beautiful residences , with flower-gardens attached , while the State Capitol , in which the Confederate Congress holds its sessions , is a most imposing-looking building , situated on a hill which commands a view of the whole town . The Congress is known as the Provisional , " and is said to be acting with great unanimity , passing laws every day without the excitement of a shadow of opposition . The uniform of the Confederacy is to be gray , with insignia of rank on the collar and sleeves . The ornaments are well enough , but I fancy a whole army in gray will look lugubrious . The flag is very much like the United States flag ? the same colors ; with the blue field and white stars ; but , instead of the stripes , three bars of red . At the President 's I saw a very poetical one made of flowers and sent to Mrs. Davis by the The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white roses , the blue field was larkspur , and the stars white jasmine , so ingeniously woven together that it could be handled without falling in pieces . Many persons object to the Confederate flag because it is so like the Union one . I like it for that very reason , though it can never recall as many pleasant associations , whatever it may become in the future . The President occupies a very pretty cottage in about the center of the town , and there Mrs. Davis has her weekly receptions , at one of which I was present yesterday . I saw little to distinguish it from ante-revolutionary gatherings . No homespuns as yet , though the more enthusiastic talk of adopting them , and I suppose they will when everything becoming is exhausted . The atmosphere of Montgomery is certainly much less warlike than that of Richmond , or any other place I have been in , nor do people seem to be half so much in earnest , while it is said the Government itself is not making the most strenuous exertions to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending to Europe for arms and ammunition , but an official said the other day that the Government intended to take them from its enemies . Yesterday E. mustered into service a regiment of fine-looking men , said to represent fabulous wealth , as the best and wealthiest men are going into the ranks . It makes me sad to see them , and I can not help believing ? in that little corner of my brain which ought to be paralyzed for the present ? that those who arc left will find little difficulty in counting their fortunes by the time the war is over . Mrs. Davis has made herself somewhat unpopular by saving openly that she has no personal feeling against her Northern friends , of whom she likes to talk , and takes great interest in their welfare . It is almost a pity she says so much , as there are always some who are willing to use it to her disadvantage , for already jealousies have crept into our model republic , and some , of old standing , have been imported with congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHMOND How shall I describe the events of the last ten days , or give you any idea of the feeling by which I have been agitated ? It seems as if ten years had rolled over my head , and that the scenes of suffering I have witnessed had burned themselves into my heart , withering every association of the past and every hope of the future . We have talked of battles , and said that they were fought here and there , or would he , but the 21st of July , 1861 , made us realize for the first time what war means . The day dawned quietly , calmly , beautifully . Although we knew Mr. Davis had gone to Manassas Junction , we never suspected the object , but enjoyed the day as one of rest , few of us even going to church . Nor was there anything to disturb the calm , except the sad duty of attending the funeral of a friend 's child at five o'clock in the afternoon . 1 remarked to Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Johnston , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked excited and I thought there must be some news , but they laughed at my nervous fancies , and I was somewhat reassured by Mrs. D. saying that we would certainly know if there was any news of importance . However , upon our return , I again remarked the same anxious expression on every countenance , and , more to convince me of my error than anything else , Mrs. D. asked a gentleman who was passing if there was any news . " Yes , madam , " he replied , " they have been fighting at Manassas since six o'clock this morning . " I do not know how we got into the hotel , but when there we were met by the ladies , who had just received the same information , and were perfectly beside themselves with terror and anxiety . There were ten of us whose husbands were known to be on that field , while all the others had sons , brothers , or some near relation , and one poor lady 's family was represented by her husband , two sons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this suspense before we received a private telegram from Mr. Davis with a list of officers killed and wounded , which , while it relieved most of us , brought a crowning sorrow to Mrs. Barstow . Fortunately she was not in the room when it was read , and we were enabled to defer until the next day a communication which no one felt willing to convey . So we retired to our rooms with grateful hearts , though death ca me too near For us to feel any elation at Mr. Davis 's other telegrams , which announced to the people victory , in these words : " We have won a glorious , though dearly bought victory . Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued . " The next day was one of clouds and darkness , with a pouring rain which disturbed the working of the wires . For nearly twenty-four hours we were without another word from Manassas , and no one would have imagined Richmond to be the capital of a victorious people . It seemed as if a pall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other as they waited to learn with what price victory was bought . Every family its ts representative with the army , and the women who had talked so freely of their willingness to sacrifice them were bowed down to the dust , fearing they might be called upon . Among ourselves , with that poor stricken woman in the midst of us , there could be nothing like rejoicing , and one of our number , coming out of her room , said , " God help us if this is what we have prayed for ! " The day wore on , and it was not until late at night that telegrams began coming in , each one bearing its message of joy or sorrow ; but by the morning of Tuesday , which opened brightly , the Richmond people began to look up . There was more of good news than bad for them , and by the time Mr. Davis had returned and had addressed them in one of his stirring speeches they were almost wild with enthusiasm . To me , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brightest ? when Mr. Davis had returned , and the parlors were illuminated , and friends were congratulating one another , and the street in front of the house was crowded with a multitude cheering for " the President , " " the Confederacy , " " the Generals , " and " the Army " ; while , like a passage in the minor key in some brilliant piece of music , I heard at a ' distance the " Dead March , " and knew that the bodies of General Barstow and General Bee were being escorted to the State Capitol . I left the parlor feeling that , let war bring what it would , I should always hear the accompaniment of that sad note . The next day the bodies lay in state in the Senate Room , where they were visited by hundreds . Eloquent eulogies were pronounced by their personal friends , and the determination to avenge them recorded on high . The trains also began to bring in the wounded . Richmond threw open the doors of its private houses , and ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of blood devoted all their time to dressing wounds and caring for the sick . On the fourth day after the battle Mrs. Johnston and I , hearing of a good opportunity to go to Manassas , procured the necessary permission from the Secretary of War , and , without listening to any remonstrances , took the early morning train . On the way we met the train containing Union prisoners , but they seemed to enjoy their situation so much , laughing and singing , and were such a horrible-looking set , that we felt it would be going quite out of our way to sympathize with them , tacitly agreeing to look on them as so many curiosities . Upon our arrival at the Junction we were met by General Johnston and several officers of his staff ; who conducted us in safety through the scene of confusion that surrounded the depot . There were congregated the sick , the well , and the wounded , Unionists and Disunionists , conquerors and conquered , people who had just found their friends , and others , alas ! who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world , while surgeons and hospital attendants were either placing those of the wounded who could be moved into the return train , or anxiously looking for the medicines and little comforts that were expected from Richmond . By some strange carelessness or oversight the medical department found itself , after the battle , deficient in the very articles it most needed , and many a poor wretch lay there groaning when a little morphine would have relieved him . We were successfully pushed and piloted into the carriage that stood in waiting , and soon reached the headquarters , a small farm-house with nothing to distinguish it but its temporary occupants . Almost the first things we saw were the captured cannon , and the first thing we heard was an account of the thirty thousand handcuffs that had been taken . This hinted at such an uncomfortable state of subjection that I worked up a very respectable feeling of rebellion , when a well-meaning but stupid man informed me there was nothing in it ? that one box of handcuffs was taken , and that it was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought to myself that shackles for the feet would have been more useful under the circumstances . In a i few moments E. came in to say that his " mess " were in readiness to receive and welcome us ; so , declining the kind invitation to remain in the house , I walked over to the encampment and found it just what might have been expected . However , in times of excitement creature comforts are a matter of minor importance . After a fatiguing day 's journey one can sleep very well on a camp cot , with nothing to separate one from the outer world but a Sibley tent ? more especially if one feels , as I did , that everything had been done to render it as comfortable as circumstances would permit . It was not until the next morning , when I discovered that my occupancy of the tent had obliged all the gentlemen to bivouac under trees , that I fully realized what an unjustifiable imposition I was . Tents , it seems , arc not among the superfluities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , the more impressed am I with the belief that we are going to war with very few of its requisites , But what surprised me more than all else was to hear intelligent men express the opinion that the war was over , that this one battle had decided it . They have convinced themselves that the North can never raise another army . If this should prove to be so , I trust that I shall be quietly removed from all participation either in the self-complacency of the South or the pusillanimity of the North . As a people , we arc given to boasting . I look forward to the future with great horror , whichever party is victorious , but privately entertain the idea that neither will be till both have suffered enough to teach them a proper respect for each other . I remember hearing some gentlemen in Washington discussing this very question , and they agreed that the North needed a defeat to unite it ? opposite views , I confess , but I give them to you for what they are worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each one having an experience of his own to relate . I also heard a great deal of the technical part of it , which I did not understand , and when I was taken over the field I knew less than I did before . If you are so behind the times as to imagine that a battlefield is anything like the pictures you see , disabuse yourself of the idea at once . If you suppose , as I did , that two lines of men are drawn up opposite to each other on a level piece of ground with nothing to do but fight , you confess a lamentable ignorance . This battlefield covered some seven miles in extent . In that territory there may have been some level spots , but I saw nothing but a broken country interspersed with woods , streams , and quite respectable little hills , and when I heard that the enemy advanced in such and such a direction , and perhaps some two miles distant was shown the exact spot where some brilliant manouver dislodged or scattered that enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though General Beauregard himself condescended to explain . By the by , he looks like one of Napoleon 's marshals , and was evidently meant for a soldier . The only facts I really appreciated were the numbers of new-made graves , and the atmosphere , which in some portions of the field was almost insupportable . I also fully realized the situation of our old friend Captain Ricketts , who is wounded and a prisoner . He is in a house at about the center of the field , which , because of the convenience of its location , was converted into a temporary hospital . There I found Federals and Secessionists occupying adjoining rooms , all suffering alike and all miserable forthe lack of some articles which a little forethought might have provided . Hearing that Captain Ricketts was in a deplorable condition , I ransacked the mess-chest for such things as I thought he might need , and succeeded in raising a bottle of brandy , some rice , and some sugar , which , with the only blanket we had , I was conveying to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a young Middleton of South Carolina lying on a heap of straw in the corner , gasping his life away from exhaustion . His wound had been pronounced mortal from the first , but , having no stimulants to give him , his poor father and brother , who sat beside him , felt that he was dying sooner than he needed to . I shared the brandy I had with them , and , after making some arrow-root , went into the next room , where lay Captain Ricketts and several other Federal officers . Mrs. R. had arrived the previous evening from Washington and was doing all that could be done with their limited means and poor accommodations . The Captain was suffering dreadfully from his wound ; but was better off than the Confederate wounded , as he lay on a camp cot instead of on the floor . He never alluded to the battle except once , when he pointed to the place where he lost his guns and where young Ramsay was killed . Mrs. R. described the scene that greeted her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead or alive , and fearing to glance at the large table in the lower hall which , she told me , was an amputation table , on which lay stretched a man who had died under the operation . Then the groans of the wounded and the shrieks of the dying met her ears , and she felt absolute relief when she found her husband no worse than he is , though it is by no means certain he will not lose his leg . I had known and liked Captain R. so well in happier times that I was completely overcome as the contrast between past and present rushed upon my mind . The other officers were slightly wounded , and , I thought , looked on in that cold , critical manner that people sometimes assume when dissatisfied with themselves and everybody else . After leaving them I saw one of the medical directors , and asked him to procure , if possible , some more comfortable place for Captain Ricketts and his wife ; but he said they preferred to remain where they were ; and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain with his friends , while she was willing to submit to any discomforts for herself . Just as I had bade the Ricketts a tearful good-by I saw in the room opposite a pair of eyes glittering with such an extraordinary expression that , without asking any questions or looking to the right or left , I walked straight up to them and , laying my hand on the head of the apparition , asked if there was anything I could do . The eyes rolled toward me , and , without any change in that same glittering look , their possessor told me that he was from Brooklyn , had been wounded , had had his leg amputated twice , once by a Federal surgeon , and once by a Confederate , and was waiting for them to come and cut it off a third time , adding , with a resolute air , " But I can stand it as long as they can . " His voice never faltered till he spoke of his mother , to whom he asked inc to write . While I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I will write myself , " and without the least perceptible tremor he wrote a short note which I have this day mailed , but which was such a curiosity , considering the condition of the writer , that I showed it to several surgeons , who pronounced it as wonderful as the incident told of Marshal Lannes , who smoked a cigar while his leg was being amputated . I found some few of the constitutional grumblers dissatisfied because our army Wm . CXXVIII. ? No. 765. - 56had not pushed right into Washington , but the majority were content to believe that there never had been such a victory , and never would be , unless the Yankees should have the temerity to fight again . A few , a very few , acknowledged that it had been a hard day 's struggle , and con-. sidered Kirby Smith 's opportune arrival providential , while they seemed to think that it would have been quite impossible to do more , considering the fatigued condition of the men . Some of them went into battle after a half-day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been marched and countermarched for the two weeks previous . Besides , there was a great deal of ' confusion among the independent gentlemen soldiers , who had done all they thought necessary for the time . Every one agrees that General Johnston is magnificent on the field , but the friends of Beauregard claim for him the entire credit for the plan of the battle , which the others are not willing to yield . Mrs. Davis gives equal credit to both , and one would suppose there was glory enuugh for all ; but military men seem inclined to be monopolists in this respect , and from present appearances I think it not unlikely that the more battles we fight with the enemy , the more " scrimmages " we shall have among ourselves . E. returned with me , completely broken down from the effects of diphtheria and the exposure and fatigue to which he had necessarily been subjected . The night after the battle he , with General Johnston and all the staff , slept under a tree . He says they were so tired that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He is now in the hands of the physicians . who have prescribed entire rest and sulphur baths . We leave to-morrow for the Montgomery White Sulphur Springs . I have been so much occupied in getting ready for this hurried start that I know nothing of the on-flits of the city ; I hear the battle is the only thing talked about . A Washington paper received to-day almost claims a victory for the Federals , and is minute in its description of the cannon , which have been placed in the square to show that none fell into the hands of the enemy ! Private accounts from there , however , represent an immense amount of consternation and confusion . A great many letters were picked up on the field , most of them a disgrace to the language in which they are written , and I can not imagine what part of the United States could have produced the writers ; but I cease to be astonished at any kind of brutality or demoralization that this war may develop since hearing of a New Orleans " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothpick and candlestick made from the bones of a dead Yankee . What a deliverance the war would be if it would only kill off such wretches on both sides ! MEMPHIS ( Early Winter ) . Will you believe it ? I have been in a battle ! And . availing myself of the privilege granted to " veterans , " will henceforth tell the story on all occasions . Left Memphis about a week ago for a little trip to Columbus , where I had some business , taking passage in a Government boat which did not carry passengers , but had a place fitted up especially for us , so that I was the only woman on board , though there were some halt a dozen gentlemen in the forward cabin . The weather was delightful , and we had a charming time , stopping long enough at Fort Pillow to walk over its very extensive but unfinished works . As we approached Columbus we heard rumors of a battle ; but such rumors are always afloat , and in this instance gained no credence , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , a shot across our bow led us to suppose that we were to stop for some reason . We were about obeying the mandate when one ? two ? three ? four ? five ? ten shotswere fired at us , not one hitting us , though two went between the boilers , and all came near enough to scare us considerably . As it was evident by this time , the enemy had possession of our guns , and were turning their fire against us . Why we were not struck I can not imagine , a steamboat being an uncomfortably conspicuous target when one happens to be in it ? as was keenly realized by an unfortunate Irishman of the Bob Acres school . For myself , not appreciating the danger , I did not dread it . Indeed , I was engrossed in watching the Irishman , whose first movement was to divest himself of a uniform coat and red sash , in which he had " splurged " most satisfactorily , while in piteous accents he entreated the captain to turn the boat , exclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirs shills ! " So I was thinking less of the cannon than of the coward , as the more novel sight of the two . I will also divulge to you , in strict confidence , that it was my intention , if things got much worse , to creep under my berth , having always had an ostrich inclination to hide my head in case of alarm . But not a word of this , for I woke next morning to find myself a heroine , and have not felt called upon to disprove it . As soon as the boat could be turned and rounded ro , at a wooding-place , the gentlemen went on shore to make inquiries , but could learn nothing very satisfactory from the only persons they met ? the stragglers and the " lame who started early " ; who , to justify themselves , were obliged to represent the Confederates as being cut to pieces , Columbus evacuated , and all in full retreat . This being the only information to be procured , G. gave it as his opinion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of disaster , it would he needed ; and accordingly we prepared to run the gantlet again . But there is a tide in the affairs of battles , as in everything else , and by the time we were opposite the battery again the Federals were in retreat , making for their gunhoats , and closely pursued by the reinforcements that General Polk led onto the field about two in the afternoon . The United States troops under General Grant attacked General Pillow at Bel- mont ( opposite Columbus ) in the early part of the day , with complete success , but were forced to retire later , losing all they had gained , and leaving their dead and wounded on the field . All this we learned from an officer who stepped on board the instant the boat touched the Columbus landing , with an order that it should proceed at once to the opposite , or Belmont , side . There was , of course , no time to ger my things together and disembark , therefore I stayed on board , not sorry to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghastly sights I should see . First , some prisoners were brought on , poor , miserable , dejected-looking creatures , with whom I could not help sympathizing , as they were forced to listen to the taunts and jeers of the common men on the boat . I was roused to active demonstrations at hearing them say to a wounded officer : " Let him lie on that pile of bricks ? it is good enough for him " ; and I went in search of Mr. McLean , who saw him as comfortably placed as was possible , and gave him some brandy , which restored his failing strength , but failed to impart a gentlemanly politeness . He took all that was offered to him , as a matter of course , and in response to Mr. McLean 's kind in- quiry as to where he was wounded , gruffly replied , " In the back , sir , but not in running away from the enemy . " " I should not have insinuated such a thing under the circumstances , whatever may have been the probabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the remark to me that " the United Stares uniform did not inevitably cover gentlemen nowadays . " I thought little more of him , one way or the other , as by this time other wounded were being brought on board . While bathing the face of a man in the agonies of death , I chanced to look round , and there by my side were thirty or forty corpses that had been brought on board , rolled in the blood-stained blankets in which they had been carried from the field , and wearing every expression by which the human face is distorted . I had always heard that persons dying of gun-shot wounds preserved a happy expression , but on those ghastly faces was fixed anger , revenge , suffering , and one man , with a demoniac stare in his eyes , had his right hand raised and clenched , as if to defy death itself . Of all who lay there I saw but one who seemed to have died in peace : a young boy of about seventeen , with light hair , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been translated far from that scene of woe and suffering . As I looked in his large blue eyes that no kind hand had closed , I thought of the distress awaiting those to whom he was dear , and , stooping down to brush his hair aside , could not restrain the tear which fell on his white face , seeming to mar its placid purity so much that I hastily wiped it off , feeling as though he had silently reproached me for my sorrowing . Among the sufferers was a son of General Pillow , who received neither more nor less attention than any one else ; all lay crowded together , dead and dying , friends and enemies ? civil war in all its hideousness ! I wished that the picture could have been daguerreotyped on the brains of those who let us drift into it ? it would have been punishment enough , even for them . When the boat was filled with its pitiable cargo we returned to the Columbus side of ithe river , where ambulances i were in waiting to convey their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went to Generai Polk 's headquarters , but found it entirely deserted , nor dicithe General and his staff return until nine o'clock at night . The firing across the river became more and more animated till darkness closed on the scene , while the town of Columbus itself was rendered as unsafe as the battlefield by the irregular and constant firing of the volunteers who were left there , and who expended their excitement by shooting at everything , anything , or nothing . I was more alarmed than I was on board of the boat , and did not at all relish the idea of being accidentally shot . When General Polk and his staff returned , flushed with victory and proud of the day 's deeds , reveling in the excitement of danger met and overcome , and recounting to one another their individual experiences , I felt that I could have been a soldier myself ; I forgot for the moment the dark side of the picture , and wondered if these men could ever degenerate again into every-day mortals . There is something electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head thrown back and his eyes sparkling with the fire of youth , seemed more like a paladin than a bishop of the Church , and it would be difficult for any one in his presence to condemn his exchange of the miter for the sword , so thoroughly is he persuaded that he is right . Later in the evening , all the glamour of war faded out of our minds as we saw G. W. Butler , of Louisiana , brought into the house mortally wounded . He was a great-grandson of Martha Washington , and had just returned from Europe , where he had been attached to various legations . His handsome personal appearance and chivalric bearing had attracted attention as he went into the battle which Fate had ordained should be his first and last , and there was something so noticeable about him that after he was wounded and the Federals were in retreat a United States officer , who chanced to see him , dismounted , gave him some water , and threw his own blanket over him , saying , " Poor fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never forget the scene as I entered the room . The wounded man lay on the trestle which had borne him from the field , his younger brother leaning over him in great distress , while a brutal doctor announced in loud , harsh tones that there was no hope , and therefore no use in doing anything . He refused even to dress the wounds , so that Butler 's shattered arm lay just as it had been struck , while his life blood welled from a wound in his breast . I never felt more indignant , and , taking the doctor aside , observed that at least a little morphine would ease the sufferer . " Nothing will do him any good or any harm , and I have no morphine to waste , " was the response . During this colloquy I shuddered to perceive that pain had not so deadened the sufferer 's faculties that he was prevented from hearing every word . But he beckoned to me , saving in the gentlest manner , but with all the spirit of his race in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am dying , but I shall have proper attention " ; and from that moment he seemed to revive , while I administered stimulants from time to time , determined that if human means could save him he should not die . Alas , all our care and all the surgical skill that had been exhausted on him were in vain , and after deluding us with false hopes for some twenty-four hours he passed quietly away without a struggle . In those few hours I felt as if I had gained and lost a friend . All the pain and agony that he suffered seemed to reveal in stronger relief his many noble traits of character and his gentlemanly breeding ? his firmness , his gentleness , his delicate consideration for others , that never left him till the end ; and as I afterward saw him lying in his coffin , with the Confederate flag folded over him , I felt for the first time that those colors were sanctified . If I feel so , how dear must they be to those who have sacrificed their all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , and offered one of the most earnest prayers I have ever heard . Immediately afterward he said to me , with a great deal of feeling , " What a terrible scourge is this war ! " If I could only get up a wholesome , hearty hatred for one side or the other side , it would be so sustaining ; but my wishy-washy way of sympathizing with everybody that happens to be hurt is perfectly contemptible , and 1 am losing all self-respect . By way of encouraging a more healthy frame of mind , however , I have taken to knitting socks , in the hope that I shall become so raveled up that there will be no extrication ; besides , an enlightened public opinion demands a certain number of these articles from every woman 's patriotism . Accordingly , I have been cramping my fingers and puzzling my brain in " heeling " and " toeing , " " rounding off " and " taking up , " till I am at times entirely oblivious of the weightier matters of the war , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we patriots meet , with our respective socks in their various degrees of advance and decline . " Our poor soldiers " is echoed in every possible inflection of the female voice , and , like a game of ball , it is only necessary to keep it up to insure complete success . Occasionally an energetic woman , with a superabundance of vitality , breaks out against the " Goths , Vandals , and infidels of the North , " but it is not necessary to notice it if you knit . So , if you wish to picture me to your mind 's eye , fancy a coarse , misshapen sock with a subdued appearance at the other end of it , and you will have all that is left of Margaret Sumner McLean . The telegraph announces this morning a terrible accident at Columbus . It seems that a new gun , which was being tested , exploded , severely injuring General Polk and killing several officers and soldiers . I feel as if every step were on a grave . To-morrow we leave for Richmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , we shall he some six days en route . With " foes without and fears within , " it needs a St. Paul to possess one 's soul in patience .
