txt This is a story about what , in the minds of the French military authorities , ranks as the greatest battle of the war in the western theatre of operations , excepting the battle of the Marne , which has already taken its place among the decisive battles of the world 's history . This battle is still raging , although its first stages have been definitely settled in favor of the French , who are continuing their progress with less and less opposition . So far the battle has received no name . The French official communiques laconically refer to it as " operations in the section north of Arras . " I can not minutely describe the conflict ; no one can do that at this stage . I can , however , write about it and tell what I have seen these past few days when the Ministry of War authorized me to accompany a special mission there , to which I was the only foreigner accredited . I purpose to call this struggle the battle of the Labyrinth , for " labyrinth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through that region , and from which the Germans are being literally blasted almost foot by foot by an extravagant use of French melinite . There have been successive chapters by different writers , describing and disposing of as finished  --  though it is not finished  --  still another battle which , from the English point of view , takes top rank , namely , the battle , of Ypres . While a British defeat at Ypres might mean the loss of Dunkirk and possibly ' of Calais . a ' French defeat at the Labyrinth would , allow the Germans to sweep clear across Northern France , cutting all communication with England . Battle Began Last October . The battle of The Labyrinth really began last October , when General de 1 Maud-Huy stopped the Prussian Guard before Arras with his motley array of tired Territorials , whom he gathered together in a mighty rush northward after the battle of the ' Marne . The crack Guards regiments afterward took on the job at Ypres , while the Crown Prince of Bavaria assumed the vain task of attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter de Maud'huy worried him , not seeking to make a big advance , but contenting himself with the record of never having lost a single trench . ) With the return of warm weather , just after the big French advance in Champagne , this sector was chosen by Joffre as the place In which to take the heart out of his enemy by the delivery of a mighty blow . The Germans probably thought that the French intended to concentrate in the Vosges , as next door to Champagne ; so they carted ail their poison gases there and to Ypres , where their ambition still maintains ascendancy over their good sense . But where tho Germans think Joffre is likely to strike is usually the place furthest from his thoughts . Activities in the Arras sector were begun under the personal command of the Commander in Chief , who was still personally directing operations during my visit only two days ago . I doubt whether until the war is over it will be possible adequately to describe the battle , or rather , the series of battles extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labyrinth " certainly is the fittest word to call it . I always had a fairly accurate sense of direction : but , , standing in many places in this giant battlefield , it was impossible for me to say where were the Germans and where the French , so completely was I turned around on account of the constant zigzag of the trench lines . Sometimes , when I was positive that a furious cannonade coming from a certain position was German , it turned out to be French . At other times , when I thought I was safely going in the direction of the French , I was hauled back by officers , who told me I was heading directly into the German line of fire . I sometimes felt that the German lines were on three sides , and often I was quite correct . On the other hand , the French lines often almost completely surround the German positions . Hard to Distinguish Hostile Guns . One could not tell from the nearness of the artillery fire whether it was from friend or foe . Artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by detonations like thunder , when the shell first leaves the gun ; second , the rushing sound of the shell passing high overhead ; third , the shrill whistle , followed by the crash when it finally explodes . In the Labyrinth the detonations which usually indicated the French fire might be from the German batteries stationed quite near us , but where they could not get the range on us , and firing at a section of the French lines some miles away . I finally determined that when a battery fired fast it was French ; for the German fire is becoming more intermittent every day . I shall attempt to give some idea of what this fighting looks like . Late one afternoon , coming out of a trench into a green meadow , I suddenly found myself planted against a mudbank made of the dirt taken from the trenches . We were lust at the crest of a hill . In khaki clothes I was of the same color as the mudbank ; so an officer told me I was in a fairly safe position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sedate , methodical ? affair after the first impressions have been rubbed off . We flattened ourselves casually against our mudbank , Carefully adjusted our glasses , turned them toward the valley before es , whence came the sound of exploding shells , and calmly watched a village developing into nothingness in the sunset . It was only about a thousand yards away ? I did n't even bother to ask whether it was in French or German possession . There was a loud explosion , a roll of dense black smoke , which was penetrated quickly enough by the long , horizontal rays of the descending sun to permit the sight of tumbling roofs and crumbling walls . After a few seconds ' intermission there was another explosion , and what looked like a public school in the main street sagged suddenly in the centre . With no , entr'acte came a succession of explosions , and the building was prone upon the ground  --  just a jagged pile of broken stones . Finding the German Trenches . We turned our glasses on the other end of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church had caught fire . We watched it awhile in silence . Ruins were getting very common . I swept the glasses away from the hamlet altogether and pointed out over the distant fields to the left . ? " Where are the German trenches ? " I rather uninterestedly asked the Major . " I 'll show you  --  just a moment ! " he answered , and at the same time signalling to a soldier squatting in the entrance to a trench near by , he ordered the man to convey a message to the telephone station , which connected with a " seventy-five " battery at our rear . I was on point of telling the officer not to bother about it . The words were on my lips ; then I thought : " Oh , never mind ! I might as well know where the trenches are , now that I have asked . " The soldier disappeared . " Watch ! " said the officer . We looked intently across the , fields to the left . In less than a minute there were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon before us , about a mile away . " That 's where they are ! " the officer said . " Both shells went right in them . " " Ah ! Very interesting ! " I replied . Away to the right of the village , now reduced to ruins , was another larger village ; we squared around on our mud bank to look at that . This town was more important ; it was NeuvilleSt . Vaast , which is still occupied by both French and Germans , the former slowly retaking it , house by house . We were about half a mile away . We could see little ; for strangely , in this business of house-to-hause occupation , most of the fighting is in the cellars . But I could well imagine what was going on , for I had already walked through the ruins of Verrnelles , another town now entirely in French possession , but taken in the same fashion after two months ' dogged inch-by-inch advances . He Sees a Mine Exploded . So , when looking at Neuville-St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a great mass of masonry and debris of all descriptions flying high in the air , I knew just what had happened . The French ? for it is always the French who do it  --  had burrowed , sapped and dug themselves laboriously , patiently , slowly , by tortuous , narrow underground routes from one row of houses under the foundations , gardens , backyards and streets to beneath the foundations of the next row of houses . There they had planted mines . The . explosion I had just witnessed was of a mine . Much of the debris I saw flying through space had been German soldiers a few seconds before . Before the smoke died away we heard a savage yell . That was the French cry of victory . Then we heard a rapid cracking of rifles . That was the sign that the French had advanced across the space between the houses to finish the work their mine had left undone . When one goes to view the work of these mines afterward all that one sees is a great , round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often twice that in diameter . Above it might have been either a chateau or a stable ; unless one has an old resident for guide it is impossible to know . It takes many days and nights to prepare these mines . It takes careful mathematical precision to determine that they are correctly placed . It takes morale , judgment , courage , and intelligence  --  this fighting from house to house . And yet the French are called a frivolous people ! A cry from a soldier warned us of a German aeroplane directly overhead ; so we stopped gazing at Neuville-St . Vaast . A French aeroplane soon appeared , and the German made off rapidly . They usually do , as the majority of German aeronauts carry only rifles ; the French now all have mitrailleuse . A fight between them is unequal , and the inequality is not easily overcome . for the German machines are too light for mitrailleuses . Firing at French Aeroplanes . Four French machines were now circling above , and the German batteries opened fire on them . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , and the sun had not yet gone . We could not hear the shells explode , but we could see little feathery white clouds suddenly appear as if some giant invisible hand had just put them there  --  high up in the sky . Another appeared , and another . There were several dozen little white clouds vividly outlined against the blue before the French machines , all untouched , turned back toward their own lines . " Moving On " for a Shell . Again our thoughts and actions were rudely disturbed by the soldier with us , who suddenly threw himself face down on the ground . Before we had time to wonder why a German shell tore a hole in the field before us , less than a hundred yards away . I asked the officer if wehad been seen , and if they were firing at us . He said he did not think so , but we had perhaps better move . As a matter of fact , they were hunting the battery that had so accurately shown us their trenches a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had left our motors by the trench , we walked across an open field in quite another direction than I thought was the correct one . All the time we heard , high overhead , that rushing sound as of giant wings . Occasionally , when a shell struck in the neighborhood , we heard the shrill whistling sound , and half a dozen times in the course of the walk great holes were torn in our field , sometimes quite near . But artillery does not cause fear easily ; it is rifles that accomplish that . The sharp hissing of the bullet that resembles so much the sound of a spitting cat seems so personal  --  as if it was intended just for you . Artillery is entirely impersonal ; you know that the gunners do not see you ; that they are firing by arithmetic at a certain range ; that their  --  shell is not intended for anyone in particular . So you walk on , striking idly with your stick at the daisies and buttercups that border your path . You calculate , almost indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You somehow feel that nothing will harm you . You are not afraid ; and if you are lucky , as we were , you will find the automobiles waiting for you just over there beyond the brow- of the hill .
