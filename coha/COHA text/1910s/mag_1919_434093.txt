IT was in the afternoon of September 15 that we arrived at Villingen . The camp was n't at all attractive from the outside , but it proved much better and more comfortable than it looked . It covered an area of about 1000 metres by 250 . Barracks were built around the outer edges , with an open court in the centre , in which were a tennis-court , volley-ball court , library , reading-room , and assembly hall . Around these , inside the line of barracks , was room for US to walk or run for exercise . This bad been a Russian officers ' camp , but it was being vacated for American officers . There were still two hundred Russians there , and at that time seventy Americans . The American Red Cross had bulk supplies , both of food and clothing , at Villingen . Food was issued every Monday . The German food here was nothing but the old vegetable compound . Once a week we got a little slice of very poor meat . The Russians , who had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underfed . We were not bothered with any formal breakfast at all . Instead , they issued us twenty lumps of sugar a week , which pleased us much better . I never ate any of my sugar , but saved every piece of it for rations on my escape . The Germans took a picture of each of us , after which we could , if we chose , go out of camp for walks , on our word of honor . We could not walk about at our pleasure , of course , but were allowed to go out at a certain time every other day ( the weather and convenience of the Germans permitting ) , in a group of not less than ten , or more than fifty . A German non-commissioned officer went with us as a guide , and we were subject to his orders . We would be out an hour or two . As we went out we would give our written word of honor not to try to escape , accompanied with our picture ; and when we returned , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as follows . The outer windows of the barracks were barred . Where the barracks did not join , a blind fence with wire on top connected them . A few feet outside the line of barracks and fence came the main barrier , which went all around . This was , first , a low barbed-wire fence ; just outside that , a ditch about four feet wide , filled with barbed-wire entanglement ; and at the outer edge of this came the main fence , of woven barbed wire , about nine feet high , with steel arms on top of the posts , curving toward the interior about two feet , thus making the top of the fence lean toward the inside , so that it was impossible to climb from that direction , even with nothing else to bother you . Just outside this was the outer guard patrol . This patrol was doubled before dark every night . There was also a line of electric lights a few feet outside , which burned all night . The Germans boasted of this as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak point went , I suppose they were justified . To maintain the camp , counting all guard-shifts , officials , and so forth , they used over a hundred men , ? to hold the 270 of us . Practically all of these men , however , were old and unfit for service on the front . After I had been at Villingen for a few days , the interpreter came round while distributing mail one day , and said that he had good news for me . I asked him what it was , hoping that I had at last got a letter ; and he told me that I had to go to jail again . He reminded me that I had been sentenced to fourteen days ' confinement at Rastatt , and having served only five clays , I would have to serve the remaining nine days here . That night , which was the twenty-first of September , I was locked up again . The same night Rhodes was brought in and locked up for twenty days in a neighboring cell . The following day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened to be my twenty-fourth birthday . I shall never forget that birthday party , locked up in my cell . The boys with whom I messed were to send my meals in to me . They sent them all right , but the guards somehow got mixed up , and all my meals were taken in to Rhodes . Thus I fasted on my twenty-fourth birthday , while ' Dusty ' feasted on my meals in addition to his own . He had just been caught , however , and I suppose he needed filling up . I was released from solitary confinement on the night of September 30 . Seven more fliers had come in from Landshut , making a total of 77 Americans in camp . From them we learned that , a few nights after we left Lands-hut , four of the fellows had escaped . They had all been caught , however , four or five days later . They made fifteen American officers , who , to my personal knowledge , had escaped , and all had been recaptured . This was a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the border as Villingen is . The weather was already growing cold , and I realized that the time for making the attempt , without hazarding the winter weather , was getting short . In spite of my effort to keep myself in condition , I found that my confinement had softened as well as delayed me . I walked miles and miles inside the camp in order to harden myself . After a few rainy days it cleared , and I went out on the first honor walk . I learned from the Russians that a few weeks of good weather might be expected . The moon was dark . It would be much more dangerous to go in moonlight , and it would be winter before the next dark of the moon . All these things indicated that now was the time . I talked to Lieutenant H. C. Tichenor , better known among us as Tich . ' and found him of my mind , willing to go any length to try it . We shook hands on it and went to work . It was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new food-issue , and we determined to be ready to break Monday night . We proposed to go right out of our window and over that barrier sonic way ; get as good a start on the guard as possible , and chance the rest . The bottoms of our beds were made of planks running lengthwise . These were strong boards one inch thick . eight inches wide , and seven feet long . Prom these I thought that we should be able to construct some means of sealing the barrier . Tich was a good engineer . We could not drive nails , of course , nor could we make any large show of work ? for the interpreter dropped in on us every hour or two , and his eye was keen ; therefore we worked out and drew our design on paper . We took the boards out one at a time , while some one stood watch for us ; bored the necessary holes and did the necessary cutting on each ; and replaced them under the beds , where they remained until the last moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with wire , like putting up ready-made wooden barracks . Albertson , who was good at map-drawing , drew the map I used . From a Russian officer I bought a Russian overcoat and cap . I considered this a fair disguise , as well as necessary cover , bemuse the silhouette at night would be the same as that of the German uniform . Also , if I should accidentally be seen in the daytime , a Russian prisoner at liberty is common enough in Germany not to attract suspicion if he does not act suspiciously . Again , in the guise of a Russian prisoner I would not be expected to speak German . There was in camp a Russian who , by ways and means known only to himself , could produce anything you wanted if you had the price . I went to him for a compass . Tich had a good one , but I thought that we should both be fully equipped . I also bought a big spring-back knife and a twenty-mark bill . For the twenty marks in German money I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were planning to escape , and knowing that , when one escaped , there would be an inspection whirls would catch those preparing , we determined to make our break all together . Willis and Isaacs had discovered a means to short-circuit all the lights of the camp . We planned to put them all out , and as this was done , to break at once at our different points . They certainly could not stop all of us . Isaacs , Battle , and Tucker were to break out of one window , Tichenor and I another , and a third bunch still another . All three of the windows were along the southern side of the camp . Willis , Wardle , Chalmers , and some others , disguised as Germans , were to slip into the quarters of the guard and await the alarm raised by our escape , and then , as these guards were turned out to chase us , they would rush out the open gate with the Huns . Almost all the Americans had a hand in it in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not going to try to escape themselves . As a means of short-circuiting the lights , chains of wire were made , with a weight on both ends . These were to be thrown over the uninsulated wires where they came into camp . It was rather a long throw , but several chains were made in case of a miss . Some other fellows were to raise false alarms at other parts of the camp , to distract the guards . Sunday morning we learned that all the Russians would be sent away Monday . We knew that this would cause an inspection of quarters and our plans would he discovered . We therefore determined to make the break Sunday night . Having expected to leave Monday night after the food-issue , several of us were short of food-supplies . I had traded off so much of mine for any compass and other equipment , that I had practically none . We could not wait , however , and as it turned out , it was probably a good thing that I was no more heavily loaded , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the other boys I got four boxes of hard-tack and one opened can of hash . The lights inside our barracks were turned out every night at ten-thirty . Our plan was to short-circuit the others a few moments after that ; and the putting out of the outside lights would be the signal to go . Sunday night , before ten-thirty , Tich and I had cut loose the bars in our window , had taken the prepared slats from our beds and put them together , making a strong and solid run-board fourteen feet long , and were ready . At ten-thirty the lights in our quarters went out . I put on my Russian cap and overcoat , pinning up the tail to prevent its catching on the wire , and slung on my haversack with my small food-supply and so forth . Tich and I took our run-board to the window . A messenger came to ask if we were ready . We told him we were . I was to go out of the window first , with the head of the run-board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming out himself as the back encl came out . I was to put the end on the fence and go over , Tich coming over behind me . We had selected a rendezvous outside in case we became separated . About ten minutes elapsed before anything happened . This time we spent , quite nervously , of course , right at the window . Then the outer lights began to sputter and went out . We pulled the curtain down from the window , bent back the bars , which , though remaining in place , had been cut loose during the night , and the window was cleared for the go . The guard , who appeared to have noticed something suspicious about our window during the evening , was standing directly in front . When he saw the lights go out , he knew , of course , that something was up , and uttering a little exclamation plainly audible to us , who were sa near him , pulled his rifle down from his back and got it ready for action . With the lights out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man was easily distinguishable within fifty yards or less . Seeing that the guard stood right in front , I thought it advisable to wait and see what he would do on hearing the noise of the other parties , who I knew would then start out , hoping that he would move from his position of such advantage . In a few seconds I heard the wire screech , and the guard below shoot off his gun and blow his whistle . This guard , however , did not move . I knew then that the time had come to go , or we would soon be caught . I shoved the ladder partially out of the window and jumped out myself . The ground was about seven feet below the window . Tichenor fed the ladder out to me , and came out with the rear end . I threw it against the fence , and immediately started over . The guard standing directly in front saw me , of course , and the instant that I started over the fence challenged me . I paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time just as I reached the top of the fence . I jumped down on the outside . I thus stood just outside the fence , the guard about fifteen feet in front of me and facing me . At an angle to my left , and about half-way between us , stood a large tree . I jumped behind this tree . The guard saw me go behind it and waited . I looked back and saw Tichenor then outside the barracks and inside the fence . I saw the other guard on this beat coming from about thirty yards to the left of me . I knew that I could not keep one tree between me and two guards very long , and that the only chance that Tichenor possibly had of getting out was to come over while I had the guard occupied . I did not intend to give myself up , so after a few seconds I jumped out from behind the tree and dashed past the guard . I passed within about three steps of the nearest and about twenty of the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not heed him , but tried to run in as much of a zig-zag course as I could without losing forward speed . He challenged a second time . By that time I had got probably six or seven steps farther , and he fired . The other guard , who had said nothing , also fired at me at the same time . The bullets passed quite near me , but neither touched me . Just as quickly as they could breech their guns , they fired again . Of course , I was not standing round waiting for them to breech those guns . Just as the second shots were fired , both at the same time again , I stumbled into a ditch and fell . I was familiar with the whereabouts of this ditch , but under the circumstances naturally forgot it . I fell just at the time of the shots . Probably one or both of them might have hit me , had I not fallen . Also the guard nearest , seeing me fall , evidently hought he had shot me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scrambled up , he apparently did not see me . The other guard shot at me twice more ; by that time I was out of sight . I ran only a short distance before I was out of breath , being loaded down with the heavy Russian overcoat , two woolen suits of underwear and two woolen shirts , and my food-parcel . I sat down just out-of sight , in order to catch my breath . At this time , all kinds of disturbances and shots were heard , for a dozen men were trying to escape at once . I then got up , but being too tired to run , began walking in the direction of the place where Tichenor and I had arranged to meet . After I had walked about a thousand yards away , my silhouette evidently rose above the sky-line , and one of the guards took a pot-shot at me at this long range . Finding that I was seen , I stooped down , so as not to silhouette myself , and ran on to the place where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes , according to our agreement . While there , I heard some seventy-five or a hundred shots fired down at the camp . At the end of that time I heard the bugle blown for assembly , and knew that he was not coming . I prayed to the Lord and started for the Swiss border alone . The trip to the Swiss border was accomplished in five nights ' walking . As soon as I was out of the neighborhood of Villingen , I took to the roads . Before the tramp was done , I had acquired the ability to walk at reasonably good speed over a gravel-road with my hob-nail shoes , making no more noise than one ordinarily would with rubber heels on a plush carpet . At first I traveled almost directly west . My compass , being made by hand , was not as convenient and easy to use as an ordinary compass , but it was a good one and never failed me . The compass-needle itself was made of a small flat piece of steel about an inch long , tapered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass peg screwed into the bottom of a little wooden box . Though large when assembled , it was ideal to pass inspection in prison , because , when disassembled , it bore no resemblance to a compass . To make it visible at night , I had taken some of the phosphorus from the face of my wristwatch and stuck it to the north end of the compass , balancing the other end with a little mucilage . Morning found me about fifteen kilometres on my way , west by a little south from Villingen . Toward morning , having walked a little late , though it was not yet light in the forest , I met two wood-cutters on their way to work . My tactics of noiselessness , however , saved me , and I observed their approach before they saw me and easily avoided them . After a little I came out to seek a better hiding-place for the day . Just as I rose , I saw , and was seen by , the only human who ever saw me by daylight during my whole trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and was looking straight at me . I feigned indifference to him , adjusted my clothes leisurely , and strode away as if he meant nothing to me . Thanks to my Russian costume , he was not suspicious and did not follow . As soon as the trees hid me , I went faster , but still maintained an indifferent manner in case another eye should see me . In a few minutes I found a good place , and taking off my shoes and putting on a pair of heavy wool socks , which I had brought for that purpose , settled down for the day . The weather was kind to me , and after a few hours the sun brought to me the possibility of food and sleep . During this first day I ate all my hash , because , being opened , it would not keep . It made a reasonably good day 's rations . Realizing the swim which was before me , and not having swum in two years , I began the exercises which I used several hours each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was restless to be on my way , and started as soon as it was dark enough to venture it . Soon after starting , while circling a little : village , where there was a crowd of people in the street , I came upon what seemed to be a narrow strip of water . When I attempted to jump across it , what appeared to be the other bank proved to be only long grass , and I went into water up to my waist . I was more afraid that the splash I had made would attract attention than I was worried by my wetting . I clambered to the other side and resumed my journey with the water sloshing in my shoes . I raided my first garden about midnight , filling my little bag . I ate some during the night , and kept a supply to eat during the day , when it would beimpossible to search for anything . For the remainder of my journey I lived more upon these raw foods than upon my scanty rations . Each morning , a little before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my day 's supply . My dry food I ate mostly when I rested during the night . When I was exhausted , I could feel the immediate stimulating effect of a lump of sugar , just like a hot cup of coffee to the tired man . A few hours after I started , the sky became covered with clouds , and a little after midnight it began to drizzle On me . About four in the morning , while it was still raining , I found the only barn that I ever saw in Germany which was not either partially inhabited by the people themselves , or so near their house as to be useless as a hidings place . It stood in a pasture , by itself , and looked inviting . The finding of this barn was but one of the many instances where Providence helped me on my journey . It rained continually until about four of the following afternoon . By this time , as I had walked all the way with wet feet , they were beginning to trouble me , and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside the barn I had hopes of finding some hay , but in this I was disappointed . I had , however , a dry floor , and lying down in my wet clothes , immediately fell asleep from exhaustion , but soon woke and found it too cold to sleep any more . When I woke it was getting light . I kept myself warm during the day , taking my swimming exercises , and my clothes soon dried on me , except my shoes , which I had taken off immediately upon stopping . No one came near the barn during the rain , but in the evening the farmers came , and I could hear them talking outside . Once they opened the door of the shed below and came in . For a while I thought it was all up with me ; but they never came into the loft where I was hiding , and all was well . As darkness came on , I put on my shoes and started out again . I was feeling fine , and after a fen hours on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw before me a town of considerable size . It was the town of Neustadt , the largest through which I passed during my journey . All roads led through the town . I therefore decided to trust to the similarity of my costume to the German uniform and bluff my way through . It was about 10.30 P.M. , and though the streets were already mostly deserted , it as not late enough for a wayfarer to he looked upon with particular suspicion . The town was electrically lighted and the factories were , running . I buttoned my Russian military coal , which , by the way , was far from shoddy , being of a material that would have cost well over one hundred dollars , even in that dear land of plenty across the seas . I set my military cap in a very severe position on the forward part of lay head , and assuming a very dignified and forbidding manner , I walked through this town a rival to the most military Prussian officer ever seen . As entered . I met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to pass t hem when the light shone in their faces and at my back , thus giving them a viewer my outline only . When I came up to them , they stood at attention , giving me fully half the sidewalk . I saluted them as a German officer would , and passed by . I next met a lone woman , who spoke to me ; but my bearing was so haughty as not to encourage familiarity . I next passed a hotel , through the windows of which I could see many soldiers in uniform . No one was outside as I passed in front of the brightly lighted door ; but after I had gone beyond about twenty-five steps , the door opened and a German officer , or someone who appeared to me to be one , stepped out and started down the street behind me . In all my experience I have never seen a German walk so fast as he did . ' almost had to drop my dignity , in order to prevent him shortening the distance between us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference , while internally all was in a tur moil , Thus pressed , I marched across an overhead bridge spanning both river and railroad , and though it was nip and tuck , I think we came over with the distance between us lengthened a little . I do n't think anyone could have out- walked me tinder those circumstances . Once over , the German soon relieved me from the ever-increasing fear that he was following me by turning into another street , Then I met five women coining from their work . These , I fear , had a pretty good look at me , but I passed the inspection . I then heard a noisy party of five or six , but by turning down a dark street , allowed them to pass and returned to my route behind them . Just at the edge of the town , the road began to climb again into the mountain forest . Here I came up behind an old man carrying a heavy burden on his back . His progress was very slow and appearance quite harmless , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five steps , he lowered his burden to the ground , to rest , which caused him to turn and face me . I was by this time beyond the lights , and I passed him without difficulty , grunting , tauten Nacht . ' The road soon began to wind , and after about an hour 's walk , climbing all the while , I came out in a clearing on the side of the mountain , overlooking the town , within a stone 's throw below . I stopped and rested , realizing that . I had used a lot of my strength and gained very little distance on my journey . The lights and hum of the mills coming up through the fog from the town in the valley below held a weird attraction , and I seated myself on a fallen tree and watched . While I was sitting here , it began to drizzle again . A clock in the town below chimed the hour of midnight . I turned again into the forest . Though I never had any very definite belief in anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me a believer in guardian angels . Never did I feel lonesome , or even alone , during all that trip . Several times I waked to hear someone speaking . During the next hour or so , I had much need for the assistance of my Guardian Angel . My road , still climbing the mountain , led south . After a little it began to grow narrower and narrower , until it vanished in the forest . I could not , however , force myself to turn and retrace my steps . With my compass I labored my way on through the forest in a constant rain , hoping soon to hit another road leading down on the other side . I realized the danger of my blind groping ; often an unseen hand seemed to halt me just on the verge of danger , and I would be more and more cautious without knowing what I had really avoided . Once I stepped into space and clown I went . My fall was short , and with only a few scratches I came to a stop on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel my way along . When looking straight up , I could sometimes see the dim glow of the cloud-covered sky above the tree-tops . I realize now that it would have been better to retrace my steps and try to avoid the mountain , which still towered above and before me . But the road , even to return , was lost now , and I had no alternative . ' I pressed on as best as I could . Soon I felt that the rain had turned into snow . Finally , I came out on the flat top of the mountain . Here the forest ended , and I found myself cold and exhausted , and faced by ground grown up with thick underbrush , absolutely impassable . At each step I was deluged with melting snow . Though I did not know it at that time , my hand-made map not being absolutely accurate , I was then on the top of Hohfurst Mountain , an altitude about as high as I could have found on my route . It was not a snow-capped mountain , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that it was snowing up there on that particular night of October when it was raining down below . I stepped back into the uncut forest , where , because of the absence of underbrush , I could make my way , and repeatedly tried to skirt this barrier . At every turn it faced me . I would stuntble and fall , often lying where I fell . almost dropping off to sleep . Always I would wake with a start , thinking that I had just heard a companion calling to inc not to weaken . Finally , I just stunt-bled into another road which , though not going in my direction , I unhesitatingly took and started down the mountain . This road conducted me to a highway going in the proper direction , and with what strength I had left I struck out to make as much progress as possible for the rest of the night . After this experience I tried to stick to roads which appeared to be big highways , and a telephone line along them gave me great assurance . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my lost time ; and finally , after exposing myself to great danger , had to drop in a little wet wood , where I spent a very uncomfortable day . That night ( the night of the 9th and 10th ) , I made my longest stage . I passed through Hauser about 11 o'clock , where , from the road-crossing signboard , I found the main highway to Waldshut . This I followed for the remainder of the night , stopping for the day within a few kilometres of Waldshut . After waking from my first sleep of exhaustion , I found that , where I was lying , I was exposed to the cold mountain wind , and though it was getting light , I walked on for a little distance , in order to find a more protected place to spend the day . Realizing that , if nothing happened , I would come to the passage of the last ditch ? the Rhine ? that night , I ate heavily of my reserve dry strength-producing food . In fact , I had left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-tack biscuits and three lumps of lily precious sugar . Sugar I found to be the very best ration for such a jourEey . Its stimulating effect was quickly felt and heated me better than any food . Before starting that night , I took off all my clothes and put on first those in which I intended to make the swim , adjusting them very snugly and tightly , taking up all slack with strings . Over these I put my other clothing , to keep me warm till the time came . III About eleven o'clock that night of the tenth of October I came to the Rhine at Waldshut . In order to make sure that I was not mistaken in my location , or misled by the signboards along the road , I climbed up on a hill overlooking the city and carefully compared the country below with my map . Having satisfied myself that the country which I saw before me , across the river , was Switzerland , I began to plan to make the swim . In the drawing of our many and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of designating Switzerland . I had labeled the Swiss territory on my map The Promised Land , ' and I wondered , while standing on this mountain looking over into Switzerland , if I , like Moses , would only be allowed thus to look into it . Though I do not think it an admirable trait in a man to expect the Lord to help him out of all tight places , and then not live up to his teachings after he has safely come through , I guess there are not many who have not at some time called upon the assistance of the Lard . Here I thanked Him for having taken care of me thus far , and prayed for his further assistance . From the hill I could get a favorable view of the river for some distance . I risked a place where , because of the bend in the river , I knew that the currentafter hitting this bank would bound back toward the other bank . I determined to undertake the crossing here , just below the bend , because I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddy of comparatively still water , and that as soon as I hit the current it would have a tendency at first to carry me toward the other bank . About a mile downstream , the river took a reverse curve , and here I knew the current would be hard against the opposite bank . I hoped to make the other shore before , or at least by the time , I reached this curve , thus taking the benefit of every possible advantage . When I approached this place , I foun d that the descent to the water would be comparatively easy , also . It was well after midnight by now . I ate the last lumps of my sugar and part of the box of crackers . I was nervous to be off , but wanted to make sure . I lay there and watched for about three hours , and during that time no guard appeared near the spot where I intended to start my swim . The only sound that came up to me was the constant voice of the river . The swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of the whirlpools which came and went here and yonder . It was not such a comfortable sound when one of them would form in front of and near me . As it reached its climax , and the surrounding water filled up the hole made in the centre by the whirlpool , it would send up quite a loud gurgling noise . I did not underestimate the crossing of this last ditch , in the impassableness of which the Germans had so much confidence that they considered no other barrier necessary to protect the frontier . I knew that its swift and treacherous current was made up from the melting snow of the mountains above , and that its temperature was so low that no ordinary constitution was strong enough to withstand it more than a few minutes . I had heard in camp of a little cemetery near Basel , filled with the dead bodies of Russian prisoners who had attempted to swim the river . I had known and considered these things from the beginning , however , and they did not disturb me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from up the river a big searchlight shot its rays over the water for an instant and was gone again . It was by now about four o'clock in the morning . I took off all my clothes , except those in which I intended to try to make the swim , and one O.D. shirt , which I kept on , to hide the whiteness of my undershirt , but all unbuttoned and ready to throw off very quickly . I put my compass , map , and German pictures , which I wished to carry over with me , in my , pocket . I opened in my hand my big knife and started to creep down to the water 's edge . I had not bought this knife with the intention of using it as a means of violence , because violence generally would not pay , and would get one in great difficulty if captured afterwards . I felt , however , that if anyone attempted to stop use just on the border of the Promised Land , I would stop at nothing rather than be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me about an hour to cover the few yards down to the water 's edge . I had to cross a railroad and a road which ran parallel to the river . As I lay just at the edge of the water , like a lizard , with eyes and ears alert ready to slip in , I heard a clock strike five . It was thus that I knew the exact time of crossing the river ; I knew also that I did not have much time to spare , for soon the day would begin to break . After that , all was quiet but the river before me , whose voice was never silent as it tumbled on , with a current in the centre of seven kilometres an hour . I got to my feet and , still crouching low , stepped into the water . As I had expected , near the bank it was practically still . The bank went down steeply , and I saw that I could make no distance wading . I stripped off my O.D. shirt , dropping it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on the opposite bank , and uttering a short , silent prayer , shoved out into the stream . I knew then that I had my liberty . The chance of recapture was past . Either I would soon be on neutral soil and a free citizen , or I would have a place in the little cemetery at Basel . A fter a few strokes , I saw that my shoes about my neck would be too great a hindrance , and I cast them off into the river . For a while I swam quietly but swiftly , expecting any moment to hear an alarm given and to become the target , under the rays of a searchlight , for the German sentries who were sure to be not far away . But nothing of the kind happened , and after a little I felt myself pass from the eddying waters into the swift current , which picked me up and hurled me on at a tremendous rate . I knew then that the time for my utmost effort was at hand . I knew that the treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre , would , after I reached that point , have a similar tendency to hold me in the centre . I laid aside my caution , and raising my arms out of the avatar , put forth my best effort . By this time I began to be affected by the temperature of the water , my head became dizzy , and for a while I thought I was about to lose my grip on myself . All was confusion about me . I feared that I might mistake the bank I had left for the bank I was going toward . I struggled hard to right things in my head and eyes and maintain control of my body . In the background of my mind , I remember , I began to wonder whether , if I were drowned , 1 would be put in the little cemetery with the Russians , or whether they would start an American one . After a few moments , however , I felt better and my head cleared . I threw every ounce of my strength into the effort . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a firmer hold on me . Also , I knew that at any moment I might strike a whirlpool . So I swam as fast as I could . When within about twenty-five feet of the other bank , which was shooting by like scenery out of any express-train window , my hand touched the bottom . I immediately attempted to land , but , t hough the water was not waist-deep , I could not stand against it , and my feet not taking firm hold on the bottom , I was thrown full length down the stream . There I got my first clucking . I soon recovered myself , however , and allowing myself to go clown freely with the current , kicked toward the bank with one foot on the bottom . With every step I went downstream fifteen or twenty feet . After a few steps , and when very close , the bottom again disappeared , and I had to swim . I was in the bend of the river which I had seen from the Mountain on the other side , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like an express train . At first my grasp at the bank was futile ; but I scratched and clawed along for a good many feet , and finally succeeded in stopping the bank . When I pulled myself out , I was not able to stand up . I was very much afraid of falling back in the river in my dizziness . My physical distress was too great , and my danger still too apparent , to enjoy at first the fact that I had reached the neutral shore . I kept on all fours , working my muscles as hard as I could , to stimulate circulation . After a little I was able to crawl up the bank , where I ran around on all fours like a dog , until I was able to stand up . I then took off my wet clothes , wrung them out , and put them on again . On both the Swiss and German sides , the course of the river is here followed rot . by a national highway and a railroad About 500 yards from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which lived the man whose duty it is to raise and lower the gates for the regulation of the traffic at the crossing . I made haste to this house and threw myself on the hospitality of the old man , who met me at his gate . I can never forget the hospitality of this old peasant . He certainly ' came through ' with all that could have been expected of him . In fact , the same is true of every Swiss with whom I came in contact . He took one look at me and knew my story . Paying not the slightest attention to my chattering mixture of French and English , he led me into his house . As he entered , he took off his overcoat and put it around me . He drew a chair before his fire and brought a big pair of wooden-bottom shoes . While doing these things for any comfort , he said nothing and , as he did not stop to try to understand , I too fell silent . Turning to his stove , he poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to nte . I took a few big swallows , and as the warns milk went down , I looked up at hint standing there with the pitcher ready to refill my bowl . Then it was that thankfulness and happiness flowed over me . I will not attempt to say how I felt . From my expression he again saw my feeling . Then it was that he spoke . It was the first time that he had said a word , and although Ise still looked on me with his kindly expression , his words were German . I had thought that the Swiss all spoke French . Instantly a cold dread seized me . My mind flew back to the time , two and a half months ago , when I had first heard that accent . I had been mistaken then as to where I was , and like a ghost the idea seized me that perhaps I was again in the same error . I almost dropped the bowl of milk as that idea stung me . With an effort , I asked him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he was Swiss , this was Switzerland , and I was all right . Life again flowed back into me . I drank the hot milk , and while he refilled my bowl I told hint that I was a Kriegsgefangener American escaped from Germany . This he already knew , except that I was an American . That knowledge increased his interest in me . I asked him for a telephone , that I might telephone Berne . He said that he did not have one , but after breakfast he would take me to the military post nearby , where I could find one . He told me that his wife was away and he was doing the cooking for himself and his two little boys , who , appearing to be about seven and nine years of age , were displaying great interest in me . Of course , I could not speak his Swiss German , but , with a few words and my experience , I can converse on simple and apparent subjects with almost anyone . I warmed myself before his fire while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes breakfast was prepared . He placed a large bowl in the centre of the table , and he and his two boys and I sat about it . Each had a large spoon , and all ate out of the common bowl . That I consider true hospitality , if I ever saw it , and I assure you that I ate my full share . The bowl contained a kind of fried pastry or dumplings , fixed in gravy . To complete the meal , we had bread , a big pitcher of hot goat 's milk , and a pitcher of hot coffee . I filled and refilled my cup , mostly of milk , with a little coffee . The old man urged me to drink all that I wanted . The hot food was to me like water to a man perishing in a desert . It helped to drive out the chill of the river , and I only hope that I was not greedy . Breakfast over , we started out for the military post ? rather a long walk . There a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He brought me a complete outfit of dry clothes . The old peasant was given back his overcoat and shoes , and I was soon dry-clad in a Swiss uniform from shoes to hat . I was again fed . Though I had just had one big breakfast , I felt equal to two , or even more . This post was just across the river from Waldshut . From the windows I could look right over into the German town , and could see the guard at both ends of the railroad bridge . I was informed that , there being only a non-commissioned officer in charge of this post , I would have to be taken to Zurich . While waiting , we went into a cafe , where the soldier bought me a drink of cognac , as I still felt chilled . We got to Zurich about eleven o'clock , after quite an interesting trip . My guard , guide , or companion , whatever you might call him , would explain my identity to people at the different . places where we stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look over and see the German guards along the other bank . At Zurich I went before the commandant . I had to pass a physical examination , and after I had proved myself to have excellent health . he gave a little note to my guard , and sent me out to buy an outfit of clothes . I had dinner here , and at two o'clock was sent by train to Reinfelden , to the commanding general of the frontier . For this trip I was given a new guard . Before parting from the soldier who had been so nice to me , however , seeing that the Swiss government was paying my bills and that I needed no money , I gave him the twenty-mark bill , which was all the real money I had , and asked him to give half of it to the old peasant who had taken me in , and keep the other half for the use of his clothes . I was then sent out to ? , where I again found my credit unlimited . I ate a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOSE WHO MAKE THEM OH into a good feather-bed . I had said to the landlord during dinner that I had been unable to get entirely warns since coming out of the river . My chill had been so great that I had never got my blood to circulating right . Every now and then a cold shiver would run over me , though there was no reason for my being cold . When I got into this bed , I found the biggest hot-water bottle in there that I ever saw . The landlord meant to see that I got ' thawed out . ' It had been two and a half months since I had been in a comfortable bed , and five nights since I had been in any . You may imagine from that how I felt when I crawled into this one . I sank down in it , and if ever a man was happy , I was . With this perfect physical comfort was combined the knowledge that I had won my freedom . I thanked the Lord for my deliverance , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-water bottle , did the work . I got so warm that night that I have IA felt cold since . The next morning a Swiss officer called for me and we went to Berne . The American military attache had been notified , and Captain Davis , assistant military attache , met us at the train . He did not recognize me , however , in my rustic civilian clothing , as the man he came to meet , and we missed him . The Swiss officer and I went on to the Swiss headquarters . We were just going in when Captain Davis caught us . I was in hopes that others of the bunch had come through , and , having taken an unnecessarily long time myself to avoid danger of recapture , I expeCted to find them there ahead of me . None , however , had arrived . Captain Davis told me that I was the first American army officer to escape , and almost the first soldier . One doughboy , Frank Soviki , had come into Switzerland two days before , and was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
