txt With the capture yesterday of 2,000 to 3,000 prisoners , tl total captures by the Italian forces during their counteroffensive are brought up to about 18,000 men . A single episode shows how and why the Austrian retreat started . On Saturday the Austrian command sent the 91st Schuetzen Brigade , composed of Regiments Nos. 31 and 32 , with orders to widen the Austrian breach at Lampol and to do this at all hazards . The brigade attempted to carry out this order and fought like wild men , but the Italian pressure was so terrific that they were unable to accomplish their object , which was to succor the Austrian divisions already surrounded in this section . After six attacks , which continued Saturday night and Sunda y morting there remained at 1 o'clock Monday afternoon only ninety men of this brigade . The others were either prisoners , wounded . or dead . The COMmanding officer then committed suicide and the ninety surrendered . It is estimated that the ' number of Austrians on the western bank of the Piave when the retreat began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , could do nothing against the Italian pressure , despite continuous counterattacks , and under the fire of Italian machine guns and artillery , which were brought up rapidly , the withdrawal across the Piave soon became a disorderly rout . In fleeing the Austrians left behind them much war material . They even threw away their rifles and deserted hundreds of machine guns which were to have been used to protect the retirement . It ' was a terrible sight as the maddened Austrians fled under the deluge of Italian bullets and shells . They leaped into the river and grabbed pieces of wood or anything that would aid them ; they tied themselves to mules and horses , but their efforts were in vain , for as the enemy troops reached the opposite bank they were again caught by the fire of Italian guns which had been trained accurately on ' the eastern bank for some days . On the Montello the slaughter was terrific . Bodies of Austrian troops were mowed down almost in their entirety . At the crossing at Nervesa both banks of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies were carried down in the current to the sea . At one place the correspondent counted 300 bodies while walking a distance of half a Along the lower Piave the Austrians found themselves , if possible , in a worse position and suffered heavier losses . The Duke of Aosta 's Third Army in the Capo Sile region continued yesterday cleaning the positions that had been occupied by the Austrians , picking up the abandoned war material , burying the masses of dead , and reorganizing the entire defense system , which had been badly cut up during the last tea days . The silence of death , it might be said , now prevails along the greater part of the Piave River region . The scene at Some places where the fighting had been extremely severe , such as the Montello region , was one of awful confusion . From this region to , the sea , also , every little village near the fighting line was a ruin , with hardly a house with one stone or brick left in place , the dead being mixed up With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are familiar with the Ypres and other sectors in Flanders , and likewise with the swamps on . the Russian front state that nothing worse in the way of death , destruction , and canfusion had ever been witnessed there than in these river regions in Northeastern Italy . The Piave River situation is now as it was before the Austrian offensive began on June 15 , except that the Italians are making progress in extending their bridgeheads at Capo Sile . Tales of heroism among the Italian troops are numerous . There is the case of Lieutenant Tuffolino , who lost his right hand eight months ago on the Cargo , but insisted upon joining in a machine gun attack upon Cape Sile . He was wounded in this assault , and fell crying , " Viva Italia . " A balloon observer , whose mooring cable was cut by a shell , leaped from the basket , ' supported by his parachute , sod favored by a breeze from off the sea descended within the Italian lines . The balloon got into an opposite current and . was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artillery. - man , who was cut-down by an Austrian shell , and when , dying was visited by the battery . commander . , When , asked how he felt the artilleryman neglected to reply to the question , but demanded instead : " Are our guns still firing ? " It was a common thing during the bushwhacking variety of fighting that was going on for corps commanders to find therfiselves occupying the first line , together with the artillery batteries , the infantry having lost itself while engaged in some counterattack . An instance of such mixups occurred during the battle preceding the ' Austrian retreat , when a General commanding a corps placed himself with an assault battalion of infantry , and went into the attack as if he were an ordinary Major . The Italians take their losses bravely . Here and there an army commander tells with regret of the loss of such and such a valued officer , but makes no further comment . An official chemical examination of the black bread eaten by the Austrian soldiers who were in this campaign showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ground-up wood fibre , straw , hay , and other unidentified ingredients .
