TO-DAY the noble-hearted : American nation is asking on its own account the question which , for nearly three years DOW , the French nation has been asking itself : What will be the outcome of this war , which is modifying our national soul ? What manner of men will come back to us from the trenches when victory has been won ? ' For two years and a half , our young soldiers have been learning the lessons of war ; shoulder to shoulder they have been winning their manhood , their eral.e ( mem , their promotions . They are being formed on the same model ; they are being initiated into the rules of discipline and system ; they are amassing a treasure of sober thoughts , and friendships which will suffice for ( lie whole duration of their lives . By virtue of their profound impressions , their first tremendous experiences , every man of them belongs now and for all time to the world of the trenches . Such an education means a France unified anti purified . In these young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some great thing is about to come into being .

Better far to call some of them in person from the ranks ? youths chosen at random from t he length and breadth or France ; they shall speak to us themselves , let us see , with no barrier between us , the boundless goodwill shining from their faces . Let us listen to these soldier-boys , beloved of their comrades , unknown to their commanders , lost in the rank and file , as they open their hearts to their families .

In his diary ? the date is January I , 1916 he writes , ? " 1'o-day begins the new year . It will be the year of victory .

" Let soul and heart obliterate the animal instincts and the revolt of one 's baser nature . A man must hold up to himself some great dream to follow , sonic goal to reach . And what is this war for , if not to train character ? It has developed within me feelings I tun proud of , though I am at a loss to say why . ' I am proud of being a soldier , of being young , of knowing that I am brave high-spirited ; I am proud of serving France , the land of my birth .

Every one of these pages , taken from the field-diaries of our young soldiers , is a variant of the same high theme : there are no two identical leaves in the whole vast forest , but each one , in these clays of storm , yearns to conic fluttering down to earth , that earth may be the richer for their fall . These boys consecrate themselves to the most glorious destiny . And so , while they are making the France of to-morrow , France herself is being made in them . Already this miracle is manifest on the surface of their lives , in t heir words , in their acts . 0 blessed augury ! I have no wish to make the mistake of classifying their aspirations , their flights of soul , and of crystallizing too hastily this free and flexible spirit . Let us watch the young sensibilities of these soldiers as they live and breathe and take color ; and from day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions they share with their families , we shall see that their instincts are beginning to work with the harmony and co rd illation of some great mechanism .

Li ? o l , atil left his home at Aix-en-Provence , where , near his family , he was studying for his degree of doctor of philosophy under the guidance of Maurice InKmdel , the far-famed author of VAetion .

' I know of no pastoral poetry more limpid , more crystal-clear than these letters , in which one seems to catch a fleet ing glimpse of Cowper 's hare , : nal the partridges of Francis Jimmies . Our young warrior watches them flash past with his good-humored smile : " Fite one thought that helps me through all trials is that . we are spending every moment close to Nature , and growing to know her as no mere civilian could ever hope to do .

In these Meuse woods , Nvhich I call My woods , I ha VC seen every little leaf born , every copse turn green anew . They shelter me and protect me when the ordeal is a t. hand . ' This fellowship with Nature  --  frequent enough among our young soldiers - ? is touching indeed . In her they find a mother whom boys of their age , in it happier life , are slow to recognize .

But Mutt is the end of their sylvan intoxication ? Leo Latil turns it to good account. : I am determined to set , free those hillsides , those tree-lops waving rhythmically behind the enemy 's trenches . ' He repeats the thought . later . This fusion of calm , peaceful impressions of the INfeuse woodlands with the burning spirit . of sacrifice stirs one almost to t he point of anguish .

As for us , we were cracking jokes ; I swaggered about , with my American pipe between my teeth . Once more , for the last time , we drank each other 's healthy and kissed cheeks wet withtears ; I hen we filed out into the darkness , dragging our gun-stocks over the floor .

The lit tle boys of the village , however , who were always ( railing along behind us , swarmed up the trees and shook them . What a downpour of plums - ; td . how good I hey were !

They are such splendid fellows , so many of them ! And besides , i love this solitude with its tang of bitterness , these ceaseless mortifications of the flesh , these moods of the purified soul , ever ready for prayer . ' Thus , in the hind of Saint . LoMs , of Jeanne d ' Are foul Pascal , speaks a young soldier gently born , who combines , after the high French manner , the Ihrcegiftsof dreaming , of generosity , and of a soaring spirit . A perfect young man ! On the evening of September 27 , 1915 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German trench , west of the farm of Navarin , in Champagne , as he was leading t he bayonet-charge of a section of the 67th Regiment , whose lieutenant had just been killed . And now lei us see and hear Alfred C'azalis , the son and grandson of missionary clergymen . Alfred ( - ' , 117M.118 is the very spirit of tender , stirring orthodoxy , of dogma translated into charity and sympathy it ( ine , lovable boy who says to God , " 1 . ' 0 Thee I belong , and to all my brothers . ' Eighteen years old , and bred in a very fervor of religion , he brings all his heart 's devotion to his war-life , so pitifully short . To this noble young Calvinist , the vision conies in a remarkable form ; but burning within is the longing , shared alike by all these soldier-boys , to create a more transcendently lovely France . ' First and foremost , ' he says , ' my preoccupation has been with the righteousness of this war . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right is on our side . But this war must not be sterile ; from all these deaths t here must burst forth new life for numkind . ' I think ceaselessly of the France of to-morrow , of that young France whose hour is at hand . A consecrated France it must be , in which there will be no purpose in life save 1 ) uty . Men will live only in so far as they realize theirduty and strive to fulfill it . And it is for its Protestants ? or rather , for us believers to reveal this new life to the world . ' Our duty , then , is to go forth as apostles . Our duty is plain ; Jesus has defined it : " Re ye perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect . " Perfect through ourselves ? tlutt is , developing our personalities to their utmost limit , making them yield the last least thing of which they are capable , and bringing them up to the ideal stature of Christ . Then , too , perfect through others ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) , which means praying for them , t hat they may learn to bend conscience and will before t he kingly will of God . ' These are his first thoughts ; this is the abiding faith of this boy , steeped as he is in the religious spirit of his home . Day by day , during his short apprenticeship to life , he devotes himself passionately to learning the lesson of facts . While in barracks , he writes ,  --  ' I am trying to profit by these days of rest to prepare myself still more fully . I have time to read and meditate . Each morning , I try to get away to the hillsides to pray , and as evening comes on , I go to the church for a moment to collect my thoughts . ' Above all , however , he tries to know what action means . ' I have often dreamed , ' he writes , ' of that hour when I shall enter into reality . ' One day , in the trenches , his thoughts turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I find it infinitely sweet. , in moments like this , to feel that there are others close by us , who , if we should fall by the way , will snatch up and hold high the blazing torch which we have been carrying forward . ' Suddenly he breaks off , and the sinister birds take flight . ' Others ! ' he says . ' Have I not too much faith in life and its preciousness to be content with that hypothesis ? It is not for death that I would prepare myself , but for life . For life eternal , no doubt , but for the more immediate mat ter of earthly life as well . When war is over and I go home , I must lie a changed being . I shall have no right to be as I formerly was ? or the lesson will all have been in vain . Through the war mankind must be reborn , and is it not our duty to be reborn first of all ? ' Thus he reconciles tragic eventualities with h his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer , and that even beyond the grave he will toil on and pursue into eternity itself his earthly spiritual task . ' A grave moment is at hand . ' Ehere is to be a bayonet , charge . If I do not come hack , one thing only I ask : may the tiny flame of consecrated forces which was in me descend upon those whom I loved and who loved Inc ? upon all my comrades in faith and in toil . ' Then follows another utterance , equally syhilline : ? ' Already I feel a change coming over me . The abstract being which was in me is falling asunder , and numberless realities of the spiritual order which were once mere phantoms are becoming flesh and blood to me through an experience which is renewed every instant . I am learning to live . ' What , does this mean ? What is this life whose meaning this boy is learning at the same time that he learns to die ? That is the great secret . But I seem to listen in amazement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells us , may he a ceaseless elimination , a progression , a development , which commences here below and continues when the spirit , taking flight into the heavens , fully unfolds that which was its essential inner nature . Eternal life ( if I understand this mysterious young Levite aright ) is not rest , but a prolongation of the noble task begun on earth . Earthly life is a rough sketch , so to speak , of the deathless existence , and suffers no change of quality beyond the grave . After dissolution , men will continue to act . The young soldiers who have fallen for France will take up again the sacred work of their country . Beneath these charmingly inadequate words ( one ! night fancy them a stumbling t ranslat ion of t he Cant ique des Anges ' ) I see with admiration how complete has been the victory , in these young hearts , of war-time discipline over the seedling anarchy in which we found so much beauty only yesterday . What a wild yearning toward group-life ! How urgent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indissoluble union wills souls capable of creation ! What . a splendid determination to make one 's self eternally at one with the best ! Four days before his death t his spiritual boy , stirred by some presentiment , set about coming to conclusions with his soul and recapitulating his deepest experiences : First of all , my experience of men . In these hours when , every instant , one 's life is in peril , they show themselves in their true colors , with no fake semblance either of evil or of good . Everything within them that is mere factitious acquisition or pretense is sloughed off ; and so one gets to know men 's souls under conditions that doubtless will never recur again . ' Then , my experience of the communion of saints . Never a moment when I did not feel close to my people , to all those that I love ; never should have believed that , in spite of great distances , they could seem as near as the men who are fighting at my side . " Thus it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a realization of the marvelous and incomparable worth of prayer . ' Four days later , on May 9 , 11t15 , at Roclincourt in Artois , Alfred Cavalis died by the side of his lieutenant. , in a bayonet-charge . Isis major , who was himself to fall three days later , wrote at 1 he time to Pastor ( . ! azalis , I mourn all my beloved young soldiers , but above all your son , who prayed wit h me the evening before bat t le .
