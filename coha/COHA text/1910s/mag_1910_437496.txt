OUR finding our Chambers was the merest chance . One day on the way to the Underground , J. and I saw the notice , " To Let , " in windows above the Embankment Gardens by the River , and knew at a glance that we should be glad to spend the rest of our lives looking out of them . But something depended on what we looked out from , and as the notice also said , " Apply to the Housekeeper , " we went at once to ask her to show us what was behind them . The house was all that we could have hoped : as simple in architecture , with bricks as time-stained , as the courts of the Temple or Gray 's Inn . The front door opened into a hall twisted with age , its sloping roof supported by carved corbels , the upper part of the door at the far end filled with bull's-eye glass , and no housekeeper could have been more in place than the little old white-haired woman who answered our ring . She ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just the right touch of dignity and deference , until we explained our errand , when she flew into a rage and told us in a tone that challenged us to dispute it , " You know , no coal is to be carried upstairs after ten o'clock in the morning . " Coal was as yet so remote that we would have agreed to anything in our impatience to look out of the windows , and , reassured by us , the became the obsequious housekeeper again , getting the keys , toiling with us up three flights of stairs , unlocking the double door , ? for there was an " oak " to sport , ? ushering us into Chambers that Adam mantelpieces and decorations made worthy of the windows , dropping the correct " Sir " and " Madam " into her talk , accepting without a tremor the shilling it embarrassed us to slip into her venerable hand , and realizing so entirely our idea of what a housekeeper in London Chambers ought to be , that her outbreak over the coal we had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing . I understood it before we were settled in our Chambers ? for , of course , we took them . But they were not really ours until after a long delay over the legal formalities with which the English love to entangle their simplest transactions at somebody 's else expense ; a longer one in proving our personal and financial qualifications , the landlord being disturbed by a suspicion that , like the Housekeeper 's daughter , we were in the profession and spent most of our time " resting " ; and the longest of all over the British Workman , who , once he got in , threatened never to get out . In the meanwhile we saw the Housekeeper almost every day . We did not have to see her often to discover that she was born a housekeeper , that she had but one thought in life , and that this was the house under her charge . I am sure she believed that she came into the world to take care of it , unless indeed it was built to be taken care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had not yet been taught the folly of inte'rest in their work , and she was old-fashioned enough to feel the importance of the post she filled . She would have lost her self-respect had she failed in the slightest detail of her duty to the house . From the first the spotless marvel she made of it divided our admiration with our windows . The hall and front steps were immaculate , the white stone stairs shone , there was not a speck of dust anywhere , and I appreciated the work this meant in an old London building , where the dirt not only filters through doors and windows , but oozes out of the walls and comes up through the floors . She did not pretend to hide her despair when our painters and paperers tramped- and blundered in and out ; she fretted herself ill when our furniture was brought up the three flights of her shining stairs . Painters and paperers and the bringing up of furniture were rare incidents in the life of a tenant and had to be endured . But coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , and at least could be regulated . This was why , after her daily cleaning was done , she refused to let it pass . Once we were established , we saw her less often . The daily masterpiece was finished in the morning before we were up , and at all times she effaced herself with the respect she owed to tenants of a house in which she was the servant . If we did meet her she acknowledged our greeting with ostentatious humility , for she clung with as little shame to servility as to cleanliness ; servility was also a part of the business of a housekeeper , just as elegance was the mark of the profession which her daughter graced , and the shame would have been not to be as servile as the position demanded . This daughter was in every way an elegant person , dressing with a deference to fashion I could not hope to emulate , and with the help of a fashionable dressmaker I could not afford to pay . She was " resting " from the time we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in the profession it is a misfortune to be out of work , it is a crime to look it , and her appearance and manner gave no hint of unemployment . In an emergency , she would bring us up a message or a letter , but her civility had none of her mother 's obsequiousness ; it was a condescension , and she made us feel the honor she conferred upon the house by living in it . The Housekeeper , for all her deference to the tenants , was a despot , and none of us dared to rebel against her rule and disturb the order she maintained . To anybody coming in from the not too respectable little street the respectability of the house was overwhelming , and I often noticed that strangers , on entering , lowered their voices and stepped more softly . The hush of repose hung heavy on the public hall and stairs , whatever was going on behind the two doors that faced each other on every landing . We all emulated her in the quiet and decorum of our movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three months I still knew little of the others except their names on their doors , the professions of those who had offices and hung up their signs , and the frequency with which the Church League on the First Floor drank afternoon tea . On certain days , when I went out towards five o'clock , I had to push my way through a procession of bishops in aprons and gaiters , deans and ordinary parsons who were legion , of dowagers and duchesses who were as sands on the stairs . I may be wrong , but I fancy that the Housekeeper would have found a way to rout this weekly invasion if , in the aprons and gaiters , she had not seen symbols of the respectability which was her pride . What I did not find out about the deleted material stretched arms . For some unknown reason J. ' s huge schube was on another chair ? I threw it into the arms of the young man 's servant , who staggered under its unexpected weight . I rushed to my desk to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern flashed upon me and a policeman ordered me out . Firemen ? for London firemen do eventually arrive if the fire burns long enough ? were dragging up a hose as I flew downstairs and the policeman had scarcely pushed me into the Housekeeper 's room , the young man had just deposited the drawings at my feet , and the servant the schube , when the stairs became a raging torrent . I had not thought of the Housekeeper till then ; after that there was no thinking of anything else . My dread of never again seeing our Chambers was nothing to her sense of the outrage to her house . Niobe weeping for her children was not so tragic a spectacle as she lamenting over the ruin of plaster and paint that did not belong to her . She was half dressed , propped up against cushions on a couch , sniffing the salts and sipping the water administered by her daughter , who had taken the time to dress carefully and elegantly for the scene . " Oh , what shall I do ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw me , wringing her hands with an abandonment that would have made her daughter 's fortune on the stage . Her sitting-room had been appropriated as a refuge for the tenants , and this sudden reunion was my introduction to them . As the room was small , my first impression was of a crowd , though in actual numbers we were not many . The young man whose distinction was that the fire originated in his Chambers , and myself , represented the Third Floor , Front and Back . The architect and his clerks of the Second Floor Front were at home in their beds , unconscious of the deluge pouring into their office ; the Second Floor Back had gone away on a holiday . The Church League of the First Floor Front , haunted by bishops and deans , duchesses and dowagers , was of course closed , and we were deprived of whatever spiritual consolation their presence might have provided . But the First Floor Back filled the little room with her loud voice and portly presence . She had attired herself for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , for all her efforts , would not meet over the vast expanse of gray Jaeger vest beneath , and her thin wisps of gray hair were drawn up under a green felt hat of the pattern I wore for bicycling . I looked at it regretfully ; mine , which I forgot , would have completed my costume . I complimented her on her forethought , but " What could I do ? " she said , " they flurried me so I could n't find my false front anywhere , and I had to cover my head with something . " It was extraordinary how a common danger broke down the barrier of reserve we had hitherto so carefully cultivated . She had her own salts which she shared with us all , when she did not need them for the Housekeeper , whom she kept calling " Poor dear ! " and who , after every " Poor dear ! " went off into a new attack of hysterics . The Ground Floor Front , a thin , spry , old gentleman , hovered about us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather house . He was in the insurance business , I was immediately informed , and it seemed a comfort to us all to know it , though I can not for the life of me imagine why it should have been to me , not one stick or stitch up there in our Chambers being insured . The Ground Floor Back was at his club , and his wife and two children had not been disturbed , as in their Chambers the risk was not immediate , and , anyway , they could easily walk out should it become so . He had been promptly sent for , and when a message came back that he was playing whist and would hurry to the rescue of his family as soon asoliie ? rubber was finished , the ' indignation in the Housekeeper 's little room was intense . " Brute ! " the Housekeeper said , and after that , through the rest of the night , she would ask every few minutes if he had returned , and the answer in the negative was fresh fuel to her wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man whose Chambers were blazing , and who confessed he had gone out toward midnight leaving a burning candle in one of his rooms . He treated the fire as a jest , which she could not forgive ; and when at dawn , after boasting that account-books committed to his care were now no doubt in ashes , he wished us good-morning and good-bye , she did not hesitate to see in the fire his method of disposing of records it was convenient to be rid of . Indignation served better than salts to rouse the Housekeeper from her hysterics , and without this distraction she could not long have remained unconscious of another evil that I look back to as the deadliest of all . For , gradually through her room , by this time close to suffocation , there crept the most terrible smell . It took hold of me , choked me , sickened me . The Housekeeper 's daughter and the First Floor Back blanched under it , the Housekeeper turned from white to green . I have often marveled since that they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . For it was I who sent that smell downstairs when I threw the Russian schube into the arms of the Third Floor Front 's servant . Odors , they say , are the best jogs to memory , and the smell of the schube is for me so inextricably associated with the fire , that I can never think of one without remembering the other . It was the chief treasure among the fantastie'eostumes it is J. 's joy to collect on his travels . His Hungarian sheepskins , French hooded capes , Swiss blouses , Spanish berets , Scotch Tam o ' Shanters , Dalmatian caps , Roumanian embroidered shirts , and the rest , I can dispose of by packing them out of sight and dosing them with camphor . But no trunk was big enough to hold the Russian schube , and its abominable smell , even when reinforced by tons of camphor and pepper , could not frighten away the moths . It was picturesque , so much I admit in its favor , and Whistler 's lithograph of J. draped in it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eighteen years , during which time J. wore the schube just twice , ? once to pose for the lithograph and once on a winter night in London , when its weight was a far more serious discomfort than the cold . Occasionally , he exhibited it to select audiences . A t all other times it hung in a colossal linen bag made especially to hold it . The eighteenth summer , when the bag was opened for the periodical airing and brushing , no schube was there : not a shred of fur remained , the cloth was riddled with holes ; it had fallen before its hereditary foe : the moths had devoured it . For this had I toiled over it ; for this had I rescued it on the night of the fire as if it were my crowning jewel ; for this had I braved the displeasure of the Housekeeper , from which indeed I escaped only because , at the critical moment , the policeman who had ordered me downstairs appeared to say that the lady from the Third Floor Back could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall under which I ascended . The two doors of our Chambers were wide open , with huge gaps where panels had been , the young man 's servant having carefully shut them after me in our flight , thinking , I suppose , that the firemen would stand upon ceremony , and ask for the key before venturing in . A river was drying up in our hall , and the strip of matting down the centre was sodden . Empty soda-water bottles rolled on the floor , though it speaks well for London firemen that nothing stronger was touched . Candles were stuck upside down in our hanging Dutch lamp , and all available candlesticks , curtains , and blinds were pulled about , chairs were upset , the marks of muddy feet were everywhere . I ought to have been grateful , and I was , that the damage was so small , all the more when I went again on to the leads and saw the blackened heap to which the night had reduced the young man 's Chambers . But the place was inexpressibly cheerless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to bed , too early to go to work . I was hungry , and the baker had not come , nor the charwoman . I was faint , the smell of the schube was strong in my nostrils , though the schube itself was now safely locked up in a remote cupboard . I wandered disconsolately from room to room , when , of a sudden , there appeared at my still open front door a gorgeous vision ? a large and stately lady , fresh and neat , arrayed in flowing red draperies , with a white lace fichu carelessly thrown over a mass of luxuriant golden hair . I stared , speechless with amazement . It was not until she spoke that I recognized the First Floor Back , who had had time to lay her hands not only on a false front , but on a whole wig , and who had had the enterprise to make tea which she invited me to drink with her in Pepys 's Chambers , where the Housekeeper , who had hitherto discouraged VOL. 105 - N O. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . After the first excitement , after the house had resumed as well as it could its usual habits , the Housekeeper remained absorbed in her grief . Hitherto her particular habit was to work , and she had been able , unaided , to keep the house up to her immaculate standard of perfection . But now to restore it to order was the affair of builders , of plasterers and painters and paperers . There was nothing for her to do save to sit with hands folded and watch the sacrilege . Her occupation was gone , and all was wrong with the world . I was busy during the days immediately after the fire . I had to insure our belongings , which , of course , being insured , have never run such a risk again . I had to prepare and pack for the journey to France , now many days overdue , and , what with one thing or another , I neglected the Housekeeper . When at last I was ready to shut up our Chambers and start , and I called at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk and wilted , though she had preserved enough of the proper spirit to pocket the substantial tip I slipped into her hand with the keys . She was no less equal to accepting a second when , after a couple of months , I returned and could not resist this expression of my sympathy on finding the hall still stained and defaced , the stairs still with their blackened groove , the workmen still going and coming , and her despair at the spectacle blacker than ever . The next day she came up to our Chambers . She wore her best black gown and no apron , and from these signs I concluded it was a visit of state . I was right : it was to announce her departure . The house , partially rebuilt and very much patched up , would never be the same . She was too old for hope , and without the courage to pick up the broken bits of her masterpiece and put them together again . She was more ill at ease as visitor than as housekeeper . The conversation languished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slight as was her success in saying it . We had both been silent for an awkward minute when she blurted out abruptly that she had never neglected her duty , no matter what it might or might not have pleased the tenants to give her . I applauded the sentiment as admirable , and I said good-bye ; and never once then , and not until several days after she left us , did it dawn upon me that she was waiting to accept graciously the fee it was her right in leaving to expect from me . The fact of my having only just tipped her liberally had nothing to do with it . A housekeeper 's departure was an occasion for money to pass from the tenants ' hand into hers , and she had too much respect for her duty as housekeeper not to afford me the opportunity of doing mine as tenant . It was absurd , but I was humiliated in my own eyes when I thought of the figure I must cut in hers , and I could only hope she would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for a housekeeper of her type , like certain wines , to mature ; and I knew that in the best sense of the word she could never be replaced , though the knowledge did not prepare me for her successor . Mrs. Haines was a younger and apparently stronger woman , but she was so casual in her dress , and so eager to emulate the lilies of the field , as to convince me that it was not in her , under any conditions , to mature into a housekeeper at all . It expressed much , I thought , that while the old housekeeper had always been " the Housekeeper , " we never knew Mrs. Haines by any name but her own . The fact that she had a husband was her recommendation to the landlord , who had been alarmed by the fire , and the hysterics into which it threw " the Housekeeper , " and now insisted upon a man in the family as an indispensable qualification for the post . The advantage might have been more obvious had Mr. Haines not spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping them to forget his presence in the house . He was not an ill-looking nor ill-mannered man , and shyness was the only explanation that occurred to me for his perseverance in avoiding us . Work could not force him from his retirement . Mrs. Haines said that he was a carpenter by trade , but the only ability I ever knew him to display was in evading whatever job I was hopeful enough to offer him . Besides , though it might be hard to say what I think a carpenter ought to look like , I was certain he did not look like one , and others shared my doubts . The rumor spread through our street ? where everybody rejoices in the knowledge of everything about everybody else who lives in it ? that he had once been in the Civil Service , but had married beneath him , and come down in the world , How the rumor originated I never asked , or never was told if I did ask ; but it was so evident that he shrank from the practice of the carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Fisher Unwin ? who shares our love of the neighborhood to the point , not only of living in it , but of publishing from it ? asking if some sort of a place could not he found for him in the office . It was found , I am afraid to his disappointment , for he never made any effort to fill it , and was more diligent than ever in keeping out of our way . As the months went on , he was never caught cleaning anything or doing anything in the shape of work , except sometimes , furtively as if afraid of being detected in the act , shutting the front door NS hen the clocks of the neighborhood struck eleven . He was far less of a safeguard to us than I often fancied he thought we were to him . Mrs. Haines was sufficiently unlike lies to account for one part of the rumor . She was coarse in appearance and disagreeable in manner , always on the defensive , always on the verge of flying into a temper . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was perpetually about , hunting for faults to find ; but she did object to showing herself with a broom or a duster , a pail or a scrubbing-brush , in her hands . I shuddered sometimes at the thought of the shock to the old housekeeper if she were to see her hall and stairs . We could bring up coal now at any hour , or all day long . And yet Mrs. Haines tyrannized over us in her own fashion , and her tyranny was the more unbearable because it had no end except to spare herself trouble . Her one thought was to do nothing and get paid for it . She resented extra exertion without extra compensation . We never had been so bullied about coal under the old regime as we were under hers about a drain-pipe with a trick of overflowing . It might have drowned us in our Chambers , and she would not have stirred to save us ; but its outlet was in a little paved court hack of her kitchen , which it was one of her duties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank injustice . She held the tenants in turn responsible , and would descend upon us like a Fury upbraiding us for our carelessness . It would never have surprised me had she ordered us down to clean up the court for her . I must in fairness add that when extra exertion meant extra money she did not shirk it . Nor was she without accomplishments . She was an excellent needlewoman : she altered and renovated more than one gown for me , she made me chair-covers , she mended my carpets . During the first year she was in the house she never refused any needlework and often she asked me for more . She would come up and wait for me at table on the shortest notice . In an emergency she would even cook me a dinner which , in its colorless English way , was admirable . There is no denying that she could be useful , but her usefulness had a special tariff . It was also in her favor that she was a lover of cats , and their regard for her was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the best of terms with hers , Bogie by name , a tall ungainly tabby , very much the worse for wear . He spent a large part of his time on the street ; and often , as I came or went , he would be returning home , and would ask me , in a way not to be resisted , to ring her door-bell for him . Sometimes I waited to exchange a few remarks with him , for , though his voice was husky and not one of his attractions , he always had plenty to say . On these occasions I was a witness of his pleasure in seeing his mistress again , though his absence might have been short , and of her enthusiasm in receiving him . Unquestionably they understood each other , and cats are animals of discrimination . She extended her affection to cats that did not belong to her , and ours came in for many of her attentions . Our Jimmie , who had the freedom of the streets , often paid her a visit on his way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done if she had not made the time pass agreeably ; for if he , like all cats , disliked to be bored , he knew better than most how to avoid the possibility . One of his favorite haunts was the near Strand , probably because he was sure to meet his friends there . It was a joy to him , if we had been out late in the evening , to run across us as we returned . With a fervent " mow " of greeting , he was at our side ; and then , his tail high in the air and singing a song of rapture , he would come with us to our front door , linger until he had seen us open it , when , his mind at rest for our safety , he would hurry back to his revels . We considered this a privilege , and our respect for Mrs. Haines was increased when he let her share it even in the daytime . He was known to join her in the Strand , not far from Charing Cross , walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely while she bought tickets at the Lyceum for one of the tenants , cross again and walk back with her . He was also known to sit down in the middle of the Strand , and divert the traffic better than a " Bobby , " until Mrs. Haines , when everybody else had failed , enticed him away . He deserved the tribute of her teaks , and she shed many , when the " Vet " kindly released him from the physical ruin to which exposure and a life of dissipation reduced him . William Penn showed her the same friendliness , but from him it was not so marked , for he was a cat of democratic tastes and , next to his family , preferred the people who worked for them . He had not as much opportunity for his civilities as Jimmie , never being allowed to leave our Chambers . But when Mrs. Haines was busy in our kitchen he occupied more than a fair portion of her time , for which she made no reduction in the bill . William 's charms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say nothing , and her last kindness of all when he died ? in his case of too luxuriant living and too little exercise , the " Vet " said ? would make me forgive her much worse . According to my friend , Miss Repplier , a cat " considers dying a strictly private affair . " But William Penn 's deathbed was a public affair , at least for Augustine and myself , who sat up with him through the night of his agony . We were both exhausted by morning , unfit to cope with the problem of his funeral . Chambers are without any convenient corner to serve as cemetery , and I could not entrust the most important member of the family to the dust-man for burial . I do not know what I should have done but for Mrs. Haines . It was she who arranged , by a bribe I would willingly have doubled , that during the dinner hour , when the head-gardener was out of the way , William should be laid to rest in the garden below our windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? J. was abroad , ? when , from above , we watched the assistant gardener lower him into his little grave under the tree where the wood-pigeons have their nest . If I try now to make the best of what was good in her , at the time she did not give me much chance . Grumbling was such a habit with her that even had the Socialists ' Millennium come she would have kept on , if only because it removed all other reason for her grumbles . Her prejudice against work of any kind did not lessen her displeasure with everybody who did not provide her with work of some kind to do . She treated me as if I imposed on her when I asked her to sew or to wait or to cook , and she abused the other tenants because they did not ask her to . She paid me innumerable visits , the object of which never varied . It was to borrow , which she did without shame or apology . She never hesitated in her demands , she never cringed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair and square thing by her , and she did not see why she should not draw upon me for help . One inexhaustible debt was the monthly bill for her furniture , bought on the installment system and forfeited if any one installment were not met . I do not remember hoW many pounds I advanced , but enough to suggest that she had furnished her rooms , of which she never gave me as much as a glimpse , in a style far beyond her means . I could afford to be amiable , for I knew I could make her pay me back in work , though my continual loans did so little to improve her financial affairs that after a while my patience gave out , and I refused to advance another penny . It was not until the illness of her husband , after they had been in the house some two years , that I realized the true condition of things behind the door they kept so carefully closed . The illness was sudden , so far as I knew . I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not seeing him , and curiously , when Mrs. Haines 's need was greatest , she showed some reluctance in asking to be helped out of it . Her husband was dying before she appealed to anybody , and then it was not to me , but to my old charwoman , who was so poor that I had always fancied that to be poorer still meant to live in the streets or on the rates . But Mrs. Haines was so much worse off , that the old charwoman , in telling me about it , thanked Our Lord ? she was a devout Catholic ? that she had never fallen so low . It was cold winter and there was no fire , no coal , no wood behind the closed door . The furniture for which I had advanced so many pounds consisted , I now found out , of two or three rickety chairs and a square of tattered carpet in the front room , a few pots and pans in the kitchen . In the dark bedroom between , the dying man lay on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering under his threadbare overcoat , so pitiful in his misery and suffering that the old charwoman was moved to corn- passion and hurried home to fetch him the blankets from her own bed and buy him a pennyworth of milk on the way . When the tenants knew how it was with Mrs. Haines and her husband , as now they could not help knowing , they remembered only that he was ill , and they sent for the doctor and paid for medicine , and did what they could to lighten the gloom of the two or three days left to him . And they arranged for a decent burial , feeling , I think , that a man who ? as it was remembered ? had been in the Civil Service should not lie in a pauper 's grave . For a week or so we wondered again who he was , why he kept so persistently out of sight ; after that we thought as little of him as when he had skulked , a shadow , between his rooms and the street door on the stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was alone in the world . The landlord overlooked his announced decision " to sack the pair , " and retained her as Housekeeper , though in losing her husband she had lost her principal recommendation . The tenants raised a fund to enable her to buy the mourning which is often a consolation in widowhood . Work was offered to her in Chambers which she had never entered before , and I doubled the tasks in ours . The housekeepers in the street with families to support must have envied her . Mrs. Haines , however , did not see her position in that light . She had complained when work was not offered to her , she complained more bitterly when it was . Perhaps her husband had had some restraining influence upon her . I can not say ; but certainly once he was gone , she gave up all pretence of controlling her temper . She would sweep like a hurricane through the house , raging and raving , on the slightest provocation . She led us a worse life than ever over the drain-pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , dust lying thick wherever dust could lie , the stairs turned to a dingy gray , the walls blackened with London smoke and grime . Once in a while she hired a forlorn ragged old woman to wash the stairs and brush the front-door mat , for in London more than anywhere else , " poverty is a comparative thing , " and every degree has one below to " soothe " it . No matter how hard up Mrs. Haines was , she managed to scrape together a few pennies to pay to have the work done for her rather than do it herself . She became as neglectful of herself as of the house : her one dress grew shabbier and shabbier , her apron was discarded , no detail of her toilet was attended to except the frizzing of her coarse black hair . All this came about not at once , but step by step , and things were very bad before J. and I admitted , even to each other , that she was a disgrace to the house . We would admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tenants were as forbearing . I suppose it was because they understood as well as we did , that at a word to the landlord she would be adrift in London , where for one vacant post of housekeeper there are a hundred applications . To banish her from our own Chambers , however , was not to drive her to the workhouse , and I called for her services less and less often . There was another reason for my not employing her , ? to which I have not so far referred , ? the reason really of her slovenliness and bad temper and gradual deterioration . I shut my eyes as long as I could . But I was prepared for the whispers that began to be heard , not only in our house but up and down our street . What started them I do not know , but the morning and evening gatherings of the housekeepers at their doors were not held for nothing , and presently it got about that Mrs. Haines had been seen stealing in and out of a public house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we call our quarter , which looked as if she were endeavoring to escape the vigilant eyes of our gossips . Then , as invariably happens , the whispers grew louder , the evidence against her circumstantial , and everybody was saying quite openly where her money disappeared and why she became shabbier , her rooms barer , and the house more disreputable . It leaked out that her husband also had been seen flitting from public house to public house ; and , the game of concealment by this time being up , it was bluntly said that drink had killed him , as it would Mrs. Haines if she went on as she was going . I had kept my suspicions to myself , but she had never come to our Chambers at the hour of lunch or dinner that there was not an unusual drain upon our modest wine-cellar . I could not fancy that it was merely a coincidence , that friends dining with us were invariably thirstier when she waited or cooked ; but her appearance had been the invariable signal for the disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her a costly luxury . I never saw her when I could declare she had been drinking , but drink she did , and there was no use my beating about the bush and calling it by another name . It would have been less hopeless had she occasionally betrayed herself ? had her speech thickened and her walk become unsteady . But hers was the deadliest form of the evil , because it gave no sign . There was nothing to check it except every now and then a mysterious attack of illness , ? which she said defied the doctor though it defied nobody in the house , ? or the want of money ; but a housekep per must be far gone if she can not pick up a shilling here and a half-crown there . I was the last of the old tenants to employ her , but after I abandoned her she still had another chance with a newcomer who took the Chambers below ours , and , finding them too small to keep more than one servant , engaged her for a liberal amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse and skirt , and she was so spruce and neat in them that I was encouraged to hope . But before the end of the first week , she was met on the stairs coming down from his room to hers with a bottle under her apron ; at the end of the second she was dismissed . I hardly dare think how she lived after this . With every Christmas there was a short period of prosperity , though it dwindled as the tenants began to realize where their money went . For a time J. and I got her to keep our bicycles , . other people in the house followed suit , and during several months she was paid rent for as many as six , keeping them in the empty sitting-room from which even the rickety chairs had disappeared , and where the floor now was thick with grease and stained with oil . If we had trunks to store or boxes to unpack , she would let us the same room for as long as we wanted , and so she managed , one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was a makeshift existence , all the more so when her habits began to tell on her physically . She was ill half the time , and by the end of her fourth year in the house I do not believe she could have sewed or waited or cooked , had she had the chance . She had no friends , no companions , save her cat . They were a grim pair , she with hungry , shifty eyes glowing like fires in the pallor of her face , he more gaunt and ungainly than ever ? for a witch and her familiar they would have been burnt not so many hundred years agct . Then we heard that she was taking in lodgers , ? women with the look of hunted creatures , who stole into her rooms at strange hours of the night . Some said they were waifs and strays from the " Halls , " others that they were wanderers from the Strand ; all agreed that , whoever they were , they must be as desperately poor as she , to seek shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been passed over , but I knew that such lodgers were more than landlord and tenants could endure , and I had not to be a prophet to foresee that the end was approaching . It came more speedily than I thought , though the manner of it was not left to landlord and tenants . Christmas  - -  herfifth in the house ? had filled her . purse again . Tenants were less liberal , it is true , but she must have had at least five or six pounds , to which a turkey and plum pudding had been added by our neighbor across the hall , who was of a generous turn . She had therefore the essentials of what passes for a merry Christmas , but how much merriment there was in hers I had no way of telling . On holidays in London I keep indoors if I can , not caring to face the sadness of the streets , or the dreariness of house-parties , and I did not go downstairs on Christmas Day , nor on Boxing Day , which is the day after . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself at our Chambers . I trust she was gay because , as it turned out , it was her last chance for gayety at this or any other season . In the middle of the night following Boxing Day she was seized with one of her mysterious attacks . A lodger was with her , but , from fright or stupidity , or perhaps worse , called no one till dawn , when she rang up the Housekeeper next door and vanished . The Housekeeper next door went at once for the doctor who attends to us all in our quarter . It was too late : Mrs. IQO PROGRESS Haines was dead when he reached the house . Death was merciful , freeing her from the worse fate that threatened , for she was at the end of everything . She went out of the world as naked as she came into it . Her rooms were empty , there was not so much as a crust of bread in her kitchen , in her purse were two farthings . Her only clothes were those she had just taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Destitution could not be more complete , and the horror was to find it , not round the corner , not at the door , but in the very house . The day after , her sister appeared , from where , summoned by whom , I do not know . She was a decent , seri ous woman who attended to every . thing , and when the funeral was over called on all the tenants . She wanted , she told me , to thank us for all our kindness to her sister , whom kindness had so little helped . She volunteered no explanation , she only sighed her regrets ? she could not understand , she said . Nor could I. No doubt , daily in the slums , many women die as destitute . But they never had their chance . Mrs. Haines had hers , and a fair one as these things go . When I remember her tragedy , my confidence is shaken in the reformers to-day who would work the miracle , and , with ' equal chances for all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
