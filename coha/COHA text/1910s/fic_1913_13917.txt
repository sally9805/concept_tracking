SCENE  --  A squalid bedroom on the top floor of a rooming house on the lower East Side , New York . The wall paper is dirty and torn in places showing the plaster beneath . There is an open window in back looking out on a fire escape on which a bottle of milk can be seen . On the right is a door leading to the hallway . On the left a wash-stand with a bowl and pitcher , and some meager articles of a woman 's toilet-set scattered on it . Above the wash-stand a cracked mirror hangs from a nail in the wall . In the middle of the room stands a rickety table and a chair . In the left hand corner near the window is a bed in which a baby is lying asleep . A gas jet near the mirror furnishes the only light . Rose Thomas , a dark-haired young woman looking thirty but really only twenty-two , is discovered sitting on the chair smoking a cheap Virginia cigarette . An empty beer bottle and a dirty glass stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheap affair with a scraggy , imitation plume , is also on the table . Rose is dressed in the tawdry extreme of fashion . She has earrings in her ears , bracelets on both wrists , and a quantity of rings  --  none of them genuine . Her face is that of a person in an advanced stage of consumption  --  deathly pale with hollows in under the eyes , which are wild and feverish . Her attitude is one of the deepest dejection . When she glances over at the bed , however , her expression grows tenderly maternal . From time to time she coughs  --  a harsh , hacking cough that shakes her whole body . After these spells she raises her handkerchief to her lips  --  then glances at it fearfully . The time is in the early hours of a rainy summer night . The monotonous sound of the rain falling on the flags of the court below is heard . THOMAS  --  ( listening to the rain  --  throws the cigarette wearily on the table ) Gawd ! What a night ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has a sudden fit of coughing ; then gets up and goes over to the bed and bending down gently kisses the sleeping child on the forehead . She turns away with a sob and murmurs ) What a life ! Poor kid ! ( She goes over to the mirror and makes up her eyes and cheeks . The effect is ghastly . Her blackened eyes look enormous and the dabs of rouge on each cheek serve to heighten her aspect of feverish illness . Just as she has completed her toilet and is putting on her hat in front of the mirror , the door is flung open and Steve lurches in and bolts the door after him . He has very evidently been drinking . In appearance he is a typical " cadet , " flashily dressed , rat-eyed , weak of mouth , undersized , and showing on his face the effects of drink and drugs. ) p. 3 THOMAS  --  ( hurriedly putting her hat down on the wash-stand  --  half frightened ) Hello , Steve . STEVE  --  ( looking her up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess ! ( He walks over and sits down in the chair . ) Yuh look like a dead one . Put on some paint and cheer up ! Yuh give me the willies standin ' there like a ghost . THOMAS  --  ( rushes over to mirror and plasters on more rouge  --  then turns around ) Look , Steve ! Ai n't that better ? STEVE  --  Better ? Naw , but it 'll do . ( seeing empty beer bottle ) Gim me a drink ! THOMAS  --  Yuh know there ai n't any . That 's the bottle yuh brought up last night . STEVE  --  ( with peevish anger ) Yuh lie ! I 'll bet yuh got some burried around here some place . Yuh 're always holdin ' out on me and yuh got to quit it , see ? THOMAS  --  I never hold out on yuh and yuh know it . That 's all the thanks I get . ( angrily ) What'ud yuh do if I was like Bessie with your friend Jack ? Then yuh might have some chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time she wants to  --  and he knows it and sticks to her like glue . Yuh do n't notice him runnin ' after every doll he sees like some guys I know . He 's afraid of losin ' her  --  while you do n't care . p. 4 STEVE  --  ( flattered  --  in a conciliating tone ) Aw , shut up ! Yuh make me sick with dat line of bull . Who said I was chasin ' any dolls ? ( then venomously ) I 'm not so sure Jack is wise to Bessie holdin ' out on him ; but I 'll tell him , and if he is n't wise to it , Bessie 'll be in for a good beatin ' . THOMAS  --  Aw , do n't do that ! What ' cha got against her ? She ai n't done nothin ' to you , has she ? STEVE  --  Naw ; but she ought a be learned a lesson dat 's all . She ought a be on the level with him . Us guys has got to stand together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out on the side ? THOMAS  --  ( dejectedly ) Do n't ask me . I du n no . It 's a bum game all round . ( She has a fit of horrible coughing . ) STEVE  --  ( his nerves shattered ) Dammit ! Stop that barkin ' . It goes right trou me . Git some medicine for it , why do n't yuh ? THOMAS  --  ( wiping her lips with her handkerchief ) I did but it ai n't no good . STEVE  --  Then git somethin ' else . I told yuh months ago to go and see a doctor . Did yuh ? p. 5 THOMAS  --  ( nervously , after a pause ) No . STEVE  --  Well den , yuh ca n't blame me . It 's up to you . THOMAS  --  ( speaking eagerly and beseechingly , almost in tears ) Listen , Steve ! Let me stay in to-night and go to the Doc 's . I 'm sick . ( pointing to breast ) I got pains here and it seems as if I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes round and round . Anyway it 's rainin ' and my shoes are full of holes . There wo n't be no one out to-night , and even if there was they 're all afraid of me on account of this cough . Gim me a couple of dollars and let me go to the Doc 's and git some medicine . Please , Steve , for Gawd 's sake ! I 'll make it up to yuh when I 'm well . I 'll be makin ' lots of coin then and yuh kin have it all . ( goes off into a paroxysm of coughing ) I 'm so sick ! STEVE  --  ( in indignant amazement ) A couple of beans ! What'd'yuh think I am  --  the mint ? THOMAS  --  But yuh had lots of coin this mornin ' . Did n't I give yuh all I had ? STEVE  --  ( sullenly ) Well , I ai n't got it now , see ? I got into a game at Tony 's place and they cleaned me . I ai n't got a nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to yuh if I had it . D'yuh think I 'm a simp to be gittin ' yuh protection and keepin ' the bulls from runnin ' yuh in when all yuh do is to stick at home and play dead ? If yuh want any coin git out and make it . That 's all I got to say . p. 6 THOMAS  --  ( furiously ) So that 's all yuh got to say , is it ? Well , I 'll hand yuh a tip right here . I 'm gittin ' sick of givin ' yuh my roll and gittin ' nothin ' but abuse in retoin . Yuh 're half drunk now . And yuh been hittin ' the pipe too ; I kin tell by the way your eyes look . D'yuh think I 'm goin ' to stand for a guy that 's always full of booze and hop ? Not so yuh could notice it ! There 's too many others I kin get . STEVE  --  ( His eyes narrow and his voice becomes loud and threatening . ) Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t'row me down  --  look out ! I 'll get yuh ! THOMAS  --  ( in a frenzy ) Get me ? Wha 'd I care ? D'yuh think I 'm so stuck on this life I wanta go on livin ' ? Kill me ! Wha 'd I care ? STEVE  --  ( jumps up from the table and raises his hand as if to strike her . He shouts ) Fur Chris ' sake , shut up ! ( The baby , awakened by the loud voices , commences to cry . ) THOMAS  --  ( her anger gone in a flash ) Sssshhh ! There , we woke her up . Keep still , Steve . I 'll go out , yuh need n't worry . Jest do n't make so much noise , that 's all . ( She goes over to the bed and cuddles the child . It soon falls asleep again . She begins to cough and rising to her feet walks away from the bed keeping her face turned away from the baby. ) p. 7 STEVE  --  ( who has been watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that kid out of the bed . I got ta git some sleep . THOMAS  --  But , Steve , where 'll I put her ? There 's no place else . STEVE  --  On the floor  --  any place . Wha 'd I care where yuh put it ? THOMAS  --  ( supplicatingly ) Aw please , Steve ! Be a good guy ! She wo n't bother yuh none . She 's fast asleep . Yuh got three-quarters of the bed to lie on . Let her stay there . STEVE  --  Nix ! Yuh heard what I said , did n't yuh ? Git busy , then . Git her out of there . THOMAS  --  ( with cold fury ) I wo n't do it . STEVE  --  Yuh wo n't , eh ? Den I will . ( He makes a move toward the bed . ) THOMAS  --  ( standing between him and the bed in a resolute attitude , speaks slowly and threateningly ) I 've stood about enough from you . Do n't yuh dare touch her or I 'll  --  STEVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul however ) What 'll yuh do ? Do n't try and bluff me . And now we 're talkin ' about it I wanta tell yuh that kid has got to go . I 've stood fur it as long as I kin with its ballin ' and whinin ' . Yuh got ta git rid of it , that 's all . Give it to some orphan asylum . They 'll take good care of it . I know what I 'm talkin ' about cause I was brung up in one myself . ( with a sneer ) What 'd you want with a kid ? ( Rose winces . ) A fine mother you are and dis is a swell dump to bring up a family in. p. 8 THOMAS  --  Please , Steve for the love of Gawd lemme keep her ! She 's all I got to live for . If yuh take her away I 'll die . I 'll kill myself STEVE  --  ( contemptuously ) Dat 's what they all say . But she 's got to go . All yuh do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every ten minutes to see if it 's hungry or somethin ' ! Dat 's why we 're broke all the time . I 've stood fur it long enough . THOMAS  --  ( on her knees  --  weeping ) Please , Steve , for Gawd 's sake lemme keep her ! STEVE  --  ( coldly ) Stop dat blubberin ' . It wo n't do no good . I give yuh a week . If yuh do n't git dat brat outa here in a week den I will . THOMAS  --  Wha'd'yuh mean ? What 'll yuh do ? STEVE  --  I 'll have yuh pinched and sent to the Island . The kid 'll be took away from yuh then . THOMAS  --  ( in anguish ) Yuh 're jest tryin ' to scare me , ai n't yuh , Steve ? They would n't do that , would they ? STEVE  --  Yuh 'll soon know whether dey would or not . THOMAS  --  But yuh would n't have me pinched , would yuh , Steve ? Yuh would n't do me dirt like that ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yuh jest wait and see ! THOMAS  --  Aw , Steve , I always been good to you . STEVE  --  Git dat kid outa here or I 'll put yuh in the cooler as sure as hell ! THOMAS  --  ( maddened , rushing at him with outstretched hands ) Yuh dirty dog ! ( There is a struggle during which the table is overturned . Finally Steve frees himself and hits her in the face with his fist , knocking her down . At the same instant the door from the hallway is forced open and Tim Moran pushes his way in . He is short and thick set , with a bullet head , close-cropped black hair , a bull neck , and small blue eyes set close together . Although distinctly a criminal type his face is in part redeemed by its look of manliness . He is dressed in dark ill-fitting clothes , and has an automatic revolver in his hand which he keeps pointed at Steve . ) MORAN  --  ( pointing to the door , speaks to Steve with cold contempt ) Git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( as Steve 's hand goes to his hip ) Take yer hand away from that gat or I 'll fill yuh full of holes . ( Steve is cowed and obeys . ) Now git out and do n't come back . If yuh bother this goil again I 'll fix yuh and fix yuh right . D'yuh get me ? p. 10 STEVE  --  ( snarling , and slinking toward door ) Yuh think yuh 're some smart , dontcha , buttin ' in dis way on a guy ? It ai n't none of your business . She 's my goil . MORAN  --  D'yuh think I 'm goin ' to stand by and let yuh beat her up jest cause she wants to keep her kid ? D'yuh think I 'm as low as you are , yuh dirty mut ? Git outa here before I croak yuh . STEVE  --  ( standing in the doorway and looking back ) Yuh got the drop on me now ; but I 'll get yuh , yuh wait and see ! ( to Rose ) And you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . Rose hurries over to the door and tries to lock it , but the lock is shattered , so she puts the chair against it to keep it shut . She then goes over to the baby , who has been whimpering unnoticed during the quarrel , and soothes her to sleep again . Tim , looking embarrassed , puts the revolver back in his pocket and picking up the table sets it to rights again and sits on the edge of it . Rose looks up at him from the bed , half bewildered at seeing him still there . Then she breaks into convulsive sobbing . ) MORAN  --  ( making a clumsy attempt at consolation ) There , there , Kid , cut the cryin ' . He wo n't bother yuh no more . I know his kind . He 's got a streak of yellow a yard wide , and beatin ' up women is all he 's game for . But he wo n't hurt you no more  --  not if I know it . p. 11 THOMAS  --  Yuh do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hop he 's liable to do anythin ' . I do n't care what he does to me . I might as well be dead anyway . But there 's the kid . I got to look after her . And ( looking at him gratefully ) I do n't want you to git in no mix-ups on account of me . I ai n't worth it . MORAN  --  ( quickly ) Nix on that stuff about your not bein ' worth it ! THOMAS  --  ( smiling ) Thanks . And I 'm mighty glad yuh came in when yuh did . Gawd knows what he'd'a done to the kid and me not able to stop him . MORAN  --  Do n't yuh worry about my gettin ' into no mix-ups . I c'n take care of myself . THOMAS  --  How did yuh happen to blow in when yuh did ? There usually ai n't no one around in this dump at this time of the night . MORAN  --  I got the room next to yuh . I heard every word the both of yuh said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ago . I know the way he 's treated yuh . I'd'a butted in sooner only I did n't want to mix in other people 's business . But tonight when he started in about the kid there I could n't stand fur it no longer . I was jest wantin ' to hand him a call and I let him have it . Why d'yuh stand fur him anyway ? Why do n't yuh take the kid and beat it away from him ? p. 12 THOMAS  --  ( despondently ) It 's easy to say : " Why do n't I beat it ? " I ca n't . MORAN  --  Wha'd'yuh mean ? Why ca n't yuh ? THOMAS  --  I never have enough coin to make a good break and git out of town . He takes it all away from me . And if I went to some other part of this burg he 'd find me and kill me . Even if he did n't kill me he 'd have me pinched and where'ud the kid be then ? ( grimly ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . MORAN  --  I do n't get yuh ? How could he have yuh pinched if yuh ai n't done nothin ' ? THOMAS  --  Oh , he 's got a drag somewhere . He squares it with the cops so they do n't hold me up for walkin ' the streets . Yuh ought to be wise enough to know all of his kind stand in . If he tipped them off to do it they 'd pinch me before I 'd gone a block . Then it'ud be the Island fur mine . MORAN  --  Then why do n't yuh cut this life and be on the level ? Why do n't yuh git a job some place ? He could n't touch yuh then . THOMAS  --  ( scornfully ) Oh , could n't he ? D'yuh suppose they 'd keep me any place if they knew what I was ? And d'yuh suppose he would n't tell them or have some one else tell them ? Yuh do n't know the game I 'm up against . ( bitterly ) I 've tried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've starved at it . A year after I first hit this town I quit and tried to be on the level . I got a job at housework  --  workin ' twelve hours a day for twenty-five dollars a month . And I worked like a dog , too , and never left the house I was so scared of seein ' some one who knew me . But what was the use ? One night they have a guy to dinner who 's seen me some place when I was on the town . He tells the lady  --  his duty he said it was  --  and she fires me right off the reel . I tried the same thing a lot of times . But there was always some one who 'd drag me back . And then I quit tryin ' . There did n't seem to be no use . They  --  all the good people  --  they got me where I am and they 're goin ' to keep me there . Reform ? Take it from me it ca n't be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gawd 's truth . p. 13 MORAN  --  Give it another trial any way . Yuh never know your luck . Yuh might be able to stick this time . THOMAS  --  ( wearily ) Talk is cheap . Yuh do n't know what yuh 're talkin ' about . What job c'n I git ? What am I fit fur ? Housework is the only thing I know about and I do n't know much about that . Where else could I make enough to live on ? That 's the trouble with all us girls . Most all of us ud like to come back but we jest ca n't and that 's all there 's to it . We ca n't work out of this life because we do n't know how to work . We was never taught how . ( She shakes with a horrible fit of coughing , wipes her lips , and smiles pitifully . ) Who d'yuh think would take a chance on hiring me the way I look and with this cough ? Besides , there 's the kid . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't strong for hirin ' girls with babies  --  especially when the girls ai n't married . MORAN  --  But yuh could send the kid away some place . THOMAS  --  ( fiercely ) No . She 's all I got . I wo n't give her up . ( She coughs again . ) MORAN  --  ( kindly ) That 's a bad cough yuh got , Kid . I heard yuh tellin ' him tonight yuh had n't seen a doctor . ( putting hand in his pocket ) I 'll stake yuh and yuh c'n run around and see one now . p. 14 THOMAS  --  Thanks jest the same but it ai n't no use . I lied to Steve . I went to a doc about a month ago . He told me I had the " con " and had it bad . ( with grim humor ) He said the only hope fur me was to git out in the country , sleep in the open air , and eat a lot of good food . He might jest as well ' uv told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he said I could go out to some dump where yuh do n't have to pay nothin ' , but he said I 'd have to leave the kid behind . I told him I 'd rather die than do that , and he said I 'd have to be careful or the kid ' ud catch it from me . And I have been careful . ( She sobs . ) I do n't even kiss her on the mouth no more . MORAN  --  Yuh sure are up against it , Kid . ( He appears deeply moved . ) Gee , I thought I was in bad , but yuh got me skinned to death . THOMAS  --  ( interested ) You in bad ? Yuh do n't look it . MORAN  --  Listen ! Yuh talk about tryin ' to be good and not bein ' able to  --  Well , I been up against the same thing . When I was a kid I was sent to the Reform school fur stealin ' ; and it was n't my fault . I was mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to what I was doin ' . They made me the goat ; and in the Reform school they made a crook outa me . When I come out I tried to be straight and hold down a job , but as soon as any one got wise I 'd been in a Reform school they canned me same as they did you . Then I stole again  --  to keep from starvin ' . They got me and this time I went to the coop fur five years . Then I give up . I seen it was no use . When I got out again I got in with a gang of yeggmen and learned how to be a yegg  --  and I 've been one ever since . I 've spent most of my life in jail but I 'm free now . p. 15 THOMAS  --  What are yuh goin ' to do ? MORAN  --  ( fiercely ) What am I goin ' to do ? They made a yegg outa me ! Let ' em look out ! THOMAS  --  When did yuh get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? ( then suddenly ) Nix , I did n't mean that . Yuh 're a good kid and maybe yuh c'n help me . THOMAS  --  I 'd sure like to . MORAN  --  Then listen ! ( looking at her fixedly ) Yuh swear yuh wo n't squeal on me ? THOMAS  --  I wo n't , so help me Gawd ! MORAN  --  Well , I 'm Tim Moran . I jest broke out two weeks ago . THOMAS  --  ( staring at him with a fascinated wonder ) You ! Tim Moran ! The guy that robbed that bank a week ago ! The guy they 're all lookin ' fur ! MORAN  --  Sssshhh ! Yuh never c'n tell who 's got an ear glued to the wall in a dump like this . THOMAS  --  ( lowering her voice ) I read about yuh in the papers . ( She looks at him as if she were half afraid. ) p. 16 MORAN  --  Yuh 're not afraid of me , are yuh ? I ai n't the kind of crook Steve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ai n't afraid of yuh , Tim ; but I 'm afraid they may find yuh here and take yuh away again . ( anxiously ) D'yuh think Steve knew yuh ? He 'd squeal sure if he did  --  to git the reward . MORAN  --  No , I could tell by his eyes he did n't know me . THOMAS  --  How long have yuh been here ? MORAN  --  A week  --  ever since I cracked that safe . I wanted to give the noise time to blow over . I ai n't left that room except when I had to git a bite to eat , and then I got enough fur a couple of days . But when I come in tonight I seen a guy on the corner give me a long look . He looked bad to me and I wanta git out of here before they git wise . THOMAS  --  Yuh think he was a cop ? MORAN  --  Yes , I got a hunch . He looked bad to me . THOMAS  --  ( wonderingly ) And yuh come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh ! Yuh took that chance fur me when yuh did n't even know me ! ( impulsively going over to him and taking his hand which he tries to hold back ) Gee , yuh 're a regular guy , all right . p. 17 MORAN  --  ( in great confusion ) Aw , that 's nothin ' . Any one would'a done it . THOMAS  --  No one would'a done it in your place . ( A slight noise is heard from the hallway . Rose looks around startled and speaks hurriedly almost in a whisper . ) Supposin ' that guy was a cop ? Supposin ' he had a hunch who you was ? How 're yuh goin ' to make a getaway ? Ca n't I help yuh outa this ? Ca n't I do somethin ' fur yuh ? MORAN  --  ( points to window ) That 's a fire escape , ai n't it ? THOMAS  --  Yes . MORAN  --  Where does it lead to ? THOMAS  --  Down to the yard and up to the roof . MORAN  --  To hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to a showdown . I 'll stick in here with you so 's if they come I c'n make a quick getaway . Yuh tell ' em yuh do n't know anything about me , see ? Give ' em a bum steer if you kin . Try and hold ' em so 's I c'n get a good start . THOMAS  --  ( resolutely ) I 'll hold ' em as long as I c'n , do n't worry . I 'll tell ' em I seen yuh goin ' down stairs an hour ago . MORAN  --  Good Kid ! ( They are standing in the middle of the room with their backs to the window . Steve 's face appears peering around the edge of the window-frame . He is crouched on the fire escape outside . His eyes glare with hatred as he watches the two persons in the room . Rose starts to cough , is frightened by the noise she makes , and holds her handkerchief over her mouth to stifle the sound. ) p. 18 MORAN  --  Ssssshhh ! Poor Kid ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Here , Kid . ( He takes a large roll of money out of his pocket and forces it into her hand  --  as she starts to remonstrate ) Shut up ! I ai n't got time to listen to your beefin ' . Take it . It ai n't much but it 's all I got with me . I do n't need it . There 's plenty more waitin ' fur me outside . This 'll be enough to git you and the kid out of town away from that dirty coward . ( Steve 's face is convulsed with fury . ) Go some place out in the mountains and git rid of that cough . THOMAS  --  ( sobbing ) I ca n't take it . Yuh been too good to me already . Yuh do n't know how rotten I am . MORAN  --  ( suddenly taking her in his arms and kissing her roughly ) That 's how rotten I think yuh are . Yuh 're the whitest kid I 've ever met , see ? ( They look into each other 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face is soft , transfigured by a new emotion . Steve moves his hand into the room . He holds a revolver which he tries to aim at Tim but he is afraid to fire . ) THOMAS  --  ( throwing her arms around his neck ) Tim , Tim , yuh been too good to me. p. 19 MORAN  --  ( kissing her again ) Lemme know where yuh are and when it 's safe I 'll come to yuh. ( releases her and takes a small folded paper from pocket ) This 'll find me . ( She takes it , her eyes full of happy tears . ) Maybe after a time we c'n start over again  --  together ! ( A sound like the creaking of a floor board is heard from the hallway . ) What 's that ? ( They both stand looking fixedly at the door . Steve noiselessly disappears from the window . ) Gee , Kid , I got a feelin ' in my bones they 're after me . It 's only a hunch but it 's never gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and puts it on . ) I 'm goin ' to blow . THOMAS  --  ( goes over to the door and listens ) Sounds as if somebody was sneakin ' up the stairs . ( She tiptoes quickly over to him and kisses him . ) Go , go while yuh got a chance . Do n't let ' em git yuh ! I love yuh , Tim . MORAN  --  Good-bye , Kid . I 'll come as soon as I c'n . ( He kisses her again and goes quickly to the window Steve stretches his hand around the side of the window and fires , the muzzle of the gun almost on Tim 's chest . There is a loud report and a little smoke . Tim staggers back and falls on the floor . Steve throws the gun into the room , then quietly pulls down the window and disappears . The child in the bed wakes up and cries feebly. ) p. 20 THOMAS  --  ( rushes to Tim and kneels beside him , holding his head on her breast ) Tim ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses him frantically . ) MORAN  --  ( his eyes glazing ) Good Kid  --  mountains  --  git rid of that cough . ( He dies . ) THOMAS  --  ( letting his head fall back on the floor sinks to a sitting position beside him . The money is still clutched in her right hand . She stares straight before her and repeats in tones of horrible monotony ) Dead . Oh Gawd , Gawd , Gawd ! ( The sound of people running up the stairs in the hall is heard . A voice shouts : " Must be in here . " The door is pushed open and three men enter . One is a policeman in uniform and the other two are evidently plain clothes men . The landlady and several roomers stand in the doorway looking in with frightened faces . ) A POLICEMAN  --  ( goes to Rose and , taking her arm , hauls her to her feet ) Come , get up outa that ! ( The two plain clothes men take one look at the dead man and both exclaim together ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh it was him I seen comin ' in here tonight . I never forget a face . p. 21 SECOND PLAIN CLOTHES MAN  --  ( picking revolver off the floor and examining it ) I did n't think he 'd be fool enough to stick around here . ( turning suddenly to Rose ) What did yuh croak him for ? ( ironically ) A little love spat , eh ? ( sees the roll of money in her hand and grabs her quickly by the wrist ) Pipe the roll ! Little sister here attends to business , all right . Gave him a frisk before we had a chance to get here . ( to Rose in loud , rough tones ) Why did yuh kill him ? It was for this coin , was n't it ? ( During the detective 's remarks Rose gradually realizes the position she is in . Her expression becomes one of amazed pain as she sees they think she is guilty of the murder . She speaks brokenly , trying to hold herself in control . ) THOMAS  --  Honest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this money . Some one shot him from the window . ( then quite simply as if that explained it all away ) Why , I loved him . SECOND PLAIN CLOTHES MAN  --  Stop that noise ! Wha'd'yuh take us for  --  boobs ? The window ai n't even open and the glass ai n't broken . He gave yuh the money , eh ? And then shot himself , I suppose ? Aw say , Kid , wha'd'yuh take us for ? p. 22 THOMAS  --  ( losing all control , frenziedly breaks from the Policeman 's grasp and throws herself beside body ) Tim ! Tim ! For the love of Gawd speak to them . Tell ' em I did n't do it , Tim ! Tell ' em yuh gave that money to me . Yuh know what yuh said  --  " Take the kid into the mountains and git rid of that cough . " Tell ' em yuh said that , Tim ! Speak to ' em ! Tell ' em I loved yuh , Tim  --  that I wanted to help yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They think I shot yuh . They do n't know I loved yuh . For the love of Gawd speak to ' em . ( weeping and sobbing bitterly ) Oh Gawd , why do n't yuh speak , why do n't yuh speak ? FIRST PLAIN CLOTHES MAN  --  ( sneeringly ) That 's good stuff but it wo n't get yuh anything . ( turning to his two companions ) Looks to me as if this doll was full of coke or something . You two better take her to the station and make a report . I 'll stay here and keep cases on the room . I 'm sick of listenin ' to that sob stuff . THOMAS  --  ( The Policeman taps her on the shoulder and she rises to her feet with a spring , wildly protesting ) But I tell yuh I did n't do it ! It was from the window . Ca n't yuh believe me ? I swear I  --  ( She stops appalled by the unbelieving sneers of the policemen , by the white faces in the doorway gazing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every eye . She realizes the futility of all protest , the maddening hopelessness of it all . The child is still crying . She notices it for the first time and goes over to the bed to soothe it . The Policeman keeps a tight hold of one of her arms . She speaks words of tenderness to the child in dull , mechanical tones . It stops crying . All are looking at her in silence with a trace of compassionate pity on their faces . Rose seems in a trance . Her eyes are like the eyes of a blind woman . She seems to be aware of something in the room which none of the others can see  --  perhaps the personification of the ironic life force that has crushed her. ) p. 23 FIRST PLAIN CLOTHES MAN  --  Your kid ? THOMAS  --  ( to the unseen presence in the room ) Yes . I suppose yuh 'll take her too ? FIRST PLAIN CLOTHES MAN  --  ( misunderstanding her , good naturedly ) I 'll take care of her for the time bein ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Make a good job of me . ( Suddenly she stretches both arms above her head and cries bitterly , mournfully , out of the depths of her desolation ) Gawd ! Gawd ! Why d'yuh hate me so ? A POLICEMAN  --  ( shocked ) Here , here , no rough talk like that . Come along now ! ( Rose leans against him weakly and he supports her to the door where the group of horrified lodgers silently make way for them . The Second Plain Clothes Man follows them . A moment later Rose 's hollow cough echoes in the dark hallway . The child wakes up and cries fitfully . The First Plain Clothes Man goes over to the bed and cuddles her on his lap with elephantine playfullness . ) THE CHILD  --  ( feebly )
