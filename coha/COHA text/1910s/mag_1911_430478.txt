 |p485  THE German city is a crosssection of Germany just as the American city is a crosssection of America . The city can not be divorced from its setting or studied apart from its historical environment . The German city is a part of the traditions , the sense of the Fatherland , the universal efficiency , the far-sighted outlook , the paternalism vitalized by patriotism of the German people . The American city , on the other hand , has no traditions . There is no sense of responsibility . It is efficient only in spots . It has no vision beyond the present . It reflects the extreme individualism and license which characterizes the nation . It is democratic in form , but hardly in reality . And measured by the services rendered , or the sense of the paramountcy of the State , it is far less democratic than the German . The most obvious thing about the German city is its orderliness . The most obvious thing about the American city is its disorderliness . The American city is an accident , a railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth in the chance location of a body of settlers . It became a city because it could not help it . The German city , on the other hand , was either a fortress , a Hauptstadt , or an industrial community , like the cities of the lower Rhine in the neighborhood of Essen , Elberfeld , or Barmen . Berlin , Munich , Dresden , Cologne , Mannheim , Dusseldorf , Hanover , and Strassburg were the seats of kingdoms , principalities , or bishoprics . Frankfort , Hamburg , Bremen , and Lubeck were free Hanseatic towns , owing allegiance to no one ? proud of their mediaeval traditions and jealous of their freedom . Much of that which we admire in the German city is traceable to age . All of these cities were enriched with valuable heritages from the past . Rulers embellished their capitals in imitation of Paris . Some , like the kings of Bavaria , were themselves artistic and in love with things Hellenic . They erected palaces , art galleries , and museums . They Iaid out parks and palace gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been converted into park-like Ring Strassen in Vienna , Frankfort , Cologne , Bremen , Dusseldorf , and elsewhere . The German city was rich in art when the industrial revolution made its appearance . When the factory came there was only the outskirts for workshops . The heart of the city remained as it was when the city was a market-place , a fortified town , or the residence of a prince . And the old has continued to control the new . In America we have no such traditions or monuments . Our only memories are those of shops , mills , and factories ever repeating themselves like the concentric rings of a growing tree . Few men have any other idea of the city than this . In addition , all of the work of the American city had to be done at once . Streets and sewers had to be built . Gas , water , electric light , telegraph , and telephone wires , mains and conduits had to be laid , while schools , station-houses , and public structures had to be erected merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were swamped with elemental needs . They had no traditions , no experience , to guide them . They had no time to dream dreams . They were driven , like the pioneer , by the fear of the coming winter . These things must be borne in mind in any criticism of the disorderliness of the American city or in any comparison with the cities of other lands . Our cities were born but yesterday , and they have the rough-hewn finish of their age . But the foundations are now in . We are in a position to look about us . And everywhere there are signs that democracy is dissatisfied with its cyclone-proof cellar . Washington , New York , Cleveland , Chicago , Denver , Kansas City , San Francisco , Baltimore , St. Louis , and Pittsburg are planning to rebuild their cities and to relieve its disorderliness with parks , public structures , and open spaces , while democ/ racy is seeking to find more efficient tools for the doing of its work . The next generation is bound to see tremendous advance in things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England or France that we must go for our models . I have said that the city was but a crosssection of the country in which it is found . It reflects the political , social , educational , and moral life of the people . Yet the German city , in spite of the autocratic personal government of the Kaiser , is free , almost as free in its local affairs as were the Free Cities of the Middle Ages , which became the centres of liberty and of culture during the centuries when civilization had almost vanished from the earth . The German city , it is true , is subject to visitation by the State . There are some limitations on its indebtedness , the method of raising revenues , and the choice of mayors . But in the main it is free ? free to dream big dreams , and when they are ready for realization , to achieve them and enjoy the fruits thereof . The American city , on the other hand , is in chains . It has great power for evil and but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become great if they can , from the fear that they may make mistakes in so doing . The German city , on the other hand , has almost complete autonomy . It can own , operate , lease , or regulate the franchise corporations which occupy its streets . And it very generally owns them . It can enter trade and industry . It may even invest public funds in private ventures which lie close to the life of the community . It builds tenements and cottages , and regulates the private owner so that his structures will not be a menace to the city . It owns great blocks of land within its limits as well as magnificent woods and forests in the surrounding country . It almost always has a monopoly of the slaughter-houses ; it carries on restaurants and rathskellers ; it builds and operates opera-houses , theatres , concert halls , palm gardens , and milk depots . It even speculates on a large scale in real estate in order to keep down the price of land , and enjoy a portion of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the field of education it can do practically as it wills , after it has met the minimum standard set up by the State . Among the larger cities there is the keenest rivalry in all these things , especially in the promotion of commercial , technical , and artistic education . The American city is bound , as was Gulliver by the Liliputians , with a thousand thongs . It has to secure the assent of suspicious farmers and hostile financial interests , before it can change the wages or salaries of its officials or alter the method of police administration . Its control over tenements , slums , and franchise corporations is generally such as the owners of these properties see fit to permit . Usually the power which is granted is just the power which the city can not use , or it is conceded so late that the evil can not be corrected at all or at too great expense to be attempted . The city may not lay out playgrounds , it may not erect bath-houses or comfort stations , it may not supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State , which has no knowledge of its local needs . It must let out its work by contract , and in some instances spend more for the advertising than for the job itself . The tax rate is limited , as is the amount of the bonded indebtedness . The city may be ruined by inadequate terminal facilities , its citizens may be killed by surface crossings , and its trade destroyed by railway discriminations for the advantage of the private speculator . Its water front may be monopolized by hostile interests which refuse to develop it , as is the case with almost all of our lake and river cities . In all these relations the city is helpless . Its unvoiced needs are given less consideration at the State capitol than the demands of any one of a hundred special interests . It is this that strangles the American city ; this more than corruption , bad charters or dishonest men . In addition to this , the tools by which the city is governed are often consciously designed to be unworkable by the people themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . They have been free to think as cities , to develop a local pride and consciousness , to call the best talent of the community to themselves . The Greek cities were autonomous . The splendid cities of mediaeval Italy were republics . The towns which spread like a network over the face of Europe during the Middle Ages were free cities . And the greatest cities of the  |p487  present century , the cities of Germany , are free in much the same sense . They enjoy the largest amount of home rule . Each of them is an experiment station . And the achievements of one are speedily carried on to the rest . The German city has no mayor . It has an Oberburgermeister , who corresponds roughly to our mayor . His legal authority is far less than that enjoyed by the patriarchal executives of New York , Baltimore , or Boston . In desperation over our inability to watch a hundred men we decided to watch but one . In order to escape from a troublesome council we threw ourselves into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the despot should be an enlightened one or should know anything more about the government of a city than the council which we discarded . He need only be an active politician , an ambitious business man , or an aggressive leader . The head of the German city is an expert . Both the Oberburgermeister and the assistant Burgermeisters make a profession of their callings . Nobody knows to what party they belong . And nobody really cares . They are like the managers of a great business concern and are employed by the city council for that purpose , much as they might be employed to manage a railroad . The present Mayor of Berlin ryas a lawyer in Breslau . He was elected to the council of the latter city , became interested in city administration , and determined to make city administration a profession . He was chosen for a subordinate post and made such a success that he was called to the mayoralty of Berlin , where he has been for many years . Dr. Adickes , the Oberburgermeister of Frankfort , has occupied that post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany can point to a life of more conspicuous achievement than his . He recently declined a post in the Interior Department of Prussia . Oberburgermeister Wilhelm Marx , of Dusseldorf , came to that city from a smaller town twenty years ago . He is a man of independent wealth . He rose to his present position and for twelve years has been mayor of the city . During these years he has builded as did Pericles in Athens and the Medici in Florence . And he has made Dusseldorf one of the most finished cities in the world . Tenure of office is permanent . If a mayor is re-elected , after his first term of twelve years , he holds office for life . When a vacancy occurs , the town council sets about to fill it much as the British city finds a clerk , or the American railroad finds a president . From the candidates who present themselves from all Germany the council makes a choice , to which choice the Kaiser must assent . Approval , however , is rarely withheld . But the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise choice or select some one who was persona non grata to the Emperor another person would have to be found . Official salaries are relatively high , about as high as they are in America . They range from $3,500 to $7,000 in the larger cities , while the salaries of the assistant Burgermeisters are about one-half of the sum paid the mayors . The assistant Burgermeisters are chosen by the same method . They are experts in finance , law , engineering , education , architecture , or city building . The number of assistants varies greatly . In Berlin there are seventeen , in Dresden thirteen , in Munich sixteen , in Frankfort nine . These experts devote their entire time to the city . They guide the deliberations of the committees of the council and along with the mayor form a sort of cabinet for the planning of the city 's development . They are an upper , expert , permanent legislative and administrative council . In Great Britain permanence of policy is secured by a staff of paid employees , who along with the clerk are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert , and highly paid official . He holds the thread of city administration in his hands , and along with the permanent staff of department heads secures that continuity of policy which has made the British city as efficient as it is . But the British city , with all its honesty and efficiency , does not compare with the German city in far-sighted policy and many-sided development . For the programme of the British city is dependent upon the hazards of elections and the will of very critical and almost penuriously cautious rate payers . In Germany , on the other hand , the permanent official enjoys the real as well as the titular power , and by reason of the assured permanency of the propertied class in the town councils there is no motive on the part of any one for a change .  |p488  Except in the management of schools , libraries , art galleries , museums , and the like , we have made no attempt to introduce this element of permanency into city administration . We select the presidents of our universities and the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any section of the country , but a sense of local jealousy has prevented the selection of any but local men for municipal office . And until we do secure this expert element , and with it a continuity of policy , it will be difficult to elevate the city much above the purely political plane which it now occupies . Possibly government by Commissions which is rapidly superceding every other form of city government and the election of local officials on a non-partisan ballot will tend to bring this about . The town council in Germany is the ultimate repository of power . It is chosen by the electors . It draws to itself a high order of talent . It is rather anomalous to find in Berlin , for instance , that all of the elected members of the Reichstag are Socialists , while the city council contains but a minority of them . The explanation is to be found in the method of election . Members of the Reichstag are chosen by manhood suffrage . Every man is equal at the polls . In the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . The voters are divided into three classes . Those who pay one-third of the taxes elect one-third of the council ; those who pay another third of the taxes elect another third , while the great mass of the people , who , under the income tax , pay the remaining third of the revenues elect the remaining third of the council . I heard of one city where a single man elected one-third of the council , and of another where one hundred and thirty persons did so . In consequence the German city is far from democratic , possibly less democratic than any of the cities of Europe . The German city is governed by its big tax payers just as the British city is governed by its rate payers . It is ruled by the capitalist class . But the result of this dominance of property at the polls has been diametrically different in the two countries . The German city is bold , generous , enlightened , and humane . The English city is timid , cheese-paring , and far less thoughtful of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negative the class-conscious theory of politics . For the capitalistic class has socialized one industry after another . It has taken over the street railways , the gas , water , and electriclighting enterprises , and burdened itself with taxes for education , recreation , and the relief of the poor in a way that gives color to the suggestion that Germany is meeting the progress of socialism by a large amount of social reform or " State Socialism . " And the rich tax payers in control of the city pay the city 's bills . They-pay almost all of the taxes . This is another anomaly which distinguishes the German from the British city . And it is the more anomalous in view of the fact that they could have shifted a great part of the taxes onto the poor . In recent years they have completely revolutionized the taxation of property a -d still further burdened themselves . From one-half to two-thirds of the taxes are collected from incomes , those below from $105 to $225 being exempt . The city is the fiscal agent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State rate . If the State tax on an individual income amounts to $100 the local taxes range from $100 to $300 more , i. e. , the local rate is from 100 per cent to 300 per cent of the State rate . In Wiesbaden the local income tax rate is zoo per cent , in Dusseldorf 140 per cent , in Frankfort 99 per cent , in Barmen 210 per cent , and in Berlin 100 per cent . Taking the thirty-four largest cities the rate averages 154 per cent of the Prussian rate , and including the State rate , amounts to from 8 to 16 per cent of the incomes of the well-to-do class . The total income tax for State and local purposes averages about to per cent . Some towns have so very few rich men that the local rate is even higher and reaches as much as 500 per cent of the State rate or possibly 24 per cent of a man 's income in all . This , however , is exceptional . Political experience would lead us to expect privilege to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . It does in Great Britain . In both countries it shifts the burdens of taxation onto the backs of the poor . This is not true in Germany , certainly not to the same extent as in other countries . Up to 1899 the Prussian cities collected a house and land tax assessed against the rental value of  |p489  the property , i. e. , upon what the owner happened to get out of the land . The property might be used as a cabbage patch . It paid taxes on its rental value as a cabbage patch . This is still the method of local taxation in vogue in Great Britain . It is against this system that the English cities are vainly protesting to Parliament . It encourages high rents and speculation , and is unjust to those who develop their property . In 1893 the Interior Department of Prussia authorized a change to the American method of assessment based on the capital value of the land . Immediately land taxes were greatly increased . In many cases the increase amounted to many hundreds per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build upon his property or sell it to some one who would . But the reform did not end here . In 1904 the city of Frankfort decided to levy a special tax on the " unearned increment " ? to tax the land speculator still further . The city made a beginning of the single tax , and now collects nearly one-fifth of its taxes from the speculative value which the growth of the city creates . In five years the Frankfort experiment has swept over Germany . It has been adopted by many other cities . It has been carried into Switzerland and has cropped out in Belgium . It inspired the Liberal party in England , and promises to create an issue which will tax the political power of the landed classes in every country in Europe . The first skirmishes of the battle are now being fought in England , Germany , Denmark , Switzerland , and Belgium , where the conviction that the speculative value of the land created by the growth of the community belongs in reality to the city rather than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany this new tax bears the ominous name of the " Wertzuwachsteuer . " As levied in Frankfort , and since copied in almost all of the larger cities , it provides for an increment tax which ranges from 1 to 33 per cent of the profit realized by the seller . If the property does not change hands within twenty years , the tax upon the increase in the value is levied just the same . The rate varies in different cities . It is rapidly progressive , depending upon the amount of profit realized on the sale . In addition to the " Wertzuwachsteuer " there is a transfer tax amounting to 2 per cent on the selling value of the land . These taxes upon the unearned increment and the selling value of the land average about 9.5 per cent of the profits in the cities which apply it . Through these means the city of Frankfort collects one-fifth of its revenues and the city of Dusseldorf three-tenths . This indicates the possibilities of this heretofore untapped source of revenue . It demonstrates , moreover , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the land , no other taxes would be needed . In other words , the city could appropriate the value of city sites which will come into existence in the future and relieve all other forms of property from taxation. * The German cities also levy a business tax known as the Gewerbsteuer . It only applies to those businesses where the profits amount to $385 a year and the capital invested to twice that sum . Strangely enough direct taxation does not lead to niggardliness in expenditure . Quite the reverse . The business men of Germany accept their burdens willingly and take pride in the development of the city . One never hears the everlasting talk about the " rates " so universal in Great Britain , nor do elections turn upon this issue as they do in the latter country , where the most eminent men are frequently defeated for the council for suggesting some needed park , library , housing , or health programme which involves a slight increase in the local rates . There is a penuriousness about city politics in Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is traceable in the former country to the method of raising local revenues by means of taxes on the tenant . The German cities are even more generous than our own . There is a big-minded/ ness about their outlook that is positively unique . The German protests against the cost of the army and the navy , he grumbles about the taxes on trade and inheritances , but he pays with willingness his taxes to the city . I have talked with men from every class , in a dozen cities , about the burdens of local taxation ; I have asked why it was that the city went in for such generous expenditure for schools and parks , for the purchase of land and the erection of school buildings ; why it erected splendid public buildings , art galleries , opera-houses , and contributed so generously to a hundred things which in America would be termed socialistic , and never but once have I heard a complaint . The business man and the workman united in saying substantially the same thing : " It brings business and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which to live " ; or " we must have strong children if we would have good soldiers , and they must be well educated if they would be efficient . " These and similar statements reflect the sentiment of the citizen and his pride in the city . This feeling is well-nigh universal . The German thinks it is good business to do these things , and that even the poorest receives a good return for the taxes which he pays . Measured by the sacrifice involved , Germany spends more generously than any other nation for municipal purposes . The ordinary revenues of the city of Dusseldorf , a city of 290,000 , from taxation alone are $2,677,000 . This is $9.25 per head . Its other revenues , aside from loans , are $3,125,000 more . Its current expenses amount to $20 per head , and its total annual budget to $l00 per head . Frankfort , a city of 335,000 population , raised the sum of $4,860,000 by taxation in 1906 or $14.50 per head. * Of this sum $2,287,334 was collected through the income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tax on house and land rent ; $465,784 by a tax on business , and $979,999 from the tax on change in ownership and the unearned increment tax . The balance came from miscellaneous fees . No attempt is made to tax personal property in any form . Nor are there any octroi or indirect taxes such as prevail in the Latin countries . @# It is quite possible that we should revise our ideas about the extravagance of the American city . Possibly we are niggardly in our expenditures for things municipal . Our failures may be traceable in part to this fact . For when we consider the difference in money values ; that salaries , wages , and the cost of all services are higher in this country than in Germany , it may be that we do not spend as much for city purposes as do the cities of that country . According to a recent Bulletin of the - United States Census it appears that the average per capita expenditure of the American city is but $15.82 . Cities like Cleveland , Baltimore , Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general and special service expenditures of New York are $23.84 per capita . I appreciate that comparisons with other countries are difficult and yet it seems very probable that one of the chief reasons for the superiority of the German city is to be found in the unsuspected fact that more money is spent in that country , relatively to money worth , than in this . The German city is also heavily in debt . The debt of Dusseldorf is $29,000,000 , or $loo per head . This is double the per-capita indebtedness of the average American city of its size . Frankfort has recently burdened itself with a loan of $18,000,000 for the development of its river frontage and harbor . Berlin has a total debt of $99 , - 294,500 . Despite these heavy debts one hears no suggestion of bankruptcy . There is no legal debt limit , and the city can do about as it pleases in the matter of investments . " It is good business , the German official says , for the city to go into debt . The higher the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive undertakings which tend to reduce the tax rate . We would not say a man was bankrupt who had borrowed 6o per cent of his assets . Most real estate is mortgaged up to 50 per cent of its value , and why should not the city borrow on the same principle ? We know that street railways , gas , water , electric lighting , and docks are profitable enterprises . They not only pay their way , but yield a profit as well . Why should not the city own these things rather than turn them over to private individuals to exploit ? " This is the attitude of the official and the citizen .  |p491  The same is true of parks , schools , theatres , opera-houses , and the like . They pay their way , though not so directly . They bring visitors , they make the city attractive as a place of residence . This increases the value of property and in turn the basis of taxation . It is good business for the city to be as beautiful , as comfortable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the cities of south Germany to attract persons to them for purposes of residence and business . Of eight German cities with a total debt of $1.72,536,000 , all but $62,306,900 is for street railways , gas , water , ( locks , etc. , which yield a profit or will do so in time . In Dusseldorf 87 per cent of the city debt is for productive undertakings which more than pay their way . The German city is as thrifty as the German trader . It is planning for dividends . It is looking forward to the time when the earnings from its enterprises will reduce the tax rate . It is even entering the real-estate business with the same idea in view . It buys and sells land both in the city and in the suburbs . It anticipates its own development and as population grows it disposes of its land at a handsome profit . But the motive of city building is not all commercial . The German has a wonderful pride in his city and is willing to make sacrifices in order that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , parks , open spaces , playgrounds , and boulevards are of the most spacious sort . Within the past decade the Rhine cities have developed a wonderful system of wharves and docks , together with the most scientific cranes , tracks , warehouses , and handling devices for the purpose of promoting trade . Duisburg , Cologne , Dusseldorf , Mannheim , Frankfort , and others have expended tens of millions of dollars on these projects , and by so doing have trebled or quadrupled their business and greatly increased their population . All this pays . It pays handsomely , not only in health , in happiness , and in comfort ; it pays in the language that the business man best understands . It pays in dividends . For the cities which do the most things and own the most enterprises have the lowest tax rate . They also have the most contented population . There is something reciprocal about politics . A city that serves its people as do Glasgow , Dusseldorf , Cologne , Frankfort , and Mannheim gets a return in local pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in such towns as Elberfeld , Barmen , and Essen , which have little ambition beyond the conventional preservation of the health , peace , and sanitary surroundings of the town . But I have not yet touched on the thing that sets the German city apart and distinguishes it from all other cities in the world . The German official thinks in a different milieu than does the British or the American official . He starts with the presumption that the city should do anything it sees fit to do provided it will improve the city , reduce the tax rate , or make it a more comfortable , healthful , or better place in which to live . The Anglo-Saxon , on the other hand , starts with an ingrained conviction that the city should do just as little as possible , and that any concession from this principle is fraught with extreme danger . The German has no prejudice against government : he does not look upon it as per se evil and inefficient . The German Burgermeister looks out from the city hall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of Europe . He builds as an architect builds a house or a railway promoter projects his railway into new territory . The city spends great sums to ' adorn its public bridges , school-houses , and public structures . It builds its streets so that they will last for a century , and lays its sewers , gas , water , and other conduits either under the sidewalk or so that they will not have to be disturbed . It employs the best sculptors to fill its parks with bits of marble , - it tears down old sections of the city to clear away its slums or to secure proper settings or vistas for a public structure or to preserve some medæval building . It lays out broad boulevards and arranges them so as to secure fine vistas . Here and there a park or open space is located and adorned with a garden or playground , while along the streets clock towers , fountains , or pieces of statuary are placed . The main thoroughfares have parkways in the centre and street railway tracks and bridle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks and city woods , while in many cities the ring streets ,  |p492  constructed on the sites of the old fortifications , bring the parkage down to the heart of the city . There are few city halls in all America which compare in beauty and splendor with those of Munich , Hamburg , Leipsic , and a half dozen other cities . The cities also own opera-houses , theatres , and town halls where operas and dramatic performances are given , while the best of concerts may be heard by the city orchestra for an insignificant cost several times a week . The same generosity is shown in education . The school-houses are of the most elaborate sort . Hospitals , convalescent homes , nursing establishments , and tuberculosis sanitariums in the country are the equal if not the superior of any in the world . Everywhere the architect , the landscape gardener , and the artist control the builder . Beauty is not a private esoteric privilege ? it is the common possession of all . Every bit of water is jealously preserved and beautified . The banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navigable rivers are not only the c9ntres of recreation , they are the source of the city 's commerce and industrial development . There is nothing that is tawdry , nothing that is cheap , nothing that is cheese-paring in German expenditure , relatively poor as the German people are . Germany almost alone in the world is building her cities with an eye to the future , conscious of the fact that the city is the centre of the civilization of to-morrow . Government means much more to the people in Germany than it does in America . It means a thousand services which promote the health and the well-being , the rearing of strong children and efficient ones ; it means the assurance to the people of the maximum of service at the minimum of cost in those elemental services which area necessity of life . The German city seeks to make life as full of sweetness , of beauty , of variety as is possible through co-operative effort . Herein is the great difference between the German and the American city . The one remains an . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , able to care for himself and wanting only to be left alone ; the other is an organized , living thing with a big and farseeing programme of the needs of humanity , and bending its intelligence and its powers to their satisfaction .
