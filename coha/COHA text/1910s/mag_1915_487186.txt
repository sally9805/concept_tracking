The Secret Memoirs of Count Tadasu Hayashi . Edited by A. M. Pooley . New York-G . P. Putnam 's Sons . $2.50 net . Whatever throws light upon a political transaction so fraught with world-wide import as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of thirteen years ago , and upon the man chiefly responsible for it , deserves immediate and careful attention . It will go down to posterity associated with the name of Count Hayashi , for seven years the representative of Japan at the Court of St. James 's , and the first to enjoy the rank of Ambassador . In the " Secret Memoirs " ( Chap . III ) he states that he arrived at a time when " England was tired of war , that in South Africa having just been concluded . " But although Pretoria was occupied in June of 1900 , the treaty of peace was not signed until two years thereafter ; and the editor makes the necessary correction in a foot-note . The Boxer troubles in China were causing much anxiety just then , and the British Government was grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops to Peking . The whole conduct of this expedition , the behavior of the troops , the moderation shown in the diplomatic transactions which followed , were particularly creditable to the island empire , and Hayashi deservedly received much of the credit . At this period Japanese statesmen were divided into two parties : those who were pro-British and those who favored a Russian alliance . The naval men , who came mostly from the island of Kyushu , were pro-British , while Ito and the Choshu military party preferred to make friendly overtures to St. Petersburg . Hayashi , a native of Yedo ( Tokyo ) , and son of a physician attached to the court of the Shogun , belonged to neither faction ; but , as it happened , his training had been English . He was one of fourteen youths sent to London at the very close of the Shogunate Government to receive a European education , and entered University College in the summer of 1867 . Shortly afterwards , however , he , with his fellows , was hurriedly recalled , and in the revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his old master , the Shogun . After a short imprisonment , he was released , and was soon in the way of promotion . He was attached as interpreter to the notable Iwakura mission of the year 1871 , which visited the chief countries of Europe and America and reported on foreign methods of life and government ; as a decade later he was to be attached to the Ito mission which gave Japan her attack of " German measles . " Mr. Pooley , in his biographical sketch , fails to mention this second opportunity Hayashi enjoyed of seeing the world of politics at close quarters . The writer of this article remembers how carefully he summed up in conversation the various impressions made upon him in this later mission . Of all the countries they visited , Portugal struck him as the least satisfactory . The visit to London , so summarily cut short in 1867 , was not to be his last . Within a few years he was in the diplomatic service , attached to the London Embassy . The experience he received was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future career . He became a thorough critic of governmental methods , with a keen sense of the honor involved . in treaty keeping or breaking ; restive under militarism , and an ardent believer in press publicity . To this fact we owe the publication of these " Secret Memoirs " which profoundly disgusted the Tokyo Government , as telling tales out of school . Mr. Pooley 's narrative of the capture of the burked manuscript makes good reading ( pp. 29-36 ) . In one of the valuable " Notes " inserted in the " Memoirs " ( close of Chap . VII ) , there is a significant passage dealing with the status of Japanese Cabinets . It helps to explain the charges of bad faith brought against Hayashi , who was personally the most honorable of men , with high ideals of political morality : The mistake which Count Hayashi seems to have made was in thinking that , because the Saionji Cabinet was in power , it was , therefore , going to govern the country . The policies of Japan are made by the Genro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry for the time being . With a majority of the Genro belonging to the militarist faction , it is easy to realize the difficult position in which a Minister bent on curbing the ambitions of the army would find himself . Ever since the revolution of 1868 , which was brought about by leaders of the Satsuma and Choshu clans , Japan has been ruled by an oligarchy , known as the Sat-Cho clique , who believe in settling things by the sword . The refusal of the Japanese Government in 1876 to decide the Korean question at that time by force of arms is held to have been the controlling motive for the ill-advised Satsuma rebellion , when the heroic Saigo met his death . From the outset Hayashi was an official in the confidence of the Sat-Cho clique , but not one of them . He deplored the frequent arrogance of the army . In the chapter on Foreign Policy ( p. 264 ) , he gives expression to this dislike : " Generally speaking , soldiers who have won battles have done so by making sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  their own lives . Naturally , they want to gain fame , they want to appropriate , as a result of victory and risk , as many privileges as possible to crown their success in arms . . . . It is easy to imagine how boastful and aggressive our soldiers were after the Russo-Japanese War . By what they did there after the war we lost not only the good-will of the Chinese , but have also won the adverse criticism of Europeans and Americans . " As the editor of the " Memoirs " intimates , he would have deeply regretted the recent aggressive policy of his Government , which in the period since his lamented death has converted simmering dislike into furious hatred . It is noticeable that hatred of Japan seems now to be the prevailing topic in Chinese magazines Published in this country , and it is a new development . " The principal point on which the late Cabinet was attacked , " remarks the Count at page 256 , " was that we had spent in Manchuria several hundred millions of yen dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges in that country . We ought not , therefore , to be slack in our policy in Manchuria . We ought still to extend further the rights which we have acquired and to strengthen the foundations of our position there , but on no account are we to make China our enemy . The object of Japan ought to be to maintain the peace of the Orient and obtain Chinese goodwill and trust . " That Hayashi , as Foreign Minister in the Saionji Cabinet , started out with an honest desire to follow the policy of the " Open Door " in China and respect her independence and integrity , may be conceded ; but he was compelled to drift from his moorings and to take up the other policy of " spheres of influence . " It is the bitter complaint of the Chinese vernacular press that the constant reiteration on the part of Japan and other Powers that they intend to respect the independence and integrity of China is meaningless verbiage . " Whatever has been leased by the Chinese Government , " remarkau iv u , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aso ( P. 221 ) , " is now almost invested with the rights of occupation , and whatever has not been leased , but is bordering on the leased territory , is in danger of being enclosed in the same . " Modern militarism is , in the last issue , immoral and unscrupulous ; and it is pitiable to note how a scholar and a gentleman like Hayashi , a man who under representative institutions would have been a pillar of strength and a model of consistency , saw his good name compromised and his cherished policies thwarted and nullified by pressure from a military clique . It is to his bitter disappointment and disgust that we owe the publication of the " Secret Memoirs , " which in a free country like our own would have taken the form of platform speeches or invectives on the floor of Congress . The editor , though generally sympathetic , is not always happy in the treatment of his subject . He credits the Count with an inadequate knowledge of America , where he himself may be at fault : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his whole career was in connection with the one country he had never visited . " Now , as a member of the Iwakura mission , he must have visited America in 1871 ; and what about the later Ito mission ? Moreover , Mr. Pooley fails to show that Hayashi made any such blunder in his handling of American questions . He was hand-and-glove with Fukuzawa , editor of the Jiji Shimpo , the medium through which from time to time he gave anonymous publicity to his cherishedopinions . This great publicist was founder of the Keio University , which for the past quarter of a century has had on its staff able American graduates , one of whom is now our Minister to Greece . Nowhere in the Japanese Empire is there a journal in fuller touch with American policy and ideals than the Jih , Shrinpo . Mr. Pooley believes that Hayashi , when Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1907 , played a fast-and-loose game with this country . Viscount Aoki was then Japanese Minister at Washington ; married , by the way , to a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Aoki and Hayashi , " says Mr. Pooley ( p. 19 ) , " recognized that China was the crux of the difficulty between Japan and America . Aoki realized that if the problem of China were settled , ' Japan would be able to maintain her credit at Washington , for the school and immigration affairs were local difficulties on which it was uncertain even that Japan was in the right . Hayashi tried to shut out America from China by raising difficulties for her nearer home . He failed to realize that the Americans are a hard-headed business race , with a strong undercurrent of sentimentality . To their remonstrances with regard to Manchuria , he retorted by raising the school question . They came back with the immigration trouble , and Hayashi found that he had slung a boomerang , - which returned in double-quick time , bringing with it the whole of the credit which Japan had so carefully amassed in the States during LILY y 0an b llab1. ? " In a few months he killed the long-established s friendship between America and Japan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly expressed dislike and suspicion , and on the other a swelling hatred , which is only kept within manageable bounds by official repression . " This is pure moonshine . Hayashi played no such political game , nor can the anti-Japanese agitation in America he explained in this way . His disagreement with Aoki , which resulted in the recall of the latter , was of a technical nature , a breach of diplomatic etiquette , and Princes Ito and Katsura agreed with Hayashi In his disapproval . The matter may be allowed to stand as explained by Hayashi in the eighth chapter of the " Memoirs . " Aoki 's attempt on his own initiative to patch up an agreement with this country , which should contain no account whatever of the immigration problem , was tactless and impossible . Hayashi states ( p. 251 ) that the three questions between Japan and America in 1908 were " the immigration question , the school question , and the problem of China . " He was right in placing the immigration question first . The anti-Japanese movement in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign in San Francisco , followed by the organization in May of that year of the Asiatic Exclusion League . It was a burning question long before the private diplomatic difference between Hayashi and Aoki , which occurred late in the year 1907 . The close of the Aoki-Hayashi =quarrel is interesting . After his recall the Viscount is said to have succeeded in excluding his rival from the Privy Council , a seat that was his due because of his great services to the nation . The other alleged reason for his exclusion was that he had become a Free Mason during his stay in London . Mr. Pooley is hardly a safe guide to fellow in these international matters . He credits the Japanese with an " innate contempt , a burning detestation for all white men , " beside which the " vicious deep-seated contempt " that exists between Chinese and Japanese sinks into a vanishing quantity . Many who know the Japanese best might be ready to reverse , and then modify , the statement . His acquaintance with the Japanese public is probably limited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by disgruntled soshi ? " political bullies . " Count Hayashi has a significant paragraph ( Chap . VII , p. 226 ) on this topic : The public in Japan is rather cool in its interest in foreign affairs , indeed I could almost say it is indifferent . When , however , something happens that forces the public to pay some attention to foreign affairs , then at once the public seems to get intoxicated , as though drunk with alcohol , and it behaves as if it were not able to discriminate , just as an intoxicated man can not tell the difference between sake ( rice beer ) and water . In many respects the most interesting pages in the " Memoirs " are to be found at the close of the first chapter , where the Count tells how German diplomatic clumsiness wounded Japanese sensitiveness at its most delicate point . After the signature of the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 , which concluded the war between China and Japan , the Japanese were greatly surprised when Germany suddenly took common action with France and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the intervention of Russia and France , but why should Germany push in ? Great Britain had refused the invitation of Russia to join in the intervention , on the ground that such an act would be contrary to the established principles of international relationship , and the reason applied quite as strongly to Germany . But not only did Germany send a separate note , in addition to the joint note of Russia and France , but she inserted therein a blunt threat of possible resort to arms . Here is the story in Hayashi 's own words ( p. 83 ) : The same day April 23 the German Minister Baron von Gutschmid called at the Foreign Office , where Hayashi was Acting Minister , but later in the afternoon . In spite of a sufficient knowledge of English and French , the German Minister apparently thought it an indignity to draft a memorandum in either of these languages , and in consequence of my inability to understand German , brought me a memorandum written in romaii , Japanese written in Roman letters , according to the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it out . Now the secretary was extremely well acquainted with the ordinary Japanese script , and was vexed at having to read out an unfamiliar transcript of the original text , which had been composed from Chinese ideographs It was quite clear that neither the secretary nor the Minister understood a single word of what the former was reading , while I , though paying the deepest attention , was barely able to catch the meaning of the memorandum . The memorandum which had been left by the French and Russian Ministers was practically a brief sentence advising the retrocession of the territory acquired by the Treaty of Shimonoseki , and giving as a reason for the advice friendship for the neighboring country . The German memorandum , on the other hand , said there was no possibility of Japan being able to hope for a victory in fighting Russia . Germany , and France , and therefore it would be beneficial for Japan if the advice tendered by the three Powers should be accepted . Standing at the table opposite to the German Minister , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia and France , have been here and have given friendly advice for the purpose of maintaining peace , and in doing so they have used a friendly terminology . But your Excellency 's memorandum is ' phrased as if it were the proposal to solve the question by force of arms . If you mean this , then the dignity of the state , as well as the feeling of the nation , must be considered , let alone the words in which the memorandum is couched . It seems as if the memorandum has been couched in the Japanese language , with which you are unfamiliar , and consequently errors have been made in the use of words . " The German Minister , in the most awkward manner , said that the views expressed by me as being in the memorandum were not so meant , and if such views occurred in it , it was due to errors in the wording of the memorandum in Japanese . He promised to cancel the memorandum and asked me to regard the German memorandum as being identical with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers at the time , remarks Mr. Pooley ( p. 54 ) , were curiously prophetic in their expressions of disgust at their Government 's policy . " In a struggle with France and Russia , " said the IV eueste Nachrichten , of Berlin , " Japan would be a very useful ally , and her forces are strong enough to distract from her western frontier a good portion . of the Russian armies . At the end of the affair we seriously fear that Germany will pay bitterly for her action , for the Japanese will eventually seek their revenge . " While giving Hayashi credit for the bringing about of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902 , and its renewal on a broader basis in 1905 , " the crown of Hayashi 's career , " Mr. Pooley regrets that it was ever signed . " I shall be very much surprised , " he declares towards the close of his Introduction , " if within a few years England does not realize that her money and her support have raised up against us in the Far East a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one infinitely more difficult to handle , on account of her geographical position . " It is a pity that the book lacks an alphabetical index . The editor 's English is at times somewhat slovenly ; for instance , at page 28 , where he complains that " for many years the British and American press have been so slovenly represented in Tokio , and indeed is so to-day . " Not so with the " Memoirs , " for Hayashi prided himself on his English , and is author of an excellently written novel ( " For His People " ; Harper , 1903 ) , a faithful picture of pre-Restoration times in Japan . There occur a few blunders in the Introduction . " Masumae " ( p. 6 ) should be Matsitmae , Kido was never " Marquis " ( p. 8 ) , and Hayashi was Secretary , not of " the Industrial Bureau " ( p. 9 ) , but of the great Department of Public Works ( Kdbusho ) , abolished in 1886.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
