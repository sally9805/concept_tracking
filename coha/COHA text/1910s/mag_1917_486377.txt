WE must assume that the problem of priority , in its very highest terms , has been receiving the earnest attention of President Wilson . We can not help feeling also that the clean-cut formulation of such a supreme priority policy would help greatly to solve the clash between lesser priorities and necessities . There are four great contributions for which the Allies look to America . They need food , ships , men , and munitions . They need them all badly enough , to be sure , but there must be , after all , a varying degree of necessity . Which of these ought to come first ? So far as the general public is concerned , it is distracted by special claims set forth by special advocates . We had first of all Roosevelt 's clamor for the immediate transportation of a volunteer army to France , no matter how trained or equipped . Then there came the famous interview with Joffre , whose obscurities have not yet been cleared up , but which was generally interpreted as a fervent demand for men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships came to the front . Thereafter food loomed up , and with ships has remained most conspicuous in the public mind . Now Mr. McCormick returns from France with a plea for guns and munitions from Gen. P ? tain . But while Mr. McCormick is still speaking there comes an intimation from apparently high authority that what France needs , after all , is  --  men . I F one were to frame a table of priorities simply by ab-stract reasoning , first place would have to go to ships , since upon ships depends the supply of food , men , and munitions for the Allied armies and populations . But inasmuch as tonnage can be found for food even under present conditions , Mr. Hoover 's work comes up into first place ; and that , too , because the food problem exists here as well as in Europe . Upon food conditions in this country is dependent the energy with which we can prosecute the building of ships , the raising and training of armies , and the production of guns and munitions . As between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more pressing necessity of the two . If that is true , then there is partial vindication for Gen. Crozier in the matter of rifle shortage in our training camps , since obviously a gun in the hands of a French soldier already in the trenches is more effective against the Kaiser than a gun in the hands of a man who may not see Europe till the spring or summer of next year . Such considerations would indicate a general priority table of ( 1 ) food , ( 2 ) ships , ( 3 ) munitions , ( 4 ) men . But whatever may be the best arrangement , it is obvious that a definite scheme is needed . The Inter-Allied War Council would be largely justifying itself if it could assist the United States in establishing the right order of precedence , based on a thorough study of the whole war problem instead of on individual impressions and opinions . S ENATOR REED having proved Mr. Hoover an incompetent and a public danger long before he started work , sees no sense in giving Hoover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , and that there is any difference between a Senatorial investigation and a criminal prosecution seems hardly to occur to him . Mr. Hoover had previously requested through his attorney that he should be heard ; several of Mr. Reed 's committee warned him that he was creating an impression of unfairness in so manoeuvring that repeated charges were brought against Hoover , and nothing was allowed to appear through regular channels in defence . Mr. Reed 's attitude is " Away with him ! " Hoover can be called on Friday , when the sugar question will be supplanted in the public mind by the coal investigation begun Wednesday , and he can be badgered on the stand by Mr. Reed himself ; meanwhile let no statement from him be officially admitted . Senator Reed ought to know that such procedure simply convinces the country that the case against Hoover is so weak that it can not be supported . M R. HOOVER may derive some consolation from the present German food dictator 's predicament . Herr von Waldow is the fourth or fifth incumbent of this Prussian office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopularity . Now he , himself , seems to be standing on the brink , because he has permitted some of the munition companies to profiteer at the expense of their employees . He might have been as innocent of all complicity in this conspiracy as Liebknecht , as efficient in the pursuit of his duties as a Prussian drill-sergeant , yet he could not have eventually escaped popular censure . Food dictators have a hard row to hoe . In the first place , they must face people 's unwillingness to draw their belts generally tighter ; secondly , they must try to suspend the customary laws of supply and demand in all the main commodities , erect a huge dam of Government regulation against the operation of these laws . Any leakage leads at once to a roar of condemnation . Thus they have to face a storm of abuse from both sides , from producers as well as consumers . This is why the casualties among food dictators are so great , greater , perhaps , than in any other branch of the service . T HE inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as commander of the Rainbow Division is not surprising . He is the fourth general to be weeded out in two weeks ' time , and doubtless others will follow rapidly . But the question is , why were these generals commissioned without first being examined ? Gen. Mann was obviously unfit for the strain ; his being sent abroad in charge of a militia division can only , therefore , be looked upon as a reward for his long service as chief of the militia division . But if an efficient army is to be created , only men can be generals who are absolutely fit , mentally and physically , whose minds are young enough to be fully capable of rapid adjustment to an ever-changing warfare . The long list of German , French , Italian , and English generals found wanting , of whom the latest is Gen. Sarrail , is proof of this , and the sooner our War Department realizes it the better . Also , it is not too soon to introduce the foreign system of holding all commanding officers , from colonels up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them promptly if they fall below the standard . It is well to talk of rigid discipline for disorderly men in the ranks , but the way to begin to discipline an army is with its highest officers . C HAIRMAN HURLEY 'S statement and cross-examina-tion leave in clear relief the actual causes of delay in shipbuilding , and a certain comfort may be extracted from the fact that some were unavoidable and others largely so . Labor troubles on the Pacific Coast played no small part till a few weeks ago , but are almost wholly adjusted now . A shortage of cars to transport materials caused temporary delay in some yards . A change in the design of the wooden ships has cut down the tonnage of the wooden fleet to the possible extent of 250,000 tons , Mr. Hurley not committing himself to an exact figure . A great delay was occasioned at the outset because hundreds of men sought contracts with the Government who had no shipyards and knew nothing about ship-construction , and careful sifting was necessary to determine which were worthy of Government support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution of Admiral Capps , caused a delay " from the last week in July until late in September " in letting contracts for most of 100,000 tons . One serious cause of delay still exists in the housing problem at Baltimore , Philadelphia , Wilmington , and other cities with great yards near ; and Congress should heed Chairman Hurley 's statement that at least $20,000,000 is needed to meet it . " T HE purpose of this memorable meeting , " said Foreign Minister von Kilhlmann at the formal opening of the peace conference at Brest-Litovsk yesterday , " is to terminate the war between the Central Powers and Russia . " But it is not to the Central Powers that the Bolshevik negotiators are primarily addressing themselves , and it is not upon Russia that the German mind is really fixed . By the Bolsheviki the purpose has been avowed . For the Central Powers there speaks the readiness with which they have seized upon an opening for peace conversations . Why should the proceedings of the peace conference have begun , at von Kilhlmann 's suggestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of a satisfactory peace , seeing that the Russians are thinking in terms of a general peace ? Analyze this programme formulated by the head of the Russian delegation , and it clearly envisages problems that affect the Allies as a whole . The fifth clause in the Russian formula , dealing with reparation and reconstruction , says " the same principles shall be applicable to colonies as to the parent countries . " But Germany has no Russian colonies in hand , and the Russians have no Central colonies . The final clause speaks of economic boycotts and naval blockades , of which the latter has no meaning for Russia . And when the Russians demand that " national groups not independent before the war shall decide by a referendum whether they shall become independent or give their allegiance to some Power , " the reference is unmistakably to Alsace-Lorraine , to Italian claims , to Bohemia and the Jugoslays  --  though , logically , too , to the Poles in Prussian Posen ! T HE full version of Lloyd George 's speech of last Thurs- day shows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war aims and the official British viewof the military situation . But the speech as a whole takes on a more serious tone in the passages dealing with the economic situation in England , and , in particular , the shipping problem , omitted in the condensed version . Concerning the food situation , Lloyd George speaks of a visible improvement in " the circumstances which have occasioned so much anxiety to us during the last few days , " a state of things which has been brought out in recent dispatches . Concerning shipbuilding , the Premier admits that his sanguine prognostications of last summer have not been fulfilled ; though this is properly countered by a decline in destruction by submarines and an increase in destruction of submarines . If shipbuilding to-day , as Lloyd George says , is about the rate of the " boom " year of 1913 , this would mean about two million tons a year , or at least half a million tons below the present annual rate of Great Britain 's losses through the U-boats . The sobering effect of the speech arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , like Lloyd George 's of a year ago regarding the assurance of the food supply , has not been fully justified . ' R EAR-ADMIRAL FISKE 'S plan for the destruction of the German fleet by aerial attack echoes the question which a great many plain citizens have been asking themselves these three years and more . Here are the German ships huddled up in the Kiel Canal ; what easier than to drop a lot of bombs on them ? Putting aside the question whether in any appreciable future the Allies can marshal a sufficient air fleet , the question arises how near to the truth is Admiral Fiske 's conception of German naval arrangements . " Germany 's entire fleet is concentrated in the region of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven . All her naval eggs are in one basket . " Here is the popular idea of the German warships lying nose to stern in the Kiel Canal and waiting to be bombed like a railway station . Perhaps the German target is not so compact as Admiral Fiske thinks . We have heard of German Dreadnoughts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German naval concentration may be more properly visualized as extending from Heligoland to the mouth of the Gulf of Finland , a good many hundred miles . But assume that the German naval eggs are all in one small basket ; what then ? Is not the British Grand Fleet all in one small basket somewhere in the fogs of a North Sea port ? If German aeroplane , Zeppelin , and submarine have failed to get at that magnificent basketful of eggs , what are the chances the other way ? I T can not be denied that Col. Lewis 's testimony before the Senate Military Committee will add to the disquiet which the investigation into army matters is arousing . That he is profoundly biassed  --  to the point of bitterness  --  is obvious ; his assumption of infallibility , as when he insisted that the Browning gun broke down during the trials  --  although he was not present , he just knew it must have broken down  --  defeats itself . But he has undeniably a strong position when he cites the fact that 70,000 of his guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government is now buying them , despite the fact that they were at first rejected . Why should this loss of time have occurred ? Why with war in sight was it not the Ordnance Bureau 's duty to buy a gun that satisfied the British and Belgian armies , even if it is not as perfect as the Browning weapon ? The search for the ideal is always commendable , but there is such a thing as being practical , particularly in war time . The worst phase of Col. Lewis 's testimony is indubitably the bias of the Ordnance Bureau towards the inventor . The latter may cherish the luxury of a grievance and be full of spleen , but the War Department has no right to imitate him . We can not , therefore , find any excuse whatever for the attitude of the officials towards Col. Lewis personally . He is a brother officer , and his attitude in offering to give up all his enormous royalties was patriotic and unselfish . Yet he could get no acknowledgment of his fine attitude , nor even obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His checks were deposited in the Treasury and the United States availed itself of this voluntary gift , but this great Government was too busy even to say thank you . No amount of bad blood between Col. Lewis and Gen. Crozier can explain or palliate treatment like that . EWARE of vidders , " the Pension Bureau echoes the elder Weller . That it has reason to do so is shown by the fact that though not a soldier of the War of 1812 survives , there are 109 pensioned widows of such soldiers . There are only 384 survivors of the Mexican War , but there are 3,442 widows of the veterans . The explanation is less for experts in longevity than the sociologists , who may tell us just why old veterans ( with pensions valid after death ) are so often attractive to comparatively young women . The pensioned widows of Civil War veterans practically equal the number of survivors . The latest report of the Bureau chronicles the workings of a characteristic bit of pension legislation  --  the act of September 8 , 1916 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows , including not only those who had been wives of Civil War soldiers during the conflict , but widows who had passed or should pass the age of seventy , even if married much later than the war . It also amended the law declaring widows of soldiers and sailors who had married prior to June 27 , 1890 , eligible to a pension , by changing the date to June 27 , 1905 . Under this law the total number of widows who had their pensions nearly doubled was more than 155,000 , and the number of widows added to the roll by the fifteen-year extension was 6,147 . U NLESS there is an epidemic of special sessions of Legislatures next year , we shall have to wait until 1919 at least for the finish fight over nation-wide prohibition . Only eleven Legislatures meet regularly in 1918 . The contest in those eleven , however , will be watched with keen interest . Only five of the eleven voted for the amendment in the House . As their vote in every case was one-sided , attention will be centred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , each of which voted two to one against the amendment ; New Jersey , which was even more decided ; Massachusetts and Rhode Island , which gave only majorities against , and Louisiana , which was evenly divided . The capture of a sjngle one of these six will be hailed by the prohibition forces as the beginning of the end , for exactly the number of States required to adopt the amendment , thirty-six , voted for it by their delegations in the House . The opposition was made up of seven States against it and five tied , not counting absentees . For any State won in the House and lost at its own capital , the " drys " will have to win only one of these divided States . W HILE we are noting the ability of academic men like Wilson , Milyukov , and Painleve to enter public lifeconspicuously , we must not forget that in Britain the greatest public men are able to don the garb of the academic specialist with scholarly distinction . The Romanes lecture on a scientific or literary subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be given in 1918 by Mr. Asquith ; and he is the sixth statesman to occupy the lectureship . Gladstone was the first , in 1892 ; five years later John Morley spoke upon " Machiavelli " ; in 1902 Bryce discussed " The Relations of the Advanced and Backward Races of Mankind " ; in 1907 Lord Curzon lectured upon " Frontiers " ; and in 1909 Balfour followed with his " Criticism of Beauty . " Varied achievement by one man in fields of the intellect and of active affairs is better known abroad than here , far as it is from being unknown here . We need not turn to the great nations , but can find examples of it in Spain , or in little Norway , which has just sent us a statesman and scientist in Nansen . But the list of five living British statesmen invited to deliver the Romanes lecture offers an intellectual array that it would be difficult to match in any other land . A nation may be prouder of finding such scholarly minds among those who have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars one who is fitted to turn to affairs with success . F OR two years the United States has had poor wheat yields ; the consequence of a third might be so serious that even the December reports on crop conditions will be carefully scanned . They are encouraging as to the efforts of the farmers , who have planted a record of 42,170,000 acres , and would have planted nearly the 47,000,000 asked had weather conditions been favorable . They are discouraging in that the state of the crop is unprecedentedly poor . The net result is a forecast of 540,000,000 bushels of winter wheat , which would ordinarily not be bad . Only twice , when in 1914 we raised 685,000,000 bushels of winter wheat , and in 1915 , 655,000,000 , has it been exceeded ; and it is slightly more than the average of the five years ending 1915 . But the showing is so far from promising the record crop needed that the country must encourage a heavy planting of spring wheat . The best crop of spring wheat ever grown was nearly 360,000,000 bushels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country may reasonably try to surpass the 400 , - 000,000-bushel mark . 1 T is noteworthy that the movement for a free port at New York has gone so far that the Federal Tariff Commission is holding hearings on it , that the House Committee on Ways and Means is expected to join in them , and that Representative Hulbert is preparing a bill . England 's free-trade policy , making her ports virtually open , and Germany 's free ports at Hamburg , Bremen , and Lilbeck , are recognized to be important factors in their acquisition and retention of overseas commerce . Antwerp , Copenhagen , Singapore , and Hongkong are other free ports , all great trading centres . It is asserted that carrying trade will go hundreds of miles to escape tariff barriers , and by the establishment of a free-port zone at places like Boston and New York , where cargoes brought from abroad merely for transshipment to another foreign port might be placed in warehouses and broken and remade without payment of customs due or unnecessary red-tape , the business of this port might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of export houses which could hold goods indefinitely to meet the varying trade demands of various parts of the world , and of mercantile houses which could exhibit in the free port merchandise for inspection by buyers before importation was decided upon . All that is yet planned is an experimental measure . It is to be hoped that something definite will grow cut of the hearings . Pr HE second refusal of Australia to vote conscription I ought to end the agitation for it there . So far as the returns show , the vote against it is larger than before . Victoria , which in 1916 voted for it , this year gave a majority of 1,500 against it . Thus Premier Hughes 's hope of following in Canada 's footsteps goes a-glimmering , and with it no doubt a good deal of his prestige . We have been hearing very little of Australia in the news , but it has been thrcugh a most hectic year , with a general strike bordering on revolution and the almost complete tying up of all shipping for months at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bushel of the 600,000 tons of wheat it agreed to take because of lack of shipping , and the sinking of several steamers in the Australian trade has further complicated matters . While the country has been enjoying a distinct war prosperity and the Government has had no trouble in raising its war loans , Australia has not been a happy country , and will welcome the coming of peace as readily as any other land . At least , however , Australia , like Canada , has clung to the democratic ideal of letting its citizens vote on so vital a question as conscription . Cerebral Congestion at Washington W E fancy that if a physician were asked to diagnose the trouble at Washington , he would say that too much blood was going to the brain . The flushed face ; the irritability ; the restlessness ; the headaches ; the turning from one subject of attention to another  --  are tell-tale symptoms . Political students and party leaders predicted something like what we now see , if the process went on . The tasks would become too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay , cross-purposes , inefficiency , and general congestion of the public business such as used to curse St. Petersburg when a man in Vladivostok could not build a house without getting a permit from the capital . Something of all this was visible in Washington even before the war . Federal employees spawned like mushrooms . New commissions , new bureaus , grew up over-night . And , inevitably , the war intensified the tendency . Not only were the military activities of the Government doubled and quadrupled . Every incidental difficulty that arose , every new form of control that seemed needful , was at once referred to Washington . But it was impossible that all things could be done equally well . In the terrible pressure of business some affairs were certain to be overlooked or neglected , others to be muddled . The Congressional investigations now going on have disclosed little beyond what in the nature of the case must have occurred . Little Fathers at Washington were certain to give some of their children cause for complaint . Two explanations are commonly advanced . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute the Government policies . It is alleged that Mr. Wilson is not a good judge of men ; that he has not a sure businesssense ; that he chooses incompetents to do impossibles . Doubtless there is some truth in this . But a President of absolutely infallible judgment in picking subordinates could not succeed in making everything function smoothly in so gigantic a system as the work of administration has grown to be . There would have to be perfect intelligence and flawless efficiency from top to bottom of the organization , if there were to be no friction and no blunders . Even super-men at the head could not make the million feet of the Federal service march in perfect goose-step . It is the overpowering nature of the burden laid upon Washington which is the main cause of congestion . Some say , and this is the second explanation , that the fault lay in Congress for turning over everything to the Administration . If Congress had kept its hand upon the whole business , lucid order and swift movement would have followed . Anybody who believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the trouble arises from the action of Congress . One complaint is that army officials and executive officers are suffocated in red tape . But who wrapped them in it ? Congress , by a set of statutes directly tending to penalize personal initiative and confine everything within routine trammels . And as for having a free hand for Government business , Congress has more than it can do in attending to its own . If the Administration is staggering and dizzy under the load put upon it , Congress is also . It can inquire into administrative failures ? and is quite right in so doing  --  but if it were to take over the work itself , it would only multiply worse failures . The knotty question of a remedy is discussed by Professor Willoughby , of the Institute for Government Research , in the December number of the Political Science Quarterly . He proposes , seriously , that we make of the Government a " holding corporation . " By this he means that separate branches of the Federal service should be set up as distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget , its own programme , merely having to report to Congress for approval and further authority . Thus we should have one corporation for shipping , another for the Panama Canal , another for the Post Office , another for the Government printing , and so on . Professor Willoughby admits that it would be extremely difficult to induce Congress to part with its powers in this way , and , indeed , urges only that a glow and cautious beginning be made . His proposal is interesting at least in showing how pressing is the problem of decentralizing the work of the Government , now more and more coil centrated in Washington , as it is , and pressing with ever greater severity upon President and Cabinet . John Stuart Mill 's formula was to collect all the information and direction possible at the centre of Government , but to have the actual work diffused widely . We are certainly getting plain warnings that to ask the Administration to do at the same time all the thinking and all the work , is to invite a cerebral breakdown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
