WHEN I hear all around me the foolish prattle about the new immi ? gration ? " the scum of Europe , " as it is called ? that is invading and making itself master of this country , I can not help saying to myself that Americans have forgotten America . The native , 1 must conclude , has , by long familiarity with the rich blessings of his own land , grown for ? getful of his high privileges and ceased to grasp the lofty message which America wafts across the seas to all the oppressed of mankind . What , I wonder , do they know of America , who know only America ? The more I think upon the subject the more I become persuaded that the relation of the teacher and the taught as between those who were born and those who came here must be reversed . It is the free American who needs to be instructed by the benighted races in the uplifting word that America speaks to all the world . Only from the humble immigrant , it appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family of nations . The alien must know this , for he alone seems ready to pay the heavy price for his share of America . He , unlike the older inhabi ? tant , does not come into its inheritance by the accident of birth . Before he can become an American he must first he an immigrant . More than that , back of immigration lies emigration . And to him alone is it given to know the bitter sacrifice and the deep up ? heaval of the soul that are implied in those two words . Oh , if I could show you America as we of the oppressed peoples see it ! If I could bring home to you even the smallest fraction of this sacrifice and this upheaval , the dreaming and the strife , the agony and the heartache , the endless disappointments , the yearn-ing , and the despair ? all of which must he ours before we can make a home for our battered spirits in this land of yours . Perhaps , if we he young , we dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may merely seek a haven for our outraged human souls and a safe retreat for our hungry wives and children . Yet , however aggrieved we may feel toward our native home . we can not but regard our leaving it as a violent severing of the ties of our fife , and look beyond toward our new home as a sort of glorified exile . So , whether we be young or old , something of our ? selves we always leave behind in our hapless , cherished birthplaces . And the heaviest share of our burden inevi ? tably falls on the loved ones that remain when we are gone . We make no illu ? sions for ourselves . Though we may expect wealth , we have no thought of returning . It is farewell forever . We are not setting out on a trip ; we are emigrating . Yes , we are emigrating , and there is our experience , our ordeal , in a nutshell . It is the one-way pass ? port for us every time . For we have glimpsed a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the cost , we shall make her our own . In our heavy-laden hearts we arc already Americans . In our own dumb way we have grasped her message to us . The story of my own migration , which I am now about to relate , is thus more than a mere personal narrative . It is an account of the aspiration of a great company of people toward an ideal , and of the manner in which that aspiration was realized . In a sense , indeed , it is the tale of all immigrants to America , from the first voyage of the Mayflower to the landing of the latest steerage passenger . And if I have allowed my own experi ? ences and emotions to occupy a large part of the canvas , it is only because they are representative of the mass , and because it is much easier and perhaps more effective to portray the individual life than the collective . It was in the early winter of 1899 that a certain fellow-countryman whom I choose to call Couza , burst in upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in America , to stir us out of our lethargy and our self-sufficiency . And it was no more than six months , if I recall aright , after his sudden departure , before the greater part of Vaslui 's men of wealth and distinc ? tion had rolled away in carriage and railway car and steamboat . It is strange , the effect of one great person ? ality on the life of an entire community . One fortnight of Couza simply revolu ? tionized our existence . Well-to-do , re ? spectable merchants took the habit of bankruptcy and made off to America with their creditors ' funds . The value of real estate dropped to one-fourth its customary level , and there came a time soon when no one could be in ? duced to buy a house or a farm at any price . Personal property . including fur ? niture , horses , and even clothing , were given away in such quantities that trade was completely at a standstill . And what took place in Vaslui was only typical of what had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rumania . I am certain that in any other country such a general exodus , bringing the serious consequences in its wake that this did , would have been stopped by the police . Was not the affair taking on the air of a national disaster ? But the government of Rumania was far from any thought of interference . it stood by idly while the procession kept moving on , apparently only too happy to be rid of an element of its population for which it had always entertained a quite frank antipathy . In fact , it did the reverse of stopping it . Ordinarily the getting of a passport had been a matter of very serious trouble and con ? siderable expense . But in this remark ? able year , t9oo , the bars were unac ? countably let down , and every person not of military age who made applica ? tion for a passport was cheerfully sped on his way by the officials and granted the document with the minimum of cost and almost no trouble at all . Along about the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the emigration movement had taken . It was to the effect that a band of young men in Berlad had formed themselves into an organization for the purpose of walking to America . I remember how incredulous we were when we first heard of it . In the first place , we had learned entirely too much about that romantic country during Couza 's visit to swallow any such absurd notion as that it could be reached by walking . And besides that , the report was brought to us by a woman whom rumor credited with neither too much truthfulness , nor complete sanity . We little thought that before many weeks we were to have a To-America-on-Foot Society in our own town . Yet that is precisely what happened . We had hardly had time to make up our minds as to whether there could be anything in the strange story from Berlad , when a number of the boys in our own set held a meeting and an ? nounced that they had formed a walking group right in Vaslui . I do not wish to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that I had the glory of being present at that meeting and becoming one of the charter mem ? bers of the organization . We assembled . about twenty-five of us in all , in Monish Bachman 's grain-shed just outside the town gate . The place was well chosen , for that shed had already become sacred in our hearts by many tender associa ? tions . It had been the scene of a long series of theatrical performances in which the present organizers had been both actors and audience . And although we were now practical men and quite done with childish things , our instincts must have guided us in selecting this sentimental spot for our adult activities . We ranged in age from fifteen to eight-teen , with the exception of young Frankel , the druggist 's son , who having spent a year at the university in Bu ? charest , was looked up to as a man of the world , and was , therefore , asked to give us the benefit of his parliamentary training . The meeting was a thunderous one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered as a very harmonious one , soon split up into a number of factions . There was the extreme left , which advocated secret procedure and the exclusion of parents from our councils . They were in favor of im ? mediate action , a nocturnal departure with French leave , and not a word , to our families until we had reached New York , when a telegram would suffice to inform them of what had happened . That plan had in its favor the element of romance . But it was , forthwith , howled down by the extreme right , the reactionaries , who laughed at the whole scheme and declared that if we could not travel Iike gentlemen we might as well abandon the idea of America en ? tirely . Finally the moderates won out . Led by the chairman himself , they argued that it would be wiser to take the townspeople into our secret , and gain the benefit of their advice and support . Before adjourning , we took up , at Frankel 's suggestion , the matter of per ? manent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with tyrannical powers over our bodies and souls . He was to preside at the meetings while we remained in Vaslui , and to act as the cap ? tain of the hand on the march . He could dismiss a member from the group for a capital offense , or punish him with reduced rations and solitary marching forty meters behind the column for minor misdemeanors . A number of us objected to making the captain into a king , pointing our the patent fact that he was called a president , and crying vehemently that this granting of whole ? sale privileges to a president was to ? tally out of harmony with the spirit of the great country to which we were going . Next we turned to the choosing of a treasurer , and experienced tremen ? dous difficulties in deciding what one of us could most safely be intrusted with our prospective common funds . Then the temporary chairman suggested that we ought to have a secretary , " just for the dignity of the organization , " even though we may find no duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked for the post of commissary-general , with powers to purchase supplies and apportion the rations ? always , of course , under orders from the president and captain . But , alas , the irony of fate and the cruelty of parents ! No sooner had we each retired to our own homes , and no sooner did we break the news to our several fathers , than we found good reason to repent of our failure to adopt the program of the leftists . The ingrate Monish Bachman , unmindful of the glory that had fallen upon his grain-shed , promptly deposed the powerful tyrant , who was his own son Yankel . Neither he nor my parent would hear of the " absurd " idea . Monish , having once been wealthy , and being still very proud and something of a power in the community , could see no reason why his son should undergo the hardship and the indignity of having to tramp to America . " If Yankel must go away , " he declared , with a flourish , " I am not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel as befits my position . " But Yankcl need not leave home at all , he insisted . The youngster was very useful to him in his business . In vain did the hoy object that he cared nothing about dignity and position , that he thought the railway- and steam ? boat were tiresome , uninteresting , grandfatherly modes of travel , un ? worthy of a boy . Monish had put his foot down . With me things went quite as badly , if not worse . My father was a cleverer man than Yankel 's , and therefore he had no difficulty in trumping up a whole chain of causes why he could not let me go . Number one : had I forgotten that no more than a week before , while I was bathing the horse down at the , swimming-hole , I had very narrowly escaped drowning , and a whipping afterward into the bargain ? With that exhibition of my incapacity still fresh in his memory , how could I expect him to trust me to take care of myself on such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two : I was the youngest in the family , and probably for that reason mother 's favorite child ? he was not talking about himself now . Paul was in the army at Hushi , and Harry was in business at Constantza . Was I cruel enough to go away and leave mother to die of longing ? Number three : The crops last fall had failed ; times were woefully hard ; there was not money enough in the house to fit me out for any kind of a journey , however inexpensive . All this array of logic I might have met , but before long father 's arguments were reinforced by mother 's pleadings . Had I forgotten Annie , my only sister , who had died but three years before , a Rower struck down in the midst of spring ? How could I think of aban ? doning father and mother in their sorrow and quit the precious soil where Annie lay buried ? Against the logic of bereavement , I saw , I had no hope of prevailing . Even though my reason did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in tears . In the mean time Vaslui generally showed a very different disposition toward the new emigration . In site of its deposed president and commissary-general , the group had managed to grow both in numbers and in public approval . It had been joined by several older men , so that the roster contained , by now , some forty-odd names . The organization held daily meetings ? no longer in the grain-shed , but in one of the town halls ? the prep ? arations for the journey were being rushed and enthusiasm ran very high , not only among the members themselves , but especially in the community . If the earlier emigration had aroused in ? terest , this new and strange develop ? ment had in it the picturesqueness and the heroic pathos which could not but appeal to the imagination and touch the heart . The majority of those who composed the reorganized group were preparing to walk to America out of real necessity , not for adventure . Vaslui gave them the homage and the sym ? pathy that a nation gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the community 's interest in the movement appeared right at the start . Before matters had proceeded very far a few prominent citizens of the town undertook to guide the destinies of the group in a more systematic fashion . They per ? petuated the old committee which had been chosen to welcome the man Couza , whose missionary zeal had started the whole migration . The purposes of this higher organization were at first purelydecorative . It made arrangements to give the group a suitable send-off on its departure , with flags and speeches and the like ; and it instituted prepa ? rations for the welcoming of such groups from other towns as might hap ? pen to pass through Vaslui on their way to New York . But once the com ? mittee had been formed it found a multitude of unforeseen avenues for its activity . It was discovered , in the first place , that such funds as had been gathered from the contributions of the members themselves were absurdly in ? adequate to the needs of the journey . Furthermore , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stop at hotels in the towns where the night might overtake them . The most serious problem of all arose over the question of how the young people were to be cared for in the foreign countries through which they must journey . Thus there came into being a whole succession of institutions which the original organizers of the walking move ? ment had not even dreamed of . The home committee of Vaslui was soon duplicated in every town where groups were forming , and before long these separate bodies became merged into a really formidable national committee , with branches in every corner of Ru- mania and activities that covered every possible need of the emigrants . And then the process of organization was carried to the last climactic step when the newly born national com ? mittee entered into correspondence and ultima*ely became affiliated with the great charitable alliances of Vienna , Berlin , Paris , and London . So that the marching group which had started out as an almost grotesque , childish fancy of merely local scope , had in a short time evolved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal capitals of Europe and even in New York itself . By far the most noteworthy by-prod ? uct of this amazing movement was the advent of the newspaper . Hitherto Vaslui had been content to get its news second-hand . Journalism was a thing unknown , not only in Vaslui , but in all the other cities of Rumania except Bucharest . There may have been news papers in Jassy , but I never heard of them . Even the Bucharest dailies were taken only by the coffee-houses of Vaslui , where they hung on racks clamped into their holders , and were glanced at sporadically by the mer ? chants who congregated there . But all this was now changed . In the last month or two Vaslui and Rumania generally had passed through a cycle of changes the like of which had taken , elsewhere , centuries to effect . The mere thought of New York had somehow in a moment of time raised us to the level of ' Western civilization . I have often heard it said since , in school and college , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of its history and invari ? ably reflect the popular soul . If this be true , I have myself been present at the birth of a little movement which may ? who can tell ? ? prove a real con ? tribution to the development of a gen ? uine national art . For these daily and weekly papers that arose so suddenly among us were no mere purveyors of the world 's daily scandal . They were essentially of the stuff of which litera ? ture is made , although I dare say they never found their way into books or libraries . They were filled with poems and passionate eloquence , words of cheer and hope , eulogies of the land of our aspirations , which for some reason or other was continually referred to as Jerusalem , encouragement to those who were left behind , and praise to the Almighty for delivering his people from the bondage of the modern Egypt ( Rumania ) . Nearly all the contents were the work of the members of the groups themselves . And for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in jour ? nalistic endeavor . They eagerly de ? voured every issue from the first word to the last . The ancient arts of music and oratory likewise came in for their share . We had never dreamed of the profusion of talent that lay fallow in our own midst . Moritz Cabana , the owner of the Hotel Regal , acquired a reputation overnight for impassioned public utterance which extended beyond Vaslui and even be ? yond the frontiers of Rumania . Allthe meetings of the group consisted in large part of songs , with Hebrew , Yiddish , and Rumanian words , whose airs were adaptations of ancient melo ? dies ? tender lullabies , melancholy yearnings for Zion , and solemn chants of the synagogue . Some had been bor ? rowed from the doinas of the shepherd , and others had filtered in , after many vicissitudes , from the cafis chantants of , Vienna . The martial airs were quite recognizable plagiarisms from the mili ? tary composers . But all of the com ? positions had been blazoned with the heroic spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times . In this immense burst of literary and artistic fire , the practical side of the undertaking was , I am afraid , some ? what neglected . I attended the major ? ity of the meetings , but I can not recall ever having seen a map at any of them . In fact , I am pretty certain that not even the captain of the expedition had the faintest glimmer of a notion about routes . It was the broad , magnificent idea of the thing that occupied all minds . No one seemed to be in the least interested in mere details . As far as I can now determine , there was not a member in the whole group who could tell just which way he was headed , except that the initial stop was to be Bei-lad ? some forty miles away ? and the ultimate destination , New York . It was never made clear in the speeches or the newspapers how the Atlantic was to be inveigled into suffering the font-voyagers to bridge its chasm . Only once had there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea and the rising of its waters like a wall , but as that came out in a poem it was not remarked . It was early in May that this first group , having completed its prepara ? tions , set out on its strange adventure . The day , was a clear and balmy one . The marchers assembled at the gate of the little circular park in the center of the town , and from the earliest hour of the morning vast throngs of people came out to greet them . Promptly at ten o'clock the bugle sounded and the rocession began . It was headed by Moritz Cahana , the orator of the occa sion , and some other members of the committee in a droshka . Then followed the group in double file , clad in brown khaki , military leggings , and broad-brimmed canvas hats , each with an army knapsack on his back and a water - bottle slung jauntily over his shoulder . Last in order came well-nigh all that remained of the community of Vaslui . We marched and sang th rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a by-road that led to the southern gate of the town . There we halted , and Moritz Cabana made a speech that caused the whole throng to cheer and brought a lump into my throat and the tears into my eyes . Finally came the long last farewells , with tears and sobs from other people besides myself . The bugle sounded again , the captain gave the command , and the column was off on its way . I had given my word that I would not again ask to go with that group , and I had kept it , in spite of the fact that Monish Bachman had withdrawn his objections and allowed my friend Yankel to go . But when , several days later , the papers began to publish ex ? citing accounts of the progress of the group I quite frankly began to be sorry for having been so good . It made me desperate to think that here I was condemned to inactivity , my hopes and my ambitions turning sour within me , while the boys who had been my friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daily drawing nearer to that magic city of promise , New York . They had , according to a letter to me from Yankel , reached Berlad ; the whole town had turned out to welcome them , had fought for the privilege of entertaining them at their homes , and had banqueted them for three days as if they had been princes . From Berlad they had gone on to Tecuci , where their recep ? tion had been even more lavish than in Berlad . Can you wonder , after this glowing report , that I was getting rest ? less and repenting of my good behavior ? Therefore , when , toward the middle of June , the second Vaslui group was organized , I returned to my attack on father . I threatened to run away and join the group at the next town . I re ? minded my parent of his ambitions for me , and asked him , after all the rebuffs his efforts had met , whether he could still hope to make anything of me in Vaslui . I painted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absence of every variety of opportunity , thediscriminations of the government against us . I emphasized particularly , knowing my audience as I did , the dreadful horror of the recruiting officer , who was constantly lurking in our path like a serpent , ready to spring upon a young man , just when he had reached the stage where he could be useful to himself and of help to his family . There was my brother Paul , a case in point . He had struggled for years ? ever since he had been twelve ? to learn a trade ; had served a three-year apprenticeship for his mere bed and board ; had then toiled like a slave first for fifty , then for a hundred francs a year . And when at last he had become master of his calling and was about to become inde ? pendent , along came the scarlet monster and packed him off to its musty bar ? racks , to be fed on black bread and cabbage , to learn senseless tricks with his feet and a gun , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were a criminal , to be slapped in the face like a bad boy , and to him in constant terror of war and the manouver for the rest of his life . " If this is the sort of future you want for me , " I concluded dra ? matically , " you are right in trying ' to keep me here . " It was cruel , this relentless logic of facts . Mother began to weep quietly , and father bit his lip And turned to look out of the window . But with the single-eyed selfishness of youth I looked only to the advancement of my own cause . I perceived that my speech had had its effect . So I followed up the argument ? ment with a brilliant sketch of the great things that were awaiting me in New York . Had they forgotten the wonder ? ful man from New York who had recently visited us ? Had they for-his his jewels , his clothes , his trunks . his fine , impressive appearance , his cul ? tured manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her men . For our visitor , by his own confession , was not the only one who had been so marvelously trans ? formed in that great country . Every ? body who went there became a million ? aire overnight , and a doctor or a teacher into the bargain . There , in America , was my future as well as theirs . For it would take me only a few weeks to make enough money to send for the whole family . So at last I conquered . But my victory turned out to be only a partial one . In fact , by the time it was finally won the best part of the glory had been extracted from it . Although father and mother were both com ? pletely won over , the chief difficulty still remained to be overcome . When father had previously told me that there was not money enough in the house to fit me out for the journey he had touched on a real obstacle , as I now learned . The costume alone would . cost about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have a few francs in cash . I suggested selling the cow , and father consented . But by the time that could be accomplished the second group had left Vaslui , and me in ? it , a thoroughly broken and disappointed boy . Meantime mother set about with a heavy heart to prepare for the great day which I looked forward to so im ? patiently and which she so horribly dreaded . For the next four weeks she knitted socks , and made me underwear of flannelette , and sewed buttons , and mended my shirts and my old overcoat . She filled several jars with jam for me and one or two with some of her far-famed pickles . In the evening when we were alone together she would make me sit on her footstool , and while her deft fingers manipulated the knitting-needles she would gaze into my eyes as if she tried to absorb enough of me to last her for the coming months of absence . " You will write us , dear ? " she kept asking continually . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord blesses you with riches . You wo n't , will you ? Promise me again my son . And if 1 should die when you are gone , you will remember me in your prayers , oh , my kadish , my male child . " Once or twice she gave way to passionate sobs : " I have borneyou , my boy , and brought you into the world in pain , and I have nurtured you , and prayed over your cradle in the night , oh , my joy and my solace . " At such times I tried to comfort her by pmmises of daily letters , by calling her silly for imagining dreadful things , and by assuring her again and again that it was only a matter of a little time before we should be once more reunited . Throughout those days of prepara ? tion father was silent with that preg ? nant silence which he always maintained when his heart was breaking . Only on the day before my departure he betrayed himself . He had apparently been wor ? rying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had come dangerously near drowning , and he had resolved that he would impress me with the seriousness of it so that I should never again imperil my life . On that memorable Saturday night , therefore , after the beautiful home service with its candles and songs was over , he took me around to the house of the rabbi and made me take part in a scene which still lingers in my memory as one of the most solemn experiences of my life . Even at the time I remember comparing it with that impressive incident in the Bible when Jacob calls his son Joseph to his death-bed . As we entered the rabbi arose and shook hands with me . Then , still holding my hand in one of his , he placed his other hand on my head and pronounced a blessing in Hebrew . When he had finished that he asked me to promise him by the love I bore my father and mother that I would never again bathe in open water . " That was an omen from above , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you must not tempt him again . Promise me that you will nor . 13e a good son of Israel . ' Then he bade me a cheerful good-by and a successful journey . At last my preparations were com ? pleted and the last and greatest ob ? stacle to my migration had to be faced . By this time the second Vaslui group was approaching the city of Galatz on the Danube , which is about two hun- dred miles from Vaslui . Father was using his influence as a member of the committee to get me admitted into the group at that point . But the leaders of the organization would not hear of it . To begin with , they argued , it was against the constitution and the by ? laws , and , besides , it would set a bad precedent , Why should any one care to walk at all and endure all the hard ? ships after this , if he could come in at the last moment and reap all the ad ? vantages ? They had wandered about over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by brigands , and had exposed themselves to sickness and every variety of danger . And now , just as their difficult journey was draw ? ing to an end , a member of the com ? mittee was trying to foist a raw recruit upon them . But father was deter ? mined , and after endless dickerings and pleadings and debatings he won his point . It had developed , you see , that the walking was not to he continued all the way to New York , after all . The home committee ? the general staff , as it had come , appropriately enough , to be called ? had apparently decided that at the outset . But the captains and the other leaders of the groups them ? selves had found the tramping too jolly ? in spite of their occasional com ? plaints to the contrary ? and threat ? ened to rebel . Not until they were convinced that without the support of the committee they could not march a step , would they listen to reason . So they agreed to walk only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River steamer for Vienna . Once out of Rumania , they would be out of the jurisdiction of the national committee and would be taken charge of by the Judische Allianz zu Wien . From Vienna they would journey by rail through ? Germany as far as Rotterdam , at the expense and under the guidance of the Verband der Deutscher Juden and the Alliance Israelite , and from Rotterdam they would sail for New York . That was the route that the group , and I along with them , actually followed . It was nor until Sunday morning that I knew whether I was going or not . As soon as the good word reached me I proceeded to put the finishing touches to my packing and to attend to the inevitable farewells . All that day I went around shaking hands with what was left of the community ? most ofthem people I had never spoken to before ? and every one asked me to de ? liver his regards to some relative in New York , and to urge him to send a steamer ticket to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening mother and I walked up and down in the front yard , my hand in hers , talking of the past and the future , and carefully avoiding any reference to the present . Just before train-time she ' put the gold-clasped prayer-book into my grip which father had given her on their betrothal , and sewed two gold napoleons into the lining of my waistcoat . ' She seemed calm and resigned . But when the train drew into the station she lost control of her feelings . As she embraced me for the last time her sobs became violent and father had to separate us . There was a despair in her way of clinging to me which I could not then understand . I understand it now . I never saw her again . For several hours I sat stark and stiff on a wooden bench in my railway car ? riage , unaware of the other passengers , mechanically guarding with one hand the fortune in my waistcoat , as father had repeatedly urged me to do . I did not even try to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother going home from the station , and kept vaguely wondering whether America , with all her prizes , could be worth that . Toward morning my mind cleared and I could see things a little more in their true relations . As the train approached Galatz I looked out and beheld the wide expanscof the Danube with the rosy hues of dawn reflected on its placid surface . There were ships along the wharves , both on the Rumanian and on the Bul ? garian side . My heart leaped up at the beautiful sight . I had never seen a real ship before , Here was the gate of the great world opening up before me , with its long open roads radiating in all directions . It was but an earnest of the nobler destiny ahead of me . In a very Few days I should be out of Rumania . And then in two weeks more New York would no longer be a vision , but an inspiring reality . I could no longer doubt that my sacrifice was worth while . And I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
