txt Senator JOHNSON declared in the Senate on Monday that the League of Nations was a trust . He has forgotten President ROOSEVELT 'S memorable division of trusts into good and bad trusts . The American Sunday School Union is as much a trust as the League of Nations . So , for that matter , is the United States of America . Calling's. thing a trust nowadays does not evoke the sensation of loathing and the shrinking which some fee/ when they see a snake . But he also supposes it to be a war I trust ; inasmuch as it.does not provide ' I for the calling of a referendum whenever our country is attacked by a foreign Power . If , for instance , that country which keeps him awake nights , Japan , were to seize Hawaii and land a few divisions in Washington State and California , Senator JOHNSON would have the people of the United States hold a referendum on the question of whether we should send any troops to resist their penetration . ' At least so we infer from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent west of the Rockies to defend California until the last return was in from Eastport , Me . No wonder California loves Senator JOHNSON . To Senator JOHNSON 'S eyes Belgium must be the most villainously autocratic of nations . When German troops crossed Belgian soil the Belgians held no referendum  --  not a fraction of a referendum , not a single , solitary plebiscite in the remotest Belgian village . They simply declared , in the words of the Chinese schoolboy , " Belgium is a country , not a road , " and , as Cardinal MERCIER put it the other day , they fired the first and last shots of the war . So Serbia . When the Austrian artillery began to bombard Belgrade they did not even hold a town meeting , much less a referendum . They turned in and drove the Austrians off the Serbian side of the Danube , and kept on doing it until the Austrians got the assistance of Germany , Bulgaria . and Turkey . These Serbs are an antique lot , on whom the sun of new thought has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , and so will the League of Nations . The Holy Alliance was formed to insure the untroubled reign of despotism , of autocracy . It wanted to insure peace , it is true , but the peace of Warsaw , the peace of autocracy regnant . Now , to a man who is picking at the coverlid and to whom nurses are administering daily doses to make him sleep , it may appear reasonable that when a bund of Emperors fails to insure the domination of autocracy it is a sure sign that a league of all the world 's nations will therefore fail to insure a democratic peace . It will not occur , however , to the passerby outside the hospital . So , . too , with the reservation concerning the Monroe Doctrine . " It " could not have been written with " any other purpose than the destruc " tion of ithe Monroe Doctrine . " On the contrary , it might have been written with another purpose . It might have been written by an American with the purpose of obtaining from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years they have refused  --  the recognition of the Monroe Doctrine . It recognizes the Monroe Doctrine as a " regional understanding , " and upholds it . That is a good deal more than any President , from MONROE to TArr , has been able to extort from the nations in the way of recognition . The danger , in Senator JOHNSON 'S mind , seems to lie in the words " regional understanding . " What does it matter what they call it so long as they recognize it ?
