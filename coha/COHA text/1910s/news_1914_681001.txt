J. , the trains were so late that an adjournment of a. case in the Federal Court had to be taken because of the inability of a juror to reach New York .

At Paterson yesterday morning from 6:30 until after 10 o'clock there was a crowd of from four to five thousand men and women clamoring for transportation to New York and Newark . but not a train went through except a couple of trains which lumbered slowly by the depot in Paterson , but no one could get aboard . Some waited for hours at the Market Street Station for some way of getting into the cities for work . Others gave it up and went home . The first through train to get to the Erie station yesterday morning was the express from Cleveland and Buffalo , which was due at 8:15 A. M. , and arrived at 10 o'clock . Five minutes later the express from Chicago . which was caie at 7:22 A. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local train arrived over the main line .

The hundreds In the station made a rush for it , but the station master and gatehands refused to let them get on the train . The conductor of the trails , although not supposed to take local passengers , was willing to open his parlor and other cars and take the crowd . The station hands were obdurate , and refused to listen to the conductor . The crowd finally stormed the gates . Then the conductor had his way , and the crowd was let out to the train . Delays on Lackawanna . On the Lackawanna Railroad the offi-cials had to contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with for a long time . All trains east and west bound were from forty-five minutes to an hour and a half late . East-bound trains were an hour and a half behind schedule time .

The greatest trouble experienced by the postal service , he said , was in moving the mails within the city owing to the automobile mail trucks being unable to run rapidly through the snow . The pneumatic tubes running from the central Post Office to the branches are ' bein. ? used as far as possible . In Brooklyn the postal problem proved to be more serious , and in that borough it was found necessary to cut down the regular mail deliveries one-third and to cut in half the parcel post deliveries . The Fire Department was kept busy all of Friday night , the department answering sixty-six calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The snow drifts made the going hard for the fire horses , while the big motor trucks proceeded at less than one-third full speed because of the condition of the streets . So fast did the alarms come in and so much better did the horse-drawn apparatus prove in the emergency that early yesterday morning Fire Commissioner Adamson hired seventy-six extra animals to help draw the engines and trucks in the boroughs . Fire in the seven-story building at 245 to 253 West Twelfth Street , occupied by the Twelfth Street Garage Company , and close to St. Vincent 's Hospital , started at 6:20 o'clock yesterday morning , when the gasoline tank of an auto truck stored on the ground floor exploded . Two alarms were sent in , and the firemen had a hard time both in getting to the building through the snow-filled streets and in conquering the blaze , that at first threatened to sweep the structure . However , hard work on the part of the firemen resulted in confining the fire to the ground floor . Thirty-five automobiles were either destroyed or damaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm , as the snow muffled the approach of the fire apparatus and those who were awake
