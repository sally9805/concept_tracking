txt GREAT MEN ARE TOO FEW The principal reason why you oppose the suffrage movement is that woman , being superior to man , will lose that superiority as soon as she goes into politics , and the world will be worse off than ever . There is certainly a possibility in your reasoning , but for myself . have a lot of faith in woman . There might be some doubt about it if the proportion of bad and good women were the same as with men , but according to what I have seen of the world I am Justified to say that there are more good women than bad . There ' fore , I think that the sooner women 's majority of superiority influences the vote the hatter for all , and instead of having such a spare crop of great men it will grow more plentiful . A MAN WHO OWES TO WOMAN ALL THE GOOD AND TO MAN ALL THE BAD THAT 'S IN HIM .
