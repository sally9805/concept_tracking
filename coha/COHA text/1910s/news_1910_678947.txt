txt In an " impassioned " speech Senator Cummms implored the Senate to be " faithful to the people " and not relieve the railways from the restraints of the Sherman anti-trust law by allowing them to make agreements regarding rates . Our people are attached devotedly to the anti-trust law , and they believe that in the years that are gone it protected them against the oppression or greed and avarice and power best represented in the railway companies or the United States . The country 's condition calls for more reason and less passion in the treatment of topics which have been treated in just tha other way . The anti-trust law was passed in a temper like the Senator 's , and with equally slight consideration of the adaptation of the remedy to the disease . The antitrust law was enacted as a. remedy for depression , and it is now appealed to . as a protection of the people against excessive prosperity . If the Senator had not been so stirred by his emotions he would not have insisted that the farmers of Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' products are conspicuously dear among commodities generally high . Railway rates are disproportionately low , and are about the only goods or services procurable absolutely for less than in the depression when the anti-trust law was passed . If that beneficent statute is to be enforced universally the farmers would and should suffer more than the railways . The Democrats used to be considered the Bourbons of the United States . Current events are showing the Republicans to he more deserving of the palm for neither learning nor forgetting . The tariff they have just enacted shows that they have learned nothing about the tariff since MCKINLEY died , leaving as his legacy the declaration that the period of exclusiveness was past , and that the Americans needed to allow themselves access to the world 's trade . The revival of the antitrust sentiment shows that they have learned nothing about the trusts since Speaker REED died. , bequeathing a sarcasm about the absurdity of any monopoly existing under modern conditions , unless sheltered by a patent . The selection of the railways as being even wickeder than the trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in the face of such statements as this : It was further advantageous to Western farmers , although manifestly unfair to the railroads , that the transportation rates for grain and other products actually declined instead of advancing with the advances of prices in general during the paper money regime . After a generation here we are back at the beginning again with a proposal to invite a revival of prosperity with an attack upon the railways . Senators Cu-srmixs and ELIctNs had an amusing colloquy as to whether or not they were Republicans . There can be no doubt that this is Republicanism . Mr. BRYAN tells the country that it wants more Bryanism , and the Republicans tell it that it wants more Republicanism ? meaning , we are told specifically , a high and higher tariff , persecution of the railways , and prosecution of everybody . Mr. WICKERSHAM tells Republicans ? that they can not run with the hares and hunt with the hounds , but he himself goes into court to prosecute a trust which enjoys a commercial character judicially certified of a sort any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statute whose meaning , as construed by the Judges , he disavows . The people are taking note of these things . They remark that the corporations are told that the Administration will not run amuck , and that the tariff privileges are renewed in their favor , . and that meanwhile capital and labor have been prosperous as never before during the period when a statute whose teeth it is proposed to sharpen was allowed to slumber . It is time for the people to have an opinion of their own , and not accept ready-made partisan opinions which do not agree with facts known to all . Is the anti-trust law as popular as Senator CUMMINS assets ? Is the Administration doing a popular thing in enforcing it not only against the trusts but against all those multifarious commercial bargains upon which all trade is based and its stability depends ? If so , where is there to be an end short of " the Constitutional prohibition against impairment of contracts ? Mr. WzcxERSFLAM 'S speech the other day , and especially his official acts since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It Is no longer a question of the prosecution of billiondollar concerns alone . The contracts in restraint of trade now in hand are those in the butter , and , egg , and cotton trades . They are such offenses as always Were punishable by a jury , but only if a crime could be alleged and proved . These same offenses are now to be set up under a statute from which there is no exception , no justification by the finding of twelve neighbors in trade that the acts are in accord with commercial morality . The Republican Party wants to go to the people on this policy and a higher tariff . As a promotive of prosperity it is something like euthanasia , not with a syringe of sleep , but with a club . Small wonder that only one name can save the Republicans , and that only by a reversal ' of policy when in power . There are signs that the people are a bit tired of raids on the corporations for politics ' sake .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
