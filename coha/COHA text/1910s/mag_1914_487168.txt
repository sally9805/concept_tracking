Second Characters , or the Language of Forms . By the Right Honourable Anthony , Earl of Shaftesbury . Edited by Benjamin Rand . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $2 50 net . We are not often permitted a glimpse into the workshop of a great writer , and when this- writer has been dead two hundred years , the experience is tinged with romance . The third Earl of Shaftesbury , philosopher and author of " Characteristics , " died in Naples in 1713 , and in 1913 Dr. Benjamin Rand , head of the Robbins Philosophical Library of Harvard University , discovered among the papers in the Record Office in London Shaftesbury 's " Second Characteristics , " and published them at the University Press , Cambridge . The book consists of - four treatises , of which the first two , " A Letter Concerning Design " and " A Notion of the Historical Draught of Hercules , " had been previously printed . The third , or rather a translation of a Greek passage on which it was to be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishedfor the first time . In addition Dr. Rand prints all the notes , directions for the title-page and the illustrations , a preface , and an " Idea of the Work , " in which Shaftesbury laid down definite rules for his own guidance . The " Idea " might be called a " Rhetoric or Composition Book " such as is studied in our colleges to-day . A right rule , viz : To begin each Part with a deeper breath , . distinguishable from the subaltern sallies or excursions in the mere sections into which the Main parts are divided ( page 5 ) A rule , viz : Nothing in the text but what shall be of easy , smooth , and polite reading , without seeming difficulty , or hard study ; so that the better and gentler rank of painters and artists , the ladies , beaux , courtly gentlemen , and more refined sort of country and town wits , and notable talkers may comprehend , or be persuaded that they comprehend , what is there written in the text . On the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and urges the substitution of the " fashionable one , from the French o-n " On page 10 he suggests that the first chapter of a serious book should contain thoughts which the reader with little study may discover , and applaud himself for it , believing the rest easy So that it is in the next following chapters that the maxims , or deep precepts , theorems , etc , may be couched , and so delivered , that what surpasses the ignorant reader may pass him by , without reproaching him his defect , or frightening him with the supposed profoundness of the sense or reading The copious notes and appendices of the MS , all of which are given in Dr. Rand 's edition , were not intended by Shaftesbury to be printed in their entirety ; for they , too , contain frequent hints either for himself or for whosoever should give the final polish to his first draught of " Plastics . " Shaftesbury was the first English writer on the great problems of art , and found an insufficient vocabulary at his disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because their meanings were clear ; others he used tentatively and only in certain connections which he hoped would explain them . Very interesting is his desire to substitute ( p. 180 ) virtual for virtuous , " which last can not be used for the energetic in the good sense . " One of his new words has again disappeared from the English language without there having been found a substitute , except the cumbersome " easel-picture . " Shaftesbury called such pictures tablatures , to distinguish them from pictures painted in the places where they were to be seen  --  walls , ceilings , doors , and the like . Other notes are full of reminders to look up references , to search for appropriate quotations , or to make sure that a given statement is correct . All in all , there is probably no other book which reveals one of the great literary men of two hundred years ago so intimately at work as Dr. Rand 's edition of the " Second Characters " This fact alone would make the book valuable , but it sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of art . Written at a time when the state of art in the world , judged by its output of visible art , was low , the maxims laid doWn by Shaftesbury are as valid to-day as they ever were , and will be recognized by our greatest writers and painters as true and singularly well expressed . Generally Shaftesbury had the unfortunate habit of polishing his sentences to their utmost before sending his mann- , scripts to the printer . In these " Plastics , " however , he did not advance beyond the first draught , and this enables us " to catch him , " as Edmund Gosse says , " before the magnificent and slightly fatuous toilet is completed , before his nouns have found their verbs , and while his epithets are still competing for selection . " This makes the " Plastics " not always easy reading , but it conveys the flatus ( lei , and makes Shaftesbury 's enthusiasm for true art almost catching . His general theory was that good art is as natural an expression of man as political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no freedom , no enjoyment of freedom , there can be no art , because you can not express yourself naturally under unnatural conditions . Art , moreover , is not finite , for it always means and conveys more than it reveals . Nor are the principles of art unrelated to those of ethics . This , " however , he wisely refrained from stating in so many words in the " Plastics , " for it would have offended many readers . But in his " Idea " ( p. 6 ) he says : Remember still , this the idea of the work , viz. : Quasi . The vehicle of other problems , i. e. , the precepts , demonstrations , etc , of real ethics . But this hid : not to be said except Earkly or pleasantly , with raillery upon self , or some such indirect way . . ? Starting out with the observation that " all men mantic , else no speech , no manners , " and that nothing is " more pleasant to human nature from the beginning than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of principles of art : The didactive or preceptive way being unartificial , un-masterly , and un-poetic : not Homerical , though Virgihan . . . . This the province of the philosopher , the rhetorician , the historian : not the bard , the mites , the enthusiast ( page 97 ) . The finer and more delicate imitation is the more tender , and by nicest . . . touches in poetry as in painting , and not by exaggeration , amplification , straining , tightening , overcharging . . . So a sordid painter first chooses a mean blemish and not a true one in manners . . . . On which very thing depends the difference between Horace and Juvenal ( page 100 ) Bad figures : bad minds . Crooked designs : crooked fancies . No designs , no thought No imitation : no poetry ( page 105 ) . Thus the species of horses and other animals , the kind being once seen . . . the idea of beauty and perfection is raised , and when reduced to this idea of instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of every spectator ( page 108 ) . Unfortunately , the good eye , i. e. , the good taste in art , is subject to a number of corrupting influences , of which Shaftesbury mentions four in particular : ( 1 ) bad art frequently seen ; ( 2 ) haste and hurry of living ; ( 3 ) vice and corruption ; and ( 4 ) the " want of nudidity , " the lack of " opportunity of viewing forms of the finer sort ( not professional models ) in nudity , and in easy , familiar , as well as strenuous exercising action . " " The great business , " however , " in this as in the whole of life is to correct our taste , " and " the artificial , witty , far-fetched , refined , hypercritical taste is the worst in the world " ( p. 115 ) , because it is the result of conceit and ignorance . Ignorance , in fact , Shaftesbury believed was the cause of the low state of art in his time : Modern masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pencil , and then too late . Illiberal . Dis-ingeneous Sharks , rakes What ideas , when thus vulgar ! Not even so high as what we call good breeding and manners in a common sense ! . . . Yet these give the clue and lead the great , who are cheated as well as misled by these mechanic knaves ! ( page 129 ) . Such men were , of course , unable to come up to the standard of true art , where " all is invention ( the first part of painting ) , creation , divining , a sort of prophesying and inspiration , the poetical ecstatic and rapture Things that were never seen , yet feigned Painter as poet , a second maker . " Shaftesbury wisely guarded himself against the attacks which mere painters always make against those who defend the divine side of art , viz. , " that they know nothing of the technical side of painting , " by including in his work several chapters on this subject . We know from his letters that he had frequent interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life engaged in writing " The Second Characters , " and that one artist lived in hishouse . These chapters may , therefore , be regarded as expressing the ideas and practices of the painters two hundred years ago . We learn there that they used practically the identical colors which are used to-day with the one exception of vermillion ; and that even our most advanced modern painters still follow the mechanical processes of mixing their pigments that were practiced then . If there are few statements by Shaftesbury of the principles of art with which the student of to-day would be willing to quarrel , his estimate of individual pictures and artists is often open to criticism . He was a great admirer of Raphael , Michelangelo , Titian , and Poussin , but also of Domenichino , whose picture of St. Jerome he calls the best in the world . Rubens and the Dutch and Flemish genre painters , especially those of peasant life , he abhorred , and while he had a kind word for Closterman , he said that Van Dyck was " fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and false in his composition , collocation , etc . " Rembrandt , Franz Hals , Holbein , Velasquez , and many important Italians are not even mentioned . This may seem strange at first , but it becomes natural when one reflects that Shaftesbury-was far more interested in the abstract principles of art than in actual pictures . He passed through Paris , the Lombardy , Florence , and Rome on his way to Naples , and being a very sick man , could not visit any museums or galleries . In his many letters from Naples ( miblished by Dr. Rand in 1900 ) there is not one word of regret at having been unable to do so , while there are expressions of regret at not having been able to call on this man or that man in the cities through which he had passed . Great praise is due to the University Press for the beautiful garb in which " The Second Characters " has been issued . As frontispiece is printed an engraving after Closter-man 's portrait of the Earl of Shaftesbury . The painting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the several paintings which the painter Fran de Gruter removed to Amsterdam in 1711 after the death of Closterman . These paintings were later attached by a court order , according to recently discovered records ( see ThiemeBecker , Kimstler-Lexicon , VII , p. 116 ) . Dr. Rand 's Introduction is a masterpiece of concise presentation of facts needed for an intelligent enjoyment of the book . His skilful editorship is everywhere apparent . There are copious cross references , an " Index of Ease , " and bracketed translations of all Latin and Greek quotations . The translations serve their purpose , but at times miss their point . " Docti rationem artis intellegunt , indocti voluptatem , " which means that the learned enjoy the principles of art , and the unlearned the beauty of the work of art , is translated . " The learned understand the art of composition , the unlearned enjoy pleasure from it . " When Dr Rand has done so much it may be ungracious to ask for more , but the wish is a natural one that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they should be rewritten for publication , to rearrange the several chapters , and to " translate " into present-day English some of the more difficult passages . If he should do this , the book would be one of the most valuable , instructive , and enjoyable treatises on art , and one which might help people to reach a juster appreciation of true art than they seem to possess at present . Emma Louise Parry 's " The Two Great Art Epochs " ( McClurg ; $2 net ) is the kind of equable compilation that seems to be in steady demand among schools and clubs . The drawbacks of the type are- exemplified in inaccuracies in the accounts of Duccio , Masolino , and Perugino , in the choice of the worst Discobolus , that of the Vatican . for illustration , in the omission of the Hagias under Lysippus Giorgione 's name was not Barbarelli On page 228 are three blunders in six lines . Such infelicities will occur so long as specialists are unable or unwilling to write our popular manuals , and publishers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The present volume is clearly written , fully illustrated , and by no means bad of its sort . Finance END-OF-THE-YEAR MARKETS . As the year draws to a close , and the fifth consecutive month of the European war is nearly ended , the American financial markets are moving in a suggestive and interesting way . The stock market , after its vigorous advance on the reopening of the Exchange , and after the rather speedy downward reaction , has fallen into a state of uncertainty . Confronted on the one hand by an undoubtedly strong demand from American investors , and on the other by the continued doubt as to whether foreign investors would not sell on any inviting rise in prices , the market seemed to have become in a sense between comparatively narrow limits of prices . Even last Fri-clay 's decision of the rate case , in favor of the railways , gave only a temporary stimulus to the rise . This may have meant that financial judgment as to intrinsic values has not yet been determined  --  especially as prices still hold well above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doors . But in. other branches of the financial marli-ets , judgment has been more emphatically pronounced . Money rates , to begin with , have returned to by far the lowest level since the war began  --  in fact , to what even in ordinary times would be called " easy money . " Official rediscount rates at the Federal Reserve Banks have been reduced ' fully 2 per cent . - Yet , in spite of this absence of anything ' like a bid for European capital , international exchange has moved decisively in. this ? ountry 's favor . Exchange on London , - which in August and September held so long at rates exorbitantly high , has this week declined to the lowest level since last February ; a level not far distant from the normal gold-import point . This notable movement is ascribed , first to the large remittances of gold already made by us to Europe , but also , and perhaps chiefly , to the expanding export movement . Even in October the country 's excess of exports fell $81,600,000 under 1913 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Europe 's purchases of materials very large , with grain still going out on an unprecedented scale , and with cotton exports last week matching those of a year ago ( whereas in August they were barely 10 per cent . of 1913 ) , the influence of our outward trade in merchandise is undoubtedly much more positive . Not least in importance among the movements on the markets has been the rise in wheat , this week , to a price higher than was reached even in the excited " war speculation " of September . This rise is partly recognition of the continued and very heavy European buying . But it is also based on some new calculations for the immediate future . Last Thursday the Government gave out its estimate on condition and acreage of our newly planted winter wheat crop . The figures brought both reassurance and disappointment . The crop 's condition is the lowest of any December since 19119 per cent . under last December , and nearly 3 per cent . below the ten-year average . Yet , ? on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than a year ago , and 203/a Per cent . above any previous planting . There are statisticians here who figure that the higher acreage so far offsets the lower condition as to indicate a yield of 689,000,000 bushels , as against 690,000,000 this past season . But " December forecasts " are a notoriously dangerous reliance , and the fall in the crop 's condition percentage in . Kansas to 80 , as against 100 last December , inspires some caution . As a general.rule , the grain trade is inclined to regard the outlook for the next winter wheat crop as decidedly poorer than a year ago . Even if our own crop were to fulfil the tentative estimate just cited , it does not seem possible for the world 's wheat crop of 1915 to equal that of 1914 ? though this year 's total , despite the huge American harvest , fell 386,000,000 bushels short of 1913 . The new acreage in France , Germany , Austria-Hungary , Belgium , and the Balkan States , also in Holland and parts of Russia , is almost sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafting of able-bodied farm workmen into the various armies , and , in the case of France , Belgium , and Poland , as a result of continuous warfare on the very ground where the new crop would normally be planted The Balkan States in 1913 , despite continuance of their savage war well into the crop season , produced unexpectedly large harvests ; yet the decrease from the previous year in the yield of Bulgaria , Servia , and Greece was something like 20 per cent. , while neighboring countries which were not at war showed little change . On the basis of final estimates on the great wheat yield of 1914 , there is likely to be only 82,000,000 bushels left from our own crop for the balance of the season  --  which is a very small reserve . Australia 's crop is short ; she will have to import about 8,000,000 bushels , against exports of 68,000,000 last season . Canada will be cleaned out of wheat , in all probability , at the end of this present season . So that this is the interesting situation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wheat crop of 1915 were to turn out one of only moderate dimensions , the world might'have to pass through a season of excessively high prices for grain And even if our harvest  --  after a December condition estimate which is , after all , far better than that which preceded the then very large wheat yield of 1912 ? should once - more be abundant , we should in all probability repeat the remarkable achievements of this year 's American grain trade . For Europe will certainly need all the wheat that the United States will have to spare .
