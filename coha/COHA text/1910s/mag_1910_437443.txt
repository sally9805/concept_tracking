WAS it indeed for such momentous results as this that the country was bombarded by presidential messages ; that the utmost activities of the press , for and against legislation , were called into action for months ; and that almost unlimited oratory stands spread forth upon the pages of the Congressional Record ? Was all this expenditure of political energy in the enactment of the Hepburn Act of 1906 worth while , in order that a peach-canner in Martins-dale , Georgia , should receive reparation of $8.91 on about three carloads of his wares ? Was a mountain in travail to bring forth such a mouse as this ? Perhaps not , for this man alone ; but the significant fact is that , within two years , about nine thousand of his fellows appealed to the Federal government for an adjustment of their transportation difficulties , great and small . The overwhelming majority of these complaints were settled informally out of court , and in this work of reconciliation one of the most conspicuous and beneficial functions of the new Commission appears . But an increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decision of record . Some indication of the public relief sought is afforded by the fact that within approximately the first two years and a half , up to August 28 , 1908 , 1053 cases on the formal docket were disposed of , leaving over five hundred 914 issues still undecided . As compared with this total of over fifteen hundred formal complaints under the new law , the number filed under the old law amounted to only 878 throughout the long period of eighteen years . Moreover , the number of complaints filed seems to be steadily , increasing . During the first year from September 1 , 1906 , only 387 cases were filed ; the next year the number rose to 448 ; and in the last twelvemonth , to August 28 , 1909 , it amounted to 1083 . Surely it can not be averred that the public has failed to respond to the new law . These activities of the government 's agents , it is almost needless to mention , afford no true measure of the benefits resulting from the law . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be preventive , not punitive . The number of arrests by the police affords no indication of the effectiveness of a criminal statute . Not the violations of law , but the breaches forestalled , are of real significance . And similarly in this instance , one surely finds the primary benefit of legislation , not in the complaints preferred , but in the fact that , under the improved relationship between the principals concerned , many long-standing causes of irritation and misunderstanding are being removed . The real gain , not to be measured by figures , is to be found in the improved spirit of the inter- // course now prevalent between railway officials and their customers . The shipper ? especially if he be a small one ? having business to transact may now be sure of courieotts treatment and a prompt and probably just outcome . In the old days he was too often made to feel his utter economic dependence . As a high traffic official recently put it to me , " One reason we do not like this law is because we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must be ready to explain and show a warrant for every act . An attack of indigestion can not any longer serve as an excuse for an arbitrary , off-hand ruling . " This improved spirit has permeated the whole staff of railway officials , from the officious baggage-smasher , who made one feel that it was a favor to have one 's chattels demolished , to the vice-president in charge of traffic , who has seen a new light on the public aspect of his calling . For a year or more after the law first went into effect , the railroad managers on their part seemed submissive and in a chastened mood . The Commission also exercised its new powers rather timidly . But a change seems to have supervened of late on both sides . So far as the railroads are concerned , the political atmosphere has certainly cleared . Popular hostilityagainst them has considerably abated . " The best tariff we ever had " moves toward the middle of the stage . A change of administration has ensued , with a marked increase in the professionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of important cases before the Federal courts , which once appeared threatening , have been decided in favor of the carriers . Thus the " commodities clause , " forbidding railroads to operate coal-mines and similar enterprises , has been pretty effectually emasculated by the Supreme Court . For while with one hand it upheld the consti tutionality of the law , with the other it pointed the broad and easy way to evade it . The late Mr. Harriman , before the same tribunal , was excused from revealing any of the details as to his frauds upon the Chicago and Alton and Union Pacific stockholders , for whom as director he was supposed to be a responsible trustee . The Standard Oil Company , by the aid of eminent counsel , seems likely to evade punishment for much of its rebating . And an unexpectedly large number of injunctions have of late issued to postpone enforcement of the Commission 's orders until they are passed upon by the Supreme Court . Nor is it likely that the brightening financial situation is without effect . Now that the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ambitious financial plans , temporarily abandoned , are being revived . Some of these probably would be hampered by any further extension of the principle of government regulation and publicity . Certain it is that the railroads have chirked up . They are manifestly " feeling their oats " ; and are displaying a disposition to contest the law at every point . Upwards of thirty cases are now pending before ' the various Federal courts , which have been taken there on appeal from the Interstate Commerce Commission . This opposition to the law is perhaps in part also due to the fact that the Commission itself has stopped whittling and has begun to saw wood . A number of really fundamental questions are up for settlement . Can it be that the great contest of 1905 has been so soon forgotten ? Must the great political principle of public accountability of common carriers be reaffirmed by another popular upheaval ? Surely railway managements can not be so blind to their own welfare as deliberately to invite it . 416 FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION The nature of the complaints before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new law , affords the best indication of the most important feature of its work ? namely , the settlement of disputes between the railroads and their clients . And it will be apparent that a large number of these only indirectly raise the issue of the actual freight rate . Oftentimes they concern rather the manner of conducting business . An attentive perusal of these decisions of the Commission offers interesting evidence of the range of a carrier 's activities . Every little station all over the country between Aaron and Zuwash , and every conceivable commodity , from " mole-traps in crates " to " jewelers ' sweepings , " is comprehended . The fact that these disputes , often pecuniarily insignificant , could not be amicably adjusted by the good offices of the Commission informally , but necessitated formal hearing and decision , is the strongest possible proof that some competent tribunal of this sort was greatly needed in the interest of industrial peace . One of the commonest petty complaints is of misrouting of freight . Goods are carried by a roundabout way , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be specific , in 1908 six carloads of print-paper were shipped from Little Falls , Minnesota , to Boise , Idaho . Three routes were open , the rates being respectively $1.30 , $1.36 , and $2.17 per hundred pounds . The Northern Pacific road , in absence of instructions , sent the goods by the third route , ? presumably the one most profitable to itself , ? the result being a freight rate $1760.62 greater than it need have been . Reparation to this amount was granted within three months by order of the Commission . Another frequent difficulty concerns the supply of suitable cars for the needs of the shipper . Carload rates are always proportionately lower than charges for package shipment . The carriers very properly prescribe a certain minimum lading as a requisite for the grant of these proportionately lower wholesale rates . The shipper at carload rates must , however , pay for the full capacity of the car , whether his shipment fills it or not . No exception can be taken to this practice , unless the carrier is unable or unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . For instance , in 1908 , a lumberman in Oregon , having a shipment of 39,500 pounds to make to a point in Pennsylvania , requested of the Southern Pacific a car of 40,000 pounds capacity . Not having one at hand , a much larger car was furnished , having a minimum capacity of 60,000 pounds . Following the standing rule as to carload rates , the shipper was compelled to pay 624 cents per hundred pounds on the marked capacity of the car , that is to say , on 20,000 pounds more freight than he actually shipped . This made a difference of $128.12 in the freight bill , ? nearly fifty per cent in excess of the charge based upon the actual shipment . The Commission issued its order for reparation within five weeks of the filing of the complaint . A flagrant case of the misapplication of similar rules was recently decided . A retail druggist at Douglas , North Dakota , bought a sheet of plate glass eight feet square at St. Paid for forty-six dollars . Usually such large sheets have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much space , are properly assessed at a minimum weight of five thousand pounds , regardless of the actual lading . But in this instance the glass was carried upright , screwed to the end of the car , along with a lot of miscellaneous freight . Applying the standard rule made the freight bill for a distance of 587 miles , $9.50 more than the entire cost of the glass at St. // Paul . It appears strange that the carrier should have permitted so clear a case to come to a formal hearing at all . Presumably it contested it as much for the protection of its standard rules , as for the sake of the actual revenue involved . No exception can be taken to these shipping rules as a whole ; but these cases make it evident that their application may be at times too harsh and rigid . The tribunal established by the new law performs a much-needed service to the community in tempering their application in exceptional instances . Attempts at arbitrary exclusion from participation in through shipments , in order to stifle competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1005 the Enterprise line , capitalized at four hundred thousand dollars , put three steamers into commission from Fall River to New York . This independent line was of the utmost importance to the cotton manufacturers , as it was expected that at New York connection could be made with competing rail and water lines to every part of the United States . But all these lines , presumably at the behest of the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad , which had hitherto enjoyed a monopoly of the business , and which , with its enormous tonnage of high-grade freight to be parceled out among connecting lines at New York , was a formidable factor , promptly declined to join in making any through rates . All their local rates from New York on were , of course , prohibitory . In one instance , while the through rate accorded to the shipper over the New Haven road was 16f cents per hundredweight from New York on , the patron of the Enterprise line was charged 25i cents for the same service . This case recalls a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers from New York tried to break l'Ol ? 105- NO. 3 the monopoly held by the steamship lines owned by the railroads out of Galveston , Texas . The roads not only refused to pro-rate , but actually demanded prepayment of freights from Galveston on , as local rates . The Federal courts tinkered with the subject for a while , until the Circuit Court of Appeals , while recognizing a probable violation of law , affirmed that suit could be legally instituted only by the United States . Meantime , of course , the company was forced out of that business ; and rates have steadily risen ever since . In this later instance of the Enterprise line , the Commission promptly ordered an extension of the same privileges to the independent line that were enjoyed by its powerful rival . No railroad can be blamed for seeking to protect its own business interests . It is the function of this tribunal with its amplified powers to determine when these efforts conflict with the rights of others . In the far Northwest it was long a grievance that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlet anywhere except over the united Hill lines of road . Neither through tickets nor through bills of lading could be had by a natural route to the Middle West , or even to Colorado or Utah , through Portland , Oregon . The reason was plain . The northern transcontinental lines got more revenue from traffic which went east over their lines a thousand miles , by way of Spokane , than when it was turned over to a rival line at Portland , Oregon , after a haul by them of only one hundred and fifty miles . Even in 1907 , at the time of extreme congestion of the Northern Pacific main line , when it was literally overwhelmed with business , the lumbermen complained that they could find no relief by these other routes . The opening of this Portland gateway did not have to await the truce or re- 418 FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION conciliation of the Hill-Harriman forces ? the mere dictum of private individuals ; it was speedily accomplished by an easy process of law . In this instance the business interests of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same remedy is open to the small shipper . Thus , in 1907 , the Commission intervened in behalf of the Hope Cotton-Seed Oil Company . This little concern in the South shipped seventeen cars of one season 's product out over a certain road , on a low through rate . The railroad agent was then informed that these shipments interfered with the policy of establishing new industries of this sort on another line ; and the through rate was canceled . This jumped the charges from 1771 cents per hundredweight to 67 cents , ? almost the entire worth of the cottonseed . Since the new law went into effect , the Commission has prescribed a new rate of 30 cents ; and industrial peace is the result . Thus does the work of this tribunal go on , with its daily grist of opinions on almost every conceivable phase of the transportation business . It may be to prescribe that , even though inflammable , small-lot shipments of petroleum must be accepted by a carrier at least twice every week , instead of on only one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Indianapolis , as it is at Chicago and St. Louis , to be sheared , fitted , and punched , without losing the benefit of a low through rate , just as cotton is halted at the compressor , or grain is milled in transit ; that a definite rate must be quoted on jewelers ' sweepings , ? the dirt and waste laden with particles of gold destined to the smelter , ? even though it expose the carrier to the risk of exorbitant claims for damage in case of accident . But whatever the issue , one has the satisfying conviction , after reading the pros and cons in the de cisions , not only that the matter has been settled by a disinterested arid supposedly impartial third party , but that the decision is endowed with the beneficent force of public authority . As one reads these decisions , there is no evidence of political log-rolling , or of legal quibbling . They go straight to the point on the economic and common-sense issues involved . By no means are all these decisions in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only forty . six out of one hundred and seven formal cases were thus settled . The railroads enjoy no monopoly of unfair practices . Indeed , many of the rules , the exceptional application of which works hardship , were originally provided to meet some attempt at fraud by shippers . They might be underclassifying ; seeking free storage on wheels pending sale of their goods ; claiming exorbitant damages ; or perpetrating any one of a thousand petty meannesses to which human nature is liable . One or two instances of shippers ' complaints set aside as unreasonable may not be out of place . The Topeka banana dealers in 1908 complained that bananas en route from New Orleans were subject to an appreciable shrinkage in weight , amounting to about six hundred pounds per car . Inasmuch as about fouteeen thousand cars were being moved annually , it is clear that the aggregate loss of weight was considerable . The practice had been to weigh the bananas when transferred from the steamers at New Orleans to the cars , and to levy the freight rate upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things the practice , long prevalent in the cattle business , where a similar loss of weight in transit occurs , of charging according to the weight of the shipments , not at the initial point , but at the point of delivery . At first sight the complaint appears to be well founded . Surely one should not be compelled to pay freight on a greater lading than is carried . But the Commission on examination decided in favor of the roads . It was shown that the service was most exceptional as to the shipment , handling , anil speed ; and it was held that the charges were on the whole reasonable and just . One of the most important issues in which the railroads have won their contention concerned the loading of lumber on flat=cars . For half a century the practice has been that the shipper should provide his own lumber-stakes and pay freight on them as on the lumber itself . In 1905 the National Lumbermen 's Association tried to change all this , and to impose upon the carriers the legal duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commodities . The carriers offered a compromise , agreeing to allow five hundred pounds per car free for the weight of the stakes ; but refused to accept responsibility for safely stowing the goods . The Commission finally , after prolonged inquiry by experts , relieved the carriers of this care and expense . It is undeniable also that the carriers have found solace in certain unforeseen ways under the amended law . The rigid prohibition of all favors and rebates has substantially raised the general level of charges , so general was the practice of cutting rates a few years ago . To be sure , this increase has affected principally the large shippers , thus tending to equalize opportunity between all grades of competitors . But over and above this , the prohibition of any act tainted with favoritism has enabled the carriers successfully to withstand many leakages of revenue . Claims for damages can be plausibly denied on the ground that their settlement might arouse suspicion , and possibly lead to prosecution for the grantof individual favors . Many roads have also actually augmented their revenues by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merely nominal rental of one dollar for freight-sheds , other buildings , or land used for sidetracks or elevators , was formerly general . It would have been awkward to place these contracts on a strictly commercial basis , especially where the tenants were shippers , with the option of resorting to a rival line . But on the plea that a continuance of these nominal rentals might be considered a criminal act of favoritism , substantial increases of revenue have been obtained . On one road alone over three thousand of these nominal rentals have been raised to strictly commercial figures . The aggregate increase of revenue from this source has been by no means inconsiderable . ? An odd feature of the problem of railway legislation is that it has to do with all three of the great coordinate branches of the government . The making of rates seems to be a legislative act ; their supervision , as actually applied , an executive or administrative act ; and their correction or review , a judicial act . Separation of these three powers is a fundamental principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms needed in the mere methods of procedure and administration of the present law ? a topic with which the present administration is admirably fitted to cope ? is beyond the province of this article . Suffice it to say that a logical repartition of hitherto confused and conflicting governmental functions is proposed , in order to promote celerity and certainty in the application of the law . The present Commission , with certain enlarged powers , is to hear and pass upon complaints , this being an executive act . A special commerce court 420 FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION is to be created , to attend finally to all matters of judicial review of orders of the Commission , short of those purely constitutional questions which must go forward to the Supreme Court . And this strengthening of the judicial arm is to be accompanied by a transfer of the service of prosecution of suits to the Department of Justice . To the non-legal expert it would appear to be an admirable division of governmental labor . The problems put up to the Interstate Commerce Commission are not all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As was confidently predicted by railroad men , this body with its enlarged powers has been brought face to face with great economic questions , whose determination is vital to entire commonwealths , and even to the whole country . One of these hard nuts for the Commission to crack concerns the reasonableness of the various freight-rate advances which have of late been occurring all along the line . This raises a question as to the absolute fairness of the new rates as against the interest of the general public . One conclusion is certain . The new law has not prevented the carriers from persisting in a policy , adopted nearly ten years ago after a generation of steadily declining rates , of quite generally putting up their charges . Unfortunately , the law of 1906 is defective in making no provision for dealing adequately with such cases . The Interstate Commerce Commission is limited in its scope to the consideration only of specific complaints . It can not of its own initiative pass upon the reasonableness of an entire new schedule of rates in advance of its taking effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , bit by bit , as individual shippers chance to complain , after the rates have become operative . This abridgment of its power to pass upon the reasonableness of tariffs as a whole was effected in the Senate . It was not contemplated either by the late administration or by the House of Representatives . The result , as was predicted , is that little protection is afforded to the public in any large way . Judging by results , the railroads are as free as they ever were to increase their tariffs , whenever they see fit so to do . There is imperative need of amending the law , and of granting power to suspend such rate-advances , not as now in particular cases on complaint , but as to entire schedules of rates , prior to their taking effect . The experience of the last few years has amply proved the need of some such amendment ; and it is gratifying to note that President Taft , judging from his public utterances , seems likely to favor the proposal . It is matter of common knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of the changes since the new law went into effect is not so generally appreciated . From an arsenal of evidence , a few details may be selected as typical . Few commodities are of greater importance to the United States than chemical fertilizers , used in enormous quantities all over the country . The basis of these is phosphate rock . The freight rate on this from Tennessee to Chicago in 1907 was $3.40 per ton . It was increased to $3.95 , until the Commission ordered its reduction to the old figure . At the same time the Oregon lumbermen had their rates to the East increased about one-quarter , after a period of quiescence of six years . From the Willamette Valley to San Francisco ? a test case now before the courts ? lumber rates were $3.10 . In 1907 they were put up to $5 . The Commission held that $3.40 was an adequate rate . The last general in- crease occurred in January , 1909 , particularly in transcontinental rates , where the fruit of the Harriman monopoly made itself felt . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation , ? twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron and iron pipe , for instance , ? the Pacific Coast rates from New York rose often as high as fifty per cent . The rate on dry goods went up by one-third . Therein lies a part of the motive power for Union Pacific speculative finance . Occasionally one strikes an exorbitant rise in the East , however , as in one instance where on imported iron pyrites used in making sulphuric acid , the rate , which in 1903 was $1.56 , became $2.72 four years later . And the hardship often obtains in the fact that these increases have been most marked in the case of the small shipper , ? the very one who , in these days of jarge enterprises , we can least afford to spare . The rate on cotton goods from the South to the Pacific Coast rose only fifteen per cent between 1896 and 1907 by the carload ; for smaller lots it rose sixty-five per cent . In 1907 , 38,000,000 pounds of cheese were produced in southwestern Wisconsin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent more in 1907 than eight years earlier ; but the shipper in smaller lots was compelled to pay forty per cent more . As always , the change is along the line of least resistance . Such a policy makes for larger dividends ; but does it tend to the perpetuation of equality of opportunity as between great and small concerns ? That is a social question of the very first import- ( nice . This chronicle of rate-advances in a time of industrial depression is not offered as an indictment of recent railroad management . It is merely intended to show the contrast between the present conditions of combinationand monopoly , and the old-fashioned days before 1900 . Everybody then assumed as a matter of course that railroad rates , while they might slacken in their thirty years ' decline , would probably never be actually higher than at that time . And yet here they are greatly enhanced in a time of trade reaction ; and , for aught that one can see , likely to keep on rising . And while the rises of 1900 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later advances bear some indications of greater independence . That little incident of a prompt rise of the rate on lemons from California , just as soon as the new tariff law had effectually debarred the Sicilian product and enabled higher prices to the consumer to be charged , was a case in point . Not all the benefits of a protective tariff were to go to the fruit-grower , by any means ! The allegation of the railway men is that these freight-rate advances are not peculiar to the carriers alone . They discern a warrant for them in their greatly enhanced wage-scales and price-lists since 1900 . " The decline in the purchasing power of the railroad 's dollar " has been a favorite subject for railway writers , ? generally , by the way , presaging another increase of freight rates . But it is certainly open to question whether the carriers have not already fully squared their accounts in this regard . They certainly have fared better in this respect than the general public . The record of increase of net incomes and stock dividends within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scale of expenditures may be rising , its acceleration is exceeded by the growth of income . No other conclusion is possible . The carrier 's argument that a rise of freight rates must fully keep pace with the course of general prices and wages , also neglects consideration of 422 FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION the well-established economic principle , that a railroad 's profits normally increase more than in proportion to the swelling volume of its traffic . Technically speaking , a railroad affords one of the clearest known examples of an industry subject to the law of increasing returns . This was exceptionally clear before 1898 , when prices and wages began to mount . Between 1880 and 1897 , for example , three times as much freight and two and one-quarter times as many passengers were transported , at an increased operating cost of only about one hundred per cent . The ever-widening margin would have yielded increasing net returns , had not unregulated competition constantly pared down the rates . This erosion of rates , thanks to the advent of monopoly and combination , has now entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing returns can be more readily observed . Even during the last ten years , therefore , the evidence is indubitable that the railways make more money in proportion to the growing volume of their business than they did before . And there is no question as to the enormously rapid rate at which their business is likely to grow in future . Statistically measured , the railways of this country in 1907 carried more than double the traffic of 1898 . Take the case of the Union Pacific Railroad . In 1900 its freight business amounted to about 1,572,000,000 ton miles . For 1909 , the corresponding figure was 5,266,000,000 , an increase of over three hundred per cent ? or about thirty-three per cent yearly . Surely this enormous growth of business , under the known laws of increasing railroad profits , ought to count for something in the public 's favor . And yet the large increase of transcontinental freight rates in January , 1909 , bears no evidence that it did so . Turning from the past to the future , the all-important question is as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuation of this policy of rate-advances , in the face of the bounteous rates of return upon the actual capital invested . How far are the common carriers of the country partners of the people in industrial prosperity ? Are they alone to be immune from the periodic industrial reactions to which all other forms of business are exposed ? Because the volume of their business declines in times of panic , are they entitled to recoup their losses by advancing the price of their commodity ? transportation ? because they seem to have the power to do so ? That was certainly their policy during the depression of 1907-08 . And if they can increase their rates in a time of depression , how much greater is the probability that they will continue to do so now that prosperity has returned . To all these contentions it will very properly be replied , that the necessity for enormously increased transportation facilities , in order to keep pace with the growth of the country , makes it imperative that attractive returns on the new capital invested should be guaranteed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-railroad political hysteria of 1906-07 threatened unduly to cut off this supply of new capital . But there is still a latent popular suspicion that in far too many cases exorbitant returns are yielded . This suspicion has been kept alive by numerous recent events . The Northern Pacific Railroad , in addition to enormous improvements of its plant out of surplus , for some time regularly paid seven per cent dividends , and that too on $93,000,000 of new stock issued at par ; then , suddenly , in December , 1908 , paid an extra cash dividend of // eleven per cent out of a secret fund , not Known to exist except by its directors . The Great Northern Railroad in 1898 increased its capital stock by one-half , and again in 1906 doubled this total in order to.keep pace with its earnings . The earnings of some of the anthracite coal roads are spectacularly large . The Lackawanna for some years has earned over fifty per cent annually on its outstanding capital stock , effecting a partial distribution of its surplus by a cash dividend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent in 1909 . Even the Reading is making a show of earnings on its huge overload of capitalization , ? partly a product of early fraud and speculation , and partly representing debts incurred to buy up and carry the American anthracite coal-supply of the next hundred years . And in 1910 even the notorious Nickel Plate line , unloaded upon the Lake Shore a generation ago , as a speculative hold-up , begins to pay dividends on its common stock . The expert may perhaps be able in sonic cases to show a warrant for these acts . He may prove , for instance , that long-continued reinvestment of surplus earnings in the property has legitimately enhanced its value ; or , to be specific , that the extra Northern Pacific dividend of 1908 represented an accumulation of income based upon conservative management . An enthusiast might even go so far as to attempt to prove that the late Mr. Harriman 's increase of the stock and bonds of the Chicago and Alton Railroad by $62,660,000 ? without a dollar 's worth of new capital paid in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prosperous road , after years of thrifty management , to its newly discovered earning capacity . And the validity of this argument must be admitted within reasonable limits . The trouble is that the undiscerningpublic is unable to distinguish the fraudulent from the honest financing ; and visits its suspicions alike upon the sound and the unsound . There is one weak point in the elaborate defense by the financial expert of an unlimited enhancement of railroad earnings and dividends . It is advanced in support of the contention that railroad charges must not be held subject to review . This is the assumption that all undistributed surplus earnings of a company are as completely the property of the stockholders as are the presumably reasonable dividends declared . And at first sight , this appears plausible enough . If , as actually happened in 1907 , net earnings of all the railroads of the United States , available for dividends and improvements , amounted to $479,000,000 , while only $227,000,000 was actually checked out to stockholders , more than half still remained on hand . A goodly portion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean years when earnings fall below the average . But what of the remainder ? Obviously there is only one use to be made of it . Reinvest it in the plant , lay double tracks , buy new equipment ; and ? the optimist will add ? give better service even if it costs more to do so . But immediately there arises a question in the public mind . These surplus earnings , thus reinvested , are in part the public 's investment . After liberal dividends have been currently declared and all the risks of bad years have been insured against , the stockholders ' sole right to the balance would seem to be neither absolute nor char . Or , otherwise stated , the stockholders ' right to a maintenance of the existing level of rates is called in question . Charges once reasonable under conditions of liberal but not excessive dividends , may become exorbitant when the returns on invested capital exceed a fairly ample rate . Such is the prin- 424 FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION ciple of division of profits in the London and Boston sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear with the popular demand expressed in the British budget for taxation of the unearned increment of land values . The trouble , of course , is that in practice these surpluses are quietly laid away year by year , and then suddenly capitalized in the form of stock dividends or other bonuses . This custom blocks the wheels of the argument above stated . This argument , that the surplus above fair dividends was in part the public 's surplus , was predicated upon the assumption that the ownership of railroad securities is unchanging and permanent . But stocks and bonds are constantly passing from hand to hand . Suppose a road is known to be accumulating a heavy surplus from ? let us say ? exorbitant rates . The value of its securities rises steadily in the same proportion , if the facts be known . Innocent persons , trustees , and widows buy these securities at the new and enhanced prices . The former stockholders " cash in " their shares , and pocket their portion of the surplus . The new owners pay full value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is distributed as a " melon , " they are merely given possession of goods , already paid for . Shall public authority intervene , and deny the right of these eleventh-hour investors to come into their own ? No court would permit it for a moment . The public 's share in the surplus earnings is gone forever . And what is worse , the private owners once possessed of these surpluses become endowed with the right to a fair dividend return thereon for all future time . Exorbitant rates create undue surpluses ; such surpluses lead to new issues of stock ; and this stock , once issued , compels a continuation of the high rates . The economic phenomena of increasing and possibly unreasonable freight rates , of unwarranted surpluses , of " melon-cutting " and stock dividends , all impel one to the same conclusions , ? conclusions embodied in the recommendations of President Taft to Con. gross . All these phenomena hang together as cause and effect . A vicious wheel of policy is set rolling , which can not be arrested . Nor may any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with the Hepburn Act . Admirable as many of its provisions are , it can never be successfully applied in any large way , until the interdependence of earnings , that is to say of rates , of capitalization , and of the value of the properties themselves , is recognized by law . One of the most extensive rate-controversies in our economic history in the Far West perfectly illustrates this statement . All the Rocky Mountain cities , from Spokane to Albuquerque , have been up in arms for years about their high rates of transportation from the East . These rates are often as much as one hundred per cent higher than rates to the more distant Pacific Coast points . The complaints of Spokane may be taken as typical of the complaints of practically every town of any size in the Rocky Mountain area . The rate from New York to Spokane on " tin pails and lard pails nested " is $1.90 per hundredweight ; while the rate through to Seattle is only 85 cents . The result is that no dealer in these goods at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is true of nested lard pails is true of practically all goods consumed . It is obvious that there are only two possible remedies for this disparity in charges . The Seattle rates may be raised ; or the Spokane rates may be reduced . The former course is precluded by ever-present water compe- // tit ion by way of Cape Horn and the Isthmus . To raise rail rates to Seattle ( add simply force traffic to come by sea . To adopt the other alternative ? to reduce Spokane rates ? means to cut into the earnings of the transcontinental roads . These Spokane rates could justly be reduced only if they were unreasonably high . The only pos-. sible standard by which to judge of this fact , in general , is on the basis of the rates of return on the entire investment of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroads . Their attorneys introduced this line of argument voluntarily , by offering proof that their properties were well worth the amount of their capitalization , and that on this basis no abnormal rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long series of high dividends , and of stock-watering . The Commission was thus forced to take up the matter of valuation ; just as the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly been led to the same conclusion . It ' promptly appeared that both great transcontinental systems had regularly been earning from ten to fifteen per cent annually upon their stocks at par ; and that a part at least of this capitalization was fictitious . Yet the surplus over fair dividends distributed had regularly been reinvested in the property ; and , as we have seen , this surplus had been indistinguishably merged in the rest of their outstanding securities . As the Commission observed in its opinion , the harm done by unjustifiable stock-watering was irremediable . It was of no avail to close the stable door after the horse had been stolen . What should have been done , was to provide for some system of government regulation of the issue of railway securities year by year ; and then to see to it that the rates charged should produce no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance for all contingencies . There is nothing revolutionary in the idea of a valuation of railroad property by public authority . No less than four states have done it most elaborately ; and one of them at least has annually inventoried the possessions of its public carriers since 1893 . ' Railroad enterprises have never prospered anywhere more than in these states , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota . And even in Texas , the projected new construction affords ample proof that investment is not deterred by the presence of this form of state control . One of the surprising features of some of these valuations by state authority , moreover , is their indication that many of our railroads are not in reality overcapitalized at all . In Minnesota , for instance , the total issue of stocks and bonds in 1908 was $44,200 per mile ; an amount just about equal to the estimated cost of reproduction , with due allowance for depreciation . In other words , this official valuation showed that the roads represented an investment practically equal to their entire issues of stocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honestly administered property . One of its principal benefits would be the segregation of the financial railway sheep from the goats in the public and investment eye . An interesting case of governmental valuation far exceeding in amount the issue of securities , recently occurred in Massachusetts . The question of a fair scale of rates for its services being raised , an inventory of the physical property of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company showed a valuation of $46,500,000 . This pro perty was capitalized for only $38,900 , - 000 . Such a proceeding under the seal of public authority is of two-fold advantage . It allays public suspicion of over-capitalization . It also encourages capital by affording proof of the security behind its investments . Advocacy of the principle of Federal valuation of railways does not necessarily mean that all the railroad possessions of the country need be inventoried at once . To do this would involve the expenditure of several million dollars . Moreover , the practice in effecting such valuation is by no means standardized as yet . It is a proceeding studded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by little , as state after state and corporation after corporation take account of stock , the procedure will become established . It is a branch of administrative activity requiring business and engineering talent of a high grade ; but experience has already demonstrated its entire feasibility . And the need of it for the final settlement of disputed rates would seem to be beyond question . The crowning feature of the legislation proposed by the Taft administration is governmental control of the issue of stocks and bonds by railroad companies . It is becoming increasingly clear that unless the Federal government assumes such responsibility the several states will do so independently . This latter alternative would be ineffective , and at the same time intolerable . Nor is there anything subversive of the established order in this proposal . Massachusetts has had an anti-stockwatering law since 1893 . The result is that over-capitalization , whether of railroads , traction companies , or gas and electric-light companies is a nonexistent evil . States as far apart as Texas and Wisconsin have also suc cessfully applied the same rule of pub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most notable instance is , however , the creation of the Public Service Commissions of the State of New York . In the settlement of such knotty questions as the reorganization of the metropolitan traction companies , or the financing of the waterlogged Erie Railroad , they may occasionally have blundered ; but , on the whole , no unbiased critic will hesitate a moment in attesting their work a great success . No agency could protect the people from the evil results of the barefaced frauds upon the investing public perpetrated in the financing of the New York traction companies . Yet clearer skies are ahead ; and a distinct improvement in the character of rapid transit has already resulted from the activity of these public bodies . Several positive advantages , other than the mere prevention of gross fraud , are likely to follow the adoption by the Federal government of the principle of supervision of the finances of interstate public-service companies . The first of these , of course , is the prevention of an extortionate scale of charges for service rendered . Only last November the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration overnight of a three hundred per cent cash dividend out of accumulated surplus . Having thus trebled its capitalization , and the new shares having become widely disseminated , express rates in future over a large part of the United States must be maintained high enough to pay dividends upon this enormously inflated basis . Had guardians of the public interest been suitably forearmed , the economic warrant for this act would have been at least subject to review . Not the least of the benefits incident to Federal control of railway finance would also be the stability thereby imparted to the financial markets . One of // the worst evils of our American railway finance has been stock-market manipulation by directors and their friends . The very recent rigging of Rock Island shares is a case in point . Despite the brilliancy of some of his achievements with the Union Pacific , it is indubitable that the late Mr. Harriman inextricably entangled his railroads in stock-market operations . That his specula tive plunges under corporate names had a successful issue , does not in the least lessen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main upon secrecy in financial affairs . The publicity incident to governmental control of capitalization would go far to abate what has long been a nuisance and a menace in ' American corporate finance . . Still another positive benefit which would accrue from the adoption of the President 's policy of financial regulation , would be the extension of the market for railroad securities . Two great stores of capital for investment , one old and one very new , might be largely . drawn upon for the development of transportation in future , were the light of publicity and governmental approval to be thrown upon new issues of securities . European capital has too often fared badly at the hands of American railroad managers . Our Eries and our Chicago Great Westerns have too far outweighed our Illinois Centrals and our Pennsylvanias among foreign investors . They have come to regard A merica as a field for speculation , rather than as one for investment . And the same thing is true in some degree of our Western farmer . Our agricultural population " out West " is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its invested capital is now becoming large . This will be a great financial reservoir as years go by . These people , like the European investors , hold state activity in high esteem . Could their savings be led into the channel of railroad investment , especially in the lines serving their own localities , the carriers would profit , not only directly , but by the creation of an atmosphere of political conservatism as well . It makes a great difference in the temper of a village whether the deacons of the church and the selectmen of the township are merely shippers of farm produce , or are shareholders in the railroad at the same time . A prime factor in winning the confidence of this class , and in offsetting the appeals of the political demagogue , would be the acquiescence of the railroads in a reasonable policy of financial supervision . Eminent railway counsel avers that this is no time to reopen the issue of Federal railroad legislation ; that , in fact , we are only just recovering from an era of political hysteria on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the Hepburn Act has at least had a fair trial . The answer is that the present administration is pledged to this policy , ? to the perfecting of the programme of President Roosevelt in this regard . In a time of widespread prosperity , the American people are in a not unfriendly state of mind toward the carriers of the country . The experience of years proves that adequate public control is the only alternative for a socialistic programme of public ownership . The American people are happily not interested in this latter plan . But the bills now pending in Congress , and the state of public opinion on the subject , show the insistent demand for adequate supervision in future of these most powerful and indispensable public servants . In time of peace prepare for war . The surest protection against the shafts of the demagogue will be found under the regis of publicity and ample Federal supervision .
