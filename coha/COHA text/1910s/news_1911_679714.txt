txt With an Italian fleet cruising off the coast of Tripoli and an Italian ultimatum in Constantinople demanding a guarantee equivalent to a protectorate over the country , the outlook is regarded as of the blackest . Though Italy has offered to pay a heavy money indemnity for the cession of Tripoli , it is not expected that the Turkish Government win accept the offer , for the Young Turks are a military party and their prestige , already damaged by the loss of Bosnia and Eastern Rumelia , would suffer an irremediable blow by the surrender of Tripoli without armed resistance . If war result , there seems , according to English authorities , no possibility of preventing the conquest of Tripoli by Italy . Some German experts predict another Adowa for Italy , but . while Turkey has from 25,000 to 30,000 met in Tripoli , the Italian fleet can shut off reinforcements of men , supplies , and ammunition . The Turkish fleet is a negligible quantity , while Italy now has four squadrons mobilized and ready for action . The first squadron , consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with three new armored cruisers , a scout , three destroyers , and a mine snip , has already arrived on the African coast . The second squadron consists of three older battleships , four- armored cruisers , and a scout . It will proceed to Turkish waters to deal with the Turkish fleet in case of hostilities . The third squadron , of three old battleships and one armored cruiser , will act as a reserve . The fourth squadron , of two cruisers and eighty destroyers , torpedo boats , and submarines , will cover the Italian coast . However good a fight the Turkish forces in Tripoli might put up , there is no possibility of striking at the Italian mainland , and thus the war would be ? localized , and , it is believed here , speed- ' , fly ended . Peril of Further Upheaval . While official disclaimers are made I on behalf of Italy that she is pursuing the policy of " grab " which Austria began in 1808 and Germany continued at Agadir , it is a sign of the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from her present dilemma by securing " compensation " 1 from her weaker neighbors . The Con- I stantinople Government , it is suggested , may argue thus : " Italy is seizing I Tripoli from us because she knows we I can not defend it , and though she has I no right to do it . if Europe is prepared to admit the doctrine in her case that might is right , it must admit it in our case , and we will help ourselves to Greek territory in compensation , as we know the Greeks are weaker than ourselves on land and sea . " Or , again , the Greeks , with the prospect of war between Italy and Turkey , may themselves decide to strike , looking to Italy for help . In the Turkish crisis of 1903 they were induced to keep quiet only by the assurance of the powers that they should ultimately receive Crete under a pacific arrangement . Three years have passed , and that promise has not been fulfilled . - Here is another danger point in the situation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hardly begun to develop . " The chief peril , " says the correspondent , " lies in the : state of affairs in the Ottoman Empire itself . Without heeding rumors such as those disseminated here to-day ( Tuesday ) that the Sultan may abdicate , it suffices to draw attention to an undated dispatch published by the Politische Correspondenz in which mention is made of the declining prestige of the Committee for Union and Progress , whose influence over the civil and ; military authorities in various parts of I the empire is states to be perceptibly declining . " Whatever turn the Tripolitan crisis may take , it is difficult to imagine that it will leave the Young Turkish system unaffected , and a grave problem is whether the Ottoman Empire possesses sufficient reserve of strength to be able to swap horses while crossing the stream and whether the nearest:neighbors of Turkey would for a second time remain passive spectators of such a charge .
