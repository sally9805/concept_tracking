txt In Mr. BRYAN 'S judgment the one Shining provision of the Banking and Currency bill which above all others commands his approval is that which authorizes the Government to issue the circulating notes . In his remarks to the hankers at Richmond last 7week he , commended that feature of the bill . He was almost enthusiastic over it in his letter to Chairman ! GLASS , which was read in the DemoCrane House caucus when the bill was under consideration . In that letter he said : The provision in regard to the Government issue of the notes to be loaned to the banks is the first triumph of the people in connection with currency legislation in a genera ; tion It is hard to overestimate the value of this feature of the bill . In ; the second place the hill provided for i Government control of this money ! that is , control through a board corn1 posed of Government officials selected by the President with the approval of 1 the Senate . This is another distinct triumph for the people , one without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely a barren victory . ! That is a very significant utterance , oven though . Mr. BRYAN seems to **30;836;TOOLONG ' ? aild pxtAnt of Government control of the note issues . Control , if it were actual and complete , would give the Government power to issue the notes at its pleasure to any amount . Mr. BRYAN overlooks the fact that the Government 's control is not complete , that the reserve banks really have control of the volume of the issues , because unless they ask for notes none will be put out by the Government . The process is that a Federal reserve bank on a vote of its Directors applies to the local Federal reserve agent " for such amount of the Treasury " notes hereinbefore provided for as " it may deem best . " Accompanying the application , it offers rediscounted hills as collateral security . and these rediscounted bills must be equal in amount to the sum of the notes applied for .

' His notion of the currency of the people is something that is not money . greenbacks or silver , something , at any rate , that is not gold . It is in this respect that his approval of the bill is significant . That very fact will lead men who have not approved Mr BRYAN 'S currency views to examine the measure with unusual care .
