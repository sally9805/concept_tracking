txt We think the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' Association should take action , so far as their influence may prevail , to secure the reappointment of Wn.mAst L. Wrnixox , Chairman of the Public Service Commission , whose term expires on Feb. 1 . These two organizations have not been indifferent to the city 's imperative need of new subways . They may justly claim the credit of having borne an influential part in bringing about the adoption of the dual subway plan . At a meeting of the Chamber in December , 1911 , Mr. E. H. OUTERBRIDON , Chairman of the Special Committee on Rapid Transit , presented a resolution embodying a suggestion of Mayor GAYNOR that the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' Association appoint a committee of citizens charged with the duty of enlightening and concentrating public opinion upon the various - proposals of subway extension then pending . A committee of thirty was appointed by President HEPBURN of the Chamber of Commerce and President Towrrz of the Merchants ' Association . The committee included men experienced in finance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of the city . SETEI Low was its Chairman . This committee made a report to the Mayor on Dec. 27 , 1910 , a report which was a highly valuable contribution to the subway discussion , and which bad a potent influence in shaping the action of the city authorities . Under the plan adopted some months later work has already begun . Nearly $300,000,000 will be spent in carrying out the undertaking . But just at the moment when new contracts are to be let for important routes under this plan , the term of Mr. Wzttcox will expire . It will be contended that there are many other men in the city who are the equal of Mr. WILLcox in ability and general experience . That may be granted . But it is Mr. Wrmcox 's special experience that marks him out as the man best qualified to carry on a work with which he has been most intimately associated from the beginning . The appointment of another In his place would involve confusion , loss of time , possibly unfortunate changes of plan or policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk that can not prudently be taken . It is not to be supposed that the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' Association are leas deeply Interested in the execution of the subway work than they were in its planning . They must see and fully understand the importance of securing for the city a continuance of Mr. Wirmaox 's service , which we may fairly call expert service . These organizations , therefore , would be performing a plainly fndicated civic duty if again they should take joint action to urge upon Gov . SELZER , when he shall have taken the chair at Albany , - the many and altogether unanswerable arguments for the reappointment of Mr. WILLcox . They can fortify Mr. SULZER against any Possible pressure to surrender this place , which is the very citadel of the people 's defense against a waste of their money . to a Commissioner with . an eye less single to'the public interest . The Chamber and the Association have again an opportunity to enlighten and concentrate public opinion .
