txt YOUNG PLAGIARIST 'S PRIZE . Why Did Boy Who Used 0 . Henry 's Story Only Get Second ? I see in a recent issue that a New* York City high school boy by using one or 0 . Henry 's stories has secured the second prize in a school contest for short stories . I am wondering how it happened that the first prize was not awarded , to him . Was it that the Judges were unable to recognize the merit of so finished an artist as this writer of delectable fiction so that they passed his work by and gave the preference to the work of a high school boy ? Can it be possible that in Your wonderful city the school boys are writing stories superior in literary merit to the work of a writer of such wide fame ? I can imagine that Mr. Henry will feel some chagrin when the item above referred to reaches his eye . ? He must consider himself still in the schoolboy class and must think with a smile of how he has deceived the magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .
