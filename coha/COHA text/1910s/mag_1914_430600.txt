 | The present life and institutions of a people are wonderfully influenced by their past , however ignorant of these silent forces may be the busy men who , in a certain limited sense , direct the activities of today . Just about a hundred years ago the Farmers ' Exchange Bank of Gloucester , R. I. , was organized with a capital of $3,000 ; it accumulated deposits to such an extent that one director was able to borrow $760,000 , and , when it failed after enriching various interested parties and damaging or ruining thousands of honest citizens , the autopsy revealed specie assets of $86.46 ; and yet some persons speak as though high finance was a recent invention . This event , happening almost a hundred years ago , and many others of the same sort for the next few decades , are the reason why we have suffered for the past half century with a banking and cur- ' t rency system marked in some respects by such serious defects , and the reason why the mighty financial institution brought into being by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past is in many respects as it is . The sad ante-bellum experience of the'United States with wild cat banks and bank notes of every conceivable degree of value and no value was ended by the national banking act of 1863 ; but so set was the country on remedying one defect that in making the bank note absolutely secure it also makes it absolutely inelastic . Incidentally another serious defect was woven into the very texture of our system of national bank notes : In being based upon a required security of United States bonds , a powerful influence was created to prevent the payment of the national debt . Yet another fault : Half the banks of the country were set up in a position of special privilege which the other half were denied , a privilege moreover which many of those banks thus denied needed more keenly than many of those to which it was granted , namely the privilege of expanding their loanable assets at crop seasons for the accommodation of the fundamental industry of the country , its agriculture .  | A bank note which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like a white man who can boast of nothing except that he is white . What are the proper character and functions of the bank note ? It should not form any very considerable part of the regular circulating medium of the country from year to year , like its gold or silver coins ; for then it surrenders all its distinctive character and advantages and really has very little reason for its existence beyond the private profit of the issuing bank . The bank note circulation , if it is of the inelastic character of our national bank notes , simply does the work of ordinary metal money ( and under some very critical circumstances does that very badly ) and drives out of the country a corresponding amount of gold . Bank notes appear in their proper character as the elastic portion of the currency . The business of the country is not of fixed , unchanging size . With different seasons of the year it expands and contracts , and sometimes at irregular intervals it undergoes violent and spasmodic irregularities . At these times the regular forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust the supply of standard metallic money to the needs of the country . When there comes such a financial stringency , either on account of the yearly demand to move the crops or because of a financial panic , we should turn to the bank note to the extent that the business needs of the country demand . I admit that there was a time in the youth of this country when , because of the imperative demand for a circulating medium for the development of its resources and the refusal of the conservative and distrustful moneyed capitalists of Europe and the Atlantic coast to supply hard money , the bank note as ordinary current circulating medium did a good service ; but that time is long past . This is a strict definition of the nature and function of the bank note , and as we have ours , and they , as we , must struggle long to loosen the grip of many a by-gone error . What , then , are the objects at which the framers of the Federal reserve , or currency , act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry of the country from  | the fear of periodic panics , like that of 1907 , which so seriously menace our prosperity ; second , the relief of the yearly autumnal strain for money to move the crops , and intermedially to reduce the evil consequent upon the accumulation of the reserves of a rigid and inelastic circulating medium in New York , where for want of a better use they are lent out on call for gambling in stock , cotton and produce futures to an extent unexampled in any other country in the world ; third , the emancipation from Wall Street control , in other words , the breaking of what is somewhat loosely for want of a better name termed the money trust ; and fourth , to make the money resources of the country most largely and effectively available . These objects can only be accomplished by concentrating bank reserves and creating a note issue which is both elastic and safe , under the control of a body animated by motives of public interest and not of private gain . The system just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only adapts with remarkable skill to American conditions methods which have proved successful in the great countries of Europe . The final retirement of all the present national bank notes , though facilitated by the present measure , will require twenty or thirty years and may take longer . The first impressions of our Federal Reserve Act are of the sweeping nature of the changes which have been introduced and the powerful character of the system which has been created . The business world has taught us the lesson of huge enterprise and mighty power , and in this case the government has well learned the lesson . The very phraseology of the law is with the air of sureness and authority , and yet at the same time it offers such inestimable advantages to the member banks that it is hard to see how a large financial institution could afford to be outside . It is a power of helpfulness and not of oppression . Many of the details of the bill are themselves of great interest . The act creates not less than eight nor more than twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities the centers of districts whose bounds are to be prescribed in the most serviceable manner throughout the country . The entire system is under the well nigh absolute control of the  | page deleted  | lating notes to it , to hold in his custody certain of its securities , and to keep constantly in touch with the supreme Federal Reserve Board in Washington . The other six of the nine directors of the Reserve Bank are elected by the banks of the district , each having one vote . For this purpose the banks of the district are divided into three as nearly similar groups as possible , and each group chooses two of the six men , this arrangement and that of one vote equally for every bank making impossible any kind of ring rule or big stick methods . Every national bank in the United States must become a stock holder in the Federal Reserve Bank of its district to the exact amount of six per cent of its capital and surplus , which must be paid in gold . This alone will supply $106,000,000 . State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby become amenable to the same system of inspection . If banks do not take a sufficient amount of stock to suit the managers , the public may be invited to buy or the United States Government may take any amount necessary for cash and the unwilling national bank will be closed at the end of a year ; but these contingencies are too remote to detain us . No bank may sell or hypothecate its stock , for the institution is strictly a bankers ' bank , owned solely by bankers , administered in large part by their elected directors , but controlled by the government 's Federal Reserve Board of seven men in Washington . Six per cent dividends go to the stock holding banks ; above this , half the profits go to the government as a franchise tax and half to the surplus fund until that augments to 40 per cent of the capital , after which the entire dividends above six per cent go to the government . This is a principle which should be applied to every monopoly in existence , since , where competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and a reasonable compensation upon the capital , the government , their only possible defender , should . Having briefly sketched the organization , let us examine the functions of the Federal Reserve Banks . Besides being allowed to establish foreign branches , which under some circumstances might be of extreme value to the government and people of the United States , we can notice only the four func- tions of receiving deposits , holding reserves , making discounts , and issuing notes . The Reserve Banks may receive deposits only from member banks or the United States government , which is authorized to deposit all the general revenues there , thus departing from the medieval strong box system into which we were driven in 1846 by the wild cat bank system alluded to in the first part of this paper . Tens of millions of dollars which have been drained from the channels of commerce will thus be poured into their proper circulation with an effect altogether beneficial to enterprise and business . Against its deposits the reserve bank must maintain a cash reserve in its vaults of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 40 per cent and 50 per cent . ) Regarding the reserves of ordinary national banks , the concentration which the new law accomplishes makes safe their reduction to the following figures : For country banks , 12 per cent of their demand deposits ; of which 4 per cent must be in their own vaults , 5 per cent in the reserve bank , and the other 3 per cent in either ; for banks in the present reserve cities , 15 per cent ; 5 per cent to be in their own vaults ; 6 per cent in the reserve bank , and the other 4 per cent in either ; for central reserve cities ( at present New York , St. Louis , Chicago , but to which the Federal Reserve Board may add others at its discretion ) , 18 per cent ; 6 per cent to be in their own vaults , 7 per cent in the reserve bank , and the other 5 per cent in either . Thus the reserves of the entire country will be concentrated like eight great armies in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the Federal Reserve Board to order by a vote of five of its seven members to be concentrated still further to such extent as the circumstances may demand by means of requiring any reserve bank to rediscount the discounted paper of any other reserve bank . Those who object to this forget that we have not created eight or twelve separate banks , but eight or twelve limbs of one great body . In the German phrase , " Eine hand wascht die andere . " We now pass to the functions of discount . Here , as in every other activity save in open market operations consisting  | of the mere buying and selling of certain securities , etc. , the reserve bank may do business only with its member banks . One of the shortcomings of the American banking system has been the lack of an adequate system of rediscounts , which would make financial capital so much more fluid , available and widely serviceable . It is almost unbelievable to an American that half the commercial paper in the German Empire is rediscounted by the Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a great deal of the same business . In Europe the notes of small tradesmen of good standing are rediscounted hundreds of miles away from home , and even in foreign countries . With our Federal Reserve Bank the great business is to be the discounting of the already discounted paper of the member banks . The process is carefully guarded by the following provisions : No bills or notes shall be rediscounted except such as have originated in actual commercial , industrial , or agricultural operations ; and specifically none shall be dealt in which were made in connection with stock gambling , future dealings or speculation . Should the reserve bank not have sufficient cash for making advances to the member banks , it will advance its circulating notes . I can only say incidentally that the system looks to the retirement through a considerable series of years of the present national bank notes and the payment of the bonds now securing them and the more and more complete displacement of these notes by those of the reserve banks . A reserve bank must buy the bonds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes on their security ; but the idea is that the main note issues will be of another character , as follows : The reserve bank presents to its head and overseer , i. e. , the gentleman holding the double office of chairman of its board of directors and Federal reserve agent , gilt edge commercial collateral which it has rediscounted or proposes to rediscount in the shape of notes , bills of exchange , drafts , etc. , of the character described above , to the face value of the notes which it wishes to obtain from that officer . If this official approves of the collaterals , he keeps them in his custody and hands over the amount of notes to the Federal Reserve Bank , which proceeds to lend them out in the course of business to its member banks .  | The Federal Reserve Bank must , however , keep in its vaults a reserve in gold against the notes which it issues equal to 40 per cent of their face value . These notes constitute a first lien upon all the property of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Government , since they do not have , like the present national bank notes , the security of a specific body of United States bonds . They must be cashed either by the United States Government or any reserve bank . In view of the fact that the reserve banks will probably have within the first year of operation cash resources of almost $800,000,000 , it is not likely that they will need to issue more notes than can conveniently be done under the 40 per cent gold reserve limitation . But if unusual demands should require , the Federal Reserve Board may authorize the issue of notes in excess under the penalty of a certain complicated tax , which must be paid to the government by the reserve bank and added as increased interest above the regular rate charged to the member banks whose paper is rediscounted with the excessive note issues . The simple imposition of a tax , even a small amount in excess of the profits to be made upon the notes , would supply ample reassurance that they would be retired as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued , had passed . We may sum up in the words of Senator Owen , that the " fundamentals " of the currency act are , " the concentration of bank reserves , the mobilization of bank reserves , the establishment of an open discount market , the establishment of an elastic currency in the form of Federal reserve notes as against commercial bills , and the establishment of foreign branches to handle the foreign business of the United States . " It is indeed a great measure , a statesmanlike measure . The credit for it is due to many persons ; to the leaders of the American Bankers ' Association , who for many years have unweariedly agitated for some such reform , when few outside their own ranks paid any heed ; to a few eminent professors and writers of political economy who perhaps by their teachings during the years when the underground work was being done have helped to send men to Congress who have now brought the structure above ground . The reform did not come in just  | the form which the bankers hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control which they desired , but none the less their influence made for progress . The services of Chairman Glass and Owen and President Wilson were all that their positions of high responsibility demanded . No partisan prejudice should permit us to deny credit to the man of the opposite party who for years stood among the leaders for currency reform ? Nelson W. Aldrich , chairman of the Monetary Commission and author of the Aldrich-Vreeland bill which failed of passage . His ambition was to round out his career with a great measure of this kind ; but his unblushing championship of the vested interests and the sins of his party in the same direction robbed his ideas of the force which they otherwise would have had with the American people , who feared the Greeks even when they came bearing gifts . Whether the gift in this instance concealed a secret peril opinions will differ ; but there seems no doubt that the great preponderance of responsible opinion is that the Aldrich plan left too great a power in the hands of men beyond the public control , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank could not serve a country of such vast extent as ours so intimately and well as the plan which has been adopted in which there is the equal power of doing good but far less power of doing harm . The currency , or Federal reserve act , is much the best and most momentous step which we have taken in banking since the War of Secession . What its exact effects will be the most experienced and able bankers or economists can not exactly predict . So much depends on the intelligence , aims and spirit in which a system is administered . It is undeniable that the Federal Reserve Board by systematically fostering the reckless expansion of unsound business ventures could occasion an inflation of the currency which would be followed by very serious injury ; but no system can be constructed which is free enough to be of service without also being susceptible of being used for harm . We have learned much during the past fifty years ; let us hope we have learned , like the rest of civilized mankind , how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men who conduct either the Bank of  | England or the Bank of France could wreck the financial structure of their countries in a few weeks or honeycomb them with weakness within a few months ; and yet they perform their functions with an intelligent devotion to the public good which is the finest political product of civilization . Let us hope that the same may be true of the men who shall conduct our system .
